<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I yield myself 7 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, a few short months ago the House gave its strong bipartisan approval to H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. Last Thursday, the Senate followed suit, approving its amendment to the House bill by an overwhelming margin of 80-16. 
   We meet today to take up the Senate amendments and to send this bipartisan legislation to the President for his signature. The measure before the House today is a compromise, a compromise between Democrats and Republicans, between the House and the Senate, and between Congress and the executive branch. The fact that compromise was achievable in this highly politicized era is a testament to the bipartisan roots of this legislation. 
   Five years ago, Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, our dear deceased colleagues, working closely with the White House, crafted a global HIV/AIDS bill that enjoyed broad bipartisan support. This groundbreaking legislation had a clear and achievable goal, to respond with compassion to those who were dying of AIDS, dramatically increase our Nation's efforts to stop the spread of HIV virus, provide care to children orphaned by AIDS, and get lifesaving medications immediately to those in need. 
   As a result, our Nation has provided lifesaving antiretroviral medicines to nearly 1 1/2 million men, women and children, supported care for nearly 7 million people, including nearly 3 million orphans and vulnerable children, and prevented an estimated 150,000 infant infections around the world. 
   Most importantly, the United States has given hope to millions infected with the HIV virus, which just a few short years ago was tantamount to a death sentence. 
   This law worked well as an emergency intervention to deal with the rapidly expanding HIV/AIDS crisis. But the nature of that disease has changed significantly since then. We now have 5 years of experience in grappling with this pandemic on a global scale, and the reauthorization bill before us reflects what we have learned. 
   The law we passed in 2003 was designed to deal with the emergency phase of the HIV/AIDS crisis. This legislation moves our programs towards long-term sustainability that will keep the benefit of U.S. global HIV/AIDS programs flowing to those in need. With this reauthorization, host governments will also gain the ability to plan, direct and manage prevention, treatment and care programs that were originally established with U.S. assistance. 
   The reauthorization bill authorizes nearly $50 billion over 5 years for these three pandemics. These additional funds allow us to significantly boost the health care workforce in those countries hard hit by HIV/AIDS with new professional and paraprofessional training programs, and to increase the number of HIV positive individuals receiving lifesaving medicine. 
   The 2003 law focused on creating new programs to tackle the crisis. The reauthorization bill increases the number of individuals receiving prevention treatment and care services. It builds stronger linkages between the global HIV/AIDS initiative and existing programs designed to alleviate hunger among those treated. It helps to improve health care and bolster HIV education in schools.     
   The 2003 law began to address the needs of women and girls. But given the changing nature of the epidemic, we clearly did not go far enough to meet these needs. 
   The new legislation remedies this situation by strengthening prevention and treatment programs aimed at this extremely vulnerable population. The Lantos-Hyde bill eliminates the one-third abstinence-only earmark, but requires a balanced approach to sexual  transmission programs and a report regarding this approach in countries where the epidemic has become generalized. 
   In an effort to ensure that our contributions to the global fund are being wisely spent, the bill provides for certain benchmarks to improve the transparency and the accountability of the fund. The bill incorporates tuberculosis prevention from H.R. 1567 sponsored by Congressman Engel. It seeks to further integrate HIV/AIDS programs with TB and malaria programs and create linkages and referrals between these programs for patients. 
   H.R. 5501 heightens U.S. efforts to combat malaria by requiring the development of a comprehensive 5-year strategy to combat this disease. It creates a new U.S. Government Malaria Coordinator, and it enhances support for clinical research for new diagnostics, treatments, and interventions to prevent, cure, and control malaria. 
   The Senate made several changes in our bill. It overturned the existing visa ban on HIV-positive individuals. It targeted $2 billion of the $50 billion authorization for Indian health care, water resources, and law enforcement issues. It modified the goal for people living with AIDS and removed a linkage between the global HIV/AIDS program and family planning. 
   Despite these changes, the language before the House today is very close to what we approved last April. With passage of this reauthorization bill, Congress signals to the world that the United States would exercise continued leadership in the global battle against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. 
   So what we have here is a bipartisan bill providing nearly $50 billion for the battle against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, a bill that has strong bipartisan support, and one that the President has indicated he will sign into law. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I want to take special note that in the short time that I have been chairing this committee, I want to mention two particular people who have both helped educate me, two Members, colleagues on the committee who have played a major role in helping to guide this legislation and the earlier legislation: the chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, Don Payne, and Congresswoman Barbara Lee, both of whom have been involved in this legislation and the previous legislation from the beginning and were pushing for this even long before that passed. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Mr. Speaker, without joining issue with the gentleman on his other comments, the suggestion that this is not curing AIDS is directly contrary to the evidence I saw firsthand in Africa earlier this month. There are huge numbers of people there who would now be dead, who are alive simply because of the drugs that this money allowed them to get. I don't know what the definition of the gentleman's cure is, but they are living normal, active lives as a result of the drug therapies. 
   I insert a Statement of Legislative Intent regarding nutrition into the Record at this time.  
   On behalf of Chairman Payne, Mr. McGovern, and Mrs. Emerson, I would like to make the following statement regarding the intent of the House on H.R. 5501. 
   H.R. 5501 and the Senate amendment to H.R. 5501 provide clear and specific instructions to the USAID Administrator and the Global AIDS Coordinator to address the food and nutrition needs of individuals with HIV/AIDS and other affected individuals, including orphans and vulnerable children; and to fully integrate food and nutrition support in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs carried out under this act. 
   We are concerned about the negative effect rising costs are having on our long-term and emergency food aid programs. This is a matter that affects a wide array of our food aid and development programs, including the effectiveness and success of our Global HIV/AIDS programs. 
   On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and members who have been very involved in international nutrition, we wish to state that it is the legislative intent of H.R. 5501 and the Senate amendment to H.R. 5501 that food security and nutrition programs, especially those referred to as wrap-around services, are not to be funded with monies diverted from other standing commitments to address food insecurity elsewhere in the world or in these countries.  
   I'm very pleased to yield 5 minutes to my friend, just a major architect of this whole program, the gentlelady from California (Ms. Lee).

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   The bill has been described, and its consequences have been discussed. But I can't help but come back to the comments from my friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) with respect to the effects of this bill. The notion that there are now pregnant women who, because of new discoveries in medicine, can take drugs which allow their baby to be born without being HIV positive, I call that saving lives and curing the problem. This is happening all over the countries where these programs are working. The notion that the United States is helping to take care of the orphans and other vulnerable children who are left without parents as a result of this epidemic I call saving lives and curing a problem. 
   And as the ranking member said in her opening comments, the effect on these people and their recognition of the role the United States is playing is having a--it's a secondary question, but it's an important one--it's having a massive impact on how they perceive this country at a time when, for many other reasons, this country has not been perceived well in this world. 
   This has been a remarkable program that has gone on. And I want to add my compliments to the staff, all the staff on the minority who worked on it, as well as Peter Yeo and Pearl-Alice Marsh and David Abramowitz, Kristin Wells, Heather Flynn with Chairman Don Payne, Christos Tsentas with Congresswoman Lee, as well as Mark Synnes with legislative counsel, Naomi Seiler and Jessica Boyer from the Oversight Committee staff, and on the Senate Foreign Relations majority staff, Brian McKeon and Shannon Smith. These are people who not only helped put this bill together, not only invested huge amounts of their time in working with the outside coalition forces, who have been working on the ground on these issues in Africa and other places, and also dealt with the administration, these are people who, when I got thrown into this issue, helped educate me. And I'm very grateful for all they have done to make this happen.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this measure has been brought to us by our colleague, the gentlelady from Chicago (Ms. Schakowsky). It notes the loss of a true humanitarian last May, with the passing of Irena Sendler, a Polish Catholic social worker who rescued 2,500 Jewish children from near certain death in the Warsaw Ghetto. 
   When it became clear to her that the Nazis planned to exterminate Poland's 1,000-year-old Jewish community, Ms. Sendler joined Zegota, the Council for Aid to Jews, an organization run by the Polish underground, committed to providing assistance and safe haven to the country's Jewish population. 
   Ms. Sendler became head of Zegota's children's department. Using her contacts from her days as a social worker, she placed thousands of Jewish children smuggled from the Warsaw Ghetto, often under Christianized names, in convents and orphanages to shelter them throughout the war. 
   These convents and orphanages were intended as temporary refuges, as Ms. Sendler recorded the actual names of these children on tissue paper. She stored those records in jars, buried them in her garden, in the hope that after the war, they would be reunited with their families. 
   In 1965, she was given the honor of being named Righteous Among the Nations by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Her legacy of courage and hope until then was little known in Poland. 
   In 2003, Irena Sendler finally received the widespread recognition she so greatly deserved when she was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest civilian decoration, and in 2006, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
   We all pay our respects and extend our condolences to the Sendler family. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution, which was introduced by my good friend, the ranking member of the Europe Subcommittee, Elton Gallegly, the gentleman from California, a resolution that congratulates Albania and Croatia on receiving an invitation to begin accession talks with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and expresses support for further expansion of the alliance. 
   At the NATO summit held in Bucharest this past April, the alliance made notable progress on integrating the Balkans into this important Euro-Atlantic institution. Most significantly, NATO invited Albania and Croatia to begin accession talks. I was pleased to see that accession protocols were signed with both countries on July 9th. 
   These two countries, Albania and Croatia, have made remarkable progress in reforming their political institutions and strengthening their military capabilities in recent years. They will make important contributions to international security, as well as to the stability of Southeastern Europe. 
   NATO has also recognized the hard work and commitment demonstrated by other countries in the region. The alliance responded positively to a request from Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina to intensify their engagement. Both countries have been active  participants in NATO's Partnership for Peace program for the last 18 months and will begin an intensive dialogue with NATO on a wide range of political, military and financial issues. 
   NATO leaders also extended a hand of friendship to Serbia, inviting the country to similarly upgrade its engagement to Intensified Dialogue, even though Belgrade has yet to indicate its interest in enhanced cooperation at this stage.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry) for putting forward a very important resolution which celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Special Olympics and recognizes the lifelong achievements of one of America's great champions of compassion, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. 
   Mrs. Shriver's leadership in the worldwide effort to improve and enrich the lives of people with intellectual disabilities is unparalleled. Her work led to the creation of the Presidential Committee on Mental Retardation in the Kennedy administration. She also organized the first International Special Olympics Summer Games on July 20, 1968 in Chicago's Soldier Field. Since that day, Mrs. Shriver has built the Special Olympics into an organization with global reach which has enriched the lives of 2,500,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities in over 180 countries. 
   The Special World Games, like the Summer and Winter Olympics, are held every 4 years. And since 1988, they have been officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee. They are dedicated to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities. These contests allow Special Olympians to enjoy the thrill of competition, to develop sportsmanship, self-esteem, and fellowship. 
   The oath of the Special Olympians is, ``Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'' The Special Olympians are indeed brave. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I first want to thank Congressman STEVE CHABOT for introducing this resolution which expresses the outrage of Congress towards recent attacks on the peacekeeping forces in Darfur and for the shameful lack of resources still experienced by these brave shoulders trying to protect innocent civilians. 
   On July 8, just 3 weeks ago, seven peacekeepers serving under the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur were killed and another 22 wounded while carrying out UNAMID operations in Sudan. These operations are designed to bring stability and security to the region. One week later, a Nigerian peacekeeper was shot and killed by militiamen while on patrol in Western Darfur. 
   This recent violence sponsored by the Sudanese Government and targeting UNAMID forces is one more justification for the recent indictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir as commander-in-chief of his armed forces. 
   A shameful part of Darfur's unrelenting nightmare has been the failure of the international community to make available to UNAMID the resources, equipment, aviation, and transportation assets and personnel needed to carry out the peacekeeping mission. UNAMID requires the 26,000 troops authorized by the U.N. Security Council and at least 18 utility helicopters and six tactical helicopters and crews. These needs have not been met. 
   Years ago, Congress and the President declared the crisis in Darfur a genocide. As a result, we have a moral duty to commit sufficient resources to protect civilians in Darfur. The President and the Secretary of Defense must marshal U.S. Defense Department assets, including helicopters, and immediately deploy them to UNAMID. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, despite commitments by Beijing to improve human and political rights in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics, the situation has not improved and in some cases has become far worse. Likewise in the past few months, China's international behavior with respect to despicable regimes in Sudan and Burma has improved marginally at best. Beijing remains these countries' strongest supporter. 
   Because of China's failure to improve its record on supporting human rights at home and abroad, now is the time to call on China to take immediate, substantial and serious action if there is to be any hope that the Olympic games will take place in an atmosphere that honors the Olympic spirit of freedom and openness. 
   This resolution does just that. It is a direct call to China by the House of Representatives to end human rights abuses, honor its commitments for freedom of the press and freedom of movement ahead of the Olympics, permit peaceful political activities during the games, enter into direct discussions with the Dalai Lama over the future of Tibet, and end its political and economic support of the regimes in Sudan and Burma. 
   President Bush has decided to go to the Olympics opening ceremony. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his decision, it is clear that the President should not pass up this opportunity to make a strong statement in support of human rights, one of our central policy goals. This resolution calls on the President to make such a statement before and during his trip to Beijing for the games. It is important for the House of Representatives to speak with one voice on the issue of human rights and political freedoms in China ahead of the Olympics. I strongly support this resolution.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first let me thank our colleague, MARK KIRK, for introducing this important resolution. 
   The Baha'i community in Iran certainly is no stranger to severe government persecution. But as a result of arrests in March and May of 2008, the entire national leadership of the Iranian Baha'i community is now being held incommunicado. 
   The May arrests are the most direct action taken against Baha'i leadership in Iran since the early 1980s, when the Iranian Government abducted and executed the entire leadership of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is. In 1983, all formal Baha'i administrative institutions were outlawed. 
   In the past 4 years, 166 Baha'is have been arrested in Iran. Among the charges brought against them is ``creating anxiety in the minds of the public and those of the Iranian officials.'' 
   Conditions for the Baha'i in Iran are deteriorating, including an upsurge in violent attacks, the destruction of property, the demolition of homes, and arson. Ministry of Intelligence officers and agents continue to summon, arbitrarily detain, and interrogate Baha'is about all aspects of their lives and about any Muslims who may participate in Baha'i activities. 
   The resolution before the House calls on the Government of Iran to immediately and unconditionally release Baha'is imprisoned as a result of their religion, and to cease its systematic persecution of the Baha'i community. It sends a strong signal that Congress will continue to watch closely the treatment of the Baha'i people in Iran.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time, and I thank my friend from California (Mr. Campbell) for coming to me with the idea of a resolution on the subject of the distorted, unfair, hypocritical, self-mocking agenda of the United Nations Human Rights Council and the need for the Congress of the United States to speak to their conduct. 
   Last year, I thought that when the United Nations decided to create a human rights body to replace the thoroughly discredited Human Rights Commission, there might finally be a chance for an open, respected forum for promoting basic liberties and rights and holding countries accountable that failed to do so, rather than a body on which would be placed some of the worst human rights abusers in the world. 
   The commission, as many of you know, was composed of many such countries whose own human rights records were far from laudable. While, for example, Zimbabwe, a former member of the commission, was busy leveling thousands of homes and leaving an estimated half a million people homeless, the commission was preoccupied with issuing successive reports condemning Israel. 
   I sincerely hope that the council will live up to its charter and become an impartial and forceful proponent of human rights around the world. Unfortunately, some have argued that the council, by spending an inordinate amount of time vilifying Israel, is even worse than the commission. It has passed one-sided resolutions condemning Israeli human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, calling several extraordinary sessions on Israeli actions in Lebanon and Gaza, and appointed successive rapporteurs to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes. 
   As Uzbekistan's jails continue to fill with thousands of prisoners, many of whom, according to the State Department, have been brutally tortured, the council was painfully silent. To be a human rights activist in Uzbekistan is to take one's life in one's own hands, yet the council has continued to shirk its responsibilities by failing to take a stand against these horrific human rights violations. 
   Rather than taking the regime in Khartoum to task, as the gentlelady, the ranking member of the committee, pointed out, taking Khartoum to task for its brazen and continued support for the janjaweed militias in Darfur, widely acknowledged to be responsible for horrific crimes against Darfurian civilians, the council has issued only a tepid expression of concerns. This shameful record led The Washington Post to describe the council as a ``ludicrous diplomatic lynch mob.'' Even U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has publicly admonished the council's unwillingness to pursue an evenhanded human rights agenda. 
   I want to make clear the criticisms I level and others have leveled against the council should in no way be viewed as an indictment of all the work of the United Nations, much of which is indispensable and serves our national interest as well as global peace and security. And while it has not been without its share of mistakes, the U.N., through its countless peacekeeping operations, poverty alleviation efforts and disease prevention programs, has proven to be worth its weight in gold. 
   We stand here today to criticize the Human Rights Council, which has an obsessed view of one country and only one country in terms of a human rights agenda, because we know that the U.N. can do better than they did in the creation and the rules governing that council. 
   I ask you to support this resolution because I believe that, while the council is still in its infancy, we can work to maximize the chances that it develops into a respected and forceful champion of human rights, not simply another proxy in the vitriolic campaign against Israel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, even as a young child, Jack Valenti showed signs of great leadership and oratory skills. He was a debate champion at his high school. Making good use of his natural ability to persuade and his interest in entertainment, Jack worked as a movie theater usher before enrolling in the University of Houston. After receiving his B.A., he enlisted in the Army Air Force where he participated in 51 flying missions and was honored with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Following his time in the armed forces, Jack graduated from Harvard University in 1948 with a Master's degree in business administration. 
   Jack Valenti entered the political arena when he was invited to a reception at a Houston Hotel to meet his future mentor and friend, Lyndon B. Johnson. He was immediately inspired by Johnson, who at the time was the U.S. Senate Majority Leader. When Johnson was selected as Kennedy's running mate in 1960, Jack worked on their media campaign. He remained close to Johnson after he became the Vice President. 
   Following the tragic Kennedy assassination in Dallas, TX, Jack was asked by then-President Johnson to accompany him to Washington where he became a special assistant and close confidant to the new President. After defending Johnson through criticism of the Vietnam War and conspiracy connecting Johnson to the Kennedy assassination, Valenti was offered a lucrative job by MCA Inc. head Lew Wasserman and United Artists' Arthur Krim as head of the Motion Picture Association of America. 
   In this position, Valenti created the MPAA rating system which initially labeled movies into four distinct ratings: G, M, R and X. This was Valenti's crowning achievement in the entertainment industry; the MPAA system is still used today to provide guidance for movie-viewing families. During his 38 year tenure as president of the MPAA, he was extremely well known in Washington as an advocate for the entertainment industry's major issues. He lobbied for the protection of movie copyrights and the prevention of digital piracy. His voluminous and eloquent style of speaking, coupled with his unique silver hair and cowboy boots, made him one of the most recognizable figures on the Hill. 
   His sage observations and folksy wisdom made Jack Valenti one of the most effective players in Washington. He was an advisor to Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle; and all of us fortunate enough to receive his council benefited greatly from our association and friendship with him. We all miss him greatly.

   The United States' relationship with Taiwan speaks to the great importance of democracy in our foreign policy. Over the past 60 years, the U.S.-Taiwan relationship has undergone dramatic changes, but it is Taiwan's development of democracy that underpins the strong U.S.-Taiwan friendship we enjoy today. 
   Initially our relations were defined by a shared strategic purpose of containing the spread of communism in Asia. This Cold War imperative served our strategic goals, but compelled us to cooperate with an authoritarian dictatorship in Taipei that failed to respect basic human rights. With the normalization of relations with Beijing in 1973, the Cold War's strategic landscape changed, and, over time, could have threatened to diminish the importance of the U.S.-Taiwan partnership. But Taiwan's commitment to democracy prevented such a split. 
   As the PRC liberalized and opened up to the world economically, Taiwan's political system evolved from authoritarianism to one of the strongest democratic systems in Asia, and in the process the U.S.-Taiwan relationship transformed from one based solely on shared interest to one based on shared values. 
   Today Taiwan is a flourishing, multiparty democracy that respects human rights, upholds the rule of law and holds competitive elections, including presidential elections in 1996, 2000, and 2004. This remarkable political evolution proves beyond any doubt that the notion of ``Asian values,'' which was used to justify one man or one party rule, is a complete fallacy. Democracy, freedom and human rights are universal values to which all human beings aspire. 
   This resolution recognizes Taiwan's strong democratic system by supporting Taiwan's fourth democratic presidential election, which will take place in March of this year, and by encouraging delegations from around the world to visit Taiwan to witness the election process.     
   It is important to note, however, that this resolution should not be construed as taking a position on the referendum regarding Taiwan's membership in the United Nations under the name Taiwan, which is also being held in conjunction with the presidential election. The purpose of this resolution is to honor the U.S.-Taiwan friendship by celebrating Taiwan's democracy. I strongly support this resolution and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, when this resolution came before the Foreign Affairs Committee last week, the situation in Gaza was deteriorating, and that deterioration continued apace. We have since amended this measure to reflect the latest facts, but the fundamental realities remain the same: Israel has a right to exist free from terror. Terrorist Hamas, which controls Gaza, does not accept this right. The United States will now and always stand firmly by Israel's side, committed to its survival; and we oppose all forms of terrorism and incitement meant to undermine the quest for peace. 
   Nearly every day, shrapnel-filled rockets launched from Gaza rain down on Israeli communities, shocking the residents with their explosive power and expanded range. Israel has answered the deadly downpour by placing pressure on the Hamas leadership and their henchmen who launch these missiles. But because these thugs cravenly place the men, women, and children in Gaza in harm's way by using civilian communities as a base, counterstrikes have lamentably caused civilian injuries and deaths, along with the deaths of the terrorists.     
   The casualties are far too numerous, since even one innocent life lost is one too many. 
   And so, as we show our support with this resolution for the people of Israel, we also express our sympathy with the overwhelming majority of Gazans who only want a decent life but whose terrorist leaders have contemptuously sentenced them to mayhem. 
   In August 2005, the Israeli Government removed all Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip and evicted Israeli families from their homes in hopes of injecting life into a moribund peace process. Israel's hope, and the hope of all who wish for peace in the region, was that Gaza would prove to be the fertile ground from which Palestinian statehood would emerge. 
   But since that time, Hamas has seized control of Gaza. It responded to good-faith efforts at peace not with reciprocal concessions or conciliatory gestures but with a relentless terrorist offensive. 
   In more than 2 years of rocket attacks, Israel has suffered countless casualties, including more than a dozen deaths, and serious damage to property and infrastructure. But perhaps worst of all has been the untold psychological trauma and interruption of all aspects of daily life. Reportedly, 90 percent of the children in the community of Sderot have suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome. The beachside city of Ashkelon, until recently out of range for the simple rockets that Hamas could muster, has now been  slammed by more than a dozen sophisticated missiles, next to the city hall, in the marina, leaving craters and shattered lives all around. This is a city of 120,000 people. The range of the rockets is increasing, and if the terrorists are not stopped, we all know that casualties likewise will increase. 
   For now the attacks are continuing unabated, and they are destroying what hopes remain of an Israeli-Palestinian peace. That is why this resolution unambiguously recognizes and reaffirms Israel's sovereign right to defend its citizens and territory. 
   We need also to recognize that Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups are not operating in a vacuum. They rely on the material and logistical support of nations like Iran and Syria. The international community must condemn Iranian and Syrian behavior and take all possible steps to halt it. 
   Much of the material for these rockets is smuggled into the Gaza Strip through Egyptian territory. We must prevail upon our friend Egypt, which has made invaluable contributions to peace in the years past, to do much more to end this smuggling. 
   This resolution therefore calls on all nations, including Egypt, to take affirmative, transparent and verifiable steps to stop the flow of rockets and related materials to the Palestinian territories. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can only condemn the policy of Hamas and its supporters to continue the brutal, cynical, and unprovoked attacks on Israel, and we must recognize this policy for the terrorist crime it is. 
   I commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) for introducing this resolution, and his cosponsors as well, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank our colleague and friend from California, a valuable member of the Appropriations Committee, an individual who has always had a long-term interest in the issue of capacity building in our international relations effort, Congressman Sam Farr, who introduced this vitally important legislation and who has an unwavering commitment to restoring the strength and expertise of U.S. civilian agencies. 
   Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has been engaged in a stabilization or reconstruction operation once every 18 to 24 months. During the same period, the backbone of America's diplomatic and development might, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, has been substantially weakened by staff cuts, hiring freezes and consolidation. 
   Despite new hires, there are only 6,600 professional Foreign Service officers in the State Department. According to Secretary of Defense Gates, this is less than the personnel of one carrier battle group, and allegedly less than the number of active military band members. 
   Likewise, at a time when the United States is engaged in two massive stabilization and reconstruction efforts and countless other emergencies, USAID, America's premier development agency, barely has 1,000 Foreign Service officers. Compare that number to the height of the Cold War, when it had more than 4,500 Foreign Service officers with expertise in engineering, agricultural development, rule of law, and civil administration. In essence, we have created a situation where those who are best suited for complex stabilization missions simply aren't there. 
   Mr. Speaker, this personnel imbalance is unacceptable and dangerously shortsighted. Stabilization operations require expertise in smart skills, such as job creation, rule of law programs, fortification of police forces, and good governance training, which lies within America's civilian agencies. Amazingly, at a time we need to call on this expertise the most, the U.S. Government capacity for these skills is at its weakest. 
   We need look no further than Iraq to see the dangers of overburdening our military with stabilization and reconstruction activities for which they were not trained, nor for which they are best suited. As Secretary Gates aptly observed, ``Brave men and women in uniform have stepped up to the task, with field artillerymen and tankers building schools and mentoring city councils, usually in a language they don't speak. But it is no replacement for the real thing, civilian involvement and expertise.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (INTERIM APPOINTMENT OF UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman who cosponsored this bill with me, along with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), chairman of the Crime Subcommittee of Judiciary Committee. 
   H.R. 580 does only one thing, it restores the checks and balances that, until last year, had long been part of the process for filling vacancies in U.S. Attorneys' offices. 
   I won't go through the history of how interim U.S. Attorneys were appointed, because the chairman has spelled it out, and the gentleman from North Carolina has reaffirmed that history. But I want to address the one issue my friend from North Carolina raised, which is, were we to take a longer time, this might have been, at least to his way of thinking, a better approach. 
   The whole goal of this bill is to restore the status quo ante before a sneak attack change on the law utilized in the PATRIOT Act without anyone calling special attention to it, undiscussed by the conferees or by the members of either this House or the other body, change that law to give the executive bench total authority in this particular area. 
   The Senator, a member of the other body who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the other body during this time, has said that he didn't know about the provision until a colleague alerted him to it last month. The former chairman's staff told him that the Department of Justice provided the language and that it was inserted in the conference report by a member of his staff who was made U.S. Attorney in Utah only 4 months later. 
   Now we have a different story from the Department of Justice. Will Moschella, the former head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, now claims sole responsibility for the provision and says he pursued the change on his own, without the knowledge or coordination of his superiors at the Justice Department or the White House. 
   This is a Department, the Department of Justice, that says it fired eight U.S. Attorneys for not coordinating their work 100 percent with the priorities of the Department, and yet we are supposed to believe that they are permitting a relatively low-level official to fly solo in changing Federal law on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys without any other departmental involvement. It is for this reason, I say to my friend from North Carolina, that the first thing we need to do is to go back to the status quo ante, the compromise worked out in the Reagan administration with Attorney General Ed  Meese, a Democratic House and the Republican Senate in 1986, which allowed for this process where we gave for the first time the Attorney General the right to name an interim U.S. Attorney, providing the district court with the theoretical ability, should that court choose to do so, to replace or, as has been much more likely, simply reaffirm the naming of the interim U.S. Attorney if no full U.S. Attorney had been confirmed yet by the Senate. 
   What is clear from the e-mails provided to the Judiciary Committee is that the Department of Justice and White House employees, whatever their motivation in pushing this proposal originally, whatever their motivation, they quickly figured out that the provision created the possibility to circumvent the Senate and decided to exploit that power. 
   One e-mail between the Department of Justice and the White House depicts an effort to slow-walk a nomination so an interim appointee can stay in place. The two employees discussed an interim appointee in Arkansas who they knew was unlikely to get Senate confirmation. 
   An employee in the White House Counsel's Office writes, ``If this is a section 546 appointment for unlimited duration, he can call himself U.S. Attorney. Our talkers should avoid referring to him as 'interim.''' 
   The Attorney General's chief of staff replies, and I quote, ``We should gum this to death. Our guy is in there so the status quo is good for us. Pledge a desire for a Senate-confirmed U.S. Attorney and otherwise hunker down.'' 
   I suggest there is ample opportunity in the record to recognize that the change we made in the PATRIOT Act without the knowledge, as far as I can tell, of any representative of either House was an ill-considered change; and the first thing we need to do and what this bill does is bring the law back to what had existed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power, to me, is one of the great national security challenges of our age. A nuclear-armed, fundamentalist Iran would become the dominant power in its region. The global nonproliferation regime would crumble. Already today we know that many of Iran's neighbors are contemplating their own nuclear programs. And can anyone be sure that Iran, with a leader who speaks like he speaks now, would not resort to either the use of nuclear weapons or to the handoff of those weapons to terrorist organizations? 
   The sanctions that the United States and the international community have thus far placed on Iran have squeezed Iran's economy somewhat, but clearly not enough to slow down its nuclear program. The present strategy is not working. I'm disappointed--and I believe the Iranian regime is surely heartened--by the failure of the administration's program to produce the kinds of results we need regarding Iran's nuclear program. 
   We need to make our foreign policy priorities clear. And Iran must be at the very top of the agenda in all our dealings with other countries. Sanctions will never work unless we have buy-in and support from other key countries. And if the process of achieving that buy-in requires us to engage directly with Iran, that is certainly something we should do. 
   Two months ago, the Permanent Members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany offered Iran all kinds of generous incentives to persuade it to suspend its uranium enrichment program. Just for the sake of initiating further talks on this package, they offered what they called a ``freeze-for-freeze,'' meaning we will agree not to pursue further sanctions for 6 weeks and Iran agrees not to increase the number of its centrifuges. But these offers weren't good enough for Iran, which responded only with a noncommittal letter. 
   If Iran won't change its behavior as a result of the sanctions the international community has already imposed, and if it won't change its behavior as a result of the generous incentives package offered in Geneva, then we should be pursuing tougher and more meaningful sanctions. 
   The legislation before us won't put an end to Iran's nuclear program, but it may help to slow it down. It will send a strong signal to Tehran that the U.S. Congress views this matter with urgency. And it will send a message to companies and countries that invest or consider investing in Iran's energy sector.     
   This bill before us contains a somewhat diluted version of two measures put together in the other body that had previously been passed by the House by votes of 397-16 and 408-6. 
   This legislation would codify and expand export and import bans on goods to and from Iran. It would freeze assets in the U.S. held by Iranians closely tied to the regime. It would render sanctionable a U.S. parent company if that parent company uses a foreign subsidiary to circumvent sanctions. It expands the Iran Sanctions Act to  cover not only oil and all natural gas but related industries. It authorizes State and local governments in the United States to divest from any company that invests $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector. It increases U.S. export controls on countries that are directly involved in trans-shipment or illegal diversion of sensitive technologies to Iran. And it requires the administration to report all foreign investments of $20 million or more made in Iran's energy sector, an action which they have not done notwithstanding the existing law, and determining whether each such investment qualifies as sanctionable. 
   Since 1996, the executive branch has never implemented the sanctions in the Iran Sanctions Act, even though well over a dozen sanctionable investment deals have been concluded with Iran by international companies. The administration hasn't even made a determination as to whether any of those investors are sanctionable. This bill will close that loophole. 
   This legislation before us also reaffirms our Nation's commitment to multilateral diplomacy to increase pressure on Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program, and it exclusively states that nothing in this act authorizes the use of force. 
   Based on previous votes, this body is committed to ending Iran's illicit nuclear program by taking measures that are peaceful but meaningful. I believe this legislation is a useful step forward toward that end. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, two issues: first, the gentlelady has mentioned several times that this bill is not as strong as we wanted, and she is right. But it does many good things, many important things. 
   If we went on and fully extrapolated her comments, we would know the reason it isn't quite as strong as we wanted. It is because the White House, working with the other body, has worked very hard to not make it as strong as we would like. 
   Even this good, but not good as we wanted bill, would have been much stronger. I would love to see a letter of support from the administration for this measure. 
   On the issue she asked me to clarify, she got a very important piece of legislation through a couple of years ago that codified our sanctions and did not contain waiver authority. We don't believe this bill did, but we have made clear, by the language in section 108, that this waiver does not affect the provisions of the executive order codified by the Iran Freedom Support Act, that the waiver in this legislation has no impact whatsoever on her legislation, which passed in 2006, I am glad of that, and the specific provisions of section 108.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself no more than 5 minutes. 
   I am a strong advocate of closer U.S.-India ties, including peaceful nuclear cooperation. I voted for the Hyde Act, which established a framework for such cooperation today. The bill before us today will approve the U.S.-India Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation. 
   Under the Hyde Act of 2 years ago, Congress was to have 30 days to review the agreement before beginning the consideration of a privileged resolution of approval. Instead, the agreement is now before us in the waning days before adjournment. We can approve the agreement now with the oversight safeguards built into this bill or we can wait until the next Congress and start over, but if we wait, however, we will likely only vote on a simple resolution of approval without any of these oversight improvements. 
   On balance, integrating India into a global nonproliferation regime is a positive step. Before anyone gets too sanctimonious about India's nuclear weapons program, we should acknowledge that the five recognized nuclear weapons states have not done nearly enough to fulfill their commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, including making serious reductions in their own arsenals, nor in the case of the United States in ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Having said that, I continue to have concerns about ambiguities in the agreement, and I, therefore, will insert several documents in the Record to clarify the meaning of these and other important issues. It is my view that these documents constitute key and dispositive parts of the authoritative representations described in section 102 of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this bill also gives the right to disapprove a Presidential decision to resume civil nuclear cooperation with any country, not just with India, that tests a nuclear weapon. It will also ensure that India takes the necessary remaining steps to bring its IAEA safeguards agreement fully into force and to conclude an additional protocol with the IAEA as India has committed to do. It gives Congress the ability to review the future reprocessing arrangements that will allow India to reprocess spent U.S. fuel. 
   Finally, late yesterday, Secretary of State Rice made a personal commitment to me that, in a change of policy, the United States will make its highest priority at the November meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group the achievement and the decision by all of the nuclear suppliers to prohibit the export of enrichment and reprocessing equipment and technology to states that are not members of the treaty on nonproliferation. This would be consistent with the intent of the Congress as expressed in the Hyde Act. 
   In light of the improvements for congressional oversight in this bill and in light of the Secretary's commitment, I will be voting for H.R. 7081.  
   Mr. Speaker, I'm a strong advocate of closer U.S.-India ties, and I support peaceful nuclear cooperation between our two countries. In 2006, I voted for the Hyde Act, which established a framework for such cooperation. The bill before us today, the ``United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act,'' would approve the U.S.-India Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation, and allow that agreement to come into effect for the United States. 
   Under the Hyde Act, Congress was to have 30 days to review the agreement before beginning consideration of a privileged resolution of approval. Unfortunately, because of months of delay in New Delhi and the Administration's acceleration of the deliberations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to grant India an exemption from its restrictions on trade to India, the Agreement is now before us in the waning days before adjournment. 
   We therefore have two choices: approve the Agreement now, with the safeguards built into this bill; or wait until. the next Congress and start again. If we wait, however, we will likely only vote on a simple resolution of approval, without the safeguards of this bill, and without the additional enhancements to Congressional oversight over these types of agreements that are required. Our leverage on the Administration--this one or the next--will only decrease with time. 
   On balance, integrating India into the global nonproliferation regime is a positive step. And before anyone gets too sanctimonious about India's nuclear weapons program, we should acknowledge that the five recognized nuclear weapons states haven't done nearly enough to fulfill their commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, including making serious reductions in their own arsenals. Nor has the U.S. ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Having said that, I continue to have concerns about ambiguities in the nuclear cooperation agreement that the Bush Administration negotiated with the government of India, particularly with regard to the potential consequences if India tests another nuclear weapon, and to the legal status of so-called ``fuel assurances'' made by our negotiators. 
   Section 102(a) of the legislation before us declares that the agreements have the meanings contained in the authoritative representations by the President and his representatives. 
   I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD5st a message from the President and a letter from the State Department that directly pertain to the interpretation of the U.S.-India agreement and that constitute some of the authoritative representations made by the President described in section 102(a). 
   These documents make clear that the assurances contained in Article 5(6) of the Agreement are political 
   commitments, and do not constitute a legal obligation on behalf of the United States or any official, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of the United States to provide nuclear fuel in any form to the Government of India, or to any Indian organization, individual, or entity under any circumstances whatsoever. They also make clear that the political commitments contained in Article 5(6) of the Agreement do not apply in the event of a disruption of the foreign supply of nuclear fuel to India as a consequence of a detonation of nuclear explosive device or a violation of nonproliferation commitments by India. 
   I am also deeply troubled that the Administration completely disregarded important nonproliferation requirements in the Hyde Act--  thus putting American companies at a competitive disadvantage--when seeking a special exemption for India at the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
   This bill therefore includes a number of provisions designed to improve Congressional oversight of the India nuclear cooperation agreement and help ensure that the agreement is interpreted in a manner consistent with the constraints in the Hyde Act. 
   It gives Congress the right to disapprove, under expedited procedures, a Presidential decision to resume civil nuclear cooperation with any country--not just India--that tests a nuclear weapon. We, the Congress, should be involved in that process. 
   And the legislation will ensure that India takes the necessary remaining steps to bring its IAEA safeguards agreement fully into force, to place the reactors and other facilities under those safeguards, and to conclude a more extensive Additional Protocol for enhanced safeguards with the IAEA, all of which it has previously committed to do. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, this legislation gives Congress the ability to review the reprocessing arrangement yet to be negotiated that will set out the conditions and safeguards to allow India to reprocess spent U.S. fuel. 
   Finally, late yesterday, Secretary of State Rice made a personal commitment to me that--in a change of policy--the United States will give its ``highest priority'' to achieving an agreement at the November Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) meeting to prohibit the export of enrichment and reprocessing equipment and technology to states that are not members of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). This would be consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in the Hyde Act to further restrict the international transfers of this sensitive technology. 
   In light of the improvements for Congressional oversight in this bill, I will be voting for H.R. 7081.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has explained the problem addressed by H.R. 1312. I just want to add a short history of the bipartisan work on this issue. I also want to express my appreciation to Chairman Conyers for moving the bill and to some of my colleagues who have been advocating for this solution for quite some time. 
   For several years now, a bipartisan group of Members has been urging USCIS to find and administrative remedy for lengthy processing times experienced by arts organizations petitioning for O and P visas. In October 2003, I was joined by 15 Members in sending a letter to USCIS Director Aguirre encouraging him to implement a number of reforms in the processing of arts-related visas. At the time, arts organizations filing for O and P visas were in a real catch-22. They were not allowed to file visa petitions earlier than 6 months before a performance, but USCIS was routinely taking longer than 6 months to adjudicate the petitions. 
   To their credit, USCIS did what they could to remedy the problem by regulation. But USCIS could not do administratively what we recommended, which was to create a consequence for failing to meet the required processing time for O and P petitions. That was the impetus for this bill. 
   The only remedy available without the bill was to pay for premium processing. Telling a nonprofit arts organization to pay $1,000 for expedited process is in effect saying: ``You've paid $390 to file this petition that we're required by law to process in 14 days, but for an extra $1000, we might process in 15 days.'' That just doesn't make any sense. 
   What we've done in this bill is create an incentive for timely processing. 
   Solving this problem has been a joint effort. We have had the benefit of input from the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the cooperation of Ranking Member Lamar Smith, who worked with us to tighten the language of the bill at markup. I want to express my appreciation for the collaboration of my colleagues Mr. Lungren, Mr. Nadler, Mr. Chabot, our former colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Mrs. Blackburn, and the many other Members who joined in the efforts leading up to this legislation. 
   International arts exchange is, in a sense, cultural diplomacy. Just a few weeks ago, the New York Philharmonic made a historic trip to Pyongyang. I understand that the 300-member delegation was the largest U.S. presence in North Korea since the end of the Korean war. The Philharmonic's musical director called the visit ``a gesture of friendship and goodwill from one people to another.'' These exchanges may not resolve the world's conflicts, but they create bonds that can pay substantial dividends in years to come. 
   The ARTS Act is meant to encourage and facilitate these exchanges, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would first like to commend my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), for introducing this important resolution. 
   When the state of Israel was founded in 1948, more than 150,000 Jews lived in Iraq. Iraq was truly a cradle of Jewish civilization, a site of Jewish learning from which one of Judaism's holiest books, the Talmud, emerged. For more than two millennia, as history books will attest, Jews also made vital contributions to wider Iraqi society. 
   Indeed, like Jews throughout the Arab world, Iraqi Jews for most of that long era enjoyed a quality of life far better than that of most Jewish communities in Europe. 
   That all changed for good in 1948, and in the years immediately preceding 1948, when the state of Israel declared its independence. Throughout the Arab world, Jews then became the objects of official scorn and often were fired from their jobs en masse. In many places, violence ensued against Jewish communities. Continuing to use Iraq as an example, that 150,000-strong community by 1952 had shrunk to a mere 30,000. The rest, the other 120,000, had effectively been forced out. 
   Overall, approximately 850,000 Jewish residents of the Arab world were expelled or otherwise forced to leave their homes, abandoning possessions and patrimony, in the years following Israel's creation in 1948. Vibrant, generations-old communities withered to near-negligible numbers. 
   That Iraqi community of 150,000 Jews in 1948 has dwindled to about ten today. In Egypt, a community of 75,000 in 1945 now numbers 50 to 100. In Aden, Yemen, a community of 63,000 in 1948 has shrunk to about 200 today. And 140,000 Jews lived in Tunisia in 1948; fewer than 100 remain. In Morocco, which is hailed today as the bastion of Jewish-Arab coexistence in the Arab world, a thriving community of more than a quarter million Jews lived their lives in peace before 1948. Today, there are perhaps 5,000 Jews residing in Morocco. Some left willingly; most felt they had no choice. 
   For centuries, long before the advent of Islam and long after it, Jewish communities lived peacefully and often prosperously and productively in Arab lands, among Arab people. 
   Their forced relocation and the material value they lost when they were compelled to abandon their homes and other property in Arab countries has never been redressed. Not one Jew from the Arab world has been compensated for his losses. Each one had to start over from scratch in his new land. 
   Compare the Jewish refugee experience with the Palestinian refugee experience. Neither Jewish refugees themselves, nor Israel, which was an underdeveloped country at the time it hosted most of these refugees, sought international aid from United Nations organizations or other international organizations. Both refugees and hosts envisioned and sought full integration into the larger society. The Arab world, in contrast, demanded the international community foot the bill for the refugees, who were to be kept in camps that, to this day, breed frustration, hatred and dependence. 
   The result of these contrasting approaches is this: While the plight of Palestinian refugees is well known throughout the world, has been the subject of numerous U.N. resolutions, and has been a major element in every Arab-Israeli peace plan, the plight of Jewish refugees is rarely mentioned. 
   Nevertheless, the rights and redress of Jewish refugees deserve recognition in any peace settlement. And, indeed, numerous international agreements pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict have been codified with the rights of Jewish refugees in mind. 
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 calls for a ``just settlement to the refugee problem,'' without limiting that problem to Palestinians. Presidents Carter and Clinton each explicitly stated that the issue of Jewish refugees must be part of any comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement.     
   And lest there be any doubt about their status, let me point out this very important fact: The United Nations High Commission on Refugees in 1957 mandated that Jewish people who fled Arab countries are, indeed, ``refugees.'' 
   The right of Jewish refugees from Middle Eastern lands to seek redress does not in any way conflict with the right of Palestinian refugees to seek redress, and the resolution before us states this explicitly. This resolution merely expresses the sense of Congress that Jewish refugees also should not be denied their legitimate rights. 
   We are simply seeking to ensure that any comprehensive Middle East settlement is just and fully just to all the parties. That sentiment of basic fairness is one I fully embrace. 
   I strongly support this resolution. And I again congratulate my colleague, Mr. Nadler, for offering it. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ALEXANDER LITVINENKO -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this resolution that notes the tragic poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, expresses concern about the potential involvement of elements of the Russian Government in his death, and highlights the need to ensure the security of radioactive materials.     
   And I'd like to thank my good friend and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN of Florida, for introducing this important measure. 
   In late November 2006, Americans joined with many around the world in watching with horror as a youthful, energetic Russian dissident and British citizen dramatically changed appearances within days. Who can forget the piercing blue eyes of the bald and gaunt man staring intently at the camera from a London hospital bed? 
   After the completion of an autopsy, British health officials concluded that Alexander Litvinenko had died on November 23, 2006 of radiation poisoning caused by ingesting the radioactive element Polonium-210. British law enforcement officials classified his death as murder. 
   Alexander Litvinenko was an agent in the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time when Vladimir Putin ran the agency. Mr. Litvinenko was fired from the service in 1998, then was arrested and briefly held without conviction after accusing senior Security Service officials of assassination plots. 
   Mr. Litvinenko successfully sought asylum in Britain, from where he continued to accuse the Security Service of involvement in illegal activities. 
   The night before falling ill, Mr. Litvinenko reportedly dined with three Russian citizens, including former Federal Security Service Agent Andrei Lugovoi. 
   On May 22, 2007, British authorities announced their intent to prosecute Mr. Lugovoi for the murder of Mr. Litvinenko. After Russia refused to extradite Mr. Lugovoi to Britain, a political dispute ensued between the two countries that resulted in the mutual expulsion of diplomats. 
   The murder of Alexander Litvinenko clearly raises disturbing questions about how elements of the Russian Government appear to deal with their enemies and perceived threats. 
   It also raises worrying questions about the security and proliferation of radioactive material. 97 percent of the world's legal production of Polonium-210 occurs at the Avangard nuclear facility in Russia, the country that is also the world's leading exporter of this substance for commercial purposes. 
   If the Russian government is not responsible for Litvinenko's death, as President Putin has stated, then it should be urgently investigating the security of the production, storage, distribution and export of Polonium-210 to prevent grave threats to international security. 
   The resolution calls on President Bush and Secretary Rice to urge President Putin and President-elect Medvedev to cooperate with British authorities in finding answers to ensure the safety and security of all our citizens. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (GEORGIA AND UKRAINE NATO MEMBERSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to support this resolution that expresses the House's backing for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to enter into a Membership Action Plan with Ukraine and Georgia at the NATO summit later this week. This resolution was originally introduced as Senate Resolution 439 by Senators BIDEN and LUGAR, and was passed unanimously on February 14. 
   I am grateful to my distinguished colleagues on the European Subcommittee, Chairman Wexler and Ranking Member Gallegly, for enabling the House to add its voice to the growing consensus in favor of extending MAP to two of our key allies, and particularly to Congressman Wexler, who, without his prodding, this resolution might not have appeared on the floor at this particular time. 
   From April 2 to April 4, heads of state or governments from the 26 member countries of NATO will gather in Bucharest for the largest summit ever. Indeed, NATO has more than doubled in size since its founding by 12 states in 1949. The seven post-Communist countries that became members 3 years ago are now making significant contributions to the work of the Alliance. 
   In addition to the crucial discussions about the future of NATO operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan, the Bucharest summit will address further enlargement of the Alliance. Decisions on full membership will be made about three Adriatic countries, Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia. Judgments will also be made about the extension of Membership Action Plans to Ukraine and Georgia. This resolution reaffirms that this is the right decision at the right time. 
   It is important to note that Ukraine and Georgia both have taken the initiative of formally asking the NATO Secretary General for integration into the Membership Action Plan. Both countries have made considerable political, economic, legal, and defense reforms in the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine and Georgia have also been active participants in international efforts to preserve peace and stability, contributing to numerous peacekeeping missions around the world. Their continued democratic development and military initiative should be supported. 
   While it is true that Ukraine and Georgia experienced domestic political crisis last year that raised some doubts about their readiness for MAP, it is equally true that both countries firmly maintained their commitment to pursuing a democratic path and strengthening their political institutions. We must continue to encourage them in this vitally important journey. 
   Secondly, it is important to recognize that MAP does not confer NATO membership. Rather, it provides a structured reform program that offers support in a broad range of political and technical areas in order to prepare applicant countries for the responsibilities of membership. 
   It is clear that both countries must complete significant reforms before they can be considered for membership. They, like all countries who have joined the Alliance before them, must be judged to have met all necessary criteria. Even then, all member countries must unanimously support their accession. 
   In closing, I would like to briefly address the concern about the potential reaction of Russia to the extension of MAP to Georgia and Ukraine. While NATO was originally established as a military alliance to counter potential aggression by the Soviet Union, it now deals with a variety of security threats in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The Alliance is clearly no longer aimed at Russia. In 1997, NATO and Russia agreed to work together to build a stable, secure, and undivided continent. This partnership was strengthened in 2002, with the creation of the NATO-Russia Council as a vehicle to facilitate joint action. Indeed, President Putin is expected to participate in this week's summit. 
   While the Alliance is right to be cognizant of the geopolitical impact of its actions, it should focus its assessment about the extension of MAP on the merits of the countries concerned. The U.S. and our allies should continue to nurture and strengthen their relationships with Russia. No one, President Putin nor anyone in Russia, should have a veto power over potential NATO applicants. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the nutrition title of the pending bill. It includes many urgently needed improvements to our food assistance programs for low-income people. 
   As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I am particularly pleased to see this title includes language to correct a couple of problems that have arisen relating to the enforceability of the Act and to ensure that no further problems exist. 
   The Food Stamp Act has long been recognized as fully enforceable on behalf of active and prospective participants. This history of enforceability is comparable to that of securities regulations, which the courts have long accepted. When, many years ago, a panel of the Fifth Circuit found no private right of action under the Food Stamp Act in a case brought by a pro se plaintiff, several other circuits, and ultimately the Fifth Circuit en banc, rejected that conclusion. Had they not done so, I have no doubt we would have intervened. 
   Recently, a couple of Federal courts cast doubt on this long-held principle, one by finding the Department's regulations on bilingual service unenforceable and another by forcing plaintiffs to meet the high standards for supervisory liability when suing a State to enforce the act and regulations against local agencies. I am pleased that this legislation overrules both of those decisions. 
   More broadly, the legislation recognizes that lawsuits by individual households or classes of household to enforce their rights under the act and regulations are an important part of the program. There now should be no doubt, if there ever was any, that all provisions of the act and regulations that help individuals get food assistance, or that protect them from burdens in their pursuit of food aid, are intended to create enforceable rights, with corrective injunctions or back benefits (the latter subject to the limitations in the act) as appropriate. 
   The act does not require States or the Department only to exercise reasonable efforts or to substantially comply with its requirements and those in the regulations: it gives each individual a right to be treated as the act and rules provide. The act and regulations have an unmistakable focus on the benefited class of participants and prospective participants, they are written in mandatory, not precatory terms, and they are concerned with the treatment of individuals as much as they are with aggregate or system-wide performance. 
   I cannot imagine how Congress could be any clearer in this regard. I anticipate that we will have no further confusion concerning the enforceability of the act and regulations.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I'm very proud to cosponsor this amendment with Mr. Skelton, the Chair of the committee, along with the Chair of the Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, Mrs. Lowey. 
   Among the many lessons learned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is the stark fact that the State Department and Defense Department have failed to coordinate on critical policy issues in these two war zones. In fact, throughout the U.S. Government, there is a misalignment between resources and missions, expertise and funding. 
   The problems are most evident in the arena of stability and reconstruction operations, where the Defense Department has assumed the lion's share of responsibilities. 
   However, the Defense Department is now playing a greater role in a wide range of foreign assistance programs. By some estimates, more than 20 percent of foreign aid now flows through the Pentagon. 
   Some of this can be attributed to a lack of capacity at State and USAID, a problem we're trying to address through legislation authored by Mr. Farr, which the House passed and is now a part of this bill. 
   But to the extent these problems result from a lack of coordination, we need to take steps to help ensure that the day-to-day plumbing of our national security agencies is sufficiently welded so that personnel from different departments have incentive to work together, and that the objectives of these departments are properly calibrated with overall U.S. Government priorities. 
   This amendment constitutes a first step in that direction. It establishes an advisory panel, structured to ensure that the three key agencies charged with protecting U.S. national security and promoting American interests abroad, State, Defense and USAID, have equal presence. I hope that the panel will work closely with these agencies to produce a report that is  practical, well-informed and, most important, directly applicable to their day-to-day operations. 
   The one thing I know is that if this panel creates a dynamic where these agencies work as well together as I have found the ability to work with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, we can make a lot of progress here. It's a real honor to have been engaged with Chairman Skelton, as well as Chairwoman Lowey on the appropriations side, in trying to come to grips with this problem. 
   I think this is a good first step, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this en bloc amendment and want to make a few comments about Amendment #18, which was included in this amendment. 
   Title XVI of H.R. H658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, is the text of H.R. 1084, 110th Congress, as passed by the House on March 7, 2008, introduced by our colleagues Sam Farr and Jim Saxton. That text differed to some degree from the introduced text and is identical to what was reported out by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as I explained at the time of House passage. 
   In discussions with the sponsors of this legislation in the other body, however, certain modifications to the text were deemed desirable, and this amendment, which has been agreed to by the Ranking Member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Gentlewoman from Florida, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and by Mr. Farr, represents those changes. 
   I thank the Chairman and the ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services for supporting this amendment, which will smooth the way towards the inclusion of title XVI in the final version of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment by my colleague from the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment. It provides that any security commitment, arrangement, or assurance that obligates the United States to respond to internal or external threats against Iraq must be approved by an act of Congress or by a treaty that receives advice and consent. 
   Mr. Chairman, the United States has many friends around the world, including in the Middle East, with whom we have non-legally binding arrangement about security. However, legally binding security commitments to use the Armed Forces of the United States have only been entered into with the approval of Congress. U.S. security commitments to NATO and Japan, for example, have been made pursuant to a treaty subject to advice and consent with the Senate. 
   I believe that past precedent should be our guide as to how to deal with any legally binding obligation of the United States that would commit both the current President and all of his successors to defending Iraq. If the President believes this is wise for the country, he should not do it alone; it should only be taken with congressional approval. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not an esoteric or hypothetical situation. This past weekend I was in Baghdad with Speaker PELOSI's delegation. It's quite clear from our discussions there that the government of Iraq at the highest level expects that any strategic framework or other  agreement between the United States and Iraq will include a legally binding security commitment that would require the United States to respond to threats against Iraq. 
   This amendment ensures congressional approval and, implicitly, congressional oversight of any proposed legally binding commitment to Iraq's security. I would hope that all my colleagues, irrespective of their political affiliation and their views about the conflict in Iraq, would agree that Congress should not be sidelined when it comes to what could be a millennial commitment to defend a country in the heart of one of the hottest regions on the planet. 
   I strongly support the amendment.  
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself 3 minutes.  
   I would like to thank, Madam Speaker, my friend and distinguished colleague, Representative BARBARA LEE, for introducing this important resolution to highlight the work done by the NGO community in support of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. In spite of the shaky cease-fire reached between Israel and Hamas on the Gaza Strip, Hamas and other extremist Palestinian groups have neither changed their stated aim, namely, the destruction of the State of Israel, nor given up the use of terrorism and violence as a means to achieve that end. 
   But while the terrorists of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad continue to threaten innocent civilians and undermine peace efforts, we should recognize the courageous efforts being made by many nongovernmental organizations to do just the opposite, that is, to foster conditions that can lead to peace. Many of these groups work tirelessly and selflessly not only to improve the daily lives of Palestinians but also to effect peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis. One example, Seeds of Peace, brings Israeli and Arab youth together for summer retreats that cultivate a culture of understanding and tolerance among tomorrow's leaders. 
   As this resolution affirms, it shall remain U.S. policy to actively support all those nongovernmental organizations that provide humanitarian assistance, promote democracy, human rights and work towards Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation while unequivocally opposing the use of violence. This resolution lends that encouragement and backing only to those NGOs that explicitly renounce violence, accept Israel's right to exist and support existing agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. 
   I join the author of this resolution, Congresswoman Lee, in lauding contributions to peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians made by nongovernmental organizations. I hope, and believe and want to believe that this is the way of the future. I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to express my appreciation to the ranking member of our Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, along with the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, Mr. Payne, and my colleague from California, Ms. Barbara Lee, for their hard work on this resolution aimed at preventing a repeat of the tragic outcome of the 2001 World Conference Against Racism.  
   As my colleagues know, the convening of the first World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa, in 2001 marked an important recognition of the historic wounds caused by slavery, colonialism, and ongoing racism and racial discrimination. 
   The Durban conference's explicit recognition of the transatlantic slave trade as ``a crime against humanity'' was a watershed event in the global community's effort to begin confronting this indelible stain in human history. 
   Tragically, the seminal achievements of this conference were overshadowed and diminished when some conference participants diverted the focus of the conference from problems in their own countries to a pathological focus on Israel and Jews. 
   The worse abuses took place in and around the NGO forum that took place on the margins of the conference. This forum devolved into a hate-filled circus, as anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic rallies spilled onto Durban's streets. 
   The official document produced by the NGO forum contained abusive language branding Israel an ``apartheid state'' that is guilty of ``racist crimes against humanity.'' 
   The government document, while not as inflammatory as the NGO document, singled out one and only one regional conflict in a biased way by highlighting the ``plight of the Palestinian people under foreign occupation,'' and in so doing, wrongly branded Israel's treatment of Palestinians as racist.

But we know what's happened before, we know what's being set up to happen this time. But I want to see delegations from the kinds of organizations that are supporting this resolution that plan to go to Geneva for that preparatory meeting to say, in the United States, we speak with one voice, and that includes not simply the American Jewish Committee and APAC and the other Jewish community organizations that support this resolution----

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume but no longer than 3 minutes as I need an arbitrary restraint. 
   I want to begin first by thanking both the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) for this resolution and for coming to the committee with a sense of the importance of this resolution and for the broader sentiment this resolution reflects, which is a broad and sincere commitment to global interfaith dialogue. I think it's a brilliant proposal. 
   I am pleased to have before us this resolution that supports such interfaith dialogue. I know its authors were inspired by a dialogue that 138 Muslim scholars, from all major sects of Islam, initiated in a letter to the Pope and to other Christian leaders. The letter emphasizes the importance of religious tolerance and of mutual respect between Christians and Muslims. In fact, the Pope graciously responded to this letter by agreeing to host a summit of  Catholic and Muslim leaders that is scheduled for this November. 
   This initiative reflects the same spirit as that of several other major interfaith initiatives meant to strengthen relations among the Abrahamic faiths, such as the 2005 Amman Initiative of King Abdullah II of Jordan and the 1998 initiative launched by the now Israeli President Shimon Peres, by King Juan Carlos I of Spain and by the late King Hassan II of Morocco. 
   Ever since Samuel Huntington coined the phrase, much is said in our public discourse about a ``clash of civilizations'' and about how to avoid it, but we really have to shoot higher than that. We have to aim to seek a comedy of civilizations. To do so, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and other religious leaders must emphasize the core similarities of their faiths and values. 
   This resolution encourages understanding and partnership among Christians, Muslims and Jews. Much of the cultural heritage of the West and the Middle East can be ascribed to these three Abrahamic religions, but of course interfaith dialogue doesn't need to and should not stop there. We should support and encourage the sentiments expressed in this resolution in favor of dialogue, not only among Abrahamic religions but among all religions. 
   While there is much work still to be done to reach our goals, I again want to thank Mr. Ellison and Mr. Wamp for this resolution that points the way towards developing societies, in the words of the resolution, based on peace, reconciliation and on a commitment to tolerance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF LEO T. McCARTHY AND EXPRESSING PROFOUND SORROW ON HIS DEATH -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague Ms. Watson for yielding me this time. 
   I came to Sacramento as a State assemblyman, elected in 1972, began my service in 1973, and had never known Leo McCarthy or met him before that time. Already in the California Assembly, a speakership fight was brewing between Leo McCarthy and sort of the favored candidate over the vacancy which would occur when the Speaker at that time was planning to run for Governor and would be giving up his seat. In the course of the year and a half between the time I came to Sacramento and the time that I voted for Speaker, I got to know someone who was particularly unique in terms of public office and public service. 
   I would say three words characterize the service of Leo McCarthy in all aspects of his public career and, I think, of his personal life: probity, energy, and a tremendous level of integrity. 
   This was a very unusual public servant. He cared deeply about the public interest, about policy, about learning what needed to be known to be effective and advocating for policies, about building legislative consensus, and about making things happen. 
   During the 5 years that he was Speaker in the State Assembly, I had the honor of being for 4 1/2 of those 5 1/2 years his majority floor leader. The end of our legislative careers wasn't quite as good as the start of it because we ended up in a speakership fight that got rather out of control and 11 months of battle. I think of speakership fights in California as war by other means, and that is what we had during that time. And, unfortunately, after that time while our relationship was civil and friendly, it was never as close as it was before.     
   I have never met anybody who made his fundamental decisions on what legislation to prioritize, what to push based on a focus on the public interest without regard to what a particular lobbyist or a particular specialist might push, with a level of integrity and with a level of energy, it has already been referenced in terms of his career, that was really unique in public office. He really was a very fine man, a very youthful man. In fact, his passing is so tragic because of that youth and vigor that he always exhibited.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (GENOCIDE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the House Judiciary Committee has reported an identical House companion to S. 888. That bill is H.R. 2489, and the Judiciary Committee's report for the House bill, Report No. 110-468, should be considered as part of the legislative history on S. 888, as reflecting the intent of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, the first legal application of the term genocide came during the Nuremberg trials in 1945. Before then, there wasn't a word in our language to adequately express the brutality and evil that this crime embodies. The purpose of the Genocide Accountability Act is to ensure that no perpetrator of genocide is able to use the United States as a safe haven for prosecution. After the Holocaust, the Genocide Convention was the embodiment of the world's pledge, the promise of ``never again.'' And yet this promise has proven to be one of the world's most unfulfilled. 
   Not very long ago, genocide was the scourge of Bosnia, and before that, Rwanda. Two years ago, this body passed a resolution acknowledging that the devastation and murderous violence occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan was a genocide. Unfortunately, the genocide in Darfur remains an ongoing crime today. The struggle to prevent and punish genocide has been, and unfortunately will be, winding and long. 
   The bill we are considering today acknowledges that in some cases the perpetrators of this evil have ended up not just on the doorstep of the United States, but living inside our house. Current law allows us to deport them, but procedural limitations in our laws can keep us from delivering justice for their crimes. 
   Because current U.S. law lacks an extraterritorial jurisdiction clause for genocide, procedurally the Department of Justice is limited in its ability to charge an individual who is not a U.S. national for involvement in a genocide committed outside the United States, even if the victims include American citizens. 
   In 1948, the United States was the first nation to sign the Genocide Convention. Twenty years ago, with the Proxmire Act, we added to our criminal code provisions to fulfill the dual obligations of that Convention, to prevent and to punish genocide. S. 888 will strengthen the reach of U.S. laws to prosecute any individuals found in our country who have taken part in acts of genocide, in Darfur or anywhere else.     
   As the atrocities in Darfur continue, it is imperative that we enact measures in this bill to stand against genocide wherever it occurs and hold fully accountable the perpetrators of genocide who are able to escape justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, the term ``genocide'' was first proposed by Ralph Lemkin, a man of Polish-Jewish descent. In 1941 he came to the United States, and on the day of his arrival he gave a speech explaining to an American audience the international responsibility to respond to genocide. I'll paraphrase what he said: If you learned that a mass of women, children and old people was being murdered 100 miles from here, wouldn't you feel compelled to run to their aid? Why then, if the distance were 3,000 miles instead of 100, would you restrain this decision of your heart? 
   By passing this bill today, we are taking Lemkin's words to heart. We will work to punish and prevent the crime of genocide not just in our own country, but wherever it occurs around the world. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. BERMAN. I thank the gentleman for his question and yielding to me and appreciate his comments and partnership on this bill. 
   In response, I would say that the genocide in Darfur is an ongoing crime. The House recognized it as such over 2 years ago, and there is no question that this crime continues today. We believe that ex post facto clearly would not apply in this situation.

   Mr. BERMAN. The gentleman raises an important issue, and I do not agree with that hypothesis. I think the witness from the Department of Justice was offering a spontaneous and personal opinion, which he was careful to label as such, and not an official interpretation by the Department. 
   When we crafted this bill, we were careful to write it as narrowly and precisely as possible. We were and remain interested only in changing the circumstances under which certain parties may be charged under the genocide statute. Our intent is to make a procedural alteration to the current law and leave everything else in the statute untouched. 
   In determining whether or not a law presents a violation of the ex post facto clauses of the Constitution, courts have generally considered whether the new law: one, places the defendant at a substantial disadvantage compared to the law as it stood when he committed the crime of which he has been convicted; secondly, changes the definition of the crime; or three, increases the maximum penalty for it. The Genocide Accountability Act doesn't alter in any way either the elements or the punishment for the crime of genocide. 
   The underlying notion here is that the defendant should be on notice that his actions constituted a crime. I think it would be very difficult for anyone to argue that the world is not on notice that we consider and have considered for many years genocide a crime. The United States has recognized genocide as a crime for nearly 60 years as a signatory of the Genocide Convention. 
   Neither do we make any change that would deprive one charged with the crime of any defense that is now available under the law. It is important to add that the Supreme Court has found a key exception to the ex post facto rule where changes to a law are procedural in nature.     
   In numerous decisions, the court has held that where a law involves changes in the procedures by which a criminal case is adjudicated as opposed to changes in the substantive laws of crimes, and I quote that phrase directly, that does not deprive a defendant of substantial legal protections, then it is constitutional.  
   It is our conclusion that this bill falls within that exception and makes only procedural changes to the law. So it was our intent that this law be used to prosecute perpetrators of genocide who are on notice that their acts constitute a crime wherever it was committed.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of language in this conference report that includes several critical provisions to aid the resettlement of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons. 
   First, I offer my sincere thanks to Chairman SKELTON and Senator KENNEDY for working to include this language in the conference report before us today. 
   Since our invasion, well over 4 million Iraqis have fled their homes as a result of political instability, economic catastrophe, and ethnic and sectarian strife. 
   Unable to legally find employment in their host countries, living in substandard housing with inadequate medical and educational facilities, many refugees simply have no place to turn. 
   While neighboring countries have struggled to cope with the strain of hosting millions of these refugees, our track record on refugee resettlement has been nothing short of an embarrassment. 
   As the refugee crisis unfolded in Iraq and its neighboring countries in the aftermath of our invasion, the Departments of State and Homeland Security stood by while a backlog of refugees referred by the United Nations for resettlement languished in the slums of Amman and other cities in the region. 
   This legislation will help make up for the administration's inexcusably lethargic pace by setting out clear refugee processing priorities, mandating the centralization of Iraq refugee efforts in the State Department, requiring greater cooperation with those allies in the region who are hosting many of these refugees, and increasing congressional oversight of refugee assistance and resettlement programs. 
   In addition, the language which we have worked together in great bipartisan fashion to include in this conference report also strengthens the Special Immigrant Visa program, for Iraqis who have worked for our Government and military in Iraq. 
   Many of these Iraqis who served bravely besides our troops and diplomats need our immediate assistance. Singled out as collaborators, they have been targeted by death squads, militias, and al-Qaeda. 
   Clearly, we owe them more than just a debt of gratitude. We owe them a safe haven and a fresh start. 
   While this legislation represents an important step forward in our commitment to these refugees, it cannot be the last word on the matter. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to help us live up to our commitments to these refugees.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 short months ago, tropical cyclone Nargis struck the coast of Burma, killing tens of thousands of Burmese citizens. The response of Burma's military leaders to this devastating catastrophe demonstrated their fundamental disdain for the welfare of the Burmese people. 
   Repeated offers from the international community to provide desperately needed assistance went unanswered. Thousands of veteran international relief workers were denied visas. Instead of dispatching Burmese groups to help the victims, the government proceeded with its referendum on a constitution drafted by an illegitimate assembly. This referendum was written without the input of Nobel Laureate and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 
   Even today, the restrictions placed by the government on international aid workers have severely limited their ability to help cyclone survivors. The disastrous manner in which the Burmese government handled the cyclone comes on the heels of its violent crackdown on Burma's Saffron Revolution last September. Buddhist monks, draped in saffron robes, peacefully marched through the streets of Rangoon. They were joined by tens of thousands of other Burmese citizens calling for nonviolent change, freedom and democracy. 
   The reaction of the ruling regime to these peaceful demonstrations was predictable. Unarmed monks were shot in the streets. Those who weren't killed were hauled off to detention centers. Political dissidents were tossed in jail. 
   In short, the Saffron Revolution was crushed, along with the aspirations of the Burmese people for democracy and a better life. These brutal actions demonstrate the moral bankruptcy of the regime. 
   Unfortunately, the regime is not financially bankrupt. While the Burmese people live in great poverty, Burma's military leaders continue to take Burma's vast natural resources as their own. The legislation before the House today hits the regime where it hurts, in the wallet. By blocking the import of Burmese gems into the United States and expanding financial sanctions, the legislation will take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the pockets of the regime each year. 
   The legislation is supported by U.S. industry. The 11,000-store Jewelers of America supports a ban on Burmese gem imports to the United States. Major retailers like Tiffany's and Bulgari have also voluntarily implemented such a ban. 
   The amendments to this bipartisan bill provided for in this resolution, which have been carefully negotiated with the Senate, promote a coordinated multilateral approach to sanctions against Burma. 
   The European Union has similarly banned the import of Burmese gems, as have the Canadians. It's our hope that the financial sanctions contained in this bipartisan bill will push other countries to examine their own financial dealings with Burma.  
   As we move forward with H.R. 3890 today, I do want to thank the ranking Republican member of the committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well as Peter King of the Homeland Security Committee, for their strong support for this legislation and for democracy in Burma. 
   Thanks also must be given to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Charlie Rangel; the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, Sander Levin; as well as their Republican counterparts, Jim McCrery and Wally Herger, for their enormous help in moving forward with this bill. 
   Finally, let me thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for her continued leadership on this legislation. 
   Since the first shots were fired in Rangoon, the Speaker has firmly indicated our intention to significantly tighten sanctions on the ruling Burmese regime. Today, we fulfill that promise. 
   Burmese freedom fighter and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi memorably asked of the world community, ``Use your liberty to promote ours.'' So today we use our liberty in the United States Congress to ratchet up the economic pressure on the Burmese regime to move towards freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. 
   I urge all Members to support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (CONDEMNING 1994 ATTACK ON ARGENTINE JEWISH CENTER -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on July 18, 14 years ago, a devastating bomb exploded outside the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Eighty-five people were brutally killed and 300 wounded because they happened to be in the building at that fateful moment. 
   On that day, the world suffered yet another example of the consequences of radical violent religious extremism, and 85 more victims were tragically added to the list of those whose lives have been taken unnecessarily. 
   We recalled the shock felt in Jewish communities worldwide, and are reminded that as long as radical extremism exists, no religious group should consider itself free from persecution. 
   Almost a decade and a half later, the perpetrators of the AMIA bombings still have not been brought to justice. 
   The AMIA attack was approved in advance by Iran's supreme leader and by the highest officials of the Iranian government. The attack was orchestrated by the government of Iran and the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah. 
   Since 1994, Iran has greatly expanded its diplomatic, political, and economic presence in the western hemisphere, represented by the opening of nearly a dozen embassies in Latin America. 
   As the AMIA tragedy shows, Iran has made use of its embassies abroad as tools to perpetrate its radical Islamic goals. We cannot let our guard down as we face this threat of terrorism. 
   This legislation recognizes that in the past few years, the government of Argentina has made significant advances in the AMIA investigation, primarily through the dedication and determination of Prosecutor Alberto Nisman and those who support his work. 
   We celebrate, as well, that Argentina has also recently enacted counterterrorism legislation which seeks to criminalize the financing, fund-raising and money-laundering activities of groups linked to terrorism. We encourage our South American neighbor to continue pursuing the criminals of the AMIA bombing and through this legislation commit to accompany them in that pursuit. 
   The resolution also commends the efforts of the General Assembly of INTERPOL to uphold and implement the international arrest warrants issued for the Hezbollah and Iranian operatives. We must continue to push the entire community of nations to work together to capture and arrest those who would harm us. 
   Mr. Speaker, only by taking the investigation of the AMIA bombing to its ultimate conclusion, capture and punishment for those who planned it, can the community of nations show Iran, Hezbollah, and those who support terrorism that their efforts will not bear fruit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague, my friend, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for introducing this resolution, and urge all of my colleagues to support this important measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BERMAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. Chairman Payne, Congressman Jefferson, Congresswoman Lee and Congressman Royce have all pointed out  various aspects of this marvelous individual's career. There are very few people one sees in a lifetime who can inspire by their strength, their commitment, their dedication and their perseverance to a noble and idealistic cause the way that Nelson Mandela has inspired so many of us. And so I'm happy to join with my colleagues in speaking on behalf of this resolution and urging its support. 
   In some ways, the most fascinating thing about Nelson Mandela's career is that after that incredible struggle against the evil of apartheid and the tyranny and the indignities that were suffered by the vast majority of the population of South Africa under the very regimented and institutionalized system of apartheid that they were forced to live under, that when victory came, and the apartheid regime ended and he took over the leadership of South Africa, that he dedicated himself to the concept not of vengeance against those who had perpetrated the evil, but to bringing forth the truth and then the reconciliation with his fellow countrymen and -women.     
   And even to the point where I read that the original president, when the legislation that institutionalized apartheid was adopted in South Africa, that he invited this man who didn't start the apartheid and the segregation, but he did more than anyone else to implement the repressive policies of apartheid, that after he became president, he invited the widow of this symbol of apartheid to come to his inauguration. And when she refused, he visited her in her house to demonstrate the depths to which he believed in that process of reconciliation. 
   He truly was an inspirational and marvelous individual, and I obviously urge all of my colleagues to support Mr. Jefferson's resolution.

   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I want to first thank our colleague, Mr. Speaker, and our ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, for introducing this important legislation. 
   The human rights situation in North Korea remains one of the bleakest on the planet. As we speak, millions of North Koreans live in desperate conditions. Political, economic and religious freedoms are nonexistent. Many are starving and undernourished and live in fear of arbitrary arrests where they know they may be tortured or executed. 
   The North Korean government knows that access to information outside the country is a threat to the regime's control. So it maintains an absolute grip over all legal media, using it to manipulate the population into believing that life is no better anywhere else. 
   Those who manage to leave the country face further danger, denial of rights and threats to their lives. China stubbornly refuses to categorize North Koreans who flee horrific living conditions and persecution as refugees, instead labeling them economic migrants. This disingenuous, semantic trick relieves Beijing of its obligation to assist the North Koreans who escape into China in accordance with international conventions on refugees to which Beijing is a signatory. 
   North Koreans are routinely arrested and abused by the Chinese authorities and sent back to North Korea where they are considered traitors. Upon return, they are arrested, likely tortured, and sometimes killed. 
   Earlier this year, Pyongyang reminded the world how it treats those who desperately seek a better life by leaving North Korea when it executed 13 women and 2 men at the Chinese border. In response to the incident, a local North Korean official is reported to have said plainly, ``We shot them to send a warning to people.'' 
   The suffering people of North Korea need assistance, and in 2004, Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support the North Korea Human Rights Act in an effort to focus U.S. attention on their plight. The Act provided new resources to assist North Korean refugees, support democracy and human rights programs, and improve access to information through radio broadcasts and other activities. It also required the President to appoint a special envoy on North Korean human rights. 
   H.R. 5834, which we're considering today, reauthorizes this vitally important legislation. The current bill extends the North Korean Human Rights Act through fiscal year 2012, doubles the original funding authorization for human rights and democracy programs, and enhances the role of the special envoy by making it an ambassadorial rank and requiring it be a full-time position. 
   I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which I strongly support and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution.  
   One cannot help but be deeply saddened by the harrowing reports and images coming from Burma in the wake of Cyclone Nargis. 
   Television clips show bloated, dead bodies floating among scared and starving Burmese, desperate for assistance. Entire villages are destroyed, some with survivors in the single digits, others with no survivors at all. Because of the escalating cost of fuel, it is too expensive to burn the corpses of the dead. 
   As horrific as the current destruction is in Burma, there is the eerie fear that we are on the precipice of the situation becoming much worse. The threat from disease could raise the number of dead from the tens of thousands to over one million. 
   It seems unthinkable that in this modern age, 1 million people can be left to die as the result of a single natural disaster. Yet, that is what we face if we are not able to provide aid and assistance to the people of Burma. 
   And, if it is horrific to hear reports of the humanitarian crisis in Burma, it is nauseating to hear reports of the lack of humanity on the part of the Burmese regime. 
   The Burmese junta seems committed to preventing the full-scale relief operations necessary to respond to the current crisis. Instead of welcoming the outpouring of assistance from around the world, Burma's generals are letting aid groups and governments languish as they wait for visas. 
   The United States stands ready with so many other countries, international organizations and NGOs, to do what it can to prevent further loss of life and to help Burma begin to recover from this devastating storm. But the military leaders continue to rebuff our help and our pleading on behalf of the Burmese people. 
   Most governments would be strained by the demands of responding to such devastation,  and Burma lacks a fraction of the capacity necessary to deal with this crisis. To make matters worse, there are reports of corruption inside Burma eroding the efforts that are allowed to take place. We hear that supplies that were provided by donors are being confiscated by the government and resold back to aid groups. This is sinister profiteering at its most extreme. 
   That the junta went ahead with its scheduled constitutional referendum on Saturday in the unaffected areas is sickening and surreal. 
   The constitution under question is intended to legitimize the current ruling government. But despite its many, many crimes, this government has done few things that have so de-legitimized its claim to govern over the Burmese people. 
   It is time for the Burmese government to do what Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said it should do, and ``put its people's lives first.'' 
   We hope and pray that, for the sake of the people of Burma, the junta does so as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND ARMS EXPORT CONTROL REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States has a wide variety of foreign policy tools to promote the national security of the United States. While these tools are often referred to as ``soft power,'' they represent such diverse mechanisms as enhancing ties with friendly countries, ensuring that U.S. exports are regarded positively by prospective customers, ensuring that our policies reflect our values, and using U.S. assistance to stem the wave of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that threaten our very homeland. 
   The bipartisan legislation before the House today, cosponsored by the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, represents a new and important initiative to accomplish all these missions. 
   Title I of H.R. 5916 reforms the Arms Export Control process, based on proposals made by Mr. Sherman and Mr. Manzullo as introduced in H.R. 4246, the Defense Trade Controls Performance Improvement Act of 2007 to create consistency in our export policy. It also provides for a strategic review of U.S. export control policies to help ensure they promote the protection of human rights. 
   It also amends the Arms Export Control Act to ensure that our close allies, South Korea and Israel, get the same expedited licensing review that our NATO allies, Australia, New Zealand and Japan currently enjoy. In this regard, the bill partially draws from H.R. 5443, the United States-Republic of Korea Cooperation Act of 2008, which was introduced by our colleagues, Mr. Royce and Mrs. Tauscher of California. 
   In addition, in order to address recent major sales of defense articles and services to countries in the Middle East, the bill insures that Israel will maintain its qualitative military edge against whatever security threats it may face, codifying this important principle into law for the first time. It also authorizes the security assistance to Israel, including implementing the recent U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Security Assistance. 
   It's only fitting that as Israel commemorates the 60th anniversary of its founding, the United States renews and strengthens its relationship with our most important friend in the region. Israel is a democratic island of stability in a sea of chaos, chaos which we continue to see just this week this neighboring Lebanon. It deserves all the support we can muster. 
   Finally, title III of this legislation provides for a limited waiver of current sanctions to support and accelerate U.S. efforts to eliminate North Korea's nuclear program. The waiver would apply to portions of what is commonly called the Glenn Amendment. 
   Glenn Amendment sanctions keep the Department of Energy from funding its own ongoing work on disabling and dismantling North Korea's nuclear program, including removing plutonium in the next phase of this process, as well as verifying that Pyongyang is living up to its commitments. 
   Until now, a flexible but limited fund at the Department of State has paid for this work. Continued exclusive use of this State Department mechanism will undermine the ability of the United States to urgently respond to unexpected opportunities to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons elsewhere in the world. 
   Title III of our bill allows for more rational funding and planning of these activities without giving the administration a blank check. It provides a narrow, carefully tailored authority. It also requires the administration to document for Congress each year the need for keeping this authority in place. 
   Title III also includes a provision authored by ranking member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen that reinforces U.S. policy regarding removing North Korea from the State Department's list of countries supporting terrorism.     
   The conditions laid out in that provision include certification that North Korea no longer is engaged in transferring to other countries any technology that enables the development or acquisition of nuclear weapons. The provision also underscores the importance of keeping the agreement laid out in the Six-Party talks, and it states that North Korea must agree to allow participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency in ensuring that the Yongbyon nuclear reactor is shut down and stays that way. 
   I pledge to this House that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will continue to keep a close eye on the implementation of the Six-Party Denuclearization Agreement. It is entirely possible that North Korea's own actions may sour the deal. However, in the interest of U.S. and global security, we need to forge ahead and accomplish what we can now. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I urge all of my colleagues in joining me in supporting this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM IN CERTAIN DISTRICT COURTS TO ENCOURAGE ENHANCEMENT OF EXPERTISE IN PATENT CASES AMONG DISTRICT JUDGES -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 34 and ask my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this legislation. Last Congress, an identical bill passed unanimously through the Judiciary Committee and then passed by voice vote on suspension on the House floor. 
   Patents are the cornerstone of our economy and provide incentives for innovation. Therefore, it is all the more important to continually assess the effect patent litigation has on the preservation of patent quality and intellectual property rights. 
   H.R. 34 authorizes the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to establish pilot programs in the United States district courts where the most patent cases are filed. At minimum, five courts, spread over at least three circuits, will take part. To qualify, a court must have at least 10 judges, and at least three judges must request to take part in that program in each of the districts. 
   The chief judge randomly assigns the patent cases. Should that judge, who is assigned the case, decline that assignment, one of the several judges who has opted to take part in the pilot program receives the case. Further, H.R. 34 requires the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to report to Congress on the pilot program's success in developing judicial expertise in patent law and authorizes funds to increase both judges' familiarity with patent law and provide additional funding for clerks. 
   Patent law is an extremely complex body of law involving analysis of intricate technologies, and Federal district court judges spend an inordinate  amount of time on patent cases, even though patent cases only make up 1 percent of the docket. The combination of the complex science and technology, the unique patent procedures and laws, the administration of the courts and their dockets, and the sheer number of issues raised by patent litigation makes improvement of the patent adjudication system a uniquely complicated, difficult, but necessary, task. 
   The impetus behind this bill, in part, is the high reversal rate of district court decisions. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals, reverses over 30 percent of the district court patent claim constructions. Critics assert that the high reversal rate is due to judicial inexperience and misunderstanding of patent law. The pilot program we are proposing here would address this problem by increasing judicial familiarity with patent law and providing funds to pay additional clerks to assist with patent cases. 
   The Administrative Office of the United States Courts had concerns about the effect of the pilot program on randomness of assignments. Therefore, in an amended version of the bill, we address this issue by only allowing the district courts with a large enough pool of judges to participate in the pilot program. As a result of this change, at least three judges will take part in the program to ensure that the selection of a certain court does not mean the selection of a certain judge. 
   Therefore, as the pilot program increases the expertise of judges who opt into the program, it also ensures that the selection of a certain district court is not outcome-determinative, and thus it does deter forum shopping. 
   While recent accounts demonstrate that as time passes Federal district court judges are becoming more proficient at the application of patent claim construction rules, and while reversal rates are coming down, judicial inexperience in patent law still frequently gives weak, untested and presumptively valid patents the same kind of protection previously reserved for strong and judicially tested patents. 
   As the importance of intellectual property continues to grow in our economy, we can expect that the Federal courts will spend even more time on patent cases. Thus, we must act now to improve the timeliness and quality of their decisions. 
   A patent program, combined with a study of its results, serves as a valuable tool in assessing the ability of the courts to become more knowledgeable about the specific laws and technologies involved in patent cases. By providing extra resources and fostering judicial experience in patent law, we can lower the reversal rate of district court decisions and ensure that invalid patents do not receive protections. 
   Questions have arisen about why the legislation is necessary. All Federal district judges should already be striving, obviously, to enhance their knowledge of patent law through extra classes and training. I want to make clear, this bill does not serve as a cushion for judges who shy away from patent law. Instead, H.R. 34 will assess the benefits of the channeling of patent cases towards judges with greater interest and expertise in patent law and determine whether the program improves patent quality and expedites the adjudication process. This bill is only a pilot program. 
   Patent quality has been a long-time priority of mine, and I believe H.R. 34 is a first step to resolving some of the deficiencies in the patent system. But this in no way substitutes for comprehensive overhaul of the patent system designed to ensure that innovation is not at risk in the 21st century. By increasing judicial expertise in patent law, H.R. 34 should ultimately improve both patent quality and the litigation process. 
   As I mentioned previously, this bill has the full support of the Judiciary Committee and many industries and trade groups, including the pharmaceutical, technology, biotech and consumer electronics industries and intellectual property owners and other intellectual property organizations. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 34. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (HONORING AND PRAISING THE NAACP ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 98TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise to join my colleague AL GREEN of Texas in honoring the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, on its 98th anniversary. As we observe Black History Month this February, it is only appropriate that we recognize the Nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. Ninety-eight years after its inception, we salute the NAACP for its continued commitment to promoting equality and justice for all Americans. 
   The NAACP has been at the forefront of every brave and courageous moment in this Nation's civil rights history. This was particularly evident during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1954 the NAACP secured one of the greatest legal victories with the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In 1960 the NAACP Youth Council organized a series of sit-ins at lunch counters throughout the country, an activity which I think for many of us, I know for myself, helped to pique and motivate our interest in the ability of politics and movement to make change on behalf of people. And in 1965 the NAACP successfully sought enactment of the Voting Rights Act. 
   Today the NAACP priorities continue to ``ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons,'' as its mission statement reads. Last year the NAACP addressed such issues as voter disenfranchisement, HIV/AIDS, and the conflict in Sudan. In 2007 the organization continues to confront these and other domestic and international concerns. Most recently, the NAACP supported Congress' efforts to increase the minimum wage. 
   We in this body congratulate the NAACP for this work and their continued efforts to protect the civil and human rights of our citizens. On its 98th anniversary, the NAACP remains an integral and essential part of this society. We salute the NAACP on this significant occasion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, but no more than 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in favor of House Resolution 122. Sixty-five years ago, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, leading to the detention of approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans. They were forced to live in isolated camps, to sell or lease their property, often at huge losses, and to give up their businesses and livelihoods. The freedom and civil liberties of Italian and German Americans were also violated during World War II by measures that branded them enemy aliens and went as far as restricting their movement and seizing their personal property. Thirty years passed before Executive Order 9066 was formally rescinded in 1976. 
   House Resolution 122 recognizes the devastating impact of that executive order. The resolution also supports and commends the efforts of the Japanese, Italian and German American communities in recognizing a National Day of Remembrance for their history of restriction, exclusion and internment during World War II. The failure of our political and judicial system to prevent the injustices against them still reverberates today. 
   The decision to intern Japanese Americans was based not on evidence, but rather on fear and panic. In 1980, Congress established a Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. That commission, after conducting 20 days of hearings and receiving testimony from over 750 witnesses, concluded that Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity, but resulted from ``race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.'' 
   In 1988, Congress enacted, and I was proud to be here and a part of that fight, the Civil Liberties Act to formally acknowledge and apologize for violations of fundamental civil liberties and constitutional rights of these Japanese Americans.     
   In 2000, President Clinton signed the Wartime Violation of Italian Americans Civil Liberties Act, which formally acknowledged civil liberty violations against Italian Americans. 
   The most honorable and principled way to show respect to those Americans who suffered injustices during World War II is to dedicate ourselves to fighting for the fundamental American principles of liberty of which their mistreatment remains to this day a glaring reminder. 
   Once again, I want to join with my colleagues in recognizing the very important work of the Japanese American, the German American and the Italian American communities in raising awareness of the National Day of Remembrance, and to particularly commend Representative Honda for his efforts in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

For one who remembers some of the key figures in this terrible tragedy, President Roosevelt; Justice William Douglas, who is an icon and a symbol of respect for civil liberties generally, you learn what war hysteria and a tendency to extrapolate the notion of an enemy into sweeping generalizations which are not justified by the evidence is something that we should be careful of.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 109. We have been discussing in the previous resolution Executive Order 9066. When President Roosevelt signed that order, approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, leading to the loss of their livelihoods, homes, and jobs. This action was the largest relocation of Americans in our history. Before being deported to permanent camps in desolate areas and behind barbed wires, thousands of Japanese Americans were temporarily held at assembly centers. Close to 5,000 Japanese Americans reported to the Pinedale Assembly Center in Fresno, California. 
   The Pinedale Assembly Center Memorial Project Committee will establish a memorial at that site, marking the tragedy that occurred there. The groundbreaking ceremony for the memorial will take place in just a few days, on February 19, 2007, 65 years after the signing of Executive Order 9066 and a day that the Japanese American community most appropriately recognizes as a national day of remembrance. 
   H. Res. 109 recognizes the historical significance of the site. The site is a symbol of the injustices suffered by Japanese Americans during World War II and a reminder of how fragile our civil liberties are in the face of fear, prejudice, and paranoia. I particularly want to commend my colleague, Representative Costa of California, for introducing this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the 60 years since the founding of our ally Israel, the United States has had no greater friend in the Middle East. U.S.-Israeli friendship is based first and foremost on shared democratic values and our mutual pursuit of peace and stability in the Middle East, and it is buttressed by our Nation's unshakable commitment to Israel's security. 
   The remarkable story to Israel's foundation and survival is inspiring. Shortly after the decision by the United Nations to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948, in Tel Aviv. In response, Israel's Arab neighbors invaded the new and tiny Jewish state. And to the surprise of the so-called experts and pundits everywhere, the nascent Israel Defense Forces prevailed, defending the people of Israel and soundly defeating the Arab coalition. 
   French President Nicolas Sarkozy called the emergence of the State of Israel ``a miracle of the 20th century.'' However, Golda Meier once remarked that there had been ``too much self-sacrifice and too many lives lost for Israel's emergence to be considered a miracle.'' 
   But the establishment and the evolution of the State of Israel can be considered, without doubt, one of the dazzling human achievements of our times. 
   Hundreds of thousands of Jews and their descendants escaped oppression, or worse, because Israel exists. Spurning the authoritarian model that dominates its region, and persevering in a sea of enmity, Israel has built a world-class civilization, a vibrant democracy, a thriving economy, and a culturally and academically rich society. 
   The American people, and particularly the United States Congress, have contributed mightily to Israel's sustenance and security over the years. Of that we are justifiably proud. 
   But Israel's triumphant story is also tinged with tragedy. Each year just before its independence day, Israel honors soldiers who have fallen in its defense. A siren sounds all over the nation, and Israelis everywhere stop to remember. This minute of silence is a poignant memory for all who have witnessed it. But it is also, unfortunately, symbolic of Israel's wider regional reality for Israel has lived under the Damoclesian threat since its birth. 
   For years the Arab world sought to drive Israel into the sea. But eventually, after much death and destruction, the visionary Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, and the wise Jordanian, King Hussein, recognized the value of peace and coexistence with Israel. And although much of the Arab world's economic, cultural and political boycott of Israel remains intact and terrorism has never ceased, the prospect of a collective military attack on Israel fortunately has faded in recent years. 
   Nevertheless, Israel today lives under potentially greater threats to its well-being and existence than ever before. The daily rocket assaults from Gaza, controlled by fundamentalist Hamas, have reaped vast physical and psychological damage on the people of Sderot, not to mention the fact that they have killed more than a dozen Israelis. And increasingly, sophisticated rockets are being used. They are more deadly accurate by the day, and they have greater range. In Israel's north, Hezbollah's replenished missile supply poses an even greater threat. 
   On the other end of the military spectrum, a theologically based state, the Islamic Republic of Iran whose president says Israel should be wiped off the map, is developing nuclear  weapons and long-range missiles. Now is not the time to go into details about these threats. This body has spoken specifically to each of these dangers in the relatively recent past, and will do so again. 
   Now it is time to reaffirm our Nation's pledge to Israel that we will stand in solidarity with Israel against all violent assaults on its security and well-being. And most of all, it is time to say to our friend and ally, Israel, congratulations on your incredible social, political, economic, and technological achievements in the face of the most stupefying odds. We in the United States could not be prouder of our special relationship with you. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

This would have been something that he would have been personally very gratified with, and certainly wanted to join in the trip that the Speaker will be leading to the State of Israel in the next couple of weeks to help celebrate this anniversary. And so I think it's fair to say that everyone in the Chamber wishes that things might have been different, that he might have been here himself to manage this resolution. And we are looking forward to a group that the Speaker will be taking to Israel to actually personally participate in that celebration.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, for introducing this important resolution. Speaker Pelosi's commitment to human rights generally, and Tibetan human rights specifically, is deep, well established, and unwavering. 
   For two decades in Congress, from her earlier stage as a junior Member to her current position as Speaker, she has used her powerful voice to speak on behalf of the Tibetan people. The bipartisan delegation that she recently led to Dharmsala to meet with the Dalai Lama and her authorship of this resolution demonstrate her continuing dedication on the Tibetan issue. I am, and all of us in this body should be, grateful for her leadership. 
   China's response to Tibetan protests over the last month has been tragically predictable. For half a century, the Tibetan people have struggled under the repressive policies of the Chinese authorities. And sadly, the current crackdown is only the most recent example of Beijing's mistreatment of Tibetans. 
   As the world watched events unfold inside China, we were sickened not only by the shock of seeing images of Chinese authorities beating Tibetans in the street, but also by the realization that these are images that we have seen before, and fear we may see again. 
   It was this legacy of repression that caused Tibetan monks to take to the streets on March 10th to peacefully protest Beijing's ongoing denial of religious, cultural, and human rights for the Tibetan people. And sadly, it was the same legacy that caused Beijing to respond with excessive force and a propaganda campaign designed to stoke Chinese nationalism by demonizing Tibetans and their spiritual leader, His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. 
   If China wishes to be viewed by the world as a truly responsible power, it must put an immediate end to its shortsighted policies towards Tibet which are morally reprehensible, irresponsible and dangerous. 
   Beijing cannot credibly claim that is seeks genuine reconciliation with the Tibetan people when its policies force Buddhist monks to denounce their allegiance to the Dalai Lama, deny educational and economic opportunities to Tibetans, and threaten Tibetan culture by encouraging an overwhelming influx of Han Chinese migrants into Tibetan areas. This resolution not only condemns Beijing's crackdown on Tibetan protesters, it also urges China to begin to move away from its policy of repression and incitement of ethnic tensions. 
   The resolution calls on Beijing to allow international monitors to assess the situation in Tibetan areas in China and ensure that those injured in the protest receive adequate medical treatment. 
   In addition, the resolution urges Beijing to hold direct and results-based discussions with the Dalai Lama in order to come to a resolution of the Tibetan issue, one that respects Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty, but at the same time provides genuine religious and cultural autonomy for Tibetans. 
   The resolution instructs the Department of State to reconsider its decision not to include China among the countries with the worst human rights records in the Department's 2007 Human Rights Report. 
   Madam Speaker, at this point, once again, I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi for introducing this important resolution, which I strongly support, and ask my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this long-overdue legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   The war on terror isn't just a military operation--it's also a battle to persuade people in Arab and Muslim countries that the universal values of freedom and democracy are far superior to radical ideologies that preach intolerance, hate and violence. 
   This bill includes several important provisions to help us succeed in that struggle. 
   Building on previous legislation, it establishes an enhanced International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund to provide educational opportunities for young people. 
   The Fund will support teacher training, the development of modern curricula, and the translation of western publications to help ensure that students have alternatives to the radical Madrassas that nurtured the Taliban and al-Qaeda. 
   A related provision in the bill extends a program I authored with Mr. Knollenberg that provides scholarships for Arab and Muslim students to attend American-sponsored elementary and secondary schools in their home countries. 
   This can be a cost-effective means to ensure that needy students receive an American-style education and exposure to western ideas and values. 
   H.R. 1 also authorizes the designation of a Middle East Foundation to support democracy, human rights, civil society, independent media and the rule of law in countries throughout the greater Middle East. 
   Like the highly successful Asia Foundation, this non-profit, non-governmental institution will make it easier for the U.S. to support reform-minded organizations and individuals without arousing the suspicion and mistrust that often comes with direct government funding. 
   Consistent with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, this legislation also calls for a significant expansion of U.S. international broadcasting and other public diplomacy in Arab and Muslim countries, and provides new authority that will allow the Broadcasting Board of Governors to respond quickly to a crisis overseas. 
   As Congress takes these steps to improve our international broadcasting capabilities, I hope the President will appoint a new Chairman of the BBG to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of that important organization. 
   Finally, this bill also contains some very important provisions to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   It repeals unnecessary restrictions on the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, strengthens the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and establishes a U.S. Coordinator for the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (PRESERVING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. I thank my chairman for helping to bring this bill and this issue to the floor twice now, and for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, last month, the House passed H.R. 580 to restore the checks and balances to the U.S. attorney appointment process. The bill we are considering today takes a slightly different path to nearly the same end. 
   Last year, during the conference process on reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, a provision was added to the report authorizing the Attorney General to unilaterally appoint interim U.S. attorneys for indefinite periods of time, making it possible for the administration to circumvent the Senate confirmation process. 
   The only disagreement I would have with my friend from Florida's comments was the notion that the Congress considered that change. This was put in in a conference committee, unbeknownst to, I think, just about every Senator on that conference committee, certainly all House Members, other than perhaps the chairman of the committee; and the Congress didn't consider that change. 
   When the Judiciary Committee began its investigation into the U.S. attorney firings early this year, DOJ representatives were quick to assure members of the committee that getting around the confirmation process was never their intent in pushing for this proposal. 
   As the Department began producing e-mails and other materials in response to the Judiciary Committee's inquiry, it became clear that whether or not it was the original intent of the administration, DOJ and White House employees quickly figured out that the provision created the possibility of circumventing the Senate and decided to exploit that authority. 
   As I said when we passed H.R. 580 last month, the ongoing investigation may uncover many issues within the Department that we want to examine. In the meantime, we should quickly address the problem we know about.     
   The bill we are considering today would reinstate a system that encourages politics to be left at the door during the appointment process and creates a check on the system if the executive branch cannot bring itself to do that. 
   The reason we are considering a second bill on this topic is that Republicans in the other body have blocked the House-passed bill from progressing. The only difference between these two bills is that the House bill specifically precluded the administration from using the Vacancy Reform Act to extend interim appointments for another 210 days. This is a provision that the Bush administration used nearly 30 times in its first 5 years to replace U.S. attorneys. If this avenue remains open, we are permitting the practice of circumventing Senate confirmation to continue. A temporary appointee could serve for nearly a year without a Presidential nomination or going through the confirmation process. 
   It's ironic, isn't it? We hear the arguments all the time about the Senate not acting fast enough to confirm judicial appointments. There is rarely an emergency to get a district judge confirmed. U.S. attorneys are different. In any given district, there is only one U.S. attorney. If the administration can simply use extended temporary appointments, the problem will continue. 
   This bill shouldn't be our last word on the matter. In the progress of the investigation in the Judiciary Committee, we have learned that a second provision removing residency requirements for U.S. attorneys was likely put into the PATRIOT Act reauthorization to make way for certain particular interim appointees. We should repeal that provision, and I intend to introduce legislation to do so. 
   Communities in this country should feel assured that their U.S. attorney wasn't put in for purely political purposes. These positions shouldn't be used to ``develop the bench'' or to send in someone who had no connection to the community whatsoever just because he needed a job. 
   We should fix the system completely, and we will, but because of threatened holds in the other body, we are only doing a partial fix today.

   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Translators and interpreters have been crucial to our efforts in Iraq, serving as a critical link between our troops and the Iraqi population. Because of their work for U.S. forces, many of these people have risked their lives and the lives of their families to assist our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Now they are under serious threat. These translators and interpreters who  serve bravely alongside our troops need our immediate assistance. Singled out as collaborators, many are now targets by death squads, militias and al Qaeda. 
   In Mosul, insurgents recorded and circulated the brutal execution of two interpreters, a stark warning to others who have assisted U.S. forces in the country. U.S. soldiers and embassy employees who have attempted to help their interpreters flee from violence have had to stand by hopelessly as their Iraqi colleagues went into hiding. Often leaving their families behind simply in order to survive. 
   Congressman JEFF FORTENBERRY came to me with the idea, and I agreed, and we introduced broad, far-reaching legislation on this issue. We are taking up the bill before us today because the Senate already passed this by unanimous consent, and the urgency of the situation requires us to act now. 
   This legislation will help quickly address this crisis by authorizing up to 500 special visas for Iraqis and Afghanis who put their lives at risk by working with the U.S. military and the U.S. embassy in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We all realize this is not a partisan issue, and I am pleased to have worked with the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee on helping to get this bill before us today. The original special visa legislation included in the 2006 Defense Authorization Act has proved wholly inadequate, authorizing only 50 visas a year, creating a backlog estimated to take 9 years to clear at the current rate. 
   As of last week, nearly 500 Iraqis and Afghanis have gone through the requisite background checks and have been approved for the visa. Because of the backlog, they are stuck in limbo waiting for a visa that may never come. These people need us to act. The Senate passed this legislation over a month ago, and the administration is supportive of taking this action. 
   Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs recently said, ``We are committed to honoring our moral debt to those Iraqis who have provided assistance to the U.S. military and embassy.'' Clearly, we owe these people a debt of gratitude. They have risked everything to help us out in Iraq and Afghanistan and the least we can do is help deliver them out of harm's way. 
   But I tell my colleagues, the magnitude of the broader refugee crisis in Iraq far exceeds anything this bill attempts to resolve. We need to address the wider refugee issue, which has forced over 4 million Iraqis from their homes. 
   The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) has legislation on this subject, and I think will be speaking to that broader issue. No one should take our efforts to do this now as a notion that that satisfies our obligation on something that we played a part in, creating the situation that led to this. 
   Let me just add, I see this as an emergency effort. It can't be the last word on this matter. We must do something to deal with the larger refugee issue in Iraq, as I said, and it's very possible that the visas we are discussing in this bill will prove inadequate for this need. Still, I think we need to act now so that the visas are available. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   My friend from Iowa makes interesting arguments, but to some extent undermines those arguments. He says rule of law is important, and, therefore, the committee should have accepted an amendment in the committee to make illegal what folks in our embassies and in our missions did, thereby undermining the argument that in any way there was any law violated. 
   There was no law against expending funds to process these visas. There were no promises made to Iraqi interpreters and translators they would be guaranteed a visa. But when our folks in the field see a situation developing where the people who have allowed them to do their job, at great risk for their life and limb, are in desperate need for them and their families to essentially be appreciated and rewarded for that life-threatening effort, and they tell their folks that they work for in the Defense Department and in the State Department and the folks in Congress who are dealing with these issues that we need to do something about them, and we respond, that doesn't constitute a promise that no one had authority to make, a violation of the rule or law. 
   And, by definition, I understand, and we have had many discussions on our immigration issues; in fact, the gentleman and I are both here now rather than at a hearing on the immigration issue. I understand the gentleman has a definition of amnesty which is wider than mine, but I never realized how much wider it was, that a bill that adds to the number of visas that can be given, after background checks and going through the regular process to ensure the security interests that we have before we issue a visa, that a bill that would increase the number of visas for these people who have put themselves in harm's way on behalf of the United States is an amnesty law. This takes that very expansive definition the gentleman has and I think expands it even further. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

I would be stunned if our dedicated employees in a very difficult foreign mission or in the military were out promising things they couldn't deliver. I don't think our folks operate like that. I think they were processing applications in case and in the event that we increased the number of visas because the demand was so urgent. The gentleman from Oregon talked about 4 million refugees. We are talking about an infinitesimal subset that worked for us in our campaign efforts in Iraq.

   Mr. BERMAN. Let me reclaim my time just to respond to that. We have a law that gives 50 visas a year, but the next year it gives 50 more and then 50 more. Is the gentleman suggesting that we should not process any more than the first 50? 
   There are people who would be allowed the next year and the year after. Why wouldn't you give these visas to the people who were first in line? I know the gentleman loves the sanctity of the line. Give these to the people who are first in line. Why wouldn't we process applications of people who weren't going to get visas that year but the next year? Why 5 years later would you take somebody who hasn't been waiting in line for 5 years and approve their visas?

But no part of Mr. Fortenberry's or my motivations for introducing the bill, and I wouldn't speculate on the Senate's motivations, but no part of our motivation was to take the administration out of an embarrassing place where they have been making promises that couldn't be kept. 
   We thought that justice, fairness, American tradition, and the risks that these people have taken to help our Armed Forces and our diplomats in one of the most difficult, hazardous situations in the world gave them a claim that we should respond to, not a promise made by somebody that we are forced to keep. We wanted them to have these visas. We weren't responding to pressure to take the administration and their people in Baghdad out of an embarrassing situation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (ALIEN SMUGGLING AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation gives Federal prosecutors and agents stronger enforcement weapons against the most pernicious forms of human smuggling, terrorism-related smuggling and smuggling that results in kidnapping, rape or an attempt to kill. 
   This bill is based on a provision that has been added into H.R. 1684, the Homeland Security Department Reauthorization Act, in its committee markup. The supporters of that provision agreed to withdraw it from that bill so the Judiciary Committee, the committee of primary jurisdiction, could take a closer look. 
   The resulting bill amends both 8 U.S.C. 1324, the alien smuggling prohibition, and 18 U.S.C. 2237, the prohibition against failure to heave to, to provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction, increase maximum penalties for serious offenses and clarify the necessity defense that applies to legitimate maritime rescues. 
   This bill applies not just to human smuggling in the maritime context, but to all cross-border human smuggling. It provides appropriately tough penalties for the kind of serious smuggling offenses I've just described, while distinguishing those from other types of transport such as noncommercial efforts to reunify families. While these practices also violate our immigration laws, they do not fall into the same category of offense, and should not be treated as harshly. 
   Although the bill streamlines and strengthens the current offense language, it does not abandon existing case law that applies to alien smuggling offenses. For instance, it will remain a violation of Federal law both to bring illegal aliens to the United States and to bring other aliens across the border through places other than those designated as official entry ports. This is especially critical as Congress mandates that the Department of Homeland Security institute biometric entry and exit systems. For an orderly and fair immigration system to work, people must come in through these sites. 
   The bill also prevents the current list of illegal activities, smuggling, recruiting, transporting and harboring, without adding new activities, such as assisting aliens in their efforts to enter our country. Again, this preserves the distinction between true smuggling and the work of groups such as faith-based organizations, who seek to serve the alien community on humanitarian grounds. 
   Because this important distinction is preserved, the Judiciary Committee believes the religious activities exception in current law is sufficient, and the bill doesn't expand it. The bill also preserves current law in treating the offense of helping to bring in one's close family members as a misdemeanor. 
   The bill also establishes for the first time in Federal law that it is illegal to transport persons under inhumane conditions, such as in an engine compartment, a storage compartment or other confined space; or overloaded or intentionally run ashore and grounded at high speed and left to scatter. Those kinds of inhumane practices have resulted in death or serious injury to numerous alien passengers. 
   Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to consider providing further sentencing enhancements for particularly egregious offenses. Such enhancements should reach the smuggling of aliens in a life-threatening manner, the abandonment of aliens in the desert or discharging them onto spits of land that will be submerged in a high tide, or those cases that involve the facilitation of terrorism. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I only want to make two points. The gentleman from Florida gave a discussion about the legislation and put it into the context of the Southern District of San Diego, and I just did want to note for the record that the Department of Justice that decided to recommend the U.S. attorney's termination had commended her specifically for her handling of immigration cases. 
   And the second point I guess I wanted to make on this issue was would it be that the people in charge had ensured that the offices most impacted by illegal immigration and by illegal alien smuggling and those districts on the border of this country had been given the resources to the Justice Department disbursed to the U.S. Attorney's Office so they weren't held under hiring freezes and constrained to try to deal with an enormous issue with a very limited number of prosecutors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1908, PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Vermont for yielding me the time and for his really very complete discussion and understanding of the legislation which is now at stake, and I rise in strong support of this bill and particularly the rule. 
   I might point out in context of the rule that, as the gentleman from Florida suggested, 14 amendments were offered. A number of those amendments, five of them, were made in order, and a number of the other amendments were worked out and are part of the manager's amendment. So many of the issues raised in the context of openness are continuing up to this point. 
   This has been both a bipartisan process, and I might suggest with respect to the people who are supporting the product of this bipartisan process, the rule is being supported on a bipartisan basis. 
   When functioning properly, the patent system encourages and enables inventors to push the boundaries of knowledge and possibility. I support strong, robust protection for quality patents. However, when the system functions improperly, such as allowing an overly broad or obvious patent, the patent systems can stifle innovation and harm America's competitiveness in the global economy. 
   Such patents cover arguably obvious inventions. An example is crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for which a patent was obtained. However, the much more insidious and troubling kinds of poor quality patents are the ones that are granted which impede commerce or further invention because they create a patent thicket so wide and so dense that an entire industry or segment of our economy becomes subservient to a single patent from a single innovator. 
   Many groups, agencies and citizens have written volumes on the need for reform, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the Federal Trade Commission, the National Academy of Science, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, the American Bar Association Intellectual Property Division and the American Intellectual Property Association. All of the studies concluded that the current system is in need of changes if it is to remain viable in the new technology global economy. The moment is ripe to move the patent system forward to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Serious flaws have to be fixed for our system to remain robust now and long into the future. 
   As the gentleman from Florida acknowledged in his comments which preceded mine, this legislation is the result of a substantial amount of work, not just over this Congress but over the past three Congresses. We did not undertake this endeavor lightly. This isn't a rush to judgment. It isn't a rush to legislate.  
   We don't claim that this bill at this point is perfect, but this remains only one step in the process. Like all compromises, not everyone received everything they wanted, which is honestly just as it should be. This legislation favors no industry, no person, organization or interest group. It seeks to solve problems that we have identified and have been identified for us by outside experts and agencies. The legislation does what is best for America and our spirit of inventiveness and innovation, and it protects our position within the increasingly competitive global marketplace.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, first I have to say that we wouldn't be here, not only for his substantive contributions to this legislation, but because of his suggestions about the approach we should take, whether it was in full committee or as we move towards the floor in terms of working out problems that existed, and that's Chairman Conyers. He played a critical role in getting us to this point. 
   Lamar Smith, Howard Coble, Rick Boucher, who I started this with, Darrell Issa, Zoe Lofgren, Adam Schiff, Bob Goodlatte, a number of people played key roles in all this. I don't have too much time. The staff, on an issue like this, was indispensable; they made incredible contributions. This is really complicated stuff. Perry Apelbaum who demonstrated great leadership and guidance on many issues, George Elliott, a detailee from the Patent Office who is a great resource, Karl Manheim, who decided to spend his sabbatical helping on patent reform, Eric Gorduna who spent his summer working on the committee report, countless other staff, and of course my Chief Counsel Shanna Winters. 
   But the question is why, why are we doing this? And here are the things we are told by groups like the National Academy of Sciences and so many other organizations that are tremendously respected for their understanding of science and of our economy: 
   One, there are serious problems in the patent system; 
   Two, many poor-quality patents have been issued, which cheapen the value of patents generally; 
   Three, there have been a variety of abuses in patent litigation rules that have taken valuable resources away from research and innovation; 
   Four, U.S.-based businesses are disadvantaged because our patent laws aren't harmonized with the rest of the world. 
   Many organizations, many groups have argued for these reforms. 
   A quick statement about support. Every major consumer group in this country has endorsed this legislation. There is tremendous support in the financial services sector, in the high technology sector. The universities have now, University of California, which is one of the critical magnets of research and development, have supported passage of this legislation through the House. The American Association of Universities has supported moving the bill forward. 
   And one last comment. There is one very controversial issue, aside from the ones addressed by the amendments that we have seen that are not fully dealt with, and that particularly relates to the issue of damages and the apportionment of damages. It is our commitment, my commitment, the chairman's commitment, Mr. Smith's commitment, Mr. Coble's commitment, to work with people who are concerned about that language to reach an appropriate middle ground that reforms the way damages are calculated between now and the conference committee and when this comes back to deal with that controversy. 
   I urge strong support for this bill so we can make this historic effort, first in 60 years, move forward to ultimate enactment. 
   I include short list of the range of groups that support this bill.  
   The Business Software Association, The Financial Services Roundtable, Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, TechNet, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Knowledge Ecology International, Public Knowledge, United States Public Interest Research Group, American Corn Growers Association, American Agricultural Movement, Federation of Southern Cooperatives, National Family Farm Coalition, National Farmers Organization, Rural Coalition, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Computer and Communications Industry Association, Computing Technology Industry Association, Illinois IT Association, Information Technology Association of America, Information Technology Industry Council, Software & Information Industry Association, St. Jude Medical, Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, Inc., Hampton Roads Technology Council, Northern Virginia Technology Council.

   Just to review the bidding, my friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) over and over again talks about the flaws in this bill. Other than four Gohmert amendments on the issue of venue and one amendment from the gentleman from Iowa that was an earmark amendment, no other amendments were kept from consideration here. For all the arguments about flaws, where were the amendments to correct the flaws that they talk about? For all the notions of, we're not against reform, but this one isn't perfect, and this one isn't right, and this has some flaws, and it hasn't resolved every issue to everyone's satisfaction, nothing will, where is their alternative bill? 
   I'm telling you, this is an issue of whether we're going to address a system that the National Academy of Sciences and so many other objective agencies have said is getting near broken or doing nothing, and I suggest doing nothing is not a good answer for a Congress that wants to keep the American economy strong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, it's an honor to be part of the debate on a bill being managed by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who perhaps is one of the first Members of Congress to speak out and lead the effort against the old apartheid regime, going way back into the late sixties and early 1970s, and who, along with Congressman Ron Dellums and many others, led the effort in 1986, I believe it was, to override the veto and provide the first really tough sanctions against investment that helped play a part in the ultimate downfall of that apartheid regime. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a long overdue one, and it's the direct result of a stunning and, frankly, embarrassing story for the United States. The United States, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, had a much too cozy relationship with the apartheid Government of South Africa which had labeled the ANC as a terrorist organization. The apartheid government banned membership and political activity in the ANC and forced its leaders underground or into exile. A direct result of that ban was that under U.S. law individuals convicted of crimes, including the Nobel Laureate and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, were deemed inadmissible for entry to the United States, along with individuals labeled as terrorists by the former South African government. 
   Much has changed for South Africa since those dark times. President de Klerk and Nelson Mandela negotiated an end to the conflict and an end to the apartheid system on behalf of the National Party and the African National Congress. In 1994, the country held its first democratic elections in which full enfranchisement was granted. 
   Today, the ANC serves as the majority party in a diverse ruling coalition. Yet, astonishingly, while South Africa completed its monumental political transition, the U.S. position regarding entry for ANC's leaders remained frozen in time. Leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbeki, the father of President Thabo Mbeki, were continually barred from entry to the U.S. and had to apply for special waivers to gain entry. 
   Even more embarrassing than the original U.S. embrace of apartheid policies was the fact that few of those who opposed apartheid in the United States Government, including many of us in Congress, were even aware of the residual terrorist designations against ANC members.     
   Despite recognizing two decades ago that America's place was on the side of those oppressed by apartheid, Congress has never resolved the inconsistency in our immigration code that treats many of those who actively opposed apartheid in South Africa as terrorists and criminals, in part because the apartheid regime labeled them as such. 
   Increasingly, stringent security measures passed by Congress since 2001 have further ensnared ANC members. Because the ANC used armed force as part of its campaign against the repressive apartheid regime in South Africa, current law continues to regard the ANC as a terrorist organization and to deny entry to members based on their affiliation with the ANC. 
   The intent of H.R. 5690 is to purge the United States of any residual effect of its former policies with regard to the South African Government and to update U.S. law with regard to the ANC. The bill, as amended, specifically removes the ANC from treatment as a terrorist organization and grants the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security the discretionary authority to determine that certain criminal- and security-related grounds of inadmissibility do not apply to an alien with respect to activities undertaken in opposition to apartheid rule in South Africa. 
   I want to take a moment just to compliment again the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who has very strong and passionate views on the issues of immigration and, obviously, also, as we all do in this Chamber, on the issue of terrorist organizations and inadmissibility for those organizations. He has truly understood and internalized the historic transition here and the unfairness of the present situation. 
   And I do want to affirm one point that he raised. This bill does not have anyone close their eyes to acts committed by the ANC or by the apartheid government, and nothing here would preclude the Secretary, as she exercises her discretion, from considering whether or not civilians were targeted by an individual actor, civilians. We should, also, I think, take into account, as we decide what to do on this, the very powerful and legally binding truth and reconciliation process in South Africa which provided a restorative justice process that salved many of the wounds of the apartheid era. 
   Once enacted, the ANC will be removed from terrorist watch lists, and the ANC will receive treatment befitting its status as a leading party and a close ally of the United States. I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (PRIORITIZING RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Chairman Conyers, for those kind words. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 4279. American inventors, artists and businesses rely on intellectual property rights to protect the value of their creative works. These works, unfortunately, are being ripped off around the world. The rampant counterfeiting and piracy of U.S. products is having a devastating impact on our economy. 
   Counterfeit and pirated products may account for up to 8 percent of world trade, and a significant portion of this illicit trade are knock-offs of American products. Latest estimates indicate that U.S. businesses lose up to $250 billion a year due to intellectual property theft. This level of counterfeiting and piracy of U.S. intellectual property rights translates to job losses, lower tax receipts, and a greater trade deficit. It has also led to public health and safety threats ranging from exploding batteries to toxic pharmaceuticals to sawdust brake pads. 
   The economic threat and safety problems that counterfeit and pirated products pose for U.S. businesses and consumers must be dealt with. Given the difficult economic times we find ourselves in, it is that much more important that we address these problems quickly and effectively. 
   I am aware of the recent efforts the administration has taken to stem the tide of counterfeit and pirated products. The Department of Homeland Security has seized record numbers of counterfeit and pirated goods coming through the border. The Department of Justice is prosecuting and convicting more intellectual property thieves. The Patent and Trademark Office has stationed representatives in foreign countries to advocate for better enforcement. However, despite these efforts, intellectual property theft is on the rise. More must be done. H.R. 4279 is more. 
   The Act strengthens our civil and criminal laws in ways that attack the organizational structures intellectual property thieves are using and reduce the economic incentives that thieves have to engage in commercial scale counterfeiting and piracy. The Act devotes more resources to investigate and prosecute intellectual property crimes. The Act also provides more resources for the U.S. Government to work with other governments to improve intellectual property enforcement abroad. 
   And probably most importantly, H.R. 4279 provides a permanent and effective means of coordinating intellectual property enforcement activities. This includes the creation of an intellectual property enforcement representative in the Executive Office of the President and requiring that a national strategic plan to counter intellectual property theft be created, complete with clear goals and benchmarks that will facilitate accountability. 
   I'd like very much to thank Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Coble and all of their staffs, as well as mine, for the hard work they've put into crafting this bill. The hard work shows in both the scope of the reforms and in the strong support for the bill by U.S. businesses and labor groups, and Chairman Conyers outlined a number of those organizations and the broad sweep that they cover and their strong endorsement. 
   I'm also pleased to say that the amendments adopted in the bill before us go a long way in alleviating concerns raised over the operational independence of agencies like the USTR and the Department of Justice, without compromising the underlying reforms. 
   H.R. 4279 will bolster U.S. efforts to combat counterfeiting and piracy, and I urge support of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill reflects the bipartisan text agreed by the other body that incorporates several provisions from H.R. 5916, the Berman/Ros-  Lehtinen/Sherman/Manzullo Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Reform Act of 2008 that the House passed in May. 
   It authorizes the Department of the Navy to transfer surplus U.S. Navy vessels to friendly countries which Congress does on an annual basis. It strengthens the vital security relationship with our close friends and allies, South Korea and Israel. Building on the work of Representative Royce, U.S. law will now add South Korea to the list of countries in the Arms Export Control in the same way as NATO, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. This is a significant symbolic recognition of the critical importance of South Korea to U.S. national security and to peace and stability throughout East Asia. 
   It also requires the administration to empirically assess on an ongoing basis the State of Israel's ``Qualitative Military Edge,'' we call it QME, against conventional or nonconventional security threats, to report that assessment to Congress every 4 years, and to use that assessment when reviewing arms exports to other countries in the Middle East. 
   Every President since Lyndon Johnson has affirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's Qualitative Military Edge against potential enemies. But unfortunately it has become clear the administration uses subjective judgment when evaluating Israel's QME. The State and Defense officials have admitted there is no objective empirical method for evaluating this critical measure of whether or not Israel maintains a qualitative superiority over potential threats to its security. 
   It is also clear that by such subjective evaluations are performed sale by sale and country by country without clear, overall consideration of the balance of capabilities possessed throughout the region that conceivably affect Israel's security. 
   This provision would remedy this glaring lack of a robust mechanism to make security and export decisions that could undermine the security of one of the most important friends and allies that we have in the Middle East. The bill also authorizes security assistance to Israel, including implementing the recent U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Security Assistance. 
   It is fitting that on the 60th anniversary of Israel, the U.S. renews and strengthens its relationship with a most important friend in the region. It deserves all the support we can muster. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (PRIORITIZING RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I very much thank the chairman for yielding and for all the work that he has done to bring this bill to this point. 
   I rise in support of S. 3325, which is the Senate's companion bill to the chairman's and a number of us, our bill, H.R. 4279, which passed the House overwhelmingly by a 410-11 vote on May 6, 2008. S. 3325, like H.R. 4279, makes necessary changes to our intellectual property laws, improves coordination of our intellectual property enforcement efforts, and devotes more resources to tackling the scourge of intellectual property crime. 
   The proliferation of intellectual property crime has had a disastrous impact on our economy and on public health and safety. Counterfeit and pirated products may account for up to 10 percent of the world's trade, and a significant portion of these are American products. Conservative estimates indicate that U.S. business loses up to $250 billion a year--I know these days $250 billion isn't that much, but it's a serious amount--due to intellectual property theft. 
   This level of counterfeiting and piracy translates to job losses, lower tax receipts, and greater trade deficits. Public health and safety is threatened by inferior and dangerous knockoffs, such as exploding batteries, toxic pharmaceuticals, and sawdust brake pads. 
   In response to the grave threat of intellectual property theft and the threat that poses to the U.S. economy and the health and safety of our citizens, the House passed the PRO-IP bill. 
   The bill strengthened our civil and criminal laws in ways that attack the organizational structures intellectual property thieves use and that reduce the economic incentives thieves have to engage in commercial-scale counterfeiting and piracy. It devoted more resources to investigating and prosecuting intellectual property crimes and to working with other governments to improve intellectual property enforcement aboard. 
   Following our lead, the Senate passed S. 3325, which provides many of the same reforms called for in H.R. 4279. 
   I just want to close by thanking very much Chairman Conyers, his staff, the subcommittee staff for all the work they put into it, the minority staff, Mr. Coble, Mr. Smith, who is a great partnership, and for working to develop and pass this bill, and to thank Senator Leahy and his staff for their efforts and urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7084, the Webcasters Settlement Act of 2008, which grants authority to relevant parties to negotiate an alternative royalty rate for the use of music on Internet radio stations under the existing government compulsory license. 
   This license gives webcasters the privilege of using copyrighted recorded music at a government-mandated rate determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges. 
   The recent government rate was determined on March 2, 2007. After considering voluminous written submissions and 48 days of trial testimony that filled 13,288 pages of transcript, the Copyright Royalty Judges determined fair, marketplace-based rates, averaged over a 5-year rate period. The judges followed their authorizing statute and carried out their duties in a fair and impartial manner. Both sides were able to present thorough cases and the judges came to a fair result based on the evidence presented. 
   Since that determination, certain webcasters have requested that copyright owners enter into negotiation to offer an alternative rate for webcasters who meet unique conditions, and requested that the Committee on the Judiciary facilitate such negotiations. These negotiations have been proceeding in earnest over the past 2 months, and the parties are making considerable progress. 
   Because the parties will not be able to finish their negotiations before Congress recesses, however, and because authority by Congress is required for a settlement to take effect under the government compulsory license, we are pushing this legislation that will grant such authority and hope the negotiations will continue in a positive direction for both sides. 
   I might add that the issue of broadcasters who are doing or want to do webcasting negotiations in that area also will be starting in the immediate future.

   Mr. BERMAN. I yield myself 1 additional minute. 
   It is an important principle that negotiations are more appropriate before the copyright royalty proceeding. However, these conversations that have taken place under the committee's auspices are occurring in unique and extraordinary political and business circumstances and are unlike typical marketplace negotiations. 
   This bill provides that any alternative private deal-making or any private deal regarding an alternative rate would not be precedential, unless, of course, the parties agreed that it should be. Some of the rates that are being discussed represent a large discount, a huge discount from what independent decisionmaking bodies have found to be marketplace rates, and less than what I understand many webcasters have been paying since the judges reached their decision. 
   Neither this deal nor this bill should be understood as a criticism of the judges' decision, and I would expect marketplace rates to be higher and at least a reflection of what the judges decided absent the distinct circumstances that apply here. 
   I hope this legislation will make it easier for more music to be performed online by paying services, and also that there will be an increase in compensation to creators. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I hate to say this in front of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, but with the gentleman from Utah, with whom I worked so closely on so many different aspects of the immigration issue, I will sorely miss you. 
   We didn't agree as much on all the intellectual property issues as we did on the immigration issues. But the other side of the coin is, I didn't agree with the ranking member of Judiciary on the immigration issues as much as I did on the intellectual property issues. 
   But in both cases it has really been a delight to work with both of you, and particularly you, Mr. Cannon, because at least for now you won't be back here next year. I will miss both your person and your work on these issues, and we shall prevail.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the drug crisis facing the United States remains a top national security threat. The GAO states that 90 percent of illegal drugs entering our country transit the Central American-Mexican corridor. 
   Drug gangs that operate in the United States, Mexico, and Central America are dangerously undermining the security environment for our neighbors to the south, and the spillover effects on our own soil are undeniable. 
   President Calderon of Mexico made a brave decision early in his presidency to fight illegal narcotics in a way that no Mexican government had done before, and he and his countrymen have paid a high price for it. Drug cartels have been blamed for 6,000 deaths in two-and-a-half years in Mexico alone, 4,000 of them in the year-and-a-half since Mr. Calderon assumed the presidency. 
   A significant percentage of these deaths are law enforcement personnel, outgunned and outspent from the proceeds of illegal drugs. There seems to be no limit to the brazenness of the drug gangs. A month ago, the chief of Mexico's Federal police was shot dead in his own home. 
   It is high time for the United States to do more than applaud President Calderon's courage. We must work together to tackle this difficult problem. 
   President Bush and President Calderon met in the Mexican city of Merida last year to craft a new and innovative proposal to confront this scourge. That proposal is largely reflected in the legislation we have before us today. 
   The central tenet of this bill is that, while the violence must stop and security must be restored, the ultimate solution to this problem lies in respect for the rule of law and the strength of institutions charged with upholding it.     
   H.R. 6028 represents the U.S. implementation of a new partnership with Mexico and Central American countries to face the immediate security threat of drug gangs, help these neighbors build the capacity of their law enforcement agencies, and enhance the rule of law in the region. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the supplemental appropriations bill includes funding for year one of the Merida Initiative, but the legislation before us today authorizes the full 3 years of this plan in an exhaustive and complete manner necessary to undertake this critical partnership with our southern neighbors. 
   For example, this legislation authorizes $1.6 billion over 3 years in the areas of counter-narcotics, the fight against organized crime, law enforcement modernization, institution building, and rule of law support. 
   Mexico has requested that the U.S. provide certain high-tech equipment. And in this bill we authorize transport helicopters with night operating capabilities, aerial and radar surveillance equipment, land and maritime interdiction equipment, and secure communication networks. 
   This legislation supports a variety of programs designed to enhance the transparency and capacity of civilian institutions at the Federal, State and local level. They include assistance in courts management, prison reform, money laundering capabilities, witness protection, and police professionalization. The latter emphasizes human rights and use of force training, as well as forensics and polygraph capabilities. 
   In the realm of prevention, the bill supports programs to increase school attendance and expansion of intervention programs. It also seeks to promote development in areas where joblessness feeds the narcotics problem, including alternative livelihood and rural development efforts. 
   It concentrates considerable funding in the fragile Central America region, as well as in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, in programs tailored to that region's specific needs. 
   The legislation contains significant human rights safeguards as well as end-use monitoring provisions for equipment and training. It provides no cash transfers. 
   It calls on the President to devise standards up front that will be used to measure the success of the initiative, and to regularly report to Congress on progress made toward meeting these standards. 
   Significantly, because this was a specific request from our Mexican neighbors, the legislation bolsters by $73.5 million America's efforts to stem the illegal flow of arms going south by significantly expanding ATF's Project Gun Runner. 
   Finally, the bill establishes a coordinator for the initiative to provide accountability and harmonize its wide-ranging programs. 
   Perhaps most importantly the legislation recognizes that the spread of illicit drugs through Mexico and Central America and into the United States, as well as the violence that accompanies it, cannot be halted without a comprehensive interdiction and security strategy planned and executed jointly with our southern neighbors. Madam Speaker, with this authorization of the Merida Initiative we demonstrate our Nation's commitment to work closely with our friends and neighbors to the south in a meaningful and long-term fashion to battle illegal narcotics. 
   I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The gentleman from Ohio raises an issue of controversy between the United States and Mexico. What I urge the Members of this body to do is to focus on the purpose of this initiative. This is an initiative that is in America's deep national interest. The whole issue of illicit narcotics trade, the role of the corridor between Central America and Mexico in contributing and supplying these illicit narcotics, the war going on in Mexico between the drug cartels, and a president and a leadership that is now taking this head on serves our national interests. Our effort to stem illegal immigration is directly connected, and the effectiveness of it will be greatly dependent on our ability to stop these cartels and to smash this trade in illicit narcotics. 
   Whatever one's concern is about a particular aspect of the U.S.-Mexican relationship, I would suggest from America's interest point of view that this issue, this initiative, is a compelling one and should be supported.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the nutrition title of the pending conference report. It includes many urgently needed improvements to our food assistance programs for low-income people. 
   As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I am particularly pleased to see this title includes language to correct a couple of problems that have arisen relating to the enforceability of the act and to ensure that no further problems exist. 
   The Food Stamp Act has long been recognized as fully enforceable on behalf of active and prospective participants. This history of enforceability is comparable to that of securities regulations, which the courts have long accepted. When, many years ago, a panel of the Fifth Circuit found no private right of action under the Food Stamp Act in a case brought by a pro se plaintiff, several other circuits, and ultimately the Fifth Circuit en banc, rejected that conclusion. Had they not done so, I have no doubt we would have intervened. 
   Recently, a couple of Federal courts cast doubt on this long-held principle, one by finding the Department's regulations on bilingual service unenforceable and another by forcing plaintiffs to meet the high standards for supervisory liability when suing a State to enforce the act and regulations against local agencies. I am pleased that this legislation overrules both of those decisions. 
   More broadly, the legislation recognizes that lawsuits by individual households or classes of household to enforce their rights under the act and regulations are an important part of the program. There now should be no doubt, if there ever was any, that all provisions of the act and regulations that help individuals get food assistance, or that protect them from burdens in their pursuit of food aid, are intended to create enforceable rights, with corrective injunctions or back benefits, the latter subject to the limitations in the act, as appropriate. 
   The act does not require States or the Department only to exercise reasonable efforts or to substantially comply with its requirements and those in the regulations: it gives each individual a right to be treated as the act and rules provide. The act and regulations have an unmistakable focus on the benefited class of participants and prospective participants, they are written in mandatory, not precatory terms, and they are concerned with the treatment of individuals as much as they are with aggregate or system-wide performance. 
   I cannot imagine how Congress could be any clearer in this regard. I anticipate that we will have no further confusion concerning the enforceability of the act and regulations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. I thank the Speaker. 
   A great deal has been said about Tom Lantos this evening, wonderful, eloquent words that captured just the profound effect that he had on this institution. Many serve in this institution. Some leave a mark on their districts of their presence here; some leave a lasting mark on the institution. It's hard for me to think of anyone who left such a mark around the world as Chairman Lantos did in so many different areas. 
   You read that statement that David Dreier read earlier, and I'm going to read it again because it captures his love of this country. He and Annette, they were the greatest Americans because they knew what the alternative had been, and they paid back with their work and with their gratitude what America offered them. 
   This is Tom Lantos' words after he is diagnosed with a very advanced stage of esophageal cancer, ``It is only in the United States that a penniless survivor of the Holocaust and a fighter in the anti-Nazi underground could have received an education, raised a family, and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a Member of Congress. I will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country.'' 
   He not only loved America; he hated tyranny and oppression. And I served with Tom on the committee for 26 of his 28 years in the Congress, and that anger and hostility and willingness to fight against dictatorship and tyranny covered the dictatorships of the communist regimes, and it covered the dictatorships and the oppression of the rightwing authoritarian regimes. He wasn't one side or the other; he was against tyranny for human rights. Stood firm. 
   It's very easy for us to attack forces that have no direct impacts on our district; it doesn't take that much courage to do that. Tom Lantos, notwithstanding what some company in his  district might be making in terms of sales to a particularly oppressive country, stood firm and constantly dealt with the pressures coming back from his own constituents about our livelihood, our jobs, because he couldn't tolerate the notion that, in effect, American companies, American individual interests, American corporate interests were giving governments around the world the tools of that repression. 
   In closing, I just want to tell one story. It was a profound experience for me, I'll never forget. I had the opportunity to see Tom a few weeks ago at his home here in Washington with Annette, with Katrina, with their granddaughter and with a baby grandson, which, by the way, was one part of what gave him his strength was this unbelievable family structure. And he looked much better than he had looked in his last few weeks here, and he talked about being at peace. Yes, he would have loved to have been able to be here a few years longer, but for him, he felt what a wonderful life he had had, what a wonderful family, what a country, the colleagues. He was at peace with what awaited him. And there was a serenity and a strength there that just was stunning to me. I'll never forget it. 
   To the family, to Annette, our prayers are with you. And you know that the work he did, the lives he affected around the world, his presence will be maintained long after his passing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I, in concert with Mr. Conyers, the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, make the following explanatory statement regarding H.R. 7311, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008.   
   H.R. 7311, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008, reauthorizes existing U.S. programs to combat human trafficking and establishes new requirements and programs regarding trafficking into both sexual exploitation and forced labor. Among a wide range of initiatives, the bill establishes new programs to prevent trafficking from occurring in foreign countries where trafficking begins, widens U.S. assistance programs to U.S. citizens, and provides additional protections for trafficking survivors who are threatened by trafficking perpetrators, and for children who are at risk of being repatriated into the hands of traffickers or abusers. 
   The Wilberforce Act also improves upon existing criminal prohibitions against human traffickers, including streamlining in the Slavery/Trafficking chapter of the federal criminal code, and creating new criminal tools to reach unscrupulous labor recruiters. Unlike previous reauthorizations, this reauthorization is for four years, from fiscal years 2008 to 2011, recognizing that U.S. anti-trafficking programs have become more established. The bill reflects an effort to develop a consensus between H.R. 3887, passed by the House on December 4, 2007, and S. 3061, ordered reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 8, 2008. The legislation draws from the common approaches in both bills and develops alternative proposals where the two bills diverge. This explanatory statement draws attention to changes in several provisions of the bill from the approach in H.R. 3887. Many of the provisions of the bill and the intent behind them that are closely aligned with the original provisions of H.R. 3887 are described in the House Report 110-430, part I, the report accompanying H.R. 3887. 
   Title I 
   Title I of the bill draws from substantially similar positions in both the House and the Senate bills. 
   SECTION 102. OFFICE TO MONITOR AND COMBAT TRAFFICKING 
   Section 102 provides more targeted amendments to section 105 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 with essentially the same objectives of requiring the establishment of the Office, promoting public-private partnerships to end trafficking and clarifying the role of the Director of the Office with regard to funding programs. Although the bill does not include several provisions from H.R. 3887, this should not be seen as failing to recognize the importance of the Office or the Director. The Office has been very effective in raising the awareness of the trafficking issue and should be considered for space in the new consolidated plan for relocating offices of the Department of State closer to the Harry S. Truman Building. When the head of the Office was changed to an Ambassadorial position, the pay rate for the position was actually reduced. That decision should be reassessed. 
   SECTION 105. INCREASING EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTI-TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS 
   This section draws from similar versions of both H.R. 3887 and S. 3061. In the new section 107A of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, subsection (b) requires a self-certification that persons or entities providing services directly to trafficking victims have completed or will complete training. This self-certification, which is not expected to be monitored in every case by the U.S. Government, is intended to apply primarily to persons actually in direct contact with and providing services to the trafficking victims, not interns, other volunteers or administrative or supervisory staff of organizations involved in the assistance. 
   SECTION 106. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF TRAFFICKING 
   This section, similar in both bills, makes a number of changes to section 108 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. With respect to the deletion of ``a significant number of'', the provision is intended to ensure that the broadest range of countries is reviewed by the Department. This section also separates out the provision regarding reducing the demand for commercial sex acts and participation in international sex tourism as a criteria for whether a country is making serious and sustained efforts to combat trafficking in persons, highlighting the importance of making progress in this area as the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons makes its decisions on tier ratings. 
   Title II 
   Title II reflects a number of changes to U.S. law, including amendments to the Immigration & Nationality Act (INA), and Title 18 of the United States Code (related to federal crimes). Many of the provisions, particularly those relating to amendments to the INA, were similar in H.R. 3887 and S. 3061. 
   SECTION 201. PROTECTING TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AGAINST RETALIATION 
   Section 201 provides a number of modifications to provisions relating to the T and U visa category, drawing from both H.R. 3887 and S. 3061. Among other matters, this section provides that a holder of a non-immigrant visa under Sections 101(A)(15)((T) or (U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act can adjust to permanent residency even if their T or U visas may have lapsed in the time period in which the adjustment regulations had not been promulgated. While adjustment regulations were released on December 8, 2008, and will control in the future, this provision is included as a stop-gap measure for those petitioners whose adjustment petitions were not processed because of the government's failure to issue regulations until that time. 
   SECTION 203. PROTECTIONS, REMEDIES AND LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE FOR A-3 AND G-5 VISAS. 
   This section addresses the issues of employees of diplomats and officers and employees of international organizations who perform domestic services in the homes of such individuals, drawing from provisions in section 110 of H.R. 3887 as well as section 203 of S. 3061. This provision is sensitive because of its effects on reciprocity to U.S. diplomats abroad. However, the failure of the Department of State to take seriously cases involving abuse has been troubling, and this provision establishes a new framework for dealing with these cases. In particular, subsection (a)(2) provides that the Secretary of State shall suspend the issuance of certain visa classes to applicants seeking to work for officials of diplomatic missions or international organization ``if the Secretary determines that there is credible evidence that 1 or more employees of such mission or international organization have abused or exploited 1 or more A-3 or G-5 non-immigrants and that the diplomatic mission or international organization tolerated such actions.'' It is expected that if the Department of Justice or another part of the U.S. Government provides information that such an act has occurred, or a non-governmental organization provides such information, and the information is credible, the Department should take steps to make the mission or organization aware of such information, and if the mission or organization does not take  steps to rectify the situation, the denials of the visas provided under this section should start. 
   SECTION 222. CRIMES 
   This section contains a number of modifications to the federal criminal code. Section 222 conforms the various crimes set forth in Title 18, United States Code, Chapter 77 ((Peonage, Slavery, and Trafficking in Persons) by extending the obstruction provisions of the Peonage statute (Section 1581) to the other substantive servitude offenses, by creating conspiracy liability within the Chapter, and by improving the treatment of restitution and asset forfeiture. None of those provisions are intended to foreclose the use of corresponding sections of the criminal code, where appropriate. 
   Section 222 also clarifies the definition of coercion in the core offenses created by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which responded to the Supreme Court's narrowing of the federal Involuntary Servitude statutes in United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988). Section 1589 covers offenses involving forms of forced labor, while Section 1591 is in the context of commercial sexual activity and can also be violated when a person uses a child for prostitution, as children are unable to give consent to commercial sexual activity. Those offenses returned the legal standard for a servitude conviction to the modern approach reflected in such cases as United States v. Mussry, 726 F.2d 1448 ( 9th Cir. 1984) and the lower court decisions in Kozminski (allowing conviction in servitude cases involving psychological coercion as well as overt violence). 
   Accordingly, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 crafted Section 1589 and 1591 to only require a showing of a threat of ``serious harm,'' or of a scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that such harm would occur. The term ``serious harm'' refers to a broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical, and is intended to be subjectively construed in determining whether a particular type or certain degree of harm or coercion is sufficient to overcome a particular victim's will. Section 222 further clarifies these concepts to reflect the various and subtle forms of coercion used by traffickers in light of the experiences of prosecutors and non-governmental organizations in combating trafficking and assisting victims. Such modification was contemplated by the drafters of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (Pub. Law 106-386): ``[T]he conferees are aware that the Department of Justice may seek additional statutory changes in future years to further address the issues raised in Kozminski, as courts and prosecutors develop experience with the new crimes created by this Act.'' Conference Report Accompanying H.R. 3244, House Rep. 106-939, 106th Cong. 2nd Sess. 101 (printed in 146 Cong. Record H8855, H8881). 
   Thus, Section 222 clarifies that ``[t]he term `abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process' means the use or threatened use of a law or legal process, whether administrative, civil or criminal, in any manner or for any purpose for which the law was not designed, in order to exert pressure on another person to cause that person to take some action or refrain from taking some action,'' and that ``The term `serious harm' means any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing [in the case of section 1589, labor or services, or, in the case of section 1591, commercial sexual activity] in order to avoid incurring that harm.'' It is contemplated that these refinements will streamline the jury's consideration in cases involving coercion and will more fully capture the imbalance of power between trafficker and victim. A scheme, plan, or pattern intended to inculcate a belief of serious harm may refer to nonviolent and psychological coercion, including but not limited to isolation, denial of sleep and punishments, or preying on mental illness, infirmity, drug use or addictions (whether pre-existing or developed by the trafficker). ``Commercial sexual activity'' in this context is not limited to a particular sex act, but would include all aspects of prostitution, including time under the defendant's control in which the victim is not engaged with clients. 
   Another modification to Chapter 77 made by section 222 involves the level of scienter necessary for a violation of Section 1591. The current standard is enhanced through the addition of a ``reckless disregard'' option. Such an approach is well-established in other federal criminal statutes, and would have the advantage of reaching those who turn a willfully blind eye toward a person in commercial sexual activity who is being physically abused or is underage. Such an approach puts the responsibility on participants in commercial sex activity to not ignore indicia of abuse, such as bruising or distress, or indicia of youth on the part of those whom they recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain, or maintain. 
   Additionally, a special evidentiary provision is added for those cases under Section 1591(a)(1) in which criminal liability attaches not because of the use of coercion but because of the use of a minor for commercial sexual activity. In such cases, the prosecution will be exempted from having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant who had a reasonable opportunity to observe the person recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained or maintained knew that the person had not attained the age of 18 years. This special evidentiary provision reflects a similar provision in the aggravated sexual abuse offense, Title 18, United States Code, Section 2241(d), and is crafted in light of United States v. X-Citement Video, 513 U.S. 64, 70, n.2 (1994) (exception from presumption of mens rea more appropriate in statutes in which perpetrator necessarily ``confronts the underage victim personally and may reasonably be required to ascertain that victim's age''). This approach comports with numerous appellate decisions in related areas of the law, such as the Mann Act. See, e.g., United States v. Jones, 471 F.3d 535 (4th Cir. 2006). 
   Section 222 also creates a new fraud crime, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1351, which prohibits the recruiting, solicitation, or hiring, with intent to defraud, foreign persons to be employed in the United States through false pretenses, representations, or promises about their employment. For the purposes of this provision, ``employment'' is presumed to include, but not be limited to, such issues as terms and conditions of employment, housing, labor broker fees, employer or broker-provided food and transportation, ability to work outside of the offered place of employment, and other material aspects of the recruited person's work and life in America. This statute is intended to capture situations in which exploitative employers and recruiters have lured heavily-indebted workers to the United States, but did not obtain their labor or services through coercion sufficient to reach the level of the Chapter 77 Slavery/Trafficking offenses. Press accounts and Congressional briefings have highlighted cases with facts as egregious as situations in which defrauded workers were stranded in fenced compounds, reduced to catching pigeons for food and collecting rainwater to drink, all the while facing bankruptcy because of brokerage charges and debt incurred in their home country in reliance on the recruiters' false promises. This section will be of particular application in cases involving employment-based immigration (``guestworker'') programs, but is not limited to employment under such a provision. This Section a five year statutory maximum in recognition that the victims of fraudulent labor recruiting are at high risk of being held in servitude, and that prosecutors should not have to wait for the abuse to rise to the highest levels of criminality before dismantling these criminal organizations. 
   H.R. 3887 updated Title 8, United States Code, Section 1328, a long-established statute that criminalizes the importation of aliens for immoral purposes and the harboring or employment of aliens so imported. The bill does not include this update, but rather directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to assess the sentencing guideline pertaining to alien harboring, 18 United States Code, Section 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii), to determine whether the guideline for harboring should conform to the Mann Act guideline when the harboring was committed in furtherance of prostitution and the defendant is an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor. Section 1324 is a more modern statute, penalizing harboring even without proof that it was done in furtherance of illegal importation. The elements of a 1324 offense do not vary based on the purpose for which the alien is being harbored. For instance, there is no difference in the knowledge required on the part of an employer, an alien smuggler, or a trafficker that the alien had come to, entered, or remained in the United States in violation of law. Section 1328 remains an effective tool to reach those who are kept in a brothel or other place in pursuance of importation for an immoral purpose, but this review of the sentencing structure is intended to guarantee that it will be supplemented by the general harboring statute. 
   SECTION 225 PROMOTING EFFECTIVE STATE ENFORCEMENT 
   This section, reflective of some of the goals of section 224 of the H.R. 3887, provides that nothing in previous acts related to trafficking, this Act, and any model law related to trafficking promulgated by the Department of Justice shall be read to legitimize prostitution as a valid form of labor, or to preempt, supplant or limit the effect of any State or Federal criminal law. In particular, it should be noted that financial transactions involving the proceeds of any trafficking activities, or any failure to report income obtained through any trafficking activities would remain reachable by applicable federal statutes, irrespective of the provision of section 225(a)(1). 
   Many states have modernized archaic slavery or forced prostitution statutes in line with the TVPA or the model state laws promulgated by the Department of Justice or non-governmental organizations. In recognition that many state statutes in the closely related area of prostitution enforcement are also antiquated, the bill directs the Department of Justice to supplement its current anti-trafficking model law with modern anti-prostitution models, so that a holistic update is available for policymakers' use. Section 225 will also require that the new model law be distributed to each Attorney General as a means of promoting the new model law. The bill also will result in dissemination of a chapter of the Criminal Code of the District of Columbia as an example of a statute that reaches as felonies cases involving coercion, pandering, and exploitation alike.  
   SECTION 238 PROCESSING OF CERTAIN VISAS 
   Section 238 mandates a report from the Department of Homeland Security concerning the work of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Unit at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Vermont Service Center. The VAWA Unit is a highly-trained adjudication team that is responsible for a number of victim-related immigration applications, including but not limited to: the adjudications, adjustments, work authorizations, parole, fax-back benefits and employment verification, naturalization, and derivative beneficiaries related to such programs as Violence Against Women Act self-petitions (Section 101(a)(51) of the Immigration and Nationality Act); T visas (Section 101(a)(15)(T) of the Immigration and Nationality Act), U-visas (Section 101(a)(15)(U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; battered spouse waivers (Section 216(c)(4)); abused immigrant work authorizations (Section 106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act) and parole for children of Violence Against Women Act cancellation recipients (Public Law 103-222, as reauthorized by Public Laws 106-326, 108-193, 109-162, and 109-164) and any other matters that are protected by the confidentiality provisions of the Violence Against Women Act. 
   The mandated report seeks information on funding, staffing, and training. The Unit should continue to be the responsible office for the processing of victim-related immigration applications, and such processing should be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable confidentiality requirements. Off-site adjudication of such applications should be considered an extraordinary circumstance, and if cases must be adjudicated elsewhere, special care should be taken to ensure compliance with confidentiality and adjudication standards of the Unit. 
   Immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other violent crimes should not have to wait for up to a year before they can support themselves and their families. The Vermont Service Center should therefore strive to issue work authorization and deferred action in most instances within 60 days of filing, consistent with the need for safe and competent adjudication. The mandated report therefore seeks information on the timing adjudications, and steps taken to improve on this aspect of the Unit's mission. 
   The staff of the Unit are widely respected as experts in the effect of trauma and victimization and the heightened confidentiality mandated by the Violence Against Women Act, and have historically been not only an adjudication team but a policy resource. The mandated report thus includes a description of measures taken to ensure that the policy expertise of the Unit is fully incorporated into decision-making by the Department of Homeland Security.

<DOCNO>Mr. BERMAN. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, on the President's request 5 years ago, Congress launched a global campaign to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and to treat and care for those who are already afflicted. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act was a bipartisan bill from its inception. Today, the Foreign Affairs Committee again brings a bipartisan global HIV/AIDS bill to the floor, and again this important reauthorization bill enjoys strong support from the White House. 
   The negotiations that brought forth this compromise bill were conducted in the same bipartisan spirit that guided the 2003 act into law, a spirit made possible by close cooperation between two former chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committee, our late colleagues Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde, and I am pleased to note that this important reauthorization bill is named for these two foreign policy titans in recognition of their contributions to battling HIV/AIDS overseas. 
   As a direct result of the extraordinarily successful law we passed 5 years ago, the United States has provided lifesaving drugs to nearly 1.5 million men, women and children; supported care for nearly 7 million people, including 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children; and prevented an estimated 150,000 infant infections around the world. 
   The 2003 legislation firmly established the United States as the leading provider in the world of HIV/AIDS assistance for prevention, treatment and care. It has reminded the global community that Americans are a compassionate and generous people, and so has helped to repair our Nation's badly-damaged image overseas. In many ways, that legislation has had great healing power. 
   Most importantly, with this initiative we have ensured that HIV/AIDS is no longer the certain death sentence it was just 5 short years ago. Hospital corridors that were jammed with AIDS patients waiting to die now brim with hope as lifesaving drugs are dispensed. 
   The reauthorization bill before the House today reaffirms our commitment to the programs and policies established 5 years ago. The 2003 legislation  worked well as an emergency intervention, but it must now be modified to reflect the constantly changing nature of the HIV/AIDS crisis. We also have 5 years of experience under our belts and we know what works and what does not. 
   The law we passed in 2003 was designed to deal with the emergency phase of the global HIV/AIDS crisis. The Lantos-Hyde bill will move our programs towards long-term sustainability that will keep the benefits of U.S. global HIV/AIDS programs flowing to those in need. With this reauthorization act, host governments will also gain the ability to plan, direct and manage prevention treatment and care programs that have been established with U.S. assistance. 
   The 2003 legislation authorized $15 billion over 5 years. In response to the desperate need for lifesaving medicine and a greater number of trained health care workers in nations hard hit by HIV/AIDS, the bill before us authorizes $50 billion over 5 years for these three pandemics. 
   The 2003 law relied upon the health care workforce already in place in the developing world, yet in many of the hardest hit areas of the world there are simply not enough doctors and other health care workers to meet the challenges of this pandemic. The Lantos-Hyde legislation invests new funds in training new professionals and paraprofessionals, as well as building existing capacity. 
   The 2003 law focused on creating new programs to tackle the HIV/AIDS crisis. The reauthorization bill increases the number of individuals receiving prevention, treatment and care services. It also builds stronger linkages between the global HIV/AIDS initiative and existing programs designed to alleviate hunger, improve health care, and bolster HIV education in schools, an approach endorsed by the President's Global AIDS Coordinator just a few short weeks ago. 
   The 2003 law gave inadequate attention to the needs of women and girls. The new legislation remedies this situation by strengthening prevention and treatment programs aimed at this especially vulnerable population. 
   The reauthorization legislation also eliminates the one-third abstinence-only earmark, but requires a balanced approach to HIV/AIDS sexual transmission prevention programs and a report regarding this approach in countries where the epidemic has become generalized. 
   The bill before you today is a compromise in the best sense of the word, and it is in the true spirit of the great leaders of this committee who guided the 2003 act into law, Chairmen Lantos and Hyde. This bill is the result of more than a year of preparatory work and weeks of discussions, concluding with a bipartisan agreement with the White House. President Bush has indicated his support and his intention to sign it into law as soon as Congress acts. 
   For all its strengths, the bill before the House today is not perfect. No compromise ever is. No one got everything they wanted in this compromise legislation. But with this agreement, we have maintained the strong, bipartisan coalition behind the global HIV/AIDS initiative which has been critical to winning rapidly increasing funding levels for this important initiative. 
   Madam Chairman, 20 million innocent men, women and children have perished from HIV/AIDS, and 40 million around the globe are HIV positive. Each and every day another 6,000 people become infected with HIV. We have a moral imperative to act, and to act decisively. 
   I will speak more lengthily about the subject, but I do want to initially extend my particular appreciation to our ranking member, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who played a critical role in working with the majority to reach this compromise. A number of Members on her side from the committee were active. Don Payne, the gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, was critically involved, as was Congresswoman Barbara Lee from California, who played such a key role in the 2003 law, as well as a number of other people, such as Congressman Carnahan. I can't mention everyone who was involved, but this was truly a collaborative effort that started long before I became Chair of the committee, with great work by Chairman Lantos last year and with the staff of the committee. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes to respond to the concerns raised during this colloquy. I thank my colleagues for raising these important concerns. 
   H.R. 5501 provides clear and specific instructions to the USAID Administrator and the Global AIDS Coordinator to address the food and nutrition needs of individuals with HIV/AIDS and other affected individuals, including orphans and vulnerable children; and to fully integrate food and nutrition support in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs carried out under this act. 
   I would like to emphasize that the committee and I personally share our colleagues' concerns about the negative effect rising costs are having on our long-term and emergency food aid programs. This is a matter that has our most serious attention, because it affects a wide array of our food aid and development programs, including the effectiveness and success of this program. 
   I want to reassure my colleagues that I will be working over the coming weeks to strengthen and clarify in the bill that food security and nutrition programs, especially those referred to as wrap-around services, are not to be funded with monies diverted from other standing commitments to address food and security elsewhere in the world or in these countries. 
   I yield 30 seconds' additional time to the gentleman from Massachusetts.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague from California, the gentlelady, Maxine Waters. 
   MS. WATERS. Madam Chairman and Members, I am pleased and proud to be here today to commend not only Chairman Berman but the late Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde for their wisdom and their foresight in putting together this most important legislation. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I just returned from south Africa and I am pleased to announce that while I was there, I was recognized and given the Order of the Companions of Oliver Tombo Award for my work to help dismantle apartheid in South Africa, and basically for being a friend of south Africa's. I was very proud. 
   But as I sat there talking with President Umbeke and others, I was reminded that in south Africa there is an estimated 5.5 million people living with HIV and AIDS. That is more than any other country in the world. Over 18 percent of the adult population of south Africa is infected by HIV. Infected persons include thousands of well-educated professionals, such as doctors, nurses, civil servants, and teachers. 
   In recognizing that we have done a great job in helping to promote democracy and get rid of apartheid, the enemy now is HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis. They are losing all of their professionals. They don't have the personnel to carry out the plan that they have put together to continue to move south Africa to where south Africa needs to be. 
   I was very proud that they had built 2.3 million new houses over the last 10 years. But, again, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS is destroying this population. This legislation will help this country and other countries. These are our friends. They love us. And they love us for having been involved in the struggle to help save them. These are countries that we will be able to count on in the world because we have come to their aid. 
   Let me also recognize that there were many Americans traveling in South Africa. Those Americans who were there are being served by people who live in areas where tuberculosis and HIV is rampant. 
   So we need this for protection and security of all peoples.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, we have no further requests for time. I would like to make a few closing comments, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is an accident of fate and hanging around a long time that put me in the position of managing this bill today, and it is the first bill not on the Suspension Calendar that has come out of the committee since I have become Chair. But the fact is the work on this legislation began a very long time before I became the Chair. 
   They have been mentioned before, but there are so many new initiatives and so much thoughtful logic underlying this legislation that I thought it would pay to once again mention a group of staff people who, working under the leadership of our staff director, Dr. Bob King, spent a huge amount of time working for Chairman Lantos, working with the minority staff, to craft what became a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation: 
   Peter Yeo; Pearl Alice Marsh; Kristin Wells; David Abramowitz; Macani Toungara; Heather Flynn from Chairman Payne's Africa Subcommittee; Christos Tsentas from Congresswoman Barbara Lee's staff; Naomi Seiler and Jessica Boyer from the Government Oversight Committee staff, all played important roles on our side in working on this legislation. Yleem Poblette on the minority staff made major contributions. 
   The result is a bipartisan product where in a way we have internalized on our side the logic of efforts to change behavior and recognized the validity of abstinence programs in the context of a comprehensive approach to this problem and accepted the value of faith-based organizations, and the minority has accepted the logic that this is a fundamental, moral and humanitarian concern that we should address and be willing to put a lot of value to, because we know it works. 
   We know there is a direct relationship between the resources we put into this program and the lives saved, the people who can avoid and prevent it, and that it has implications beyond just the moral and humanitarian dimension, as Speaker Pelosi and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen said, in terms of security and economic welfare and economic growth in so many parts of the world, which ultimately all inure to our benefit and our national interest. 
   So, once again, I am very pleased to be part of this process with my partner, the ranking member.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman yielding, and I rise to join you in supporting the gentleman's amendment. What was interesting to me was to learn, and there are many things I learned in this bill that I didn't know, but one was that about 1.2 billion people globally lack safe water to consume in the least-developed countries, and up to 90 percent of AIDS patients, 90 percent, suffer and frequently die from the chronic diarrheal diseases that the gentleman discussed. These diseases are caused by the use of unsafe water.

   Mr. BERMAN. Madam Chairman, the gentleman's amendment, and I have spoken to him about it, encourages the Global Fund Inspector General to not only audit its grantees, but also the subgrantees and subrecipients who receive Global Fund money. 
   Obviously, I share the gentleman's concern that transparency and accountability in the use of HIV/AIDS assistance provided through the Global Fund is critically important for all the reasons that he stated. The Global Fund, in all fairness, I do want to point out, has shown, I believe, its commitment to that transparency and accountability. It has a new inspector general, and has instituted an enhanced accounting system that focuses on improving accountability among subrecipients. But the principle of this amendment makes sense. While there are some technical issues I will want to talk to him about as we move through the legislative process, I look forward to working with him on it and I certainly urge the adoption of the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   First, I appreciate the compliments of my friend from Wisconsin. I prefer that the compliments be withheld and the motion to slash this bill by 40 percent be rejected, although I do appreciate the implication of his comments that a recommittal motion that is forthwith is not intended to kill the bill and that, therefore, the recommittal motions that are not forthwith are intended to kill the bills they are made to. 
   But getting to the merits of this. The purpose of my comments is directly to the other side. I know the easy vote, even for those who support this bill, is to vote both to cut some money and to support the minority on their motion to recommit. 
   But I would like to suggest that in this particular case, given what has transpired in terms of putting together this bipartisan bill, both on the merits of the motion to recommit and on the message it sends about how we can work on a bipartisan basis in the future, this motion is wrong and that Members on the other side should oppose it along with the Members on our side. 
   First, on the facts. The administration supports this bill and supports our number on this bill. To the extent they have concerns about what the level of appropriations may be in this year, their statement of administration position directly says, talk about the level of appropriation; don't cut the authorization. 
   Secondly, the U.N. HIV/AIDS commission, which I'm not a fan of a lot of different agencies that start with ``U.N.,'' but this one is the preeminent authority, talks about the incredible remaining need. And in the issue of absorptive capacity, this was the same argument made in 2003 against a $15 billion authorization for which the Republican Congress appropriated far more than the authorization because we were able to see an absorptive capacity, and we saved well over a million lives. 
   But here we are dealing with a situation where there are 35 million people worldwide that are still living with HIV/AIDS. This is a program that works. The combination of changing behavior, prevention, and treatment is saving lives. I don't like to throw the words ``moral imperative'' around. It's usually used for anything people feel passionately about. But talk about pro-life, I can't think of any single program that I have been involved with where we are going to be more pro-life than in pushing this with programs that work, with the capacity that can be absorbed. No one is saying we are going to spend $50 billion in the next 5 years. We are going to obligate, based on the appropriation moneys, and those moneys will be spent probably over the course of 8 to 10 years. That's the way this appropriation process works, as everyone knows. 
   My final point is the ranking member and I, the White House directly, the President and his chief of staff were directly involved, the Republican leadership in this body, we put together a bipartisan bill. Part of the key negotiation was about the number. In return for that, a number of issues of importance to the minority were preserved in this bill: the preservation of the concept of behavior change through abstinence and faithfulness; the understanding that approved family planning programs would be the ones that were funded. A variety of different aspects. The belief in the use of faith-based institutions. 
   How are we, in the future, going to come together on bipartisan programs where the deal is made and then all of a sudden a key part of the quid pro quo, the other side says ``no'' to? 
   I would suggest, sure there are issues about what is our fiscal condition and what can we do, and the appropriations could be weighing these very carefully. But this was a fundamental agreement to maintain a bipartisan tradition on this legislation named after Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos, both of whom worked in that capacity. 
   I think this motion to recommit massively undercuts that whole bipartisan approach, and I would urge my colleagues to defeat it. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.
