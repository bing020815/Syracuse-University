<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, five years ago, the United States made an unprecedented commitment to the people of the world who suffer from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. We pledged $15 billion--and with that funding, we have: Provided life-saving drugs to almost 1.5 million people; funded care for over 2 million orphans and vulnerable children; and provided mother-to-child transmission prevention services during more than 6 million pregnancies. 
   For millions, HIV/AIDS has been transformed from a death sentence to a manageable condition--and Congress has played a very real role in making that happen. On this issue, our moral obligation and our self-interest speak with one voice. Not only do we have the opportunity to save millions of lives--failing to do so will help proliferate disease and instability, spreading bloodshed across borders. 
   Today, with the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global LeadershipAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act, we raise our commitment to eradicating those diseases to a total of $48 billion. In addition to expanding our prior efforts, this carefully negotiated legislation will: 
   Strengthen HIV -related health care delivery systems and increase health workforce capacities; 
   Foster stronger relationships between HIV/AIDS initiatives and other support programs, including those that promote better nutrition and education; 
   Allow HIV/AIDS testing and counseling to be provided as part of the U.S. bilateral family planning program; and 
   Enhance prevention and treatment programs targeting women and girls. 
   This bill also eliminates a requirement that 1/3 of prevention funds be spent on abstinence--a requirement that has proven ineffective. Instead, we have directed the Administration to create a ``balanced'' approach, requiring behavioral change programs to receive 50 percent of the funds devoted to the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV. In the face of the AIDS pandemic, this bill will show the world, unambiguously, that America accepts its obligation to act. 
   Last year alone, 2.5 million people contracted HIV--roughly 6,800 every single day. And last year alone, 2.1 million AIDS victims were added to the rolls of the dead. We are confronting a scourge far too pressing, far too powerful, to be made the object of political inaction. We have rarely faced a greater global challenge. We have rarely needed a greater global solution. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee for her hard work to shape that solution. But most of all, I want to honor Tom Lantos. This bill, in many ways, was the culmination of his career, his lifetime of service. I wish he could be here to see it. But how perfect that Tom's work, which began in the fight against tyranny in his homeland, expanded to encompass the whole world, and the world's struggle against the tyrannies of disease and poverty. 
   Chastened by the vast challenge of AIDS--but inspired by Tom's example, and Henry Hyde's, as well--let us come together across the aisle and join the struggle with all the force America can muster. Let us pass this bill.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Our thought is that both sides should have notice of what amendments are going to be considered, that all Members have notice of what is going to be considered. Obviously, there is no constraint on what amendment somebody might want to offer, but we believe that it would be helpful if Members had notice of what the substance of the amendments are so they can, if they want to support it, support it on the floor, if they want to oppose it, have the opportunity to come here and do so. But I think it will be our intention to ask that there be a notice requirement without restriction on the amendments that are asked but simply to give notice as to what the amendments are going to be.

   Mr. HOYER. We have a number of pieces of legislation that are obviously pending. First of all, we are very hopeful that we will pass the extenders legislation which we sent to the Senate some, actually months ago, a couple of months ago, I think, which, as you know, ensures tax credits for alternative energy. Wind is particularly important. Boone Pickens was here, as you know, on the Hill talking to both Democrats and Republicans, the importance of that. Others have talked about that as well. As you know, they're trying to dispose of some of the ``Coburn holds'' as we call them. Some of those may be back. Obviously we will have to consider a funding resolution for government after we leave. My expectation is that will be a point of business. We're also talking about obviously, as you have read in the paper, and as I think, I'm not sure you and I have talked about a jobs bill and some continuing economic assistance to make sure our economy hopefully grows and does not certainly fall any deeper into recession. Those are some of the pieces of legislation. 
   I have mentioned some of the things that we hope to get from conference next week, mental health parity being one of those, higher education, the consumer products safety. Hopefully many of those may be dealt with next week. But if they were not, it is my expectation we would do those in September as well. 
   So those are some of the major things that I foresee for September. What we will have done next week obviously won't be on September, but if we haven't done them we will try to get them done in September.

   Mr. HOYER. As you know, we have considered a number of pieces of legislation which we were hopeful would move us in the direction of, A, producing more domestic energy through encouraging further drilling in those leaseholds already available, approximately 88 million acres that are currently available. We considered the Consumer Energy Supply Act today. Unfortunately, that didn't get sufficient votes. It got a lot of votes. It got a significant majority of the House. It did not get the two-thirds so we could move it to the Senate. We considered the DRILL Act which also received a majority of the votes which provided for both the 10.4 million acres in Alaska and the National Petroleum Reserve to be encouraged to be moved forward as quickly as possible to drill in that area, produce oil and petroleum in that area, which also encouraged, as you recall, the building of additional pipelines, both for natural gas and for petroleum products. 
   Next week, we will be considering--many people are very concerned about the fact that the price spikes which don't seem to go down consistent with the price of oil by the barrel, which has reduced significantly, but the gasoline price hasn't reduced. There is significant concern about the impact of speculation. We are going to consider that bill, I think, next week, as I indicated. 
   You say you have introduced this bill. I'm sure it will go to the committee. I haven't seen the bill. I will certainly talk to the various chairmen. I don't know how many committees will have jurisdiction over the bill. You say it's a comprehensive bill, maybe multijurisdictional, but I will certainly talk to the Chairs about the substance of the bill. 
   Let me say, the American public is obviously very concerned. Our position is we ought to drill. We ought to drill where we've given leases that exist.  Your position essentially is, well, that is fine, but there are other places where we could drill as well. We believe that is accurate as well. It's been very controversial. As you know, Governor Schwarzenegger, the Republican Governor of California, is not too interested in proceeding with drilling off his shore. There are differences of opinion. We really do believe that we ought to drill, we ought to drill now and we ought to drill where there is not controversy and where we do have leases. I think that is the difference between us, apparently, not that any of us oppose drilling. It is where you drill first. If that proves, from my perspective, not to be fruitful, then perhaps at that time we ought to look at alternatives. But the President, of course, has indicated and made it very clear that he believes wherever you drill is not going to make a substantial difference in the next 5 to 10 years. 
   So we believe we ought to start drilling right now so that we can move ahead as soon as possible. There are 107 billion barrels currently speculated to be in the identified areas of that 88 million acres to be available. We use about 21 million a day, about 14 billion a year. That is a pretty good supply, about 7 1/2 years of supply. We would hope we would move ahead on that. But we haven't done that yet. We understand that. 
   But we ought to have a legitimate debate on it. I think all of us want to get to the same place--energy independence for our country and the use of alternative and renewable energy sources to not only help our energy supply but also help our environment. So I will certainly encourage the committee to look at that bill.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   As my friend clearly knows, as you know, we've been operating under two moratoria: One has been the executive moratorium which was just lifted which was placed on by the first President Bush. As you know as well in the Interior bill year after year in the 6 years your party was in charge and then last year in the Interior bill, that moratorium was continued. So under both parties, Governor Schwarzenegger, Governor Bush of Florida, both very, very strong proponents effectively of not drilling off their shores. So this is not a Republican-Democratic difference. In fact, both parties were supporting--I presume, I don't want to speak for your party--our party was supporting drilling where we have current leases.     
   I would disagree with my friend, and we may disagree on the definition of deep water. They are drilling now in the Gulf of Mexico, as you know, at depths of 1,000 feet. Additionally, there are 33 million acres available in the gulf now on the Outer Continental Shelf and available for drilling right now. 
   I would say further to my friend, if you wanted to drill tomorrow anywhere, there is not a drill available in the world. Now my presumption is there is not a drill available in the world that is not being used because they are pretty pricey items and you can make a pretty good profit providing those drills. My presumption is that people have not requested those drills be made available and have not asked to purchase them. As you heard me say, Exxon made $40 billion. These drills are pretty expensive items, and they bought no drills with that $40 billion. 
   So as a practical matter, tomorrow, if everything were available, there would be no drilling because there are no drills available. My presumption is that the oil companies believe there is sufficient supply available. There are no lines at any of the gas stations that I go to. I have not seen any gas lines. I am old enough, I know you're not, but I'm old enough to remember the lines in the 1970s. They were long. That was an artificially created shortage by OPEC, as you recall. But notwithstanding that, I don't see any lines. I don't see any shortage of product available. What I see is a healthy price at the pump. And in my opinion, when you get more supply, the price comes down. I think some people are pretty happy with the price. None of my consumers are happy with the price. None of the people who pull up to the pumps in my district are happy with the price, but I can't believe that the oil companies are unhappy about the price. I don't see them complaining about their high profits. 
   So when you say if we could drill in the deep water, I don't know what you mean by deep water. It could be more than 1,000 feet which is where we are drilling now in some places in the Gulf of Mexico. But we do have 33 million acres available on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico available for drilling right now. And if the drills were available and the inclination were available, I would hope that the companies would pursue, either the large companies or small companies. The problem with small companies is that it is a very expensive proposition, as the gentleman knows.

   Mr. HOYER. We agreed with your premise, and we offered a bill to have that happen, and it was Use It or Lose It which said we have 107 billion barrels identified, speculated to be available on presently held leases, a 14-year supply in the United States of America. And what we wanted to direct the administration to do was start leasing that land right now because we agreed with your premise that the psychological effect would be that those who have the petroleum and are frankly selling it very dear, and many of our consumers are being really hurt, we understand that, our premise was either by drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve now or drilling in the 68 million acres available in the lower 48, including 33 million in the gulf now, that it would have exactly the effect that you projected. 
   Unfortunately, we also believe that releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which in 1991 and two other years, I don't have the exact years, we have done it three times, including once under this administration after Hurricane Katrina, in 1991 price went down 33 percent. It went down less when SPR was released after Hurricane Katrina. 
   Our view is you are correct. Psychologically, that would have a real effect on the market. Unfortunately, we couldn't pass that. We wanted to pass it as quickly as possible. How do you pass something as quickly as possible? You put it on suspension and give it to the Senate. Unfortunately, large numbers on your side of the aisle determined that was not a policy that they wanted to pursue. So they had no psychological effect, which we thought would have been, as you do, a psychological effect and may well have had an immediate impact on pricing by the barrel, and hopefully then would be converted to price at the pump.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ON ANNIVERSARY OF CAPITOL POLICE DEATHS -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. The Speaker has just made an announcement about two of those who served our democracy and our country and who served this Capitol. Every morning when I come into work, I pass by a plaque honoring Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut on the spot where they were murdered 10 years ago this very day. 
   It's a quiet hallway now. Down the hall you can hear the sounds of visitors to the Capitol; a few feet away the work of the majority leader's office goes on every day. John Gibson lost his life in the hallway that is in my office that was then the office of the majority leader Tom DeLay. What a shock to think that that hallway could be filled with gunshots and blood, to know that our Capitol, the most sacred space in our democracy, could be filled with violence. But what a saving grace to know that every day we are surrounded by brave men and women who will stand in the way of violence even at the cost of their own lives. 
   Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut died in the defense of our democracy just as surely as those in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other trouble spots of the world. 
   Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut deserve every tribute they've been given: Lying in honor under the Capitol dome; yesterday's words dedicated to their memory; today's moment of silence at 3:40. But we know that what they did, every member of the Capitol Police and every law enforcement officer throughout our land stands ready to do as they rise in the morning and put on a badge, either on their uniform or in their wallet or on their hip, and they attach a gun, perhaps, as well, prepared to defend and keep the peace. 
   We honor Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut not because they were unique in their sacrifice, which, however, they were, but because their willingness to sacrifice was so typical, typical of all of the best in those who wear the badge. 
   Edmund Burke wrote that ``Good order is the foundation of all things.'' It is certainly the foundation of everything that happens in this building. Without peace and good order, democracy could not survive. 
   Let us thank those men and women who risk their lives to give us order, safety, freedom from fear, and let us keep their families in our thoughts today and every day. 
   God blesses America with men and women ready to defend our freedom, our country, and our Capitol. Without them, the work of this Capitol and the work of our democracy would not prevail. We thank their families, we remember them this day, and may God grant them continued peace.

   The schedule for the week of February 4 is attenuated, to some degree obviously, by the 22 States that have a primary on February 5. Both Democrats and Republicans obviously will be involved in those to one degree or another. Monday and Tuesday the House is not, therefore, in session.

Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Thursday and Friday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business this week. In addition, we will consider H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   That is the schedule. Of course, I will tell my friend that we obviously have a couple of bills that we passed today  that we want to see move as quickly as possible, and if we could move those next week, we would certainly try to do so.

So I am reluctant to give away Friday, given on this side we have worked so hard to get done in a relatively quick fashion, I think quick fashion, not relatively, on our stimulus package. So I do not want to speculate on giving that day away at this point in time, nor do I want to speculate that we will give the day away. If we do not have work to do, obviously we will not require Members to be here.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   He and I share that concern, of course. As I indicated, and he well knows, we passed a bill on November 16 of last year, which means that was 2 1/2 months ago that we passed a bill. We have been waiting for the Senate to pass a bill. They have two bills, as you know: one out of their Intelligence Committee, one out of the Judiciary Committee. They have been unable to reach compromise. Two days ago, they had votes on cloture and did not receive that, either for the extension or for essentially the Intelligence bill. 
   As a result, we are very frankly in, as you well know as well as anybody, we are waiting on the Senate to pass a bill so that either our bill, we can send that to the President; their bill, send it to conference, or whatever option. But we need them to take some action. We are hopeful they will take some action soon. 
   I met, along with other members of the leadership on our side of the aisle, just a short time ago, informed them that we had passed by vote an extension of 15 days, urged them to move as quickly as they could. The leader indicated to me that he was hopeful that they would be able to address that this week. I think he is going to be talking to the Republican leader to see what possibly could get 60 votes to move something to the floor and through consideration. But I am unable to tell you what we are going to do until such time as the Senate acts. As you and I have discussed, you have been there.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I do want to comment, because our perspectives are somewhat different on the risks that would be created by failure to act or not have an extension, so we would be operating, as you pointed out, under the old FISA statute. 
   Very frankly, the good news is that the backlog that confronted the court now no longer exists. 
   Secondly, as you know, under the old law, the 72-hour period in which the Government could take action and then get sanction of the court after the fact is in the law. 
   So I believe that second paragraph, while I don't disagree with his speculation, I disagree with his conclusion in the sense that I think that the Government, the NSA or another agency, could in fact act within that 72 hours and get approval from the FISA Court for its actions. And, as the gentleman knows, the FISA Court rarely, if ever, and I don't know of an incident off the top of my head where they have disapproved an action that was taken and stopped it at that point in time. 
   So, I think the risk is minimal, because I think the old law, while, yes, they have to go to the court, and very frankly, this is why it was created, to be a check and balance on what might be, and I don't allege that this is happening, but certainly it was a check on arbitrary and capricious action by those in the Government. I happen to think that check and balance is an appropriate one; although, under the statute we passed, we gave broader authority, blanket authority, as you know. 
   But we are hopeful, as you are, that the Senate will act, that we be able to go to conference. We need to deal with the immunity issue, which is the difference between the two Houses, although they haven't passed a bill, but the bill that passed out of the Intelligence Committee did give retroactive immunity. That is controversial. 
   And we have just got, as I told you, the documentation last Friday that we have been asking for an opportunity to review to determine, A, the justification for the action of the telecom companies and the actions for which immunity is being sought. We think that is appropriate for us to know before we act. 
   But in any event, I did inform, as I told you, the leader that we had acted, and indicated to him I hope that they would act as soon as possible so that we could resolve this in conference.

   Mr. HOYER. I would agree with that. I think we solved the technological problem in the bill we passed. Very frankly, the only problem that I think the administration would have with our bill which we passed through the House would be the immunity issue. 
   The technological issue I think is addressed by the blanket approval by the court. Although the court has to approve certain objects and processes, it does not, as you know, need to approve specific instances of intercepts or specific targets of intercept. 
   So, from that standpoint, I think our bill solved that problem. But our bill has not been enacted so the technological issue of where the communication now goes through a U.S. switch, that is the technological difference now, and then goes back out, that needs to be addressed. It was addressed in our legislation, but the legislation needs to pass.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Before the gentleman who spoke before me leaves, I just wanted to make sure that we correct the record. He said we might go back to the deficits that we had prior to 9/11. I will remind the gentleman that this President inherited a surplus and we had three surplus years preceding the fiscal year 2001, and in fact the Clinton administration ended up with a net surplus, the only President in our lifetimes to have done so. I know he misspoke and I knew what he meant, and I share his view on the deficits. 
   However, I am very supportive of this package because uniquely deficits I think are justified in the time when you have a crisis economically confronting you and you want to stimulate  the economy. That is in fact I think classic economics in many ways, and it is what we hear almost every economist telling us, from conservative economists to liberal economists and in between. 
   Mr. Speaker, for several years the American people have been confronting an economy that most working people are not being advantaged by. We were told that if we adopted an economic policy in the early part of this administration that that would turn our economy around, grow jobs, stimulate growth. In point of fact, of course, less than one-third of the number of jobs that were created from 1993 to 2001 have been created from 2001 to today, less than a third in the private sector, 6 million versus 20 million under Bill Clinton. 
   This prediction of economic well-being was not in fact true, and it is now abundantly clear that millions of hardworking American families are struggling and that the American economy needs a strong shot in the arm. 
   I want to congratulate my friend Hank Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury. I want to congratulate the Joint Economic Committee that provided good statistics, our Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee for the work they have done. I want to congratulate Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt for the leadership they have shown, and I certainly want to congratulate our Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, all of whom worked together tirelessly to try to come to agreement. And I want to congratulate Mr. Rangel and Mr. McCrery, who in a bipartisan way worked together to try to get us to where we are today. 
   I think this is good news for the American public, because we are going to vote in an overwhelmingly and bipartisan fashion to reach out to try to get this economy moving and help a lot of Americans. 
   The number of Americans living in poverty and the number of uninsured is up by 5 million and 7 million respectively. Job growth has been unimpressive. Foreclosures have hit record levels, and Americans all across this country are struggling with exploding gasoline prices, higher grocery bills, and increasing college and health care costs.     
   Thus, I am very pleased that Members on both sides of the aisle and the White House have come together in the spirit of bipartisanship and good faith to produce the economic stimulus package that we will have the opportunity to vote on today. 
   In particular, the Speaker, the minority leader, Mr. Boehner, as I said, and Treasury Secretary Paulson deserve great credit for their efforts. The Speaker clearly, as someone who has watched her work on this for the last 2 weeks, I can tell you, she was indefatigable and focused, as was Mr. Boehner. 
   In short, this stimulus will put money in the hands of hardworking Americans to give them the help they need and at the same time stimulate the economy. That is what economists tell us we ought to be doing. 
   Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told the New York Times last Friday about this stimulus package: ``It is a much-needed and very constructive step. It will provide some confidence, but policy-making will need to be on standby, because more may be needed.'' That is obviously a fact. We hope this will do the job, but we will be on alert to make sure that we do not recede further. 
   I am pleased that this stimulus package adhered to the principles that Democrats have stressed for weeks, that an economic stimulus package be timely, targeted, and temporary. That is not just an alliterative phrase that rolls from your mouth relatively easily. It is a premise on which we have based this package so it would be stimulus, so it would be temporary and not exacerbate long-term deficits, and would be targeted to those people who need it and will help stimulate the economy. 
   Democrats are particularly pleased that under this package 35 million working families who would not otherwise have been helped will receive tax relief. My friend who spoke before me spoke about transfer of wealth from one to the other. We treat, unfortunately, 50 percent of America who pays more FICA taxes than they do income taxes, 50 percent of working Americans pay more FICA tax than they do income tax, we treat them as if somehow they are not paying taxes. They pay property taxes, franchise taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes. They pay a lot of taxes, and they are hurting. This is a tight economy for them, and this bill added 35 million additional Americans, middle-income and lower-income working Americans, with help. They will help stimulate the economy. 
   This economic package also will expand financing opportunities for Americans in danger of losing their homes. I congratulate Mr. Frank for the extraordinary leadership he has shown on this issue. The mortgage crisis obviously is squeezing many, many Americans and putting them in danger. Too many have already lost their homes, and many are in danger of losing their homes. 
   It also gives that business stimulus that is a concurrent partner of this stimulus package, not only giving people the opportunity to purchase but giving people the opportunity to expand jobs, expand their businesses, and grow our economy. 
   I commend it to both sides. I thank both sides for working on this. My friend Charlie Rangel said during the course of these negotiations, he said that not only will the stimulus package through its economic impact give confidence to our country, but the fact that we have in a bipartisan way come together and concluded that we can work together in time of challenge will also give our citizens confidence. I think they will be pleased with the work we do this day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of this particular extension. I do not rise and did not rise in support of the underlying bill that we are extending. And I think the gentleman from Ohio raised some valid points, as the chairman thinks he raised valid points as well. 
   But the issue here is really one of allowing this body an opportunity to pass a bill that speaks to the constitutional issues that have been raised, as well as the substantive issues raised by Mr. Issa in what we all want to do: protect America and Americans. 
   Today the House is voting on a 15-day extension, nothing more, nothing less. Before we do that, I want to remind my colleagues that this body has already passed legislation to reauthorize FISA. 
   On November 15, 2 1/2 months ago, this body passed the RESTORE Act, a bill that modernizes the technologically outdated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, gives the intelligence community the authority to intercept critical foreign communications, and  protects our fundamental constitutional rights. 
   The bill was skillfully assembled by two of our best chairmen, John Conyers and Silvestre Reyes. Those chairmen join me today in support of this short-term extension for several reasons. First, despite the body's efforts over 2 1/2 months ago, the Senate has yet to complete its work on its own FISA legislation. This week they failed to get cloture on either alternative. We are going to await its bill and look forward to an undoubtedly challenging, but productive, conference. This will take some time. 
   Second, on the question of immunity, which the President has so highly touted, our committees have been asking for 8 months to see the legal documents pertaining to the President's terrorist surveillance program. And we have received 8 straight months of denials. The White House only offered this access last Friday. It is reasonable to conclude that for the committees to carry out its own responsibilities and constitutional duties, it needs some time to do that. 
   This afternoon, our Judiciary members will be read-in to the program, and only next week will they begin to digest the hefty stack of documents that, in turn, will help them make a judgment on what, if any, immunity is merited. My position has been that in order to give immunity, we need to know what we are giving immunity for and what the justification for the actions were. Again, we need time for this important review. This extension gives us that time. 
   Finally, let me say to my colleagues that even if we were unable to do this extension, and this is very important, even if we were unable to do this extension, February 1 were to come and go without any new legislation, no one should fall victim to those fear-mongers who suggest that our intelligence community could ``go dark.'' It would not. That is simply not the case. 
   The authorizations issued under the Protect America Act are in effect for up to one full year. So any requests that have been made and authorized up to this point in time from August on would be in effect at least through next July even if they had been authorized in August. The authorization issued under the Protect America Act will help protect us to that extent. 
   This means that all of the surveillance in effect today will remain in effect for least 6 more months. Even the administration's own Assistant Attorney General for National Security, Kenneth Wainstein, acknowledged this, saying that if the PAA were allowed to expire, intelligence officials would still be able to continue eavesdropping on already approved targets for another year.     
   In fact, out of an abundance of caution, last Thursday, when I announced the schedule for this week, I urged the administration, if it had any authorizations, it needed to proceed on that for fear that we might not extend this act. I think we'll do that today, so that fear will not be realized. 
   For those new threats that develop after February 1, let us not forget that the underlying statute still gives the administration 3 days' worth of emergency authority to immediately begin surveillance without going to the Court, no lesser court. The Court, by the way, now has no backlog. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It is simply much like a CR, which is not a judgment on the merits of a particular appropriation bill one way or the other. It is simply a judgment that the congressional will ought to be done, that we ought to make our judgment based upon a conference report, with the Senate having passed a bill, which it has been unable yet to do. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this bill, not because you support the underlying bill, but because you share with me and with Mr. Conyers and Mr. Kucinich and Mr. Issa and all the others who have dealt with this bill a concern about protecting our country and protecting our Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HONORING THE LIFE OF GWEN BRITT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, today, along with my colleagues from the Maryland delegation, I want to take this opportunity to honor the life and legacy of a beloved figure from our State who passed into God's hands on January 12, State Senator Gwen Britt. 
   Gwen lived a full, wonderful life. She was a wife, a mother, a grandmother, legislator, a civil rights leader and a friend. But she also was an inspiration, a woman of deep faith and conviction, with an unshakable commitment to achieving justice, equality and fairness in our Nation. 
   The former Gwendolyn Greene grew up in northeast Washington at a time when our Nation was failing to live up to its promise of equal opportunity. She knew the racial divisions that existed in this segregated city, in our schools, in our stores, even in our parks. 
   And so in 1960, as an 18-year-old student activist of Howard University, Gwen and members of the District of Columbia's non-violent action group decided to take a stand. She walked into the Montgomery County park, then segregated, and tried to climb aboard a horse on a merry-go-round; something that all of us today would think is normal for any American, particularly any young American. 
   Yet as the Washington Post reported, the students' actions, as innocent and as unprovocative as they seem today, sparked 5 days of protests, and Gwen and other activists were arrested for trespassing, spat upon and harassed by counter-demonstrators. 
   This experience left Gwen undeterred. In fact, it fortified her already strong character, as well as her determination to do what she knew in her mind and in her heart was right. 
   Gwen took to heart Dr. King's words, ``Make a career of humanity, and you will make a greater person of yourself, a greater Nation of your country and a finer world to live in.'' So said Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   Gwen Britt took that to heart. So she did make our Nation a finer place in which to live. That experience in Glen Echo Park was only the beginning of Gwen's civil rights work. 
   She left Howard University to join the Freedom Riders who challenged Jim Crow laws in the South and in our transportation system. And in 1961, she spent 40 days in a Mississippi jail for sitting in a whites-only train station. 
   John Lewis was one of Gwen Britt's friends. John Lewis, a hero, a Member of this body. More people know about John Lewis because of his extraordinary leadership, but Gwen Britt was there by his side on Freedom Rides. 
   It is a testament to Gwen Britt's humility and quiet confidence that she never advertised her proud and very important civil rights work. 
   As Maryland State Delegate Victor Ramirez of Prince George's County recently said, ``She talked about the civil rights movement if you brought it up, but she was one of those people who spoke softly but carried a big stick.'' 
   Since her passing, words of tribute have poured forth. Governor Martin O'Malley noted, ``She was a leader long before her years in the Senate.'' How true that is. Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown called her a ``principled, active and fair-minded voice for equality.'' 
   And Prince George's County executive Jack Johnson said she was ``one of the most honest people you ever met.'' And on The Washington Post's Web site, people who knew Gwen posted words of sympathy and tribute. 
   For example, Katey Boerner, the executive director of the Glen Echo Park Partnership for Arts and Culture, has said some, almost 50 years after the demonstration that occurred to open up Glen Echo's amusements to people of all colors, ``We plan to include her story of bravery and shepherding change in our upcoming civil rights exhibition here at the park. We can now treasure her memory for the amazing story that was her life and the impact that she had on so many through her leadership.'' 
   Not surprisingly, Gwen Britt also made an important impact in the State Senate after she was elected in 2002. She rose to the position of deputy majority leader in 2007 and became an unwavering voice for those who have felt the cold chill of exclusion.  
   Carl Snowden, the director of civil rights in the State Attorney General's Office in Maryland, said this, ``She saw other groups that have historically been locked out of the system: women, Latinos, gays. And she felt all of those left out had to have a place at the table.'' 
   Gwen Britt was a woman of extraordinary character and courage, and all those she touched during her 66 years on this earth, her beloved family; her sons, who spoke so eloquently at her funeral; her husband, who himself was a Freedom Rider, who himself was a great warrior and advocate for justice in the civil rights movement. 
   The State of Maryland and our Nation have been enriched by her actions and her leadership, as a young person, as a State Senator, as a neighbor, as a friend. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I want to extend my condolences to Gwen's husband of 46 years, Travis; her two sons, Travis, Jr., and John; and all of her family and many friends. 
   We will miss her dearly, although we are comforted that her life and legacy will endure and that she now is at rest in God's hands. 
   Gwen will live as so many before, in the hearts and minds of those she impressed, of those she motivated, of those she enriched. We will miss Senator Gwen Britt, but our State, our community and our Nation have been made better by her life.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is not a sham. And I would say to the leader, as he knows, he had an opportunity to vote on a DRILL Bill, Drill Responsibly in Currently Leased Land. He voted against that bill. A number of people in this Chamber voted against that bill. What that said is let's produce more product here in America. 
   What this bill says is, let's make sure that prices aren't being driven up artificially. No more, no less. 
   This summer the Democratic majority in this body has produced bill after bill after bill to address record oil prices that have exploded on this administration's watch. $1.46 to over $4 during the 7 1/2 years of this administration. 
   Every one of us here, Democrats and Republicans, acknowledge that curbing our Nation's addiction to foreign oil, which is how President Bush himself characterized the situation, requires short-term solutions, and long-term strategy. And thus, this body has considered a bill that would increase production of more bio fuels here at home, and a second to incentivize the use of nonfood commodities to meet that goal. The chairman has been a leader in that effort, Chairman Peterson, along with Mr. Goodlatte. Appreciate both of their leadership. 
   We have considered a bill to hold OPEC accountable for price fixing, bills to address retail and wholesale price gouging, a bill to crack down on energy market manipulation, a bill to increase supply by suspending shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and then another one to release oil from the Reserve; a bill to expedite the production of 10.6 billion barrels of Alaskan oil, to keep all oil produced in Alaska as well in the United States, and encourage diligent development of existing leases on Federal lands. 
   I tell my friends on the Republican side, when I use that phrase, ``diligent development'' that is lifted from their 2005 bill. We said ``use it or lose it,'' which was essentially the same thing, and they voted against it. 
   We have also considered a bill to bring down commuter rail and bus fares, and a bill to provide tax credits for renewable and alternative energy. 
   None of these bills, none of these bills, alone is a panacea. We all recognize that. And we all recognize that there will be no immediate solution. 
   But all of them, together, constitute a vital step towards confronting our oil dependency and our energy independence. 
   Many of these Democratic energy initiatives have passed the House. Some have become law. However, unfortunately, some have been blocked by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who seem to have one answer and one answer only to America's energy crisis, drill in places that are not now authorized. 
   I want to remind my colleagues there are currently some 88 million acres available for drilling. Experts tell us there are 107 billion barrels of oil available under those acres. We use, that would be a 14 1/2 year supply. And what we have said is, pursue that. Drill. Produce that energy here in America for our use here in America. 
   Unfortunately, that bill was rejected by the overwhelming majority of the Republican Party. It is ironic, but Democrats generally agree with our Republican friends that increasing domestic production of our energy sources is critical. Both sides agree that we ought to get more energy from America. We agree that we ought to get more oil from America. 
   And unfortunately, when some of my Republican colleagues speak, they say, Democrats don't want to drill. That is absolutely not true, false, a misrepresentation said, in my opinion, for political purposes to accomplish an objective for politics, not for policy or for energy independence. 
   We must drill more, but we believe the oil companies which today have 68 million acres of land to drill on that is leased and open for drilling, must drill there first. Let's see if it is available there. If it is not, well perhaps let's look at alternatives. 
   In total, there are 311 million acres available for drilling, including 20 million in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. If they are serious about domestic production, they should be bringing these resources to market that we have leased in the public trust to produce oil and gas for the American people.     
   Today, I'm hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle will again come together and support this legislation. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson. Chairman Peterson has had some of the biggest challenges in this year in the Congress of the United States, last year as well. The farm bill went a long period of time. The farm bill--which had significant energy components in it--and this bill, the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act. This bill is designed to control the market speculation that is artificially inflating the price of gas. 
   Among other things, this bill builds upon what we did in the farm bill, and closes overseas loopholes that allow speculation to go on unregulated; increases market transparency with strict reporting standards for traders; sets position limits to prevent individual speculators from dominating the market; and strengthens the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is operating at its lowest ever staffing levels. 
   I tell my friends on both sides of the aisle if you take the referee off the field, the players are going to take an unfair advantage. You take the referees off the field, I guarantee the split ends are going to start down the field before the ball is hiked because he wants to get that advantage. 
   We've taken the referees off the field. This bill tries to put the referees back on the field. Even as trading volumes have increased 8,000 times since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was first established--8,000 times--we have decreased their number of employees, their number of referees, if you will. Expert economists agree that unchecked, unregulated speculation is inflating the oil bubble and costing American consumers billions at the pump. 
   I urge my colleagues not for political reasons but for reasons of giving relief to our constituents, men and women trying to support their families who drive up to the pump and say to themselves, ``I can't afford this. I have got  to spend it but I can't afford it,'' let's put a stop to out-of-control speculation in the oil markets that is fueling this run-up in the cost of petroleum and harming consumers and the economy. Let's come together, as we have before, and pass this important energy legislation. 
   I have said something about Mr. Peterson. I want to say something about Mr. Goodlatte. I want to congratulate him for working together with Mr. Peterson to come up with a bill that can have bipartisan support, a bill which tries to effect reasonable, measured policy. I congratulate them both on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. It is not the only answer, but it is one of the pieces of the puzzle that we need to solve for all of our people.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. I appreciate what my very close and dear friend and one of the best Members of this Congress, in my opinion, Maurice Hinchey, has just said. Like many Americans, he thinks and many Americans think this doesn't go far enough. From the perspectives of perhaps everybody in the Chamber, it doesn't go far enough towards the position they would like to take. It is not a perfect resolution, but then again none are. 
   What it does do, however, is try to say that if we are going to make decisions in the House of Representatives on an issue so critically important to our country and to the welfare of our troops that are in harm's way that we have the advice or at least the opinion of the administration as to how actions ought to be taken. Therefore, if there are those of us who believe, as I know my friend from New York does and some others, that we ought to redeploy, change course, redirect our efforts, the best advice and counsel that we could get on how to do that ought to be from our military leaders. 
   And what this resolution simply says is, and I agree with my friend from Connecticut that we can say, hopefully, with a somewhat unified voice, perhaps not unanimous but somewhat unified voice, if we were to take the position that the gentleman and I shared when we voted for redeployment within a timeframe, tell us how that would be done. Tell us how it would be done consistent with the safety of our troops. Tell us how it would be done consistent with trying to leave behind as stable a government or community as possible in Iraq. Tell us how it could be done to enhance the possibility of political reconciliation in Iraq. 
   The surge has not accomplished that. If the surge was intended to bring political reconciliation, General Petraeus said it had not. Ambassador Crocker said it had not. 
   So I congratulate and thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner), the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), and others who have joined in this effort to try to come to a step that will be a positive step. I think this is one of those steps. 
   And I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whatever your particular position is, that we ought to have in front of us a considered, considerate plan of how we would accomplish an objective if this House, hopefully, could summon the votes to seek that objective and mandate that objective. 
   So I thank Mr. Skelton for bringing this to the floor. I thank him for his leadership on this issue, and I would urge all of my colleagues, understanding full well the concerns that have been expressed so ably by the gentleman from New York, my friend (Mr. Hinchey), that this legislation will send a strong message to many, including the administration, that we want to have the information that we need to make the best decisions that we can make. We may differ on what those decisions ought to be. 
   But, hopefully, what we will not differ on is that if we can have the best information and advice as to how to obtain an objective, then the legislation we pass will be better, will provide for the safety of our troops and provide, hopefully, for the success of a redeployment within a timeframe that many of us believe is absolutely essential.

   We will have a suspension vote at the end of the consideration of the Waters bill. The votes will be rolled until tomorrow, and so that there will be no more votes tonight. There will be a suspension vote, but the minority has indicated that there will not be a vote on that suspension bill. 
   We will then, tomorrow, finish the votes on the Waters bill, and then go to the Franks housing bill and complete that tomorrow. My expectation is we are probably talking somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 o'clock tomorrow, assuming that things are nice and pleasant and peaceful.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I understand that there is substantial angst among the minority. I empathize with that angst. I've been there. 
   Having said that, I do not empathize with the abuse of process. And because  I do not empathize with the abuse of process, as I have said before, I am going to ask the Speaker to limit the time in which voting is allowed to that which is provided for in the rules. You did that; we're now going to do it. 
   Somebody said, ``About time.'' I agree with you. Abuse of process is when, and everybody knows this could be done. On our side in the minority we could have kept open for 2 hours with having every 30 seconds somebody come down the aisle. We all know that's possible. I've known that was possible for some period of time. We try to accommodate people who want to change their vote. We try to accommodate people who want to vote. We try to accommodate people who are late. 
   The problem with accommodating people who are late, if we make it in order in effect, not because of the rules but because of the comity of the House, to allow what just happened, we can, you're correct, in effect do a filibuster by vote changing. We don't have filibusters in the House. They have it in the Senate. I don't think the Senate works particularly well. 
   You can have your motions. I haven't said anything. Our Members haven't said anything. You're certainly entitled to that. But what just happened, as I said, in my opinion, is an abuse of the Chair's forbearance. The Chair has the responsibility to determine when the vote is concluded. 
   The vote changing on a motion to adjourn, I know that probably all of you did polls on that and focus groups on whether or not you should vote ``aye'' or ``nay'' on that vote and that led to your changing your vote one way or the other, sometimes maybe twice because you were having difficulty deciding. 
   But I just want to let everybody know that while we cannot nor are we going to preclude you from doing your motions to adjourn, what just happened is not appropriate for the House, for either side, to simply use a device of changing votes, of voting late, of lining up in the aisle and coming down every 30 seconds or so with a ``one more vote.'' That, in my opinion, is not appropriate for the House to pursue. 
   Mr. Gingrich sent out a letter, as we have said before, said he was going to call votes 15 minutes and 2 minutes later. You've all heard from Mr. Gingrich lately. He has a lot of advice and counsel. I don't always follow it. But on this, he made the point that I'm making, that we have now had, I don't know, 20, 25 motions to adjourn in which we voted on, reconsiderations to be voted on. Nobody has said anything about that. 
   But I want to tell my friend, the minority leader, that, as I have said before, my inclination at this point in time will be to ask the presiding officer to limit the votes to the 17 minutes, the 15 minutes that is provided and 2 minutes which have been historically accorded. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. HOYER. As I indicated at the outset, I understand your feelings. I said angst, but I understand your feelings. My point is that I understand while you have been making motions to adjourn and making your points, you've made it every time you've stood up, I have made the point that I remember voting on omnibus appropriation bills numerous times, 4 months, 5 months after the appropriations process should have been concluded, long after the year began, which were omnibus bills which we could not change. So we understood that that was, we didn't think, fair. 
   We understood that we sat here for an hour and 45 minutes while we were winning a vote, and no vote ever changed during an hour and 45 minutes, and the vote was not closed down until, in fact, you changed votes on your side and we lost. We understood that. We didn't like that. We thought that was unfair. I didn't think it was against the rules. I've said that. But I thought it was unfair. 
   All I am saying to my friend, the minority leader, and to my friends on the minority side, that what just occurred is not an acceptable, in our opinion--my opinion, forget about our opinion, I haven't talked to anybody else--in my opinion, way for us to operate the House. The motions, yes, but simply changing votes for the purpose of delay could take an hour, could take 2 hours depending upon how many times people wanted to change. 
   Mr. Gingrich, we don't hold to it, we understand that, but he said 15 minutes plus 2. I have said that before and some people cheered. Fifteen minutes plus 2, or 5 minutes plus 2 if it's a 5-minute vote, is what we have set as the norm and the comity and the fairness to individuals to exercise their deliberative judgment.

We're slowing down the business of the House, and that's allowable, but we're not going to allow the business of the House to be stopped by, we believe, conduct inconsistent with the rules.

   Mr. HOYER. I will tell my friend, the first action we had on appropriation bills was of course when we passed all of our appropriation bills before we left for the August break. We now hope to have action on the remaining appropriation bills. We expect those to be included in an omnibus appropriation bill. Obviously, we have considered all of them. They essentially have been conferenced, notwithstanding the fact that the other body did not pass through the Senate five of their bills, as you know, but they did in fact pass them out of subcommittee. So we had products to conference with. 
   Both the House and the Senate have been working together to get them in a place where they could be considered, and it would be my expectation that we would consider an omnibus appropriation bill Tuesday night after we come back. I would hope to be able to pass such a bill on Tuesday. Again, that is being worked on between the House and the Senate. There have been discussions, as you know, with the administration as well trying to reach agreement so that we can ensure that the Government certainly doesn't shut down.     
   The CR expires on the 14th of next week. We would hope that we can pass an omnibus appropriation before that.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Obey is not here, and I think the answer to that question is ``yes,'' but you would know better than I. I am sure you would hear complaints if that were not the case, and perhaps you have heard complaints. 
   Frankly, as you know, and you and I have discussed this experience by the House before under both parties, because of the lateness of the Senate's actions, we are not in a position where we had all of the bills passed. Furthermore, there was not an inclination on some of the bills to go to the conference. Thirdly, we have been facing, as you know, a veto threat from the President on all of the bills except the Veterans MILCON bill and perhaps Homeland Security. Defense was signed, as you know. Notwithstanding the fact that the MILCON bill is very substantially above the President's request, he said he would sign that one, but bills like the Labor-Health bill were vetoed, so we have to consider that one again. 
   Mr. Obey has had a meeting with Mr. Nussle, as you know. It has been reported in the paper. That meeting was to try to figure out whether they could come to agreement. That meeting was not dispositive over that issue. Others have had meetings, including myself. We are hopeful to get to a place where everyone will not get everything that they want, but hopefully we will have agreement. I can't guarantee that. 
   The answer to your question, as I told you at the outset, I don't have specific answers to. My presumption is, however, the staffs have been talking to one another.

Obviously he is required, the Department of Defense is required under contract agreements that if there is not funding at a certain point in time, for them to send notice, not because they necessarily anticipate that there will be a necessity to have RIFs, but because under the agreement, when they contemplate running out of money, which would be sometime in February, 60 days before that, they have to send out a notice. 
   My expectation is that the Secretary will be sending us a letter. But I think the Secretary's expectation, and I think the letter may say this, his expectation is, pursuant to our conversations, that will not be necessary nor does anybody contemplate that being done. And I certainly want to say to any and all employees who are listening, that is not going to happen.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. 
   I am very hopeful and we are working very hard, as I know Mr. Obey is and others, and I know Senator Reid is as well, trying to reach agreement with the President. 
   Let me say respectfully that the discretionary spending that we have provided for is less a percentage of the GDP in terms of the spending of our national income than any of the bills that were passed from 2002 to 2006. We believe the differences are relatively small between the executive and the legislative branches. 
   We are prepared, as you have undoubtedly read and, as a matter of fact, you and I have discussed, to make some accommodations with the President, as is appropriate, to try to negotiate those. 
   What we are not prepared to do is simply have the President say, ``Look, this is what I have determined you can do.'' He can veto, we understand that, but we don't think that the proper place for the Congress of the United States under article I of the Constitution, which gives us the authority and puts in the Congress of the United States, the Senate and the House, the responsibility to make policy and appropriate funds for the priorities that we deem to be appropriate for our national security and general welfare, we don't think that it is appropriate to simply be given a number that we must meet. That is not what the Founding Fathers contemplated. As you well know, the budget is a relatively recent advent in terms of the President's authority over the budget. 
   Having said that, we want to work with the President. We think that the differences are very small. We think that they can be bridged hopefully relatively easily, which is why we hope by next week we can accomplish both of the issues you raise.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that question. We believe very, very strongly, as you know, that the alternative minimum tax was never, ever meant to apply to some of the people it may well be applied to this tax year. We have passed legislation to prevent that. In that legislation, as the gentleman knows, was also tax cuts for millions of people on property taxes, on other taxes, tax relief for teachers who buy things for their classroom, in effect, business expenses for making sure that our kids are learning. 
   The Senate, as you know, tried to bring that bill, not that bill but the chairman of the Finance Committee today made a unanimous consent to place the alternative minimum tax relief bill on the floor of the United States Senate without paying for it and it was objected to, as you know, as you probably know, by a Republican Member of the Senate because there was a refusal, apparently not an allowed amendment on the flat tax. We think that is unfortunate. 
   In answer to your question, we hope the AMT, in fact, is passed by the Senate. We hope that it is paid for. We have committed ourselves to paying for things that we spend money on so our children don't have to pay for them. 
   But we are going to be working very hard next week, I want to assure the gentleman, to make sure that the AMT is, in fact, addressed so that the 23 million people who are at risk of a tax increase and were never intended to be, as both sides agree, do not have that reality come April 15.

   Mr. HOYER. As you know, we passed a bill earlier this year, some months ago, which not only dealt with children's health insurance but it also dealt with reimbursement to doctors, medical providers who will be confronting on January 1 of this year a 10 percent decrease in reimbursement. Many of them will not continue to serve Medicare patients. We think that is a great problem. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate refused to go to conference on that bill. We did have meetings on our SCHIP bill. Our SCHIP bill, our children's health bill, was a part of the larger bill dealing with Medicare during rural health, dealing with ensuring that nobody was disadvantaged by any of the pay-fors in our bill, but the Senate would not go to conference on that. The meetings that resulted essentially resulted in taking the Senate bill on children's health insurance. 
   As you know, the Senate had indicated they were going to address the Medicare reimbursement issue which we had already addressed. Unfortunately, it is my understanding that yesterday they decided they either could not or were not going to do that. I talked to Mr. Rangel just a few minutes ago about that issue. We are going to be talking about that a little later today as to how we might address that. We think, again, that is a critical need for us to address. But I can't tell the gentleman exactly how that is going to be addressed because I don't know what ability we have to work with the Senate on this particular issue, but it needs to be addressed.

   Mr. HOYER. Of course my friend could help me solve that problem very easily. I just need 10 or 12 votes; and you are such an excellent whip, I'm sure you could get those votes for me and we could cover those 4 million children. But if you don't give me those 10 votes, or 15, that we need, we have no intention of leaving here without presenting for the floor, which we hope will pass the Senate as well, an extension of the existing law. 
   In addition to the extension of the existing law, I'm sure you've talked to Republican Governors and Democratic Governors. I've talked to Democratic Governors just yesterday. All of them are very concerned. Missouri, as you well know, has a shortfall. A number of other States have a shortfall, including my own, so there will be need to, if we're going to simply extend, to also fund the shortfall, or children will be off the program that are currently on the program. 
   In addition to that, as you well know, a very controversial regulation was issued by the administration capping or requiring a 90 percent coverage of those under 200 percent or you can't participate further in the program, can't expand the program. No State, as I understand it, meets that obligation, so that we're also working on that. 
   But the answer to your question is, we are certainly planning for, if we cannot get, we hope to be able to get, frankly, in the near future, in the next few days, hopefully, we've worked very, very hard in trying to meet some of the concerns that some of your Members have had. 
   As you know, you and I and your leader had an opportunity to meet. Mr. Boehner indicated he thought there was a significant number of Republicans that would like to vote for the bill. But we got, as you know, 45 Republicans who did vote for the bill. 
   We have had extraordinary meetings, and I think it's worth telling the body. Mr. Dingell and myself, as well as Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley and Mr. Hatch and Mr. Rockefeller, and from time to time, Mr. Barton and Mr. Deal and others, Mr. Whip, literally spent about 50 hours over the last  month in meetings trying to come to a place where we could reach agreement. Obviously, we're not there in terms of sufficient numbers to think that we can, or are ready to, introduce a new bill. That would be our preference, to introduce a bill that, after these long discussions, that would enjoy hopefully 60, 70, 80 Members, which is the number your leader used as possible to vote for such legislation and move that through the Senate and send it to the President. That would be our hope.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that question. As the gentleman knows, and I've been involved in this business for a long time, four decades about, and whether it was in the State Senate, which had a constitutional ending date, or in the House of Representatives, it's very difficult to predict the last days of a session. 
   Now, I will tell you that the Speaker and I are working around the clock, almost literally, to ensure that we can adjourn this first session of the Congress of the United States on the 14th. We had hoped the 13th, but we're letting Members know that the 14th, that's only 4 days from now. We've just gone through some pretty heavy lifting in terms of the appropriation bills, in terms of the AMT, in terms of SCHIP, in terms of Iraq and in terms of other matters that we need to address before we leave here. But we think we can do it, and it is our intention to do it. 
   But, obviously, there are things that are pending that we cannot leave without doing, so that if we cannot get that done in that time frame, we will have to see where we go from there. 
   But I want to make it very, very clear to everybody that the Speaker, Senator Reid, and I have talked; and we are all very focused on the 14th being the day that we adjourn. The following week is the week before Christmas. We believe that individuals need to be home. I need to do shopping and decorating because all my family's coming to my house from some parts of the country, so I need to be home. And I'm sure every other Member shares that view. 
   So all I can tell my friend, and he knows this as well as I do, that the unpredictability of the next 4 legislative days is such that I can't make any guarantees, other than we are doing everything we can to get the business that we've just discussed done. We may have some very late nights on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; but we are hopeful that we will get this done and not have to ask Members to come back the week before Christmas.

Not only that, as my friend knows, because he's from the State of our distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, we were able to go to conference today, which has been somewhat contentious for a few days. We expect that conference to be on the floor early next week. So we are moving ahead.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend, the dean of the House, John Dingell of the State of Michigan, for yielding. I also thank him for his extraordinary leadership for over half a century, his father in an extended period before that, a distinguished career of service to this country and focus on the strength and growth of this country, on the health of our people, and of the opportunities for our workers. John Dingell is a giant with whom we serve. John Dingell is a giant of a leader in the Congress of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will remember one of the most solemn occasions in our Nation's history, the 66th anniversary of a ``date which will live in infamy,'' the day in which our Nation was attacked by an enemy that we now count as an ally. Let us hope, and I believe that many years from now, this day, December 6, 2007, will be remembered by future generations as the date upon which the New Direction 110th Congress took a historic step in moving our Nation toward real energy independence and casting off the bonds of dependence that threaten America's national, economic, and environmental security. 
   The bipartisan compromise legislation before us, the Energy Independence and Security Act, is nothing less, Mr. Speaker, than our generation's declaration of independence from foreign sources of petroleum. In particular, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Dingell, Chairman Rangel, Chairman Gordon, and so many other Chairs of committees for the extraordinary work and effort that has made this day possible, which they put forward. 
   I am pleased that this legislation incorporates some of the ideas in the Progress Act, legislation that I have worked on with Chairman Dingell and many of our other committee Chairs. This legislation of course, like all legislation, is not perfect. However, when we pass this bill, we will be voting to strengthen our national security, lower energy costs, grow our economy, and create new jobs and, as well, begin to reduce global warming. 
   Among other things, this legislation takes groundbreaking steps, Mr. Speaker, to increase the efficiency of our vehicles, raising fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 for new cars and trucks, the first increase in fuel economy standards since 1975. This important step would not have been possible without the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and the leadership of John Dingell. I thank them both for their efforts. 
   This provision alone will save American families an estimated $700 to $1,000 per year at the pump and reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day in 2020. This single step will reduce  by one-half what we currently import from the Persian Gulf. This legislation also makes a historic commitment to American-grown biofuels, including incentives to boost the production of biofuels and the number of flex fuel and other alternative vehicles, and establishing a tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, it requires that 15 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources; strengthens energy efficiency for a wide range of products, appliances, lighting and buildings, to reduce energy costs to consumers; and repeals tax breaks for oil companies and invests that money in clean renewable energy and American technologies. 
   The oil companies of course are making extraordinary profits to give them incentive to continue to provide us with the incentive that we need. But they do not need additional subsidies from this Congress. It is telling that this legislation is supported by a broad coalition of environmental, business, labor, and farm groups, as well as State and local officials. 
   For example, my friend and our former colleague, Dave McCurdy, president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, stated: ``We believe this tough, national fuel economy bill will be good for both consumers and energy security.'' I want to thank Congressman McCurdy for his work on this bill, and I want to thank John Dingell, again, without whom this compromise could not have been reached. Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy said: ``If it becomes law, this deal will mark the most important step toward improving U.S. oil security in a generation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, our national character was challenged by an unprovoked attack at Pearl Harbor 66 years ago. We rose to the occasion then; and through our citizens' will, intelligence and ingenuity, we prevailed, and we were strengthened. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, we face a daunting but far different challenge, a challenge that compels us to confront and conquer our Nation's addiction to petroleum. This legislation will help to do so. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, not for partisan objectives or partisan reasons, but for the independence of our Nation, for the national security of our people, for the economy of our workers, and for the environment of our children, I urge my colleagues to vote for this very historic and important bill. Vote to cast off the chains of dependency that hold us back today which threaten our economic and environmental security. Vote, my colleagues, to put America on a path to achieve energy independence. 
   Before I close, Mr. Speaker, let me once again say that no one in this body with whom I have ever served has focused on an issue so tenaciously, so effectively, so energetically as the Speaker of this House. When we pass this bill, it will be a testimony to her leadership and to her commitment. 
   I urge my colleagues, step with history for tomorrow and our children. Vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank him for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Drill Responsibly In Leased Lands. The assertion was that Democrats are not for drilling. This gives lie to that assertion. This says, as we have been saying, there are 88 million acres available for drilling right now. Those acres are subject to lawsuit, my friend says. Any acreage would be subject to lawsuits. This acreage is subject to the availability of drills. Black and Decker or otherwise. What an absurd, I say to my friend, assertion. There are no drills available currently to drill in new lands here or other places. 
   The minority leader, I presume, is going to be speaking in some few minutes. He said this: ``They're,'' meaning the Democrats, ``offering excuses designed to get people thinking about something other than drilling. They worship at the altar of radical environmentalists.'' 
   This is, of course, the crowd that said global warming didn't exist until just a few months ago. This is the crowd that has been in charge of the White House for the last 7 1/2 years. 
   The gentleman from New Mexico says, Gee whiz, let's bring the price of gasoline down. 
   They had an energy policy which they came up with under Dick Cheney. Some people say it failed. I'm not sure the oil companies thought it failed. It was $1.46 when they brought up the policy. It's now $4 at the pump. The oil companies are making the biggest profits they've made in their history. 
   The assertion Mr. Boehner made is, as I said again, that we worship at the altar of radical environmentalists. Let me quote one of those radical environmentalists: ``I have been an oilman my whole life, but this is one emergency we can't drill our way out of.'' That radical environmentalist's name is T. Boone Pickens, and as he said earlier in that statement, ``I have been an oilman all my life.'' He understands very well what can and cannot be done. 
   This bill says let's drill. Let's get American product to American consumers and try to bring down prices. We've also asked the SPR be released. Not all of it. Maintain most of it. Why? To bring prices down, to free the oil that Americans have bought for their use and to bring prices down. With Americans being pummeled by $4-a-gallon gas, it's high time that America did just that. With the passage of the DRILL bill, America will move decisively to increase its domestic oil production. 
   Now, ladies and gentlemen of the House, isn't it an ironic happenstance that the day before we put this bill on the floor, 24 hours before we put this bill on the floor and say let's drill in the National Petroleum Reserve, isn't it ironic that the White House announces they're going to do just that? My, my, my. What an awful idea we had--right up until the time 24 hours ago when the administration decided they would do it. 
   I'm glad they've done it. And if our actions spurred their action, so be it. And we're going to take credit. Because they've been in office 7 1/2 years. They took it 24 hours ago. What was the reaction of the oil industry? They were happy. 
   Now, nobody is saying if you have land over here you have got to use it before you get land over here. What we're saying is you can't inventory land. You can't inventory acreage. You can't be a huge, rich oil company and want no competition and therefore inventory land. We're saying that. Yes, we are. We think that makes good sense for the American public. 
   Today we call their bluff, I think. Yesterday they saw us. And they said, we'll drill here.     
   Mr. Speaker, 68 million acres of American oil-producing land are sitting leased, available, and idle. There is even more land available for drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or NPR-A, which we're dealing with today. 
   Combined, we are talking about an area the size of--and all my colleagues listening to this debate and anybody else who is listening to it, they ought to know currently what is available--the area of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and most of my own State, Maryland. That entire area is currently available for drilling, for getting American product to Americans. 
   Let's help the oil companies get that oil out of the ground and get it flowing to the Americans who need it. The DRILL bill speeds up the leasing process in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. It ensures that Alaskan oil will fill American gas tanks. 
   That is, I presume, why, when they knew this bill was coming to the floor, yesterday the administration said they were going to have this land leased. Yesterday. The American public is pretty smart. There's nobody I think that's hearing my voice, wherever they are, doubts that if they just did it yesterday, after being in office for 7 1/2 years, then maybe, maybe, maybe there was a relationship between Chairman Rahall bringing this bill to the floor and the action yesterday to try to preclude the credit for doing what we think is good policy. Hopefully, we're all going to vote for good policy today and vote for this bill. 
   It calls upon the President to speed up the completion of the Alaskan oil and gas pipelines. That's what it does because we need those lines to get that oil and product, natural gas and oil, to market and to Americans. 
   ``Drill on the leases you have, or let somebody else do it. But don't just sit on them while Americans are paying $4 a gallon. Use it or lose it.'' 
   The gentleman says, well, they're not just sitting there; they're afraid of lawsuits. We may all be afraid of lawsuits. We may never drive our car because we're afraid of an accident or a lawsuit. That's not what they're in the business for, and very frankly, in terms of fear, when you're making the largest profit for a product, you go look for more, unless of course you want to keep the price high and supply down. 
   Why is our plan better than the Republicans'? One, it means more oil. The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is already approved for drilling, has an estimated 10.6 billion barrels of oil. ANWR has 10.4 billion. And the information we have is the oil companies aren't too interested in drilling there. 
   Two, our plan means more oil, faster. Unlike ANWR and protected coastal areas, NPR-A plus the 68 million leased acres elsewhere are currently approved for production. 
   And get this, right now, today, available pipelines reach to within 5 miles of the National Petroleum Reserve, and if the pipelines are completed soon, we will speed production up even more. 
   Third, I see no reason to give even more handouts of public land to companies enjoying record profits and billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies unless they are using that which they currently have. Inventorying land, inventorying acreage, inventorying possible oil supplies is not what the American people want. 
   What the American people want is they want production. They want performance. They want prices to go down. That's why we say let's start on the land they already have. Let them eat their vegetables before they think about dessert.

   What we are saying is, we have available now. You don't have to do the seismic. Presumably, that's what you've been doing on the 68 million acres. If you haven't been doing it, then let's release it and give it to somebody else who will because, as you point out, the seismics have not been done in other areas. They have been done here, presumably by people who already had available the leases.

   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, what the American people want, they want to know why we're simply arguing that we ought to have more available when we haven't used what we now have available. That's what the American people want to know, and that's what this bill says, and that's what we're arguing. 
   Your argument, with all due respect, is not necessarily wrong, but it certainly is not a replacement for what we have provided here. Let's move ahead on that which is already authorized, and then we can certainly authorize more to see whether or not more is available. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have lived through 7 1/2 years of Republican energy policy: plans put forth by Vice President Cheney, a bill passed in 2005--let me stress, a bill passed in 2005. Oil was approximately $2. Their plan was passed, passed through this House, passed through the Senate, sent to the President, he signed it. Three years later, the price of gasoline has doubled. It is a failed policy. We need a new policy. We need to make sure we use the land we have. 
   And that's why it's so ironic that just yesterday, I tell my friend from Louisiana, isn't it ironic that just yesterday the President made an announcement the day before this bill was going to be announced that he wanted, in October, to allow the leases to move forward on this land which we're talking about? He apparently agrees with the objectives of this bill. 
   With this responsible domestic production bill we can start today. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Let's use the resources that are available right now on leased lands. Drill responsibly in these leased lands. Let's keep America's oil in America. Vote for the DRILL bill. Let's make America more energy independent. 
   And before I close, let me reiterate what T. Boone Pickens said because the nub of this debate is not just about more oil. The nub of this debate and the nub of the failure in the past of perhaps all of us has been that we have not honestly said to the American public, the only way we will solve this problem, the only way we will become energy independent is to ensure a vigorous program of pursuing renewables so that we will have energy for the future, not just for today; for our children, not just for ourselves. 
   Vote for this DRILL bill. It is a responsible way forward.

But we are still very interested in the proposition, as you know, that that legislation spoke to, and that is providing an accelerated exploration, discovery and exploitation of our energy here in the United States, drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, building a line to get not only the oil, but also natural gas down to the lower 48, and to ensure that companies aren't inventorying property on which either they or others might be producing energy for America. 
   So we believe the provisions of that bill are important. And I would think that we're going to be looking at ways in which we may move forward on that. But it has not been decided.

   I was having a discussion with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee during the last vote. I asked him about his discussions with Mr. Lewis to try to facilitate the consideration of appropriation bills. My belief is that they hadn't made as much progress as he had hoped to make, but with relation to the other bills, I will just reiterate what I have said, that I continue to talk to Mr. Obey about my hope that we can find a way to move appropriation bills to the floor if that is possible. But we have not gotten any scheduled at this point. We do intend to move certainly the Defense bill. The Speaker was accurate on that.

   I want to congratulate GEORGE MILLER, to start out with, as the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. GEORGE MILLER has been, throughout my career, all 26 years that I have been here, he and I have served together. He has been one of the most courageous, emphatic and faithful speakers on behalf of working Americans that we have in this House. 
   I want to thank my friend, ROB ANDREWS, who has been an indefatigable advocate of making sure that working Americans had opportunities in our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation, the Employee Free Choice Act, is simply about establishing fairness in the workplace and providing America's workers with a free choice to bargain for better wages, benefits and work conditions. 
   I think that is absolutely essential if we are going to stop this growing disparity between the very wealthy and the haves and the increasingly have-nots. 
   America is a great and strong country because of its middle class. That is shrinking. That is a challenge to our country. This is an effort to address that. 
   The fact of the matter is the current system for forming labor unions is badly broken and undemocratic. Far too often, employers intimidate, harass, coerce or even fire workers who support a union. 
   To address this blatant unfairness, this legislation simply allows workers to form a union if a majority signs cards saying they want a union. Under current law, workers may use the majority sign-up process only if their employer agrees.  
   In contrast, the Employee Free Choice Act would leave this choice, whether to use the National Labor Relations Board election process or majority sign-up, with the employees, not the employer. 
   It is simply a red herring to claim that the legislation abolishes the NLRB election process. Although I will say as an aside that the delays, the underfunding, the rule complication essentially abolishes in some respects the NLRB's intent. In any event, it does not abolish the NLRB. The NLRB process is still available if workers choose it. 
   We all know what is really going on here today. It is no secret. The administration and many in the Republican Party have a long-standing, deep-seated animosity toward the organized labor movement, despite the fact that working men and women are the backbone of our economy and have built this country into what it is today. 
   Now, I am a strong proponent of the free market system. I am a strong proponent of business and those who grow businesses and create jobs. I say all over this country, the Democratic Party is the party of workers. If we are going to be the party of workers, we have to be the party of employers, but we need to make sure there is a balance. 
   We are not the representatives of either. What we are representatives of is the American people. We need to make sure that it is a fair opportunity. 
   Over the last 6 years, the administration, among other things, has dropped an ergonomic safety standard, tried to eliminate Davis-Bacon protections, denied collective bargaining rights to Federal employees. 800,000 Federal employees, we have denied bargaining rights, 800,000 Federal employees. Now, there are about 1.8, 1.9 million civilian Federal employees, and we just reached in and said, oh, no, if you are a DOD, Defense Department employee or a Homeland Security employee, you cannot have collective bargaining rights. 
   I asked the Office of Personnel Management to cite me one instance in the last half a century where collective bargaining rights have put at risk any national security issue. They could not name one in the last half century, not one. I have the gentleman there pointing at himself; I can name you one. Well, this administration's Office of Personnel Management could not. 
   It is no surprise today that they would oppose this legislation, which seeks to give workers a meaningful choice in selecting their representation and stiffen penalties for discrimination against workers who support a union. 
   Madam Chairman, hardworking families today are increasingly squeezed by stagnant incomes and the rising costs of education, health care, transportation, food and housing, and there is not an employee who is on even footing as an individual. I say that. Perhaps that is not correct. 
   I was with Alonzo Mourning just the other day. He is almost 7 feet tall. He may be on equal footing because his employer needs him very, very, very badly, and there may be some few like that, but if you are 6 foot 2 you may not be in that position. 
   American workers deserve to be fairly compensated for the dedication, loyalty and skill they bring to their jobs, and this legislation will help restore fairness to the workplace. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to be pro-labor or pro-business but to be pro-worker, pro-middle class, pro-growing America. Vote for this bill.

   Mr. HOYER. I really don't. But I want to make two observations. First of all, we are 100 percent of the number of open rules that we had in the last Congress where we had one. We have now had two. 
   With respect to open rules, I know that, in talking to Mr. Frank, he intends to bring some bills to the floor under an open rule. And we have been urging Members to have, if not open rules, structured rules. As you know, we have had some structured rules contemplated as well, offering amendments, allowing, obviously, amendments from your side as well as from our side.     
   And we want to make sure that we have the opportunity to consider views from both sides of the aisle. So we hope to do that. I cannot represent to you how many open rules there are going to be. 
   And I understand what the gentleman is saying about the fact that these bills were supported by large numbers, and in the latter case by all Members, but that doesn't mean that they were necessarily perfect. And amendments were offered, as the gentleman knows, and we took 7 hours, I believe, on the one that was of very little controversy 2 1/2 or 3 weeks ago.

   Mr. HOYER. We, of course, on this side, call it the Hastert rule, because after you criticized it roundly for a long period of time, you adopted it. 
   Let me say seriously; there is no alternative to increasing the debt limit. Both sides pretend that there is. There is not. The administration, if the debt limit is to be extended, is going to request a level to which they would like it increased. Frankly, your side of the aisle, you were not here at the time, I tell my friend, but regularly voted against increasing the debt limit, almost unanimously, in large numbers. It was obviously an effort to try to make it appear that our Members alone were responsible for raising the debt. That was not an honest representation, in my opinion, because we passed bills with Republican votes which resulted in that, whether they were appropriation bills, tax bills, whatever economic bills they were. 
   So in answer to your question let me say this: We obviously adopted your rules, as you recall, at the beginning of this session. So rule XXVII was a rule that you had in place at the time that you were in the majority. We adopted your rules, and we are pursuing that under those rules.

   Mr. HOYER. I think my friend is correct on that. And that is why I started my remarks with really the Congress, if it is going to be responsible on either side, Republican or Democrat, has a responsibility to set the debt limit so that the United States of America meets its obligations, whether it is to our own people on Social Security, whether it is meeting a payment on our debt to foreign countries, whether it is simply funding our government and keeping services to our veterans and everybody else that we vote to give services to, we need to do that. 
   I agree with you. And I would hope at some point in time, frankly, both parties can get together and say look, this is something that we need to do. And frankly, whether it is the Gephardt rule or the Hastert rule, essentially that is what both sides were doing so that it could not be, I don't want to say demagogue, but misrepresented as agreeing that we ought to have that debt level. 
   Now, I think almost everybody disagrees with the rate at which we have been going into debt, and the fact that we have borrowed 94 percent of our operating funds that we have borrowed from foreign governments over the last 6 years. I think there is probably nobody that thinks that is a good policy. 
   But the underlying policies that drive that are really what is at issue.  But I agree with the premise of the gentleman that both sides of the aisle have tried to hold the other responsible for the debt. On our side, frankly, we disagreed with the fiscal policies that were being pursued, which, as you know, we think took us from a $5.6 trillion surplus to now a $3 trillion deficit in the last 6 years. We tried to make that point through that vote. But the gentleman's basic premise I think is absolutely correct. There really isn't an option of when we get to the debt limit, we either ought to stop spending money, reduce very substantially our entitlement obligations, or we have no alternative but to raise the debt.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First of all, I want to say, Mr. Whip, we congratulate you on your reelection as the whip. I have an affection for whips, as you know, the position, and I am personally advantaged by our close working relationship and respect for one another. And I think the American public hopefully will be advantaged by that. I think this House will be advantaged by that, and I look forward to working with my good friend, ROY BLUNT. 
   In addition, all of us on our side appreciated the very gracious remarks of your leader, Mr. Boehner, when introducing Speaker Pelosi and passing the gavel to her. We know that is a difficult role. It was a difficult role for Mr. Gephardt when in 1995 he had that responsibility, and it was a difficult role for Ms. Pelosi on the two occasions she had to do it. Your leader was extraordinarily gracious and positive in that role, and we appreciate that and we want you to know that. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour and at noon for legislative business. Under the suspension calendar, we will consider a resolution mourning the passing of President Gerald Ford. That resolution, I would tell the Members, the principal sponsor of which is Mr. VERN EHLERS, our colleague on your side of the aisle, who represents the district which was so ably and effectively represented by President Ford for such a long period of time, a quarter of a century. 
   Mr. Speaker, we will also consider H.R. 1, a bill to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and a resolution to establish a select intelligence oversight panel. 
   I will tell Mr. Blunt we expect votes to be not before 3 to 4 p.m. We had originally, as you know, thought we might come in Monday. There was a schedule conflict and we wanted to accommodate that. We are glad we did. We will try to hold votes until 3 or 4, but west coast Members will have a difficult time getting back so they ought to plan on being here on Monday unless they have an important engagement they have to attend. 
   On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider H.R. 2, a bill to increase the minimum wage. 
   On Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider H.R. 3, a bill regarding stem cell research. 
   And on Friday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider H.R. 4, a bill regarding the Medicare prescription drug program. We expect the last votes to be hopefully no later than 2 p.m. 
   The practice, as you know, will be that we will come in at 6:30 on Mondays and adjourn no later than 2 p.m. on the day of adjournment. Many times that will be Friday, sometimes it will be Thursday. We understand the need for Members to get out. If it is on Thursday, the expectation is we may go a little later than that, but that will be generally the practice we will try to pursue.

   We believe almost all of those items have been broadly discussed, considered, not only in the election process of approximately 6 months in duration or longer, but also, for instance, the 9/11 Commission report which we will consider in the first order of business next week, vetted by the bipartisan commission, the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Governor Kean and co-chaired by Mr. Hamilton, so that the gentleman's assumption is correct. 
   But that does not mean, I want to make it very clear, that does not mean that when we get through those items which essentially were the items focused on during the course of the election, that we will not hew to what we believe to be a positive step forward in including both sides in deliberations, in conference reports, in committees and on the floor.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the whip for that observation. That was one of the important recommendations that the commission made. Those recommendations were made, of course, over a year ago, I think. I am not sure of the exact date, but over a year ago. Your side did not implement that particular recommendation. 
   The gentleman is correct, we have not implemented the recommendation as recommended. What Speaker Pelosi has done, she has discussed with Leader Boehner what I would refer to as a hybrid of that, not perfect from I think the Commission standpoint, but meeting in spirit what the Commission wanted to do. What the Commission wanted to do was empower the Intelligence Committee with a participation in the appropriations process, which the Commission perceived would give them a greater relevance and greater influence. 
   We agree with that; so as you know, we have suggested and are implementing a hybrid where the members of the Intelligence Committee and members of the Defense Appropriations Committee will meet and work together to accomplish that objective. We hope that will move towards effecting what the Commission wanted to achieve, while, at the same time, maintaining the jurisdictional issues which, as you know, in this body can become very, very acutely debated.

   In the spirit of comity, and I know if Maryland were playing, I would want to be accommodated and I want to accommodate my friend, Mr. Boehner. So we have done that; but it has put us in a position where we thought we would have come back Monday. That is not the case. We will have votes as late as possible, but we cannot guarantee. That leaves us a shorter period of time to do the work we have scheduled. So I cannot guarantee, but we are going to try to keep it for your Members' sake, for our Members' sake, and we understand the west coast travel issue, as late as we can in the day, but cannot guarantee later than 3:30 or 4 o'clock.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   He observes that I said we hope to have it on the floor. I want to reiterate that I hoped each one of those weeks that we would have it on the floor, and I hope that we will have it on the floor next week. 
   I would say to my friend that I hope we have a bill on the floor next week, pass it through the House and pass it through the Senate and that the President will sign that bill. Obviously, one of the reasons that we have not gotten the bill on the floor as quickly as I had hoped is that there have been very, very substantial discussions between the House and the Senate, between the House and the White House, and the Senate and the White House about what their thoughts are with respect to various aspects of the supplemental bill and what they would or would not consider a signable bill. 
   So I think there have been extensive discussions on that. I am hopeful that  when we finally pass something to the President he will sign it and we will have that bill done. As the gentleman indicated, we are aware of the fact that it is timely that we pass this bill certainly within the next 2 weeks. And when I say pass it, not just pass it but have it signed by the President so we have a law in effect that gives the President and the Department of Defense the funds they need to continue the deployment that currently exists. That does not adopt the policy of the appropriateness of that, but it does recognize the reality of the fact that we have men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.

   The fact is that we now have that funding passed from the Senate in the supplemental to us and we are trying to resolve as you know the differences. But there is a desire to get that bill done in a timely fashion so that the problems that you portray, which I believe are accurate, do not occur.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As I said last week, with respect to more drilling in various parts of the country, whether it is in Alaska, in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge or on the Outer Continental Shelf, I would like to reiterate the information I referred to last week, but before I do that let me say that we are very supportive of any legislation that will lead this country towards energy independence within the framework of what we think is necessary and needed. Now I say it in this context. I support and I think we support on this side a diversified clean energy portfolio. We think that is critically important for our country. 
   In the area of supporting energy supply, I hope the Senate will return the tax extender bill which invests in alternative energy sources which can be put online so we can be more energy independent and not dependent upon the producers of petroleum, many of whom are not friendly to us, and others of whom are not as reliable as we would like. 
   I have listened for some period of time in the last few weeks that all we need to do to solve this problem is more drilling. We don't believe that is the case. In fact, as I said to the gentleman last week, we have nearly a whole refinery's worth of capacity idle right now.     
   What I mean by that, Mr. Whip, is that our refineries were operating, at the end of last week, at 89 percent capacity. That is the lowest operational capacity of refineries in our country in the last 10 years at this time of year. So our refineries still have another 8 to 9 percent capacity. 8 to 9 percent is a very significant portion. 
   Now, we've introduced two bills today to make oil companies use their existing leases. Before we go to new leases, before we go to the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge or the Outer Continental Shelf, which is very controversial on both sides of the aisle, we believe that oil and gas companies should use the present leases they have. They hold nearly 68 million acres of Federal land and waters on which they are not producing oil and gas. These 68 million acres of leased but currently inactive land and waters could produce, I tell my friend, an additional 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day. So that when we talk about looking for new spots to drill, we first ought to look at those spots. Vast acreage, millions of acres have already been authorized. 
   If we took those actions, I tell my friend, the information I have is that it would nearly double total U.S. oil production and increase domestic national gas production by 75 percent. That is on existing leaseholds. 
   It would also cut U.S. oil imports by more than a third, if all we did was use existing leaseholds. It would be more than six times the estimated peak production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   In other words, using existing leases that have already been authorized, would produce six times what the projections are, and the most optimistic projections are for the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. 
   Let me say that we also introduced two bills today to look at and study the investments in oil futures, in petroleum futures. We're very concerned that that is having an impact on price, not because of supply and demand, but because of speculation. Mr. Dingell and Mr. Barton, as you know, have cosponsored legislation, and I've cosponsored it myself with them. 
   So I'm hopeful that we will move ahead vigorously, as I know the gentleman from Missouri wants to do, to see what can be done to make our country more energy efficient, to utilize the energy sources which are already authorized. 
   I would say one additional thing in terms of refineries. There's been some discussion about refineries. There's been one application for a new refinery in the last 30 years. One application. It was approved. That refinery has not been built, notwithstanding the fact that the application was approved. 
   And obviously, with refinery capacity not being at the capacity it's been at in the last 10 years, it would seem that a new refinery was not built because the oil companies made a determination that it was not needed because, at this critical time when demand is so high, they're not operating at peak performance. 
   So let me just reiterate that we all want to work together to try to have our country be energy independent. We think that's important for our national security, our economic security. And indeed, we think that going to alternative energies is critically important for the health of our global climate. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   My friend mentioned the Outer Continental Shelf, and I agree with him. But the facts I have are this. Four times more natural gas is available in areas already open to drilling. Let me reiterate that. In areas already approved and open for drilling, four times more natural gas is available than in OCS waters protected by the moratorium. 
   In other words, that which is protected has only 25 percent perceived to be available than does the already approved available Outer Continental Shelf areas. So if we started vigorously pursuing exploration and drilling in those areas, we'd get 75 percent more than we get now. 
   In fact, the figure is that we are using only 18 percent of the 7,740 active leases currently available on the Outer Continental Shelf, only 1,655 are in production; so that when we talk about the problem is that the Democrats are not allowing us to drill and explore and to recover resources that are in our Outer Continental Shelf or on our lower 48, that is not, I think, accurate. I think it's not accurate because of the extraordinarily high percentage of currently approved leaseholds that are not being utilized in this very day. 
   Now, I'm sure that the oil companies, very frankly, want to increase supply and see prices come down. I say that somewhat with tongue in cheek. If perhaps we were finding more supply, utilizing those leaseholds, perhaps the price would not be quite as high and the profits wouldn't be either. 
   But I will tell you that Americans are, at $4 a gallon, seeing the companies that are selling them oil receiving extraordinarily high profits. God bless them for getting profits. They have invested, they've worked hard. They put their capital at risk. I'm for that. 
   But at the same time, when they are failing to use leaseholds that would bring more supply, that would presumably then bring down the price, I think the American public have a right to ask, why are we only using 18 percent of the currently available leaseholds on the Outer Continental Shelf and about one-quarter or a little less than one-quarter of what's available on the mainland? 
   I yield back to my friend.

   Mr. HOYER. My friend, at the beginning of his last comments, said ``on public lands.'' I want to make it very clear that the implication, perhaps that we're not allowing that on public lands, there are, as I said, 80 percent of the already authorized spots on public land not being utilized today; so that this is not a question of where we have not authorized drilling. We're for that. We want to find more product. 
   What we are saying is that we have now got the majority of authorized spots being unutilized. Now, why that is so, when the product is getting the highest price it's ever gotten, which ought to be incentive, in and of itself, to look for new product and to explore and to drill and to get new product to the market, which would then bring the price down. 
   I hope that nobody is controlling supply simply to escalate price. We know that when demand goes up and supply is constrained, that prices inevitably rise. The American public is paying the price for that. Great profits are being made. But it is adversely affecting our economy and our families. And we share your view that we want to address this problem. 
   But I want to say, we talk about today. Unfortunately, for too long, I'm old enough to have experienced the gas lines of the late seventies where you waited hours to get gasoline in your car. Hopefully that won't reoccur. 
   But had we, Democrats and Republicans, Americans all, focused in a disciplined way on looking for, developing more efficient automobiles, more efficient refrigerators and other electric utilities, focused on conservation, focused on alternative sources of energy, we would be far ahead of the game.     
   In the final analysis, we cannot get distracted, in my opinion. We need to go down both paths, making sure today we have the most efficient process possible but that tomorrow we're energy independent, because in the final analysis, that will be the only way in which we will continue to keep our economy moving, our national security intact, and our environment clean and healthy.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his leadership, and I thank Mr. Hoekstra for his excellent idea. 
   As you will recall on the floor, I indicated we would adopt it immediately on the spot if he would agree to a unanimous consent request to strike the ``promptly'' and insert ``forthwith'' so that we would not, in adopting Mr. Hoekstra's good idea, kill the bill. He rejected that idea, at which point in time I made the representation that we will introduce that bill as a suspension and bring it to the floor next week. 
   I tell my friend, that is exactly what we have done. Mr. Hoekstra made a determination, very frankly from my perspective, that he was more interested in trying to politically put some people on the hook for a vote on a proposition that he knew and we knew they were for but they did not want to kill the Intelligence bill in the process. 
   Now people will say it doesn't kill the bill, that is accurate, but it clearly delays the bill. There was no reason to delay the bill because had Mr. Hoekstra agreed, contrary to the advice he was receiving, to yes, I will strike ``promptly,'' insert ``forthwith'' so that my proposition can be adopted immediately, which would have been the case.     
   So I think any criticism of sinking to a new low, very frankly, if politics had not been played with this proposition, it would be on the authorization bill to the Senate as we speak. This proposition, which Mr. Hoekstra came up with, as you recall I said on the floor, we think this is a good idea. Proving that we thought it was a good idea, we have brought it to the floor today for passage. 
   Mr. Hoekstra, who I now see is on the floor, made a determination he did not want to adopt, in the way that we suggested, his proposition last week. So we are going to adopt it this week. 
   I would hope that all of us would vote for it, because, as I told Mr. Hoekstra then and believe now, Mr. Hoekstra's idea was a good idea. It is a good idea. We are going to pass it, hopefully, tomorrow morning by an overwhelming majority vote. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, for those of us who have served in this body for some period of time, all of us know that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) has been as focused on health care for all Americans as anybody who's served in this body, with the sole exception, perhaps, of his father. For over half a century, the Dingells have focused on making sure that Americans in the richest land on the face of the Earth had access to health care. 
   I want to congratulate my friend, Mr. Dingell, and I want to congratulate his partner, Charlie Rangel, one of the senior Members of this House, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who has worked collaboratively with Jim McCrery, and I want to congratulate Jim McCrery; I'll congratulate him again while he's listening; who has worked, I think, positively with the chairman, and I thank him for that. 
   I rise in support of this legislation. Today the Members of this body must answer this fundamental question: Will you stand with millions of American children who, through no fault of their own, but they live in families of limited means, have no health insurance? Or will you stand with the few, including at least now President Bush, although I hope he changes his mind, who are ideologically opposed to this legislation, and thus being willing to leave millions of American children stranded without the health insurance coverage they need and that they deserve? 
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this: we must not sacrifice the health of our children on the altar of a conservative ideology. We must pass this bill. 
   The fact is, President Bush himself stated on the campaign trail in 2004, in fact, it was at the Republican Convention, and I would hope all my Republican colleagues would listen to the President's quote, if you haven't already seen it and read it. He said this as he addressed the American people asking them for their vote for a second term, which they gave him. He said this: ``In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs.'' 
   President Bush said that as he appealed to the American public for their support for a second term, that he would aggressively pursue a program of adding millions of children, eligible but not included, in the health insurance program. 
   ``We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' That is what President Bush said to the American public from the convention floor in 2004. We, tonight, are going to give him the opportunity to fulfill that promise to the American public. 
   Unfortunately, the President is threatening to renege on his campaign promise and to veto this legislation. Let's be clear: this fiscally responsible legislation will ensure that some 10 million children will receive health insurance coverage. That's approximately 4 million more than are covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program today. And so what we consider today is not young Master Snyder, who was on this floor, or Gemma Frost, with whom we met earlier today. Gemma Frost will be covered. Luckily, Master Snyder's father is covered, as all of us are, under a Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan to which our employer contributes. Gemma Frost was not so lucky. 
   The truth is, those 4 million additional children are eligible under existing guidelines, not new guidelines that we've created. They are the children that were eligible that President Bush talked about in 2004 that he wanted to vigorously assume inclusion in the program. Millions, he referred to. 
   This legislation does not change eligibility guidelines. It simply strengthens CHIP's financing, increases coverage for low-income children, and improves the quality of care they will receive. 
   In contrast, under the President's proposal, and I hope my friends would put this fact in juxtaposition to the President's representation in 2004 on the floor of the national convention that you held as your party, his proposal would decrease, by 800,000 children, the numbers that would be covered under CHIP in the future. Now, that's included in the 4 million, so actually it's a net 4 million difference between the proposals. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we ought not to retreat from our children's health. We ought not to retreat from working families concerned about the inclusion of their children. 
   And I suggest to my friends concerned about cost, we ought not to give the answer, they can go to the emergency room. Why not? Because all of us know that is the most expensive intervention in the health care system in America. And so not only do we put our children at risk, but we compound our costs. 
   It's no wonder, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation has received strong support from Members of both sides of the aisle, as well as a wide range of health care providers, including private insurers, doctors and hospitals. 
   For example, Senator Hatch has already been quoted, but it bears repeating. He said: ``We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this.'' 
   Don't take that bad advice. Let us join hands; let us be together on this issue. You voted on a prescription drug program far more expensive than this one, and unpaid for. 
   Senator Grassley stated: ``The President's understanding of our bill is wrong.'' 
   That's the former chairman of the Finance Committee, Republican, senior Member of the United States Senate. He says, ``The President's wrong.'' He urges him, he says, ``I urge him to reconsider his veto message.'' 
   Every one of us, as we vote tonight, can send a strong message that will perhaps help him to reconsider that position. 
   Now, let me say, those who complain that this bill will induce people with private insurance to drop their coverage and enroll in the CHIP program are simply grasping at straws. Why do I say that? The fact is, even America's health insurance lobbying group supports this bill. 
   Finally, let me mention two other points. First, I am very pleased that this legislation includes a comprehensive dental benefit that will give low-income children the dental care they need and will provide States with flexibility in how they provide such care. 
   Why do I bring that up? 
   Dental care is important. A 12-year-old child who lived approximately 8 miles from this Chamber, Deamonte Driver was his name, he was 12 years of age. He had three siblings. He got a toothache. His mother did not have coverage and tried to get coverage, tried to get dental care, and she could not get dental care, and that toothache became an infection in the brain, and Deamonte Driver died just months ago, just 9 or 10 miles from where we stand. That is one of the reasons, one of the  four million reasons that I stand here to say that we need to pass this legislation. 
   Secondly, I'm very disappointed that the Senate Republicans insisted that we remove the House-passed provision on Medicare, as well as our provision that would have allowed legal immigrants who pay taxes to be eligible. 
   Why is that of concern? 
   Because my granddaughter, 5 years of age, who just started kindergarten, she may sit next to one of those children in her kindergarten class, and that child who is legally in the United States may get sick. But if that child cannot access health care and sits next to my granddaughter, my granddaughter is at risk. 
   We want everybody in this country to be healthy so that the rest of us can be assured that we operate in a healthy environment. That is why we want that provision. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this House, Speaker Pelosi was right: I don't believe there's a person in this House that doesn't care about their own children, about their neighbor's children, and about the children of our country. All of us care. We need to come together, however, and see how that care can be transformed into meaningful, tangible help. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a rare and wonderful opportunity tonight to do the right thing, to put aside partisanship, to elevate the practical, responsible, and moral solution above the ideological. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's seize this opportunity. Let's do the right thing. Let's stand with America's children. Let us pass this historic legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend from Washington State for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the last 7 1/2 years, the President and members of his administration have claimed that the American economy is doing just fine. And in December, President Bush said, ``The economy is pretty good. There are definitely some storm clouds and concerns, but the underpinning is good.'' 
   But the reality, of course, that we have seen is far different, particularly for American workers. 
   Just last Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate jumped one-half of 1 percent, from 5 percent to 5.5 percent. Now to some of us, perhaps that is simply a statistic. For some families, it is a crisis. This is the largest 1-month increase in unemployment in 22 years, or said a different way, until the 6th year of the Reagan administration. 
   Our economy has actually lost jobs each of the last 5 months, a loss of some 325,000 jobs since the first of the year. In fact, this administration has created about 3.6 million jobs over the last 7 1/2 years, as opposed to 20 million plus jobs under the Clinton administration, or under Clinton, an average of 236,000 new jobs per month, and under this administration approximately 40,000 new jobs per month. And you need 100,000 to stay even. That is why this bill is on the floor today. 
   Over the last 12 months, the number of unemployed Americans has increased by 1.6 million, from nearly 6.9 million in May of 2007 to nearly 8.5 million in May of this year. That is 8.5 million of our fellow citizens who don't have a job, who are not sure how they are going to pay for their housing, their rent, their food, their medicine and the clothing for their children. That is what we are talking about today. We are talking about those 8.5 million people who are our constituents, Americans who need our help. And that is what this vote is today at this point in time. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, 1.5 million of those workers are what we call euphemistically ``long-term unemployed,'' which means they have been jobless for more than 6 months. I don't know how many of you have had the opportunity to see ``Pursuit of Happyness,'' spelled h-a-p-p-y. It is a wonderful movie about a now very successful African American and his little boy who found themselves homeless with no money. And they went to the homeless shelter, and they couldn't get in. Those are the people we are talking about. That is what we are voting on this day, as to whether or not we are going to reach out to those people and try to lift them up and give them a helping hand, not a handout, but a helping hand. These are people who were employed, who were working, and through no fault of their own, they lost  their jobs. Because if it is the fault of their own, by the way, they don't get unemployment. 
   All the while, working Americans have been confronted with decreasing household incomes, exploding gas and food prices and escalating health care costs. Why then, given this squeeze on hardworking middle-class American families, does the President threaten to veto a common-sense, compassionate response, the temporary extension of unemployment benefits? 
   Here is the kicker. Listen to me. There are 200,000 more long-term jobless Americans today, right now, as we debate this bill, 200,000 more Americans who are on long-term jobless status than when President Bush last signed an extension of unemployment benefits into law. In other words, the status today in America is that there are 200,000 more people who need our help than when President Bush last signed an extension of long-term unemployment. 
   How can we then say it is not time to act today, to reach out our hand today, to say that the Congress of the United States feels your pain, hears your cry, and responds? There is no justification for the President's threatened veto on this much-needed legislation, Mr. Speaker. This bill is not only a sign of compassion and a demonstration of our values, but it is also a fast-acting form of economic stimulus. 
   Who says so? Conservative economists say so. It will help lift up our floundering economy. It will simply provide up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every State to workers exhausting regular unemployment compensation. And in States with higher levels of unemployment, an additional 13 weeks is available on top. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is vital. It is vital for workers and their families who are struggling to make ends meet in this poorly performing economy. It is not charity. It is our obligation and responsibility. It is a recognition that under the administration, the American worker has been forced to contend with job loss, decreasing incomes, exploding gas costs, food and health care costs, and unprecedented foreclosure rates. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is the right thing to do at the right time, at the right place. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this is not a Republican or Democratic issue, this is not a liberal or conservative issue. This is an issue of saying, there are people in trouble. We hear their cry. We respond to help. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, we call this the people's House. Help the people this day.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) for yielding.  
   I note that my good friend, Frank Wolf, is on the floor as well. I don't know that there is any Member of this body with whom I have worked more closely on an objective than Frank Wolf and I worked, particularly during the 1980s and early 1990s on this America's subway. I am glad that he is on the floor, and I thank Mr. Davis for his leadership and Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Moran. We have all worked very hard on that. Mr. Oberstar, we thank you as well for your assistance. 
   Bill Lehman was from Florida. Bill Lehman was chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, and Bill Lehman used to call this America's subway. 
   I tell the gentlelady from North Carolina, I don't know whether she has left, and I appreciate her remarks, but it is America's subway. It's in the Nation's Capital, yet 18 million to 22 million Americans from outside this region ride it as they visit their Nation's Capital. 
   The employees who come into this city work for our Nation, not for the State of Virginia and the State of Maryland or even for the District of Columbia but for our Nation and all of our taxpayers. 
   That's why it's America's subway, and that's why we invested significantly in its construction. That's why it is necessary and appropriate for us to invest in its maintenance and continuing quality. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I have a statement that I will put in the Record without going through all of the specifics that have been discussed. 
   I want to say also to the gentlelady, yes, this is an amendment, but, unlike most amendments, this amendment has already gotten the imprimatur of the overwhelming numbers in this House and passed on suspension when Mr. Davis offered it, when the now minority, but the then Republican majority, was in charge of the Congress, with Democrats strongly supporting Mr. Davis' bill. 
   I think Democrats will strongly support Mr. Davis' bill. I would hope Republicans would strongly support Mr. Davis' bill to accommodate their taxpayers, their workers and their Nation's Capital. 
   I want to again thank Mr. Davis for his leadership on this issue. I want to thank Mr. Wolf for his partnership for me for now into our third decade of working on this issue. 
   We can be proud of this Metro system. It is one of the best in the world, not just in our country. Every American can be proud of their subway. 
   I urge very strong support across the aisle. This is not a partisan issue. As I say, Mr. Wolf and I worked in lockstep for over a decade in ensuring that this subway was completed. Mr. Moran joined us some time later, and that was working at the local level as the mayor of his city. Mr. Davis, as county executive of his county, we worked together. I want to also thank the ranking member very much for his leadership and his facilitating this amendment coming forward on the floor.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Davis-Van Hollen-Hoyer amendment to the Amtrak reauthorization. This critical amendment will help ensure that the ``Nation's subway'' continues to operate in a safe, reliable and effective manner. 
   The Washington Metro Area Transit Authority--which was established in 1967--has been faced with a severely aging infrastructure. In recent years, it has led to widespread maintenance problems, increased delays, and threats to passenger safety. 
   In fact, Metro officials recently estimated that the system needs approximately $489 million in urgent and outstanding infrastructure repair work. 
   This amendment--which is based on legislation which overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives in the last Congress--would authorize $1.5 billion in Federal funding for capital repairs and maintenance in the Metro System. This funding would be collectively matched by dedicated funds from Maryland, DC, and Virginia. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues question the appropriateness of a Federal investment in this system. In my view, this perspective is shortsighted and does not take into consideration the Federal Government's long history in the development of and reliance upon the Metro. 
   In 1960, the Congress passed and President Eisenhower signed into law the legislation to provide for the development of a regional rail system for the Nation's Capital. Congress has since passed Metro authorization bills in 1965, 1969, 1979, and 1990. The Federal Government provided $6.2 billion of the approximately $10 billion needed to construct the original 103-mile system. 
   Metro is critical to the Federal Government's evacuation plans of the Nation's Capital and we experienced Metro's essential role during the city's evacuation on September 11th, 2001. 
   Nearly half of Metro's riders during peak ridership are Federal employees and more than 50 Federal agencies are located adjacent to Metro stations. 
   Millions of tourists from across the country visit our Nation's Capital each year and many of these visitors use the Metro system to traverse the city while visiting our Nation's museums, monuments and historic landmarks. 
   Clearly, the Federal Government and the American people depend on Metro and there is a clear Federal interest in ensuring that the system is able to operate efficiently and effectively. 
   Unfortunately, just this week we were reminded of Metro's importance and its deteriorating infrastructure when an orange line train derailed in Northern Virginia. This mishap, where thankfully no one was injured, delayed the evening commute for many Federal employees and reinforced the need for this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, we must act now to preserve this critical national asset and ensure that the Nation's capital continues to have a safe, reliable, and effective transit system for the Federal workforce and its visitors. I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting for this important amendment.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to say to Mr. Kildee, those of you who have been our pages and have made such an extraordinary contribution to this institution, Mr. Kildee has been on the Page Board for almost, as a matter of fact, maybe as long as I've been a Member of Congress, which is longer than, by almost a factor of two, not quite, all of you have been alive. 
   You come to this institution with a great responsibility, in my opinion. You are extraordinary young people in high school, learning not only about government but learning about all the other skills that you will need to know to be successful and to help your country be successful. 
   This program, I think, is an extraordinarily important program because of what it does. It gives to you at a young age while you are learning the opportunity to see firsthand your democracy in action, to see those who have been selected by your parents, by your brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and your neighbors and friends to represent them in the Congress of the United States. 
   You have been given this unique opportunity that a very, very small segment of your fellow cohorts, your generation, will have had, to come firsthand to see the Members, who are all human beings, who all have ideas, who all have passions and fears and visions and desires like your parents and you have and who come here on behalf of their constituents to try to do good for their country. 
   As president of the Maryland Senate in the 1970s, I had the opportunity to run the Page Program in the State Senate, and I was always hopeful that those young people, who were your age, 16, 17 years of age, they were seniors, for the most part, you're juniors, would leave their service in this institution and in that institution with a positive perspective, with a thought that this democracy, founded so many centuries ago, still is a viable democracy that, as Winston Churchill said, is the best of all other forms of government tried. 
   It is, as you have seen, not perfect, but it has created one of the greatest societies that has ever existed, not the only great society but one of the greatest, and you have helped us make it function. 
   And sometimes you will think to yourself, well, I didn't get on the floor and speak; you're obviously not a Member; and perhaps you didn't write a great treatise on this issue or that issue and will feel from time to time, well, all I did was run this envelope from this office to that office or from the floor of the House to someplace else or, from time to time, get information for a Member who was debating something on the floor. But your service made this institution run better. 
   John Kennedy was a hero of mine, and, frankly, I got into politics because of John Kennedy. He came to the campus of the University of Maryland, talked about the difference that young people could make. He spoke on this floor at least on three occasions where he gave his State of the Union.     
   In his inaugural address, he said to all of us that the energy, the faith, the devotion we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. 
   Pages, I hope you leave from here with a better knowledge of how the people's House works and with a renewed conviction that your democracy works, perhaps, better than you thought or some had told you it did and that you will leave this place with an energy and a faith and a devotion to letting your colleagues know how well their democracy works and with the conviction that if they participate fully in this democracy that it will work even better. 
   Thank you for your service. Thank you for what you do in your communities, in your schools and in your communities, and thank you for transmitting the knowledge you have learned to literally thousands of your friends and colleagues. Godspeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady, and I congratulate the gentlelady for the extraordinary work she has done, not just this year but throughout the years on this very, very important issue which offers hope for literally millions and millions of people, not just in America but throughout the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, today the new majority in this House demonstrates its commitment, its commitment to addressing the priorities of the American people. As we consider this legislation, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, let us be clear: This bill, S. 5, has widespread bipartisan support in Congress and certainly among the American people. It passed the Senate in April by a vote of 63-34. And it's nearly identical to legislation the House passed in January by a bipartisan substantial margin of 253-174. 
   This legislation will pass again today. And thus the real question is will the President heed the will of the  American people as expressed by bipartisan majorities in both Houses of Congress and sign this bill.     
   Or will the President continue to undermine the will of the American people. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, this legislation would increase the number of embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research. Current policy limits the use of Federal funds for research only to those stem cell lines that existed when President Bush issued an executive order of August 9, 2001, an executive order which accommodated the research we are talking about but limited it. 
   This policy severely restricts the potential for lifesaving breakthroughs because only 22 of those 78 stem cell lines are available for research today; and the vast majority of those 22 lines are aged, contaminated, or have been developed through obsolete methods. 
   It cannot be stressed enough: This legislation only authorizes Federal research funds for stem cell lines generated from the embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. Thus, this legislation does not seek nor does it certainly intend to destroy life. It seeks to preserve life. 
   Former Senate majority leader Dr. Bill Frist, who was once an opponent of efforts like this one but now supports them, stated: ``I strongly believe ..... that embryonic stem cells uniquely hold specific promise for some therapies and potential cures that adult stem cells cannot provide.'' That was Dr. Frist, the former Republican majority leader of the United States Senate. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have, I think, a moral obligation to provide our scientific community with the tools it needs to save lives, and this legislation accomplishes that objective. 
   Supporters of this bill understand that there is a difficult issue for many Americans and that it raises many questions that humanity has yet to adequately answer, and that is why this legislation also directs HHS and the National Institutes of Health to issue ethical guidelines that will ensure the highest standards of scientific investigation. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, this bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research on stem cells not derived from human embryos. 
   The truth is, as demonstrated by Gallup polls taken since 2001, the more Americans learn about the potential for stem cell research, the more they support it. Just last month, 65 percent of Americans reported that they supported expanding Federal funding for stem cell research. This legislation represents the hope of millions of Americans who are waiting for us to take action. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, as they have before. It is an opportunity. It is a chance. It is a hope for better health and life for those whom we represent. 
   I urge the President to reconsider his veto when this bipartisan piece of legislation reaches his desk, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HOYER. What the chairman and I have discussed is that we are going to complete these four bills next week. As the gentleman knows, as a result of the supplemental taking up a substantial amount of time of the committee and of the committee's chairman and the committee staff, we are behind in our schedule. It is our intention, as the gentleman knows from my previous statements privately and publicly to him and in the colloquy, that we will complete 11 of the 12 appropriation bills prior to June 29 when we are scheduled to take the July 4 work period break. The Defense bill has been decided to be done mid-July. Other than that, these bills will be done. 
   In order to accomplish that objective, our schedule will be directed not so much at time as work. And we will complete the work. So I say to my friend, Saturday is a possibility. The chairman has said Saturday is a possibility. I am hopeful that will not be necessary. I am hopeful that the subcommittee chairs and the ranking members will be able to work together, as was done last year in terms of schedule and time, so that we can complete our work by Friday at a relatively early hour. I am hopeful we can do that.

   Mr. HOYER. That obviously is an average of a little less than four bills per week the 3 weeks that are available to us. We have four bills scheduled next week. We will not have the Defense bill scheduled. Labor and Health may be the biggest bill thereafter that we will consider prior to June 30.

   Mr. HOYER. I do anticipate that, and I would look forward to having discussions with the gentleman at the end of next week, Thursday or Friday. Hopefully that is feasible. We hope it will be feasible. 
   As you know, last year, as I reiterated, there were time agreements between the chairman and the ranking member that allowed us to effect reasonably efficient consideration under the open rules that were then in place.  We anticipate that, and I hope that is the case.     
   But I want to reiterate what is self-evident. Our commitment has been to pass 11 bills by the end of this month. That gives us three full weeks to do that. We think that is doable. 
   Again, the defense bill is not in that mix. The defense bill arguably could have taken substantial time, and that will be done in July. 
   I say to my friend that I contemplate proceeding as we have done in the past and look forward to discussing that with him as we proceed.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. It gives me an opportunity to respond to two things. 
   First of all to his specific question, and that is what I contemplate at this point in time. I have not fully discussed it with the chairman, but that is what we contemplate. As far as I know, that is what the rules will provide for next week. 
   When I said it gave me an opportunity to comment on the general, I know there has been some consternation on your side of the aisle, Mr. Whip, with the pre-printing requirement. 
   As you know, one of the things we were concerned about was that matters would come to the floor with little notice. My view is an open rule allows somebody to present whatever amendment they choose to present. But requiring that it be preprinted so it gives notice to Members it seems to me not to be contrary to the concept of an open rule. It simply means within the concept of an open rule Members will have notice as to what amendments people intend to offer. 
   We think that is not undermining of anybody's right to offer any amendment they choose to, while at the same time giving the body notice of what they can contemplate and consider what they might want to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I would reiterate, as I told my friend, my contemplation is we will proceed in the regular order next week. We hope that will go in the regular order. 
   I further said to my friend that we will discuss that as we go forward during the latter part of the week. We hope, as occurred last year, there was cooperation between both sides to accomplish the work of the Appropriations Committee. 
   We know we have had a problem. Nine of the appropriations bills, as you know, weren't passed last year. They were passed this year, and they were passed after the fiscal year not only had started but after the Congress in which they were supposed to be passed expired and the new Congress was under way. 
   But I want to assure the gentleman, as I have said, we contemplate the regular order. What I was referring to in the second part of my response was the issue that has been raised not with respect to appropriations bills over the last 3 or 4 months but with respect to bills that we perceive to be open rules but with a pre-printing requirement. We do not think, and we will be glad to discuss that, that giving Members notice of amendments they may have to be prepared for and to contemplate and to have information about and find out what people might think about that undermines the open-rule concept. The open-rule concept, from my perspective, is that any Member who wants to offer an amendment that is germane can do so. And that requiring them to tell people ahead of time what that amendment is is not undermining of that right. 
   However, as I said, I understand the gentleman's position with respect to an appropriation bill where moneys may be cut. There may be opportunities to add back in other places or to shift from one object to another. I think you are correct. It may be a more fluid situation that the Members confront at that point in time, and they may not be able to have the ability to pre-print an amendment which they can themselves not contemplate. 
   I want to explain that I was referring more to the questions that you have raised, not you specifically, but that have been raised with reference to the differences that we have on the fact that we believe we have provided a number of open rules, notwithstanding the pre-printing requirement.

   Mr. HOYER. Well, I don't know that the response is necessary. I will say to my friend, I heard him speak a lot in 1991 and 1992 and 1993 about open rules, about openness, and I'm speaking now of Mr. Dreier, and he subsequently became the chair of the Rules Committee. And his response was, when I raised one of his quotes, was, look, we're in authority now and we've found out that we can't get done the work that we need to get done without, in effect, shutting down the rules. 
   It is very difficult now to hear him tell me that he's going to do everything possible to make sure that the rules are open. He had an opportunity as chairman of the Rules Committee, of course, to do that, and from our perspective, as he well knows, he didn't do that. 
   As I have said before, we are going to proceed with these four bills in the regular order, and my friend the distinguished whip and I will discuss, along with Mr. Boehner and I, will discuss trying to get our work done within the time frame allotted to us and that is available to us. 
   He made the observation correctly that 11 of the 12 appropriation bills last year were passed through this House, in the previous year the 12 out of 12. Or 11 out of 11. I guess 10 out of 11 the last year. We've added an appropriations committee. They were passed. However, I would remind and say once again, with the cooperation of Mr. Obey and with time constraints so that they could be done in a timely fashion. I am hopeful that we proceed that way again, and we will look forward to discussing it.

   Mr. HOYER. As someone who served on the Appropriations Committee for a quarter of a century, I can tell you this has been done on a regular basis in the last Congress, the Congress before that and every Congress in which I've served. In every Congress in which I've served.

   Mr. HOYER. It's my understanding, staff has just told me, that we have an agreement, I presume Mr. Obey and Mr. Lewis and other leadership have agreed, to coordinate the floor and committee work so as to not have conflicts. So that apparently has been contemplated. 
   I want to agree with you that, generally speaking, you are absolutely correct. The Appropriations Committee does not like to be marking up bills when appropriation bills are on the floor. I agree with that 100 percent. Mr. Obey in particular does not like that because Mr. Obey, either as the ranking member or now the chairman, was very engaged, as we all know, in the floor debates. So he was particularly not happy with that process, and as an appropriator, I can tell you that no appropriator likes to have that happen. 
   Again, we understand that there has been some work on this so that we can try to accommodate both doing the work on the floor and doing the work in the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to pay my respects, and I know the respects of all others in this House, to the nine Charleston, South Carolina, firefighters who lost their lives this week while fearlessly and courageously discharging their duties, and offer my condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones in this great tragedy: Captain Billy Hutchinson, Captain Mike Benke, Captain Louis Mulkey, engineer Mark Kelsey, assistant engineer Brad Beaity, assistant engineer Michael French, firefighter James Drayton, firefighter Brandon Thomas and firefighter Melven Champaign. They made a commitment to one of our Nation's highest callings, a calling to service in the face of great danger, and a call to honor a tradition of heroes. 
   These fallen firefighters, Mr. Speaker, represented more than 100 years of service to the people they swore an oath to protect. And the dedication with which they lived their lives is something our Nation will not soon forget. 
   John Kennedy once said: ``The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment, but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. A man does what he must, in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures, and that is the basis of all morality,'' Kennedy concluded. 
   In their final moment, Mr. Speaker, these nine men taught us what true morality is really all about, a love and heartfelt concern for one's neighbors that provides the strength to rush into the breach while others are rushing from it, and a sense of responsibility that will not allow a man to stand idly at times when his help is most needed. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, the thoughts and prayers of a grateful Nation are with the families and friends of these nine courageous men, firefighters, heroes. May their legacy of valor, gallantry, and service be something that lives on in our country forever.

   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   On Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour business and at 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6 p.m. 
   I want to reiterate that, as we did the other day. It will be 6 p.m. I would hope that the offices that are covering the floor, that they remind their Members 6 p.m. on Monday will be the votes. The congressional baseball game is at 7:30, and we want to give Members time to get to the game. It is a fun event and a collegial event, and we are going to accommodate that by accelerating by half an hour the votes on Monday at 6 p.m. 
   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of those bills will be announced later today. 
   On Tuesday the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m., and on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m. We will consider the following fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills: Interior and Environment; Financial Services. 
   I will say to my friends that those two bills will be considered, and we will obviously, consistent, hopefully, with our agreement, try to enter into unanimous consent agreements in terms of the amendments and the timing of those amendments. And we will see how the balance of the schedule goes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

   The answer to that is yes. Again, we are going to complete those two bills at least. There may be some other legislative business. We don't know whether there will be conference reports. As you know, there is a conference on the 9/11 bill and some other conference reports on other items that may come forward. But the answer to your question, I think, is essentially yes. If we can complete the work that we have before us prior to Friday, there may not be a need to meet on Friday.

   Mr. HOYER. Yes, there is. We had a lot of discussion about this. As Mr. Obey has represented, because of the reforms that have been adopted and the transparency that we want to effect, but also the certification that is necessary for the legitimacy of projects, the time frame necessary to do the State-Justice-Commerce was more than could be accomplished within the time frame that the staff had available. As you know, they had to deal with the Interior and the Financial Services as well. Science-State-Justice-Commerce was such that they simply could not get it done in time. Regrettably, therefore, it, too, as the other four bills, one of which was already scheduled for July, the defense appropriations bill, had to be moved to July.

   And if I can, it has been somewhat complicated, as you can understand, by the fact that we now have four appropriation bills that we anticipated in June now scheduled for July. So to that degree, I want to be somewhat careful about what I represent, because we are still in the process of determining the scheduling of all of those bills.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Chairman, I rise today to express concerns about GAO's response to GAO employees' petition for a union election, which was filed on May 8 of this year. As a legislative branch agency it is imperative that GAO conduct its labor relations in a manner that is a model for all Federal agencies. 
   I am particularly concerned by GAO's decision to challenge the eligibility of one-third of the employees covered by the union petition. GAO is asserting that these employees are not eligible for representation because they perform a supervisory role. 
   The facts of their employment status at GAO strongly suggests otherwise. If these employees are in fact determined to be supervisors, then they are supervisors in name only because they are prohibited from performing supervisory functions. Moreover, GAO would have a 1:3 ratio of supervisors to nonsupervisors. That would be one of the smallest ratios in any public or private organization. 
   I am deeply concerned that GAO's challenge is an attempt to delay balloting until the end of the year, one that will entail a considerable expenditure of resources that will only distract the agency from carrying out critical investigatory and oversight work for the U.S. Congress. 
   I strongly urge GAO to reconsider its challenge, which will be costly, undermine agency morale, and distract it from its mission.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I wanted rise not to speak on the issue that gentleman just spoke so passionately about, but just to say a word about the two new leaders of this committee. 
   I have had opportunity of serving in this House for some period of time.  When I first came here, shortly thereafter, Vic Fazio, Congressman Fazio and Congressman Lewis, who is now the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, handled this responsibility that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Zach Wamp are now handling. For almost at least a decade, Liz, I think they handled that responsibility. And they handled it in an absolutely bipartisan way to reflect the fact that 435 Members representing the 300 million people in this country care about this institution working well to their benefit, and to the benefit of our country. 
   I want to congratulate certainly Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who, in her third year, has become a cardinal, in large part because of her energy and her focus and her talent and her experience in the State Senate in Florida and the House in Florida, and what she brings to this institution. She is an institutionalist. 
   We are also fortunate with Zach Wamp from Tennessee, with whom I disagree from time to time and maybe a lot of times when we vote on substantive legislation, but who is a good friend of mine. We are blessed that the two of them are working on this bill. 
   I mentioned Liz Dawson, who has been, really, mothering this bill, I was going to say husbanding this bill, but for a very significant period of time, since she was a very young girl, and who cares a great deal about this institution. I want to thank her as well for her leadership. 
   But I think we ought to all feel fortunate that we have two people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Zach Wamp trying to make the accommodations for this institution to work well to represent our people. This is the people's House. To the extent that we have the resources to represent our people in a way that will reflect credit on this House and a positive result for our people, our country will be better. So I wanted to say that and congratulate Mr. Wamp and Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1281 to make it unlawful for anyone to disseminate false election-related information about an election in order to prevent another person from exercising the right to vote. I commend Chairman CONYERS and Representative EMANUEL for their leadership in bringing this critical bill to the floor. 
   The pernicious practices that H.R. 1281 would combat are not just academic to me. During the Maryland governor's race last year, there were numerous and substantiated reports of political operatives distributing false campaign materials on Election Day to confuse voters about the candidates, including endorsements they had allegedly received. 
   In recent elections in Maryland, including the 2006 elections, operatives have also spread false information about the time, place or manner of voting or qualifications for, or restrictions on, voting, or the political affiliations of candidates. 
   These grotesque practices are a direct assault on the most fundamental right of Americans: the right to vote and have that vote counted. 
   Over the past 40 years, tremendous progress has been made removing the most conspicuous obstacles and impediments to voting in order to guarantee that all Americans, regardless of their race or color, can vote. Unfortunately, there exists in our Nation a small but committed group of individuals who will sink to any low if they believe it will produce a victory. H.R. 1281 goes after these people, who are a disease on our democratic system. 
   I am hopeful that the House will overwhelming pass H.R. 1281 and send the message that deceptive campaign practices are un-American and anti-democratic.

   Mr. HOYER. Let me come over here. 
   I tell a story when I greet, as so many of you have, constituents to the floor of the House. I tell them the story that few Members of the House did I come with a more negative perception of than John Rousselot, as you can imagine. John Rousselot had quite a reputation around the country. And I say that to them for the purpose of saying that I ended up thinking John Rousselot was one of the really delightful human beings with whom I served, notwithstanding our deep disagreements. Some of you who served during his term will recall, as we know, John had a problem with his leg, but he used to delight, as you recall, going over to that rostrum and talking to you us. You remember that, Bob, I am sure, very well. He did it, however, not in a confrontational way but with a twinkle in his eye, as if to say, I'm coming over  here and I'm going to tell you guys what you really ought to be doing. And I really always enjoyed it. 
   When Jay said, well, I'm not going to speak from that rostrum, I'm going to come over here, it reminded me of that. 
   Unfortunately, as all of you know through the years now, the aisle has become more a wall than an aisle. A division has grown. I lament, I really do, Bob Michel's loss from the House and from the country's service in this body--he still serves our country as all of you do as well--because he was, with Tip O'Neill, two unifying leaders who tried to bring us together, not agreeing necessarily but disagree in a sense of trying to get together to solve problems with our different perspectives being involved. As all of you know, I have a deep affection for Bob Michel for that reason. But I always come here--before I was majority leader I came here--because I want to thank all of you for the service you have given to our country, the friendship you have given to me and so many others in this body. 
   Some of you I see on a regular basis. The Historical Society obviously making such a continued contribution. I saw Ben Gilman 2 days ago at a breakfast at which I spoke. But I really wanted to reiterate the welcome of Speaker Pelosi to all of you back to the House. 
   I also want to recognize our friends, and I'm not sure which one of you are here, from Great Britain, from Ireland. As a matter of fact, I think there are 19 Irish Parliamentarians here. There are a couple from Greece and New Zealand; Great Britain, as I said; and Canada. So we have five nations represented who with the United States have something in common with one of them, Great Britain. And we have much in common with all of us. We welcome you to the House. You are friends and great allies at a time of challenge for the global community, both in terms of economics, in terms of terrorism, in terms of moving our international community towards a more peaceful resolution of its problems. 
   Senator Mitchell. Did he leave? I'm sorry. I should have said that at the beginning. I was going to invite Senator Mitchell, based upon his experience in Northern Ireland, if he might visit us here and see if he can resolve the differences between the Senate and the House. I thought that might be a very useful contribution to the country. We're having some problems. You may have noticed. The Senate is a strange body, Senator Tydings. We're trying to work with them, but it is very difficult. 
   In any event, I want to welcome all of you back and thank you for what you have done for our country on both sides of the aisle, as Americans, not as Republicans or as Democrats but as Americans, and say how honored I am to have the opportunity to join with you on this day when you return, to remember what you have done here, but to also remember the friendships that we have made here. 
   Good luck to you. Thank you very much.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   My hope is sooner rather than later. However, as the gentleman knows, we are having, as is so often the case, difficulty reaching agreement with the Senate, mainly because the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has a very close vote structure there, as you know, and so he is trying to figure out the votes in the Senate on a budget. 
   As is too often the case, one of the issues is whether we pay for things that we are doing. The House feels strongly about that issue, and I think the chairman of the Budget Committee in the Senate feels strongly about that issue, but he is not sure that he can get the votes. That is the discussion. There is some discrepancy, not much, between the figures, and we are hopeful that we can get a budget conference committee done. As soon as a conference committee is done, we will report it to the floor. If that is next week, it will be on the floor next week. 
   I am in regular communication with Mr. Spratt, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and he is working at it.

   I still anticipate that. With reference to the gentleman's question regarding the number of bills, based upon the comments of Mr. Murtha, I have not talked to him personally but that have been reported, it is my understanding that he is thinking of one bill, not both an Afghanistan and an Iraq. 
   The problem is while there is, I think, pretty universal support for the effort in Afghanistan as being critical to our fight on terrorism, there is more disagreement on the Iraq component and what we ought to be doing there. But the way the budget is structured, it would be very difficult to consider them discretely, Afghanistan and Iraq. So it is my understanding that Mr. Murtha has recommended and intends to pursue it as one bill.

I expressed it as a hope, and we are going to work toward not having a lame duck session. 
   Let me go back and answer your question. I think we had a week delay on the supplemental, and I think the week of May 5 is the week we are looking at for the supplemental. As you know, I said the last week in April, the first week in May. That is the first full week in May, so I guess I am still accurate. We are on for that week hopefully on the supplemental, which will be timely in accomplishing the objective of getting dollars in time before the depletion of the funds that have already been appropriated. 
   With respect to the appropriations process, obviously I will be discussing with Mr. Obey and with Mr. Spratt, if we fail to pass a budget, we have to give the Appropriations Committee a figure to mark to. My thought would be that we will do as we have done in years past, deem that the House budget will be the numbers to which they will mark. But we have not made that decision at this point in time.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The Speaker has focused on, as I think she has been quoted in the press as saying, we are still looking at TAA and discussing that with the administration. TAA, trade adjustment assistance, we think that is very important. There have been some positive discussions and indications from the administration. In addition, I know the Speaker has been discussing additional items with the leadership in the House and with Mr. Reid, and I think as well with the White House. So I think discussions are ongoing. The Speaker has made it very clear that the action taken from her perception, certainly from my perception, was not the death knell of Colombia. I know that some have interpreted it that way, but I don't think that the Speaker or I interpreted it that way.

   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, we have some extraordinary people who work for us. At times this is a very stressful job. They remain even-tempered. They remain gentle and kind and good humored. We have lost one of those just recently. Maybe you did not know his name, but you saw him, usually through the center door, or sometimes other doors. His name was Lou Costantino. 
   As a member of the House security team for over 28 years, Lou Costantino has been a fixture at the House Chamber's front door and was beloved by Members and staff who were greeted by him every day. I never failed to come through that door that he did not have a kind and gentle world. 
   He was a ``purveyor of pork,'' if you will. He loved sausage, and he allowed some of us to share in that sausage. 
   I am very sad to report to all of you that Lou died of a heart attack last Saturday. He was young, 71 years of age. Many of you will remember Lou for the homemade sausage he made for his friends and colleagues every day. 
   We will miss Lou. He made this institution a better place.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Having been in the gentleman's position for too long, I honestly empathize with his position. It is my expectation that the appropriation bills, as they have historically, will come to this floor starting mid-May and continuing through June, and we hope to complete our appropriations bills by the end of June. My expectation is they will be, as they are traditionally, on the floor with open rules, or at least structured rules. Obviously, open rules, if you have 500 or 600 amendments from all  the folks, we may not get finished, which is why we have structured rules. But certainly the gentleman is correct that that is the tradition. I would expect us to follow that tradition. 
   On supplementals, over the last 15 supplementals, I was looking around to see if I had it immediately in front of me, I don't, but on the last 15 supplementals there have been a variety. Seven of them were open, eight of them were less than open, some more structured than others. 
   I understand the gentleman's representation, and I certainly look forward to working with the gentleman.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't know that we will see it next week, although I would like to see it next week. 
   As the gentleman knows, I was very concerned and remain concerned about the interpretation of germaneness. And, frankly, that wouldn't have been a problem either had the minority been willing to offer the traditional motion, which was to recommit and have it immediately reported back to the floor. I will tell my friend we would have had a vote on that. I think you would have probably prevailed on the motion itself, and we would have prevailed on the bill. It would have carried that rider with it, of course. But the minority, frankly, from our perspective, chose to try to defeat the bill by not just making the motion to recommit to adopt the proposition that you offered, but sending it back to committee for that purpose, which was obviously not necessary, which leads me to believe, I want to tell you honestly, my friend, that this was a procedural device to kill the bill rather than let it come to a vote on its merits. 
   As the gentleman knows, I feel very strongly personally, others do as well, but I feel very strongly personally that we ought to extend a full voting franchise to the Representative who sits on this floor and represents 600,000 of our fellow Americans. The answer to your question is, I hope to bring that to the floor as soon as possible under conditions where we will protect ourselves from procedurally losing a bill which has the majority of votes on this floor.

   Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the views. Although, as the gentleman knows, that bill was reported out of the Government Reform Committee chaired by a Republican, with a Republican majority, with a majority of Republicans voting for the bill to report it out of the committee in the last session. So while I understand your view, it is not as if we were taking up a bill that hadn't already been processed by your committee in the last Congress, reported out of that committee, and because obviously there is opposition to it on your side of the aisle, not brought to the floor. 
   I understand the gentleman's point; but very frankly, the only reason it has not passed, because it has the majority of votes on this floor, was because the motion that was made was not the traditional motion of adopting a proposition, in this case the gun control issue, and reporting it immediately back out with that amendment attached. 
   I appreciate what the gentleman is saying, but I can't feel too guilty about bringing to the floor a bill that was reported out of a Republican-chaired committee with a Republican majority.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I share the previous speaker's sorrow. I'm sorry that the policies pursued by this administration have not done what he wanted to do, support our troops. We sent too few, we equipped them too little, and we have left them too long and trained them for too short a time. Yes, I'm sorry. 
   The American public expects us, the Congress of the United States, to do something, not simply to say yes to failed policies, but to, on their behalf, speak out and try to take us in a new direction. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is not a Member of this body on either side of the aisle who does not pray for our success in Iraq and who does not pray for the safe return of our brave service men and women. However, after the loss of more than 3,200 American soldiers and more than 24,000 injured and after the expenditure of more than $400 billion on a war now entering its fifth year that Secretary Rumsfeld told us would take just a few months. With open arms and cheering in the streets, this war would be over and the mission would have been accomplished almost 4 years ago, said the President of the United States, who now asks us to rubber-stamp, no strings attached. Do it, as Mr. Putnam said, before supper. That is not what the American public expects of us. They expect better. They expect a new direction. They expect us to think, not simply say, amen, Mr. President. 
   The Defense Department says: ``Some elements of the situation in Iraq are properly described as a civil war.'' None of us who voted for the original authorization voted to put our troops in the middle of a civil war, not one of us. 
   The Iraq Government has failed to meet political goals. It is our responsibility to ask them to do so because we want to support our troops. And if the Iraqis do not meet their responsibilities, our troops will not be supported. A National Intelligence Estimate concludes that this war is increasing, this is the National Intelligence Estimate, increasing the global war on terror. The Army Chief of Staff has issued strong warnings about the effect of the war on America's overall military readiness. Mr. Murtha has talked about that for at least the last 2 years. 
   My friend, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, with whom I served for a quarter of a century on that committee, he must share  the concern about military readiness that all of us share and know that we are eroding our military readiness every day. Thus, the question before the Members today is this: Will we change direction in Iraq, or will we continue to stay the course with a failing policy? 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the answer is clear. It is long past time that this Congress assert itself and assist on accountability and a new direction in Iraq. More blank checks from this Congress would constitute an abdication of our responsibility and our duty. Four years of abdication is enough. It is time, my fellow Members, for Congress to assert its support of our troops by adopting policies that will keep them safe and enhance their success. 
   This legislation, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, will protect our troops, requiring deployments to adhere to existing Defense Department standards, not our standards, Defense Department standards, standards for training, equipment and armor, while allowing the President to waive these standards, which are his own, the administration's standards, if he believes it necessary. That is the right thing for us to do. 
   The bill also holds the Iraqi Government accountable, measuring its performance by the standards President Bush outlined in his January 10 speech, not our standards for Iraq, but the benchmarks that the President of the United States has set. But if they are only rhetorical benchmarks with nothing behind them to require that action, then we are wasting our time in supporting our troops because that will not do it. 
   The bill provides a responsible strategy for a phased redeployment of U.S. forces and refocusing our efforts on fighting al Qaeda. That is who attacked us, not the Sunni or Shia, but al Qaeda. 
   Some claim that this legislation will micromanage the war. That assertion is absolutely false and without ground. Our Commander in Chief, General Petraeus and our military commanders on the ground will retain all the flexibility they need to succeed. This legislation in no way undercuts their discretion on the ground. The only strings attached concerning troop readiness and the Iraq Government's progress have been endorsed by President Bush. Others assert that inclusion of a timeline for responsible redeployment is tantamount to capitulation. Mr. Hobson spoke on this floor just a few minutes ago. He voted to set a time line in Bosnia. Mr. Lewis sits as the ranking member of this committee; he voted on June 24, 1997, to set a timeline. Mr. Hastert, Speaker of the House, set a timeline. Mr. Delay voted for a timeline. Mr. Blunt voted for a timeline. Mr. Boehner voted for a timeline. 
   Every one of them voted for a timeline, and what were the circumstances? We hadn't lost a single troop, not one. We had spent $7 billion, not $379 billion. We had brought genocide to a stop, ethnic cleansing to a stop, and we were not losing people and we had a stable environment, yet they voted for a timeline. 
   Here, Secretary Gates says in testimony at his confirmation hearing: ``We are not winning.'' If that is the case, it is time for us to have a new strategy, a new direction, a new paradigm, if you will. That is what this bill does. 
   Mr. Boehner said just a few weeks ago, in terms of timelines, he said, ``I think it will be rather clear in the next 60 to 90 days as to whether this plan, the current escalation, is going to work.'' ``We need to know,'' Mr. Boehner said, ``as we are moving through these benchmarks that the Iraqis are doing what they have to do.'' Nothing in this bill will undermine that 60- or 90-day expectation that the minority leader, the Republican leader, has articulated. Under this legislation, if the Iraqis meet their benchmarks for 
   progress, the redeployment of American forces will not begin until a year from now. This is not any precipitous withdrawal. And, indeed, if there is total success, it will be more than a year from now. 
   Finally, let me point out, as I have said earlier, that timelines were supported in July of 1997, 220-2. Only two Republicans voted against setting a timeline. I voted against that timeline. And I said ``at this time.'' Why did I say that? Because we were succeeding. We were not losing troops. We had stopped genocide. We had stopped ethnic cleansing. We had a stable government in Serbia. We were winning and our strategy was succeeding. And under those circumstances, I thought timelines were not appropriate. But there is not a military general I have talked to who has said that we are succeeding. Today, this very day, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq lies deeply wounded, life at risk. If a Member of Congress goes to Baghdad, they will not drive you from the airport to the Green Zone. Why? Because they do not believe it is safe, almost 50 months after we started this operation. 
   My friends, it is time for a new direction. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support the troops, represent America, represent your people who want to win but do not want to leave our troops in the middle of a civil war. Support this well-thought-out crafted piece of legislation, which in no way undermines the ability of our troops to manage this war, but says to them, we will expect the Iraqis to perform and we will give you a time frame in which the world will know that they must themselves take responsibility.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, the chairman of the committee, who has done such an extraordinary job for decades now in taking care of the environment and particularly providing for clean water and sewer treatment for our country, so critical to our public health and to the health of our country. 
   I want to, at the outset, however, make an observation, that I am not surprised, very frankly, I tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, that they are concerned about Davis-Bacon provisions in this bill. After all, of course, most of those who have risen voted against raising the minimum wage in this country from $5.15 to $7.25 over a 2 1/2 -year period. 
   If you don't believe in raising the minimum wage from $5.15, it is not surprising to me that you are not for paying a prevailing wage to workers on public projects.  
   I have observed in the past, of course, how much cheaper projects would be if we didn't pay our laborers at all, and we just forced them to work. But hopefully we will not pursue, ever, a policy like that. 
   I want to commend the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Oberstar of Minnesota, for all of his hard work and leadership on this important legislation reauthorizing the Clean Water State Revolving Fund for the first time in 13 years. 
   It is interesting that our friends on this side of the aisle have been in charge of this Congress and bringing legislation to the floor for the last 12 years. So since they took charge, they have not reauthorized this program; again, not because of the observations, as has been pointed out, they didn't think we needed to have a clean water program, but because they didn't want to pay prevailing wages. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership, and I want to thank my dear friend, Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, for her very important leadership as well. 
   As you know, we have passed two other bills this week reauthorizing sewer overflow control grants, H.R. 569 and H.R. 700, related to combined sewer overflow grants to States for aging sewers. We know that is a problem throughout this country. That handles storm water and sewage water, and H.R. 700, which is a pilot project for getting clean water to rural communities. We know that we focus on urban communities, but it is very important for us to also make sure that our rural communities have clean water. 
   I believe that this bill, as has been indicated, has bipartisan support, notwithstanding the difference on prevailing wage. 
   Madam Chairman, the fact is a clean safe water supply is vital in communities, both large and small, rural and urban, all across this Nation. We are not talking about a luxury, a perk or a non-necessity. Clean water, safe water is absolutely indispensable to the good health of all Americans, as well as our way of life and our continued prosperity. 
   Just consider, my colleagues, that our Nation's farmers and fishermen and manufacturing and tourism industries rely on a clean water supply, and their activities contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy every year. 
   Our Nation, as has been pointed out, now faces a clean water crisis. As the Environmental Protection Agency warned in a recent report, and I am quoting from the administration's Environmental Protection Agency: ``Without continued improvements in wastewater treatment infrastructure, future population growth will erode away many of the Clean Water Act achievements.'' 
   And I want to congratulate Mr. Baker and Mr. Oberstar for their leadership in trying to confront that crisis. One key reason for the clean water crisis is that much of the water infrastructure in our Nation is rapidly approaching or already exceeding its projected life. 
   So I am proud today, Madam Chairman, that the new House majority, with the support of many Republicans, will take an important step toward addressing our Nation's water needs by reauthorizing the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and authorizing $14 billion over the next 4 years to ensure safe water for our families and for our people. And I congratulate both sides of the aisle for working towards that objective. 
   The fund is the primary source of Federal funding for clean water, helping to provide low-interest loans to local communities for construction of wastewater treatment facilities and other water pollution abatement projects. 
   In fact, since 1987, when the fund became the major Federal source of clean-water funding, it has provided States with more than $50 billion for more than 18,600 low-interest loans to local communities. 
   The unfortunate truth is, the recent Congresses allowed the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to expire in 1994 and failed to reauthorize it because, as I have said, and as we have seen on the floor, the concern about Davis-Bacon, the concern about paying a prevailing wage, wages that I think are fair and appropriate for public projects. 
   In recent years, the former majority cut funding for the funds involved in this project by 34 percent, and the President has proposed cutting it even further. 
   Madam Chairman, it is a new day in this, the people's House. It is long past time for us to act on this important legislation. 
   The new House majority is absolutely committed, under the leadership of Jim Oberstar, who has been one of the giants on this issue, for, as I said, decades, not days, not weeks, not months, not years, but decades he has been in the leadership of this effort. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan way, to reauthorize this critically important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (AFTER FOUR YEARS, NO MORE BLANK CHECKS -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, 4 years ago tonight, our Commander in Chief, President Bush, gave the orders that instigated Operation Iraqi Freedom. Whether they supported the President's decision or not, all, and I emphasize ``all'' patriotic Americans prayed for our success as well as the safe return of our brave service men and women. And 4 years later, we still do. However, today our success in Iraq is as elusive as it ever was and has ever been over the past 1,460 days. More than 3,200 American soldiers have given the ultimate measure of sacrifice, and more than 24,000 have been injured. The American taxpayers have spent more than $400 billion on this war, and the President asked for an additional $245 billion, including a $100 billion wartime supplemental spending bill that will be considered on the floor later this week. And thousands of Iraqis have been killed, while literally millions have fled to neighboring countries, triggering a refugee crisis. 
   Yet despite the sacrifice and hardship, how much progress has been made? Just last week, the Department of Defense reported record levels of violence and hardening sectarian violence in the fourth quarter of 2006, stating, ``Some elements of the situation in Iraq are properly descriptive of a civil war.'' 
   Administration officials themselves admitted last week that political goals that were to have been met by the Iraqi government this month will take significantly longer to achieve, said the administration. The National Intelligence Estimate tells us the war has increased the global terror threat rather than reduce it. And General Schoomaker, the Army Chief of Staff, has issued strong warnings about the effect of this war on America's overall military readiness and our ability to respond to emerging strategic threats. Indeed, IKE SKELTON of Missouri, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that the situation with respect to America's readiness of its Armed Forces is grave and troubling. Meanwhile, the American people have wearied of administration claims that are divorced from reality. ``Mission accomplished'' and ``the insurgency is in its last throes'' are just two of the assertions that have proved, sadly, very badly mistaken. 
   From the outset, the administration refused to commit a force commensurate with the threat it articulated, and now it asks for patience while a fourth troop escalation seeks to accomplish what three others could not. It profoundly miscalculated the cost of this war. It went to war without a plan for postwar stabilization and security. And perhaps most egregiously, the administration sent our troops into battle without proper equipment. 
   Madam Speaker, given the repeated miscalculations by the administration over the last 4 years, and given the situation on the ground in Iraq, today it is past time, way past time for the United States Congress, the people's representatives, to insist on accountability and a new direction in Iraq. 
   As one who supported the authority of the President of the United States to remove Saddam Hussein, and in listening to the President's State of the Union when he said not one of us who voted voted for failure, that was accurate. I certainly did not vote for failure. And I want success and seek success, but the administration's policies have not garnered success. Therefore, more blank checks and questioning obeisance by this Congress would constitute, in my opinion, a dereliction of our responsibility and our constitutional duty. Thus, this Congress, for the first time in 4 years, will have the opportunity this week to change America's course in Iraq and to insist that the Iraqis take control of their own destiny.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We are going to meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour on Monday and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules, including, and every Member ought to pay attention closely to this announcement, to the important bill, I think frankly it is going to pass with every Member's vote; we will consider several bills under suspension, but including legislation regarding Members' pension accountability. 
   I think everybody in this House believes that we ought to have legislation, we have had it; when the minority was the majority they pushed for this legislation, we agreed with them, we are pushing it as well. We think there will be agreement on making sure that if you commit a crime while a Member of Congress that is contrary to your duties that you are going to lose your pension. We think the American public believes that is fair. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 for morning hour and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of those suspension bills, as is the practice, will be available by the end of today. 
   On Tuesday, obviously we will receive the President for the delivery of the State of the Union message. So we will vacate the Chamber about 5 o'clock to give the opportunity for the security forces to make sure the Chamber is secure. 
   On Wednesday, we will meet at 10. We will consider a resolution to restore to the Delegates and Resident Commissioner their ability to cast votes in the Committee of the Whole. This rule was in place prior to January 1995, and we believe it is a good rule and will try to adopt that amendment to the rules. We will finish business in time--I have discussed with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt--we are trying to accommodate our schedule so that the minority is able to leave in a timely fashion to go to their meeting in Cambridge.

   Mr. HOYER. This is exactly the same rule that was put in place by the Democrats when we were in the majority to give to our five Delegates the opportunity to come to the floor to express their opinion in the Committee of the Whole. That rule, however, provides that in the event that the votes of the Delegates make a difference in the outcome, that immediately the Committee would rise, go into the House, and it would be revoted in the full House without the ability of the Delegates to vote. 
   The reason I articulate that, Mr. Whip, is to point out that, as you know, that was taken to court to see whether or not that was appropriate under the Constitution. The Court ruled that it was appropriate under the Constitution, with that caveat that I have just referenced. I have discussed this with all five Delegates. They are all supportive of this rule. 
   We believed, as you know, when you adopted your rules in January of 1995 and dropped the Delegates, we believed that that was unfortunate, because we have five people here sent by their constituents to the House but do not have an opportunity to express their view in a public way, their position in a public way on behalf of their constituents. This will do that, although under the Constitution we are constrained to write it as we did, which has been confirmed by the court. And I thank the gentleman for that question.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The purpose is to honor democracy. We are fighting in Iraq to honor democracy and allowing people to vote. I thought it was unfortunate, personally, that we did not continue the rule in place that we adopted in 1993 in the rules package. And this rule will of course extend to the Republican delegate, Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, as well as the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. I personally believe very strongly she ought to have a full vote in this House. She represents 680,000, thereabouts, Americans who, if they moved across the river to Virginia or across the line to Maryland, would have a full vote. I think it is inappropriate, wrong, and frankly inconsistent with our commitment to democracy that she does not have a full vote on the floor of the House. 
   But I say to the gentleman the purpose is to give to these elected representatives of constituent parts of this country, not States, but constituent parts of this country the ability to express their views on this floor. Under the Constitution, obviously, if they make a difference, there would be a constitutional question; make a difference in the sense that the margin is so close that they would make the difference between winning and losing a proposition. So we provided then and are providing now what the Court has sanctioned as the way to give to the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, a Republican, as well as the four Democrats who represent those four areas of our country that I indicated, the District of Columbia, clearly a part of our country, and the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam, the ability to come to this floor and express their opinion. We believe that is consistent with the democratic principles of this country, and that is why we are doing it.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Of course, we are not very worried about that, we have been getting so many Republicans to vote with our propositions, 124 on one of our bills, 82 on another one of our bills, our margins are so big that is not a big concern to us at this point in time, I tell my friend. 
   Frankly, Guam is in no different position than some of our States. Some of our States have one Member, and they are guaranteed a Member no matter what their size is. So Wyoming, Montana and other States who have either more or less, Montana now represents more than most of us, Wyoming less than most of us. I am not sure what the population of Alaska is. But to that extent, Guam, American Samoa are not in any different position than a State that is guaranteed a vote. 
   Now under the Constitution, and I will say again to my friend that it wasn't the courts that imposed this, in our efforts in 1992 and 1993 when we adopted the rule to extend to our colleagues who vote in every committee in this House, they vote in the Ways and Means Committee if they are there, I don't know that there is a Delegate member, but they vote in the Natural Resources Committee, the Science Committee, other committees on which they are members they vote. They are in line to chair or not chair subcommittees, depending upon their seniority. It is only in the Committee of the Whole that they cannot vote. So they cannot express their views for their constituents on an issue. 
   The Constitution is such, which is why we drafted the rule, you are correct, to have them make a difference would be, we believed, inconsistent with the Constitution. We need a constitutional amendment to do that. We are not offering a constitutional amendment. We don't think that is necessary. 
   But I want to tell my friend honestly, I have been the chief proponent of this and feel strongly about it, I believe passionately that Ms. Norton ought to have a full vote, number one. 
   Number two, I believe the four Delegates, whether they be from Puerto Rico, whether from Guam, American Samoa or the Virgin Islands, ought to have the opportunity to come to this floor and express their views. So we are offering that rule. We thought it was a good rule. 
   You are right, in the final analysis it is not going to skew the difference between the minority and the majority parties because ultimately if they make a difference, it is not that their vote will not count, their vote will count. Their constituents will see their vote up and other Americans will see their vote up, and they are going to say the gentlelady from Guam or the gentleman from American Samoa or the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands or the gentleman from Puerto Rico believed X, Y or Z on a vote. We think that is consistent with our view that we ought to be extending opportunities for democracy, not limiting them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. First of all, let me say he and I agree. I was at dinner last night and Secretary Paulson was there. Secretary Paulson, as everybody knows, was the managing partner of Goldman Sachs. Obviously he worked very hard and is a very successful individual. He has been in his job now for a few months. 
   He said to me he was surprised how hard Members of Congress worked, how complex were the challenges confronting them, and how much of an education, frankly, over the last months he has had in dealing with Members of Congress, working on both sides of the aisle, how hard they had to work to come to grips with solving our Nation's problems. 
   I want to make it very clear that Members of Congress do in fact work 6, 7 days a week, and that is the rule, not the exception. And when they are at home in their districts, they are doing what the Founding Fathers expected them to do, particularly in this House, the people's House. They are going home and listening to their public and having town meetings, they are visiting business enterprises that are creating jobs and visiting schools. They are talking to their constituents. They are meeting people with problems with the Federal Government in their district offices where, as the minority whip has pointed out, they have offices, district offices, to serve their public. That is our job. 
   I tell my public that this job really is a two-fold job. Fifty percent of it is coming to the House and voting yea or nay on policy. Fifty percent of it is making sure that our districts are represented well in their interface with the Federal Government.     
   The Federal Government has an impact on our States, on our municipalities, on our jurisdictions and on our people, on our veterans and on our seniors in particular, but many, almost everybody. It is our job to be in close communication with them. As a matter of fact, the reason we are elected every 2 years, by the Founding Fathers' device, was to specifically keep us in close touch. 
   So I agree 100 percent with the minority whip when he indicates that our Members are working, whether they are here on this floor or they are at home. Period. Having said that, we are going to be considering a CR pretty soon because nine of the 11 appropriation bills that we were supposed to pass into law are still not passed. They weren't passed by the end of the fiscal year, September 30 of 2006. They have not been passed as of January 19, and we are going to try to get at least a CR passed so that we can fund last year's responsibility.  
   And I want Members to know that the committees have had essentially 2 days to work in this place, Tuesdays and Wednesdays; and the committees have been complaining that they aren't able to get their work done. I want everybody to know, Mr. Blunt and I are close friends. We are not close Democratic friends and Republican friends; we are close friends. We see one another a lot, we talk to one another a lot, but what I have said, and the whip knows I have said this, we are going to come in Monday nights. Now, why are we going to come in on Monday nights? Because if we do not come in Monday nights and we come in Tuesday night at 6:30, the committees cannot meet because they can't get quorums. 
   Woodrow Wilson said that the work of Congress is done in its committees. If committees can't work, the Congress can't work. America sent us here to work, to get its work done, to make a difference, to take us in a new direction, and that is on our side. 
   I am prepared, as the leader, to take some of the flack when sometimes, as we wanted to do today, as the whip knows, we wanted to do the pension bill today. Mr. Dreier objected, it wasn't in the regular order, we understand that, we are going to accommodate that, so we are going to do it Monday. We think it is going to be an overwhelming vote on that. That could have been done today. We could have done that and moved it on, but we will be here on Monday. And committees will have Tuesday and Wednesday. Next week is a short week, the week after is a short week, so we won't be meeting on Fridays. So we are not on an onerous schedule. 
   But I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this leader wants to accommodate the interest of Members. Why? Because I know you work hard, because I have been here for 26 years and I work very hard, and my colleagues work hard. I want you to also know that I think it is our responsibility and duty to the American people to be here in sufficient time to allow us to do the people's business. 
   And I want the people to know that when we are not on the floor on a Friday and only doing a half an hour or an hour's work, as the gentleman indicated, that our committees have 4 hours, from 9 to 1, to try to do their work. 
   Now, we are early in the session, so they may not have needed today. And, yes, I could, as practice has been, when we get to Thursday conclude, well, we can get this out of the way and go home. I know Members like to do that. 
   I want Members to be informed on a regular basis it is my intention, as the leader, as the person responsible for scheduling, to talk to our committee chairmen and committee ranking members that they will have the opportunity to get their work done, and I am hopeful that they will report that work to the floor. 
   My friend and I have discussed getting work for the floor is sometimes difficult; but I say to my friend, I think it is more difficult if the committees don't have the opportunity to work. We are trying to provide that, while at the same time, I say to my friend, provide for Members' schedules, not only at home to work, but Members to be at home to see their children and their families and their wives and their husbands. We think that is important as well. 
   So scheduling, as my friend, Mr. Blunt, has observed, is tough; but we are going to try to provide a schedule which provides the opportunity to do our business here and at home and to make sure that we stay in close touch with our families. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I asked to speak because the whip yielded back his time. 
   I understand the gentleman's contention. Very frankly, we did our business in a timely fashion and got a lot done these last 2 weeks, in our opinion. We may differ on that. We got, we think, a lot done in a bipartisan fashion, really, in terms of the votes. 
   I will tell you, the Foreign Affairs Committee had a hearing today; it is going on now. Lee Hamilton is testifying on Iraq. We believe that is timely and important. So that committee is meeting. I just got the notice of what committees are meeting. 
   I only state that because I believe my friend is correct, that early on we don't have as many committee meetings. We believe that having the time available for our committees to get work done is going to facilitate having meaningful work on the floor, and we hope that we can do our meaningful work on the floor in hours where it will provide for Members not having to work until 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock at night, even though it may save them 2 or 3 hours on a Friday. But we are going to work with you. We have worked together; we are going to continue to work together. We will have differences. 
   I am going to work with Mr. Boehner, the leader, to accommodate our Members. You are my friend. The fact that we are in session or not in session is not an indication of whether Members are working. That representation was never made, nor was it ever intended to be made. It is a misrepresentation, certainly in my view, that that is any contention of mine or implication that ought to be drawn. I think the gentleman agrees with that. Members work hard whether we are in session or not in session.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I have been listening to this debate. It is, like all debates, interesting. Yesterday we had a debate, a relatively extended debate, in which Republican after Republican rose and said, This bill does not do enough. In this instance, it does not bring us full energy independence. That is obvious. But person after person got up and said, We're not doing enough for students, we're not doing enough for college aid, and then, lo and behold, the vote was taken and 356 people out of 435 voted for that bill, including 124 Republicans. We are not doing enough in this bill, that is clear, but the journey of a thousand miles, as has been observed, starts with a step. 
   Another individual got up, and then I will go to my remarks, and talked about the Washington Post editorial. An interesting comment that she made. I don't think she had perhaps read all of the editorial because the editorial said this: 
   ``The good part of the bill revokes tax breaks for oil and gas production in the United States that should never have been granted.'' 
   I believe in the free market system. What is the free market system? If you have a demand for a product and you can get a good price for it, you produce it. That's supply and demand. In point of fact, the price of the product has gone up and up and up. I do not criticize the oil companies for wanting a tax break. We all want tax breaks. What I criticize is the Congress of the United States for not making a judgment on behalf of the American people. That is who I criticize. The actions taken in the ETI bill were wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the lessons that most of us learn early on is to study history so that we can avoid making the same mistakes of the past. A generation ago, this Nation faced a series of crises born of an overreliance on foreign oil. Prices spiked and supplies were rationed. It took work, but Congress and the President acted to combat that dependence and ushered in a wave of new technologies, conservation and efficiency improvements that have saved untold billions of dollars and barrels of oil and greatly enhanced the Nation's economic performance and national security. 
   Unfortunately, in recent years, however, we seem to have forgotten that time period. The economy grew, the price of oil waned and we forgot the lessons of the past and abandoned the progress toward a more fuel efficient existence. Mr. Speaker, crises at home and abroad have changed that, changed it dramatically, and we find ourselves once again increasingly reliant on foreign oil. And drilling for more oil and gas alone is not the solution. Mr. Bartlett said that earlier today. Oil is a wasting resource. What wasting means is it is going to go away. I have a great-grandchild, unlike some of you who are much younger than I am. She may not use oil. It may not be available for her. 
   Today, we will pass the last of the bills that we promised the American people we would undertake at the beginning of this Congress. This legislation is but a first down payment on the promise of a new energy future for our country. This bill is not about punishing one sector of industry, nor does this bill represent the totality or even a substantial component of our energy policy, as evidenced by the Rural Caucus's biofuels energy package, Speaker Pelosi's innovation agenda, and the PROGRESS Act, which I, along with 129-plus Members of this body in the last Congress, introduced. However, the CLEAN Act starts to move our Nation in a new direction. It is about the focus of precious taxpayer dollars and the future of our country. 
   The oil and gas industry is extraordinarily well-established and well-off. I applaud it for being so. It does not need the American taxpayers' help to be successful or to make a dollar. There is not an American who goes to the gas pump that doesn't know that. Even President Bush, a former executive of an oil company, agrees that the industry does not need additional government subsidies when prices are this high. But our future energy resources do need help to get started. Renewable energy, alternative fuels, conservation and efficiency programs are underutilized in our effort to wean our Nation off our dependence on foreign oil. 
   The money saved by this bill will be spent on our energy future and set aside to, among other things, accelerate the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels; promote the use of energy efficiency practices and conservation; and increase research, development and deployment of clean renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. 
   By acting now to take this small but significant step to move toward making America energy independent, we have the opportunity, ladies and gentlemen of this House, to leave future generations a lasting legacy that makes our Nation and our world a better place. The legislation is a good first start in that effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. This legislation, introduced by Representative JOHN SARBANES, would provide sorely needed assistance to States, elementary and secondary schools and others to help teach our children about the environment and instill within them an appreciation and sense of stewardship for our planet. 
   The case for extending and enhancing environmental education is quite clear. Several recent studies indicate that students perform better in science, reading, math and social studies, when environmental education is integrated into the core curricula. Indeed, Hollywood Elementary School, located in Maryland's 5th Congressional District, was part of an intensive study by the State Education and Environment Roundtable published in 1998 that documented how 40 schools in 12 States achieved remarkable results by implementing an environmental education program. The study also found that environmental education increased students' enthusiasm for learning and enhanced their creative thinking skills. 
   Getting kids outdoors to exercise, play and experience their natural world is also an important tool to prevent childhood obesity, reduce attention deficit disorder, and address other related health problems. Research shows that kids today are spending more than 6 hours a day inside plugged in to electronics--but only minutes a day outdoors. That could have serious consequences for our children's physical and mental development. 
   Just as important, environmental education prepares children to be responsible stewards and citizens. We face enormous environmental challenges including global warming and pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. To take on those challenges, the next generation needs a solid understanding of environmental Science. 
   But even though environmental education is desperately needed, for all of those reasons, our Nation has seen it go into decline. In recent years, the overall level of federal support for environmental education in both policy and funding has unfortunately been woefully inadequate. 
   The No Child Left Inside Act seeks to remedy this situation by providing new support and funding for environmental education in the Nation's public schools in three areas: teacher training, enhanced programs, and the development and implementation of State environmental literacy plans. 
   Specifically, this legislation reauthorizes the National Environmental Education Act of 1990 and authorizes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Education and Training Program. It also creates a new National Capacity Environmental Education Grant Program to be administered by the Department of Education, awarding matched grant funds to local and State educational agencies, colleges and universities, and nonprofit groups to develop curricula, disseminate information about model programs, and increase the number of environmental educators. 
   Our looming environmental problems demand a strong generation of scientists, researchers, public servants, and citizens. By passing this bill, we can help to build that generation and improve our children's health and quality of life at the same time. 
   I commend Representative SARBANES for introducing this measure and I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting for the No Child Left Inside Act.

In other words, I think Mr. Skelton and Mr. Levin and the ranking members are working to see whether they can agree on a form of the bill that would then pass from here again to them, and they would then pass it finally. It's effectively a conference, but the Senate has not gone to conference. So we can't very well have a conference report if the Senate doesn't go to conference. But both Mr. Skelton and Mr. Levin and I believe the ranking members as well want to get the reauthorization bill done.

I expect it to be a CR, but I do expect to have additional items on that continuing resolution. The extent of that has not yet been determined. There's a lot of discussion, as I'm sure you're well aware  of discussion on your side as well, about things that people would like to have on the bill.

I have had discussions with the White House about items, some are called anomalies, that is, things that otherwise would have been done if we had done the regular bills, that the White House believes need to be done. There are a number of things that are being discussed of that kind. 
   In addition, we're going to have discussions about anything that we may need to do in the short term with reference to the extraordinary calamity that has confronted our economy. Whether anything addressing that will be in the CR or not is unclear at this point in time, but that's a possibility. 
   So I tell the gentleman, it will not be an omnibus in the sense that you and I understand an omnibus and the body understands an omnibus. For the most part, we will probably be looking at spending being at last year's levels for most of the items that we're talking about.

   Mr. HOYER. It is possible, but I think given the time frame that there is some concern about the time it will take to consider more lengthy pieces of legislation would impede getting the CR done. So that there may not be full bills, as I indicated. Obviously we do want to ensure funding of the government. We want to continue further operations of the government, both on the national defense side and the national security side, homeland security side, as well as all other departments of government. 
   At this point in time, I really can't answer that question, but I can tell you that my belief is at this point in time that we would be largely dealing with bills at last year's level.

   Mr. HOYER. I think mid-November is obviously an option. There have been discussions, as you know, on timing with the White House. I don't know whether you know, but I've had discussions with the White House on timing. I think they're relatively flexible on timing. Nobody has said this time or that time. There is obviously a wide variety of dates being discussed, mid-November being one. The Speaker and I, and I think Senator Reid has also expressed himself on this issue, but the Speaker and I are hoping that we would do a February date or even a March 1 date, so there would be some clarity in where we're going, whoever is elected President. 
   The date, though, is still obviously not resolved. We will have to discuss that with the White House and see what we can get through the House and the Senate, but November is obviously a possibility. 
   I will tell the gentleman we will be back here. I hope my office has had these discussions with you. But we're looking at, as we usually do, the week before Thanksgiving, about a week-and-a-half, 10 days after the election, the week of the 17th as the date when we would come back and organize, which would also be a week available for session if it was needed. 
   I might also add, if I could, further, that we had discussions today and we're all very, very concerned, and you and I are going to be meeting on it later tonight, very concerned with the economic conditions that confront our Nation at this point in time. So we are going to be ready to come back in October, if necessary, depending upon what discussions we have and what, hopefully together, in a bipartisan way, we believe needs to be done to respond to the crisis.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We've had discussions about this. As I said at my press conference on Tuesday, there have been no discussions about including that moratoria in a CR. I want to make it clear; there haven't been discussions about it that we won't or we will. My expectation is, though, we passed a bill, we think it is a good bill, we think it opens up drilling. And there will be some discussions both on the Senate side--we don't know what the Senate side is going to do with it--and with the White House on that issue. 
   We've had pretty open discussions with the White House on this issue. I know there's been a letter signed by a large number on your side about that issue. The White House is obviously sensitive to that, but I don't think that's going to be a stumbling block.

   Mr. HOYER. Those are some of the items that, yes, as I said, could well be added to the CR. We're going to have discussions. I'm going to have discussions with your side--with you, in particular--on this issue. 
   Again, I think there's nobody who wants to shut down government. And there's nobody, frankly, that doesn't want to make sure--for instance, let me give you an example: Unemployment insurance. We're very concerned about people who are going to be running out of their unemployment insurance. If we're not here, we want to make sure that there is authorization for the dollars--that are available, obviously--to be spent for extension benefits for people that run out because they can't find employment in the context in which we are now finding ourselves. So yes, that is possible.

   Mr. HOYER. Yes, sir. We won't be here on that particular date, or week, and therefore, we might have to make accommodations for that. 
   There are other things, obviously, that we have talked about that we are having concerns about: creating jobs, providing for jobs in our economy. We're doing a lot of investing in, some would say ``bailing out'' companies that had a whole lot of assets, but now we have people who don't have a whole lot of assets, have lost their home and who are facing heating bills that are spiking up very seriously, facing a tough time buying groceries because grocery prices have spiked, and they may be out of a job. 
   There are a number of issues that we are concerned about. We have been faced with Lehman Brothers and AIG  and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But there are a lot of little people who are having equal problems for them, and we want to make sure that we address them, and I know you do as well.

   As you know, we authorized, in the 2007 bill, $25 billion in guarantees for modernization to comply with more efficient automobiles, which we believe is a very important aspect of becoming energy independent, reducing the demand for petroleum products.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, today, the new Democratic Majority in the House has brought legislation to the Floor--the National Security FIRST Act--which will strengthen our national security by addressing a glaring deficiency that became public last year. 
   Many Members of Congress--and millions of Americans--were shocked when it was reported in 2006 that the Bush Administration had approved a deal allowing Dubai Ports World--a company owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates--to manage terminal operations at six major ports in the United States. 
   Let me be clear: There is nothing wrong with foreign investment in our nation. In fact, we have reason to encourage it. But what was shocking about the Dubai Ports World deal was that it was approved by the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States with only minimal review, and without the 45-day national security investigation that clearly should have occurred. 
   In fact, the deal was approved despite the fact that the Department of Homeland Security had raised security concerns. And, approval occurred without the input of senior Administration officials, such as the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security, and even the President himself. 
   Thus, today, I want to congratulate Chairman Frank of the Financial Services Committee for his strong leadership on this bipartisan legislation. In short, this bill addresses key failings in the current CFIUS review process. 
   First, it will require that in cases involving a company controlled by a foreign government that either the CFIUS Chairman (the Treasury Secretary) or the Vice-Chairman (the Homeland Security Secretary) certify that the transaction poses no national security threat, or that a 45-day security investigation occur after the initial 30-day review period. In cases where the second stage 45-day review applies, the bill requires the President to approve such transactions. 
   In addition, the bill improves CFIUS accountability to Congress. Recall that last year, Congress was not notified of the Dubai Ports World deal. Now, CFIUS must report to the committees of jurisdiction within five days after the final action on a CFIUS investigation. 
   Finally, this legislation requires that every transaction be subjected to an investigation by the Director of National Intelligence. 
   Again, this is important legislation that will strengthen our national security. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I met Andy Jacobs in the Young Democrats, many, many years ago. I drove Andy Jacobs to a speaking engagement at the Young Democrats at a restaurant not too far from the Baltimore Washington International Airport. A few years later I was elected to Congress, and Andy Jacobs was a Member of the Congress of the United States, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, an extraordinary Member of this House. And there came a time shortly thereafter when Andy decided to retire. And there were a number of people who expressed an interest in running for this seat. Andy came to me and he said JULIA CARSON's going to win this race. You be for JULIA CARSON. 
   Our beloved colleague, JOE DONNELLY has just said, she never lost a race. 
   Now, I didn't know JULIA CARSON. And there were some pretty active people, men and women, in that race; and we had met a couple of them. They were pretty impressive. I had not met JULIA CARSON. But Andy Jacobs, her predecessor, a Congressman for some 25 years, at least, said to me, JULIA CARSON's going to win this race. And sure enough, JULIA CARSON won the race. And those of us who served in this body had the privilege of getting to know JULIA CARSON, getting to know her as a friend, getting to know her as a colleague, getting to know her as a leader in her community. 
   I went to Indianapolis. I see my friend, my very, very close and dear friend Baron Hill here. Baron and I have been in Indianapolis a number of times, and I did a number of fund-raisers in Indianapolis for and with JULIA. And then in the last campaign I went out to Indianapolis to be with JULIA and we were at a senior citizens center, and it was the essence of JULIA CARSON. JULIA CARSON, who was sort of one of the most, ``acerbic'' is not the right word, I've been searching for the right word, but JULIA could be very direct. And there was no fooling around. You knew where JULIA stood and you knew what she was thinking. She didn't have time for just jiving. She knew what she wanted to say, she knew what she wanted to do and she told you. 
   And I went to the senior center, and I spoke on her behalf. But so many people were speaking on her behalf. It was thought to be a tough campaign. She won better than she was expected to win. But you got the essence of JULIA CARSON as you went around and talked to those seniors who had been active in the community for many, many years, as JULIA had been, who worked herself up to be a Member of Congress, but she was not appointed by anybody. 
   The community loved JULIA CARSON. And when I say the community, the community writ large, not the African American community, the white community, this community or that. The community, writ large, loved JULIA CARSON because she was honest, she was direct, she cared and she worked hard for her people. JULIA CARSON was an asset to her district, to Indianapolis, to Indiana, to this institution, the House of Representatives, and to our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (SUDAN ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, today the House is considering one of the most important human rights measures we have dealt with all year--a bill related to the world's worst ongoing humanitarian disaster, the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. This measure is about changing direction, showing the world that the United States will not stand idly by--as the international community shamefully did in Rwanda in 1994. This measure is inspired by the apartheid-era legislation that this Congress proudly initiated, which helped bring about the end of one of the most cruel, racist, violent regimes in modern history. 
   Next year marks the fifth anniversary of the genocide in Darfur. That is five years of raping  and pillaging, of displacement of millions of innocent men, women and children. Today, the question that we must ask ourselves as Americans, and as human beings, is this: Will we respond with apathy or with action to stop this ongoing tragedy? I submit that there can be only one answer: We--and by ``we'' I mean the international community--cannot and must not turn a blind eye to the Darfurians' suffering and plight. 
   Today's measure--the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007--is a call to action. It authorizes states, local governments and universities to divest from companies doing business in the military, power production, oil-related, or mineral extraction industries in partnership with the government of Sudan. Further, it provides safe harbor to mutual funds and pension plans choosing to divest their assets in such companies. And finally, it prohibits the federal government from entering into new federal contracts with these offending companies. No longer will Americans have to worry that their tax dollars are going to companies that support the inhumane regime in Khartoum. 
   The bill we will pass today and send to the President is just one piece of a multi-faceted effort to address the crisis in Darfur. This solution must include not only full and speedy implementation of the United Nations/African Union hybrid peacekeeping force, but also international support for a single, unified peacemaking process. I have been extremely disappointed in both the rebel leaders and government officials who continue to choose violence over peace and have declined to participate in peace talks. However, we must continue to push for progress toward a ceasefire and a viable political solution for this ravaged land. Finally, and equally importantly, a solution in Darfur must include a sustained and secure role for the courageous humanitarian workers, who risk their lives daily because they are so committed to alleviating the suffering of their fellow human beings. 
   I want to express my sincere gratitude to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who has been a leader in this Congress on the issue of Darfur, who traveled with me to Darfur in April, and who sponsored the original Darfur Divestment measure, H.R. 180--which I was so pleased to cosponsor and which passed the House 418 to 1. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HONORING DR. VINOD K. SHAH AND THE DOCTORS SHAH -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, rarely do I avail myself of this opportunity, but I do so today to recognize the extraordinary contributions of an extraordinary man, extraordinary woman and extraordinary family. 
   The holiday season is traditionally a season of giving. Today I would like to take just a few minutes to recognize the vital contributions of a man and his family who have continually given his time, his energy and his efforts to the residents of St. Mary's County and to southern Maryland, which I am honored to represent in this body, my dear and great friend Dr. Vinod K. Shah, affectionately known as Vinnie or V.K.       
   NOTICE
 X         
   Every so often an individual comes along who leaves an indelible mark on his or her community and the people around them. In southern Maryland, two such individuals are Dr. Shah and his wife, Dr. Shah. Her name is Ila. Together they established their medical practice in southern Maryland roughly 30 years ago when the citizens there were greatly in need of medical services. 
   We had some good doctors, but we needed more. Since then Vinnie and Ila have built a medical practice that has literally changed the face of health care in our region, expanding to become the largest private medical practice in the State of Maryland. 
   Dr. Shah's service and the service of his family to southern Maryland as well as our Nation's dependence on foreign-born doctors, particularly in rural America, was recounted in a front-page story in the Washington Post on December 7, 2007. 
   As Richard Martin, who was the head of St. Mary's County Hospital when Dr. Shah arrived, told the Post, and I quote, ``It was just like miracle workers had walked in. I told them, `You are the answer to my prayers.' '' 
   The Shahs epitomize family values. Vinod and Ila recruited family and friends, including Vinod's eight siblings, each of whom is a doctor or is married to one. 
   When I refer to the Shah family, let me just recite their names, all family, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters, giving service in this country to our people: 
   Dr. Vinod Shah. 
   His wife, Dr. Ila Shah. 
   Dr. Mamesh P. Shah. 
   Dr. Anil K. Shah. 
   Dr. Amish Shah, Dr. Shah's son. 
   Dr. Deepak K. Shah. 
   Dr. Arpana Shah, his daughter-in-law. 
   Dr. Umed K. Shah. 
   Dr. Nayan Shah. 
   Dr. Atul Shah. 
   Dr. Avani Shah. 
   Dr. Dhiren Shah. 
   Dr. Beena Shah. 
   Dr. Jyoti D. Shah. 
   It is an amazing list, and it doesn't end there, with his daughter doing her residency and her husband doing his residency. The Shahs epitomize family values. As I said, they are an extraordinary family. 
   Today, Shah Associates is a growing practice that includes 65 physicians in 10 locations, and which recently announced that it will partner with specialists from Georgetown University Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center in a planned 32,000 square-foot addition to his medical center. 
   Leslie Miller, who heads the cardiac program at both hospitals, told the Washington Post, referring to Shah Associates, ``They are a model of health care of the future. These guys, on their own, using their own money, have put together this extraordinary system. We want to extend what they have done.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the manner in which Dr. Shah operates Shah Associates is an accurate reflection of this generous and good man and the values that he and his family hold and demonstrate to all of us daily. This medical practice is truly a family affair, as I have noted, and accepts all those who need care, regardless of their ability to pay. I have heard extraordinary stories from my constituents about the extent to which the Shah family has gone to help them, the care that they have extended. 
   I have known Dr. Shah for many years. He is my next-door neighbor. He is one of my closest friends. He, his wife, his son, his daughter, his son-in-law and daughter-in-law are all very close. 
   Without doubt, he is one of the most decent, honorable and honest men that I have ever met. His wife, Ila, reflects that same character, as do his children, their spouses and his extended family, his brothers and sisters, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. He is not only my friend and my neighbor, but he is a friend and neighbor to the entire community in southern Maryland. He has touched countless lives over the years, and the difference he has made, that his family have made, that Shah Associates have made, cannot be overstated. 
   Let me say, too, that Dr. Shah's success is a quintessential American story in which a husband and wife, both immigrants, both physicians, come to our Nation and through hard work, intelligence, merit and reputation become, quite literally, the backbone of the community. Gandhi once remarked, ``Be the change you want to see in the world.'' 
   Vinod Shah, Ila Shah and their family have lived this philosophy to the fullest. They saw a dire need and, rather than turn their back or leave the problem to someone else, they embraced a great challenge and have made an immeasurable, positive, extraordinary contribution. They faced discrimination, rejection and challenge. 
   Their positive, unflagging, and extraordinary talented effort has resulted in their being embraced by their community, which they have served so well. They brought hope and care and service, and they have enriched the lives of all whom they have touched. 
   I want to thank Vinod and Ila as well as all the physicians and providers at Shah Associates for the incredible service that they have delivered to residents of St. Mary's County and to the entire southern Maryland area, and, indeed, a broader reach as well. 
   Dr. Vinod Shah is the vice president of the Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. I presume, in a short period of time, he will be their leader. He will be an extraordinary representative of an extraordinary group of people who, like so many immigrants before them, have responded to America's welcome and have made such an extraordinary difference. We are all the better and healthier for it.  
   Born in India, Transforming Rural MD.--Extended Family of Medical Specialists Helps St. Mary's Thrive  
   St. Mary's County was once a place where no doctor wanted to settle. In the 1970s, the county hospital used decades-old equipment, struggled to make payroll and had no full-time specialists--not even an obstetrician, although more than 600 babies were born there each year. 
   Then came Vinod K. and Ila Shah, Bombay-educated and D.C.-trained husband-and-wife doctors who were eager to open a practice in the rural area. They had heard about St. Mary's from Vinod's younger brother and were enticed by the potential impact that even a small practice could have there. 
   ``It was just like miracle workers walked in,'' said Richard Martin, 92, who was then head of the hospital. ``I told them, `You are the answer to my prayers.' '' 
   The couple was soon joined by Vinod's younger brother, Umed K. Shah, a gastroenterologist. Next came two family friends. A few years later, another brother arrived, cardiologist Anil K. Shah, with his wife, Beena Shah, a neurologist. 
   In time, Vinod and Ila Shah recruited more friends and family, including the rest of Vinod's eight siblings, each of whom is a doctor or is married to one. They built the largest private specialty practice in Southern Maryland, Shah Associates, which has treated about 90,000 of St. Mary's 110,000 residents. 
   For many years, foreign-born doctors have been the unlikely medical backbone of rural America. In the 1970s, the United States actively recruited them, promoting the opportunities available in remote areas avoided by many U.S.-born physicians. Then, starting in the 1990s, a visa waiver program promised to fast-track doctors to a green card if they worked in a rural area for at least three years. 
   Today, at least 23 percent of practicing doctors in the United States attended a foreign medical school, and almost all of those practitioners were born overseas. But recent changes in visa policy have had the unintended consequence of slowing the flow of foreign-born doctors to rural areas, a trend that Shah is, in small ways, resisting. 
   Two generations of Shah doctors see patients who span several generations of Southern Maryland families. ``We come here for everything,'' Navy retiree Paul Hailor said at their main office in Hollywood, Md. ``My fiancee is down the hall waiting for a pulmonary appointment. Kids come here for MRIs, CAT scans.'' 
   Nurses and patients have a system for keeping all of the Shahs straight. They use initials for the four Shah brothers: Dr. V.K. the cardiologist; Dr. U.K. the gastroenterologist; Dr. D.K. the child psychiatrist; and Dr. A.K., another cardiologist. The other Shahs, especially the four with names beginning with `A,' often go by their first name: Dr. Amish the cardiologist, also V.K.'s son; his wife, Dr. Arpana the dermatologist; Dr. Beena the neurologist; Dr. Jyoti the sleep specialist. 
   ``Every once in a while, we get someone calling in wanting to talk to `Dr. Shah,' '' said Betsy Warren, a registered nurse who has worked for Shah Associates for 16 years. ``You ask them, `Which Dr. Shah?' And they say, `The one with dark hair.' '' 
   To Southern Maryland, the Shah family has imported distinctive aspects of Indian culture: colorful saris, lavish parties for hundreds stocked with huge trays of vegetarian  Indian food and recitals featuring classical Indian dances. 
   Family members say it took years to earn the trust of the community, but once they did, the practice quickly grew. Some local doctors who once viewed the Shahs as competition eventually joined the practice. 
   Each time the nearby Patuxent River Naval Base added employees, the practice received a wave of patients. The practice's offices, where employees had once been asked to park in front so business would appear brisk, were soon overflowing. 
   In 1995, V.K. Shah found an empty lot on Route 235 in Hollywood. Two years later, he opened the Philip J. Bean Medical Center, dedicating it to a late local physician who he said ``delivered half the county.'' 
   ``We said `Let's name it after someone who means something to this community,' '' Shah said. ``I think people should feel good about this place--it should mean something to them.'' 
   But the facility that felt like a palace then is already too small, and the practice with 65 physicians in 10 locations, is scrambling to recruit more doctors. ``Demand is so high across the board,'' said Shah, 66. ``I can't retire.'' 
   Plans were announced last week for a 32,000-square-foot addition to the medical center. The extra space will allow specialists from Georgetown University Hospital and Washington Hospital Center to practice there as part of a new partnership. 
   Because Shah Associates provides so much of the medical care in the region, the partnership will allow the universities to study health patterns over generations, said Leslie Miller, head of the cardiac program at both hospitals. 
   Shah Associates has compiled its patients' medical records into a database that allows it to track the medical histories of families and look for early warning signs in younger generations. Such locally comprehensive databases might one day help researchers better understand such hereditary conditions as heart problems, he said. 
   ``They are a model of the health care of the future,'' Miller said. ``These guys, on their own, using their own money, have put together this extraordinary system....... We want to extend what they have done.'' 
   But in many areas that are more rural than Southern Maryland, as in many inner cities, the gap between medical needs and resources remains great, despite government efforts. 
   In 1994, Congress made foreign doctors who train in the United States while holding a so-called J-1 visa eligible to apply for a green card if they practiced for at least three years in underserved areas. The program, which exempts J-1 holders from a required return home for two years after their training is complete, has placed thousands of doctors in inner-city and rural communities, as well as in prisons. 
   They continue to flood the United States with residency applications, but each year the program receives fewer applications and fills fewer spots. Last year, only 900 of the 1,620 available waivers were issued. 
   Rural health experts attribute much of that drop to the popularity of another visa, the H-1B, which allows U.S. companies to temporarily sponsor highly skilled foreign workers in such fields as medicine, architecture and science. 
   In 2000, to make more H-1B visas available for technology companies, Congress exempted research institutions and universities, including their hospitals, from a cap on the hard-to-get visas. The popularity of the J-1 waiver program plummeted, and the pipeline that once channeled doctors to underserved areas narrowed. 
   Today, no medical facilities in Southern Maryland are eligible to sponsor physicians under the J-1 waiver program. A majority of the nearly 30 Maryland primary medical care centers designated as having a specialist shortage are in Baltimore. The District has 13 sites, including the D.C. jail. Virginia has nearly 120, two of which are in the Washington area. 
   With baby boomers beginning to retire, the American Medical Association says, the country could be short as many as 200,000 doctors before 2020--a shortage that is expected to hurt already-underserved areas the most. 
   V.K. Shah, who is also vice president of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said a shortage could be prevented by drastically increasing the number of medical schools in the United Sates, relying more on nurses and nurse practitioners or by allowing more qualified international medical graduates to practice in the United States. 
   But to practice, foreign doctors must first complete training in a U.S. residency program, for which spots are scarce. Last year, 46 percent of foreign applicants received residencies, compared with 93 percent of American graduates, according to the National Resident Match Program, which facilitates the application process for more than 1,000 U.S. institutions. 
   Each year, Shah Associates hosts a handful of graduates from foreign medical schools, encouraging them to seek opportunities beyond big cities. This summer, four recent graduates of Mumbai medical schools traveled to Southern Maryland on tourist visas for an unpaid crash course in American medicine. 
   The graduates watched as the Shahs cracked jokes with their patients, reassured them about upcoming operations and gently recommended diet changes. Mitesh Lotia, 24, one of the graduates, said that the one-on-one interaction held great appeal. 
   ``In India, we would see 100, 150 patients a day,'' he said. ``There was no time to get to know patients. I want to practice here. I'll go anywhere.''

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day for the House of Representatives; it's a historic day for the  Dean of the House; it's a historic day for the leadership of this House; and it will be, I think, viewed as a very important day for America and our energy independence and for our effort to keep our environment sustainable. 
   I want to thank and congratulate the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I said this when we last considered the bill on this floor; no Member of this body has focused more on energy and energy policy, energy independence, throughout the years than has the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell. 
   Save for his singular focus on ensuring the health of all Americans and their availability of affordable health care, quality health care, his focus on energy and energy independence and efficient use of energy has been unmatched, and I congratulate him for that. 
   As he said when this bill passed out of the House, it wasn't the perfect bill. There are many of us in this House who would have hoped that the Senate would not have removed some of the items that were in this bill when it came from the House. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, this landmark bipartisan legislation, the Energy Independence and Security Act, represents a vital turning point for our Nation and a historic accomplishment for this Congress. 
   Today, we set a new direction for this country in the area of energy policy. Our Nation's energy policy is inextricably linked to our national security, our economic security, and our environmental well-being. 
   And, I have long believed that we must summon our national will, resources and ingenuity to make significant gains in technology, conservation, vehicle efficiency, and the use of alternative fuels in order to end our reliance on foreign oil and other important sources of energy. To that extent, this bill was and remains a vital national security interest. 
   With this legislation, we will move toward real energy independence that results in a stronger economy, more jobs, and healthier communities. The Chairs and ranking members that worked tirelessly to produce this bill are also to be congratulated. 
   Under the leadership of Chairman Dingell, as I have said, this bill includes historic fuel economy, renewable fuels, and energy efficiency provisions. 
   The increase in the fuel efficiency of vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 is the first in a generation, and is supported by environmentalists and the automobile industry, in no small part because of the work of Chairman Dingell. 
   Furthermore, it will result in $22 billion in net annual consumer savings by 2020 and reduce greenhouse gases in an amount equal to taking off the road 28 million of today's average cars and trucks. 
   Among other things, this bill will reduce our reliance on foreign oil by investing in the production and infrastructure needed to deploy homegrown biofuels. It provides incentives for plug-in hybrid cars. And it includes landmark energy efficiency provisions that will save consumers and businesses at least $300 billion through 2030. 
   Let no one be mistaken, this bill, while comprehensive, does not represent the totality of our energy policy. There is still much more to do, and we will be about that business. 
   For example, we should take up legislation to establish a renewable portfolio standard and extend the production tax credit, and do so promptly. We also should continue to work across the aisle and with the Senate to reach further consensus on issues such as the use of renewables, the development of new technologies, and the fiscally responsible extension of needed energy tax provisions. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we started this session, we started it on a historic note and swore in the first woman Speaker in the history of America, in the history of this House of over 200 years. As she was sworn in, we had literally scores of children who surrounded the Speaker. And she intoned that this would be the ``children's Congress,'' it would be the ``children's Congress,'' and it would look to the future, not the past. And this bill looks to the future of energy use, of energy efficiency, of energy security, and of the health of this tiny globe on which all of us survive and hopefully thrive. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a historic turning point in America's energy policy. And I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for our children, for our future, for our security, vote for this historic piece of legislation. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. 
   Jim Oberstar is one of the most knowledgeable people in America on energy issues and on transportation issues. And the two, of course, are closely related. I want to thank him for his leadership and for his service. We are fortunate, as an American people, to have him chairing this critically important committee. 
   There is no stronger proponent of rail service and mass transit than Jim Oberstar. That service has never been more important than it is today. His vision and his service have put this country in a place where we now have the opportunity to make additional investment which is critically needed so that the demand for mass transit resulting from the cost of gasoline and energy products can be met by our mass transit system. And I thank him for his leadership. 
   This bill, as well as the other two bills considered on this floor today on drilling and market speculation, is a clear recognition by this House majority that America's energy policy cannot be one dimensional. 
   We've heard a lot of finger pointing on the floor today, and finger pointing is relatively easy. The fact of the matter is we all need to come together. I don't just mean Republicans and Democrats and the Congress of the United States, but all 300 million of us in this country need to come together and understand that we have 3 percent of the world's oil supply and 25 percent of the demand. It does not take a great mathematician to understand, therefore, that simply drilling for new product will not solve our problem. That is not to say by any stretch of the imagination that that should not be done. 
   These bills, taken together, and when combined with other actions taken by the majority on energy, are a clear reflection of the alternative to the Republicans' sole focus on drilling, to the exclusion of alternative and renewable sources of energy. 
   Let no one be mistaken: Democrats do not oppose further drilling, discovery and production of product, period. All we are saying, as I will explain in more detail shortly, is that the oil and gas companies should utilize the 68 million acres--that's 68 million acres--currently available to drill on which contain, according to experts, over 100 billion barrels of oil. And we use about 7.5 billion a year in this country, so that is approximately 14 years of oil. That's what the experts tell us, not Democrats and Republicans, the experts tell us are available on these untapped resources currently available, currently leased. I would tell my friends that, not only that, but they contain hundreds of millions of cubic feet of natural gas. 
   Now, as to Chairman Oberstar's bill: It promises Americans relief from our $4 per gallon gas prices. Tomorrow? No. Next week? No. Next month? No. Very frankly, we have been too long delaying our investment in alternative energy sources and alternative transportation modes. But it does promise that in the future we will have the capability both to provide mass transit for our people, and to provide for the alternative to lower demand which, therefore, should lower prices as well. 
   It authorizes $1.7 billion over the next 2 years to provide grants to mass transit authorities to reduce public transit fares and will help transit agencies deal with escalating costs. That is a rational response to increased demand. 
   In just the first 3 months of this year, Americans took almost 85 million more trips on public transit than in the same period the year before. Surely all of us in this body, faced with 85 million additional trips, will want to respond in a way that provides capacity to accommodate that growth. 
   Public transit reduces America's oil consumption as well as carbon dioxide emissions. Thankfully, the administration has, very late, come to the conclusion that, yes, global warming is a problem. Unfortunately, for 7-plus years of this administration they denied it was a problem, but coming to the right conclusion late is always timely. 
   In addition, the legislation on market speculation that was introduced by Chairman Peterson and Congressman Van Hollen is an effort which I hope every Member of this body will support to address this issue, record high gas prices, from another angle. 
   Oil producers are telling us they believe that a large portion of the price is related to speculation. Can I guarantee they're right? No, I cannot. Am I an expert on this issue? I am not. But I do know that they have said that is the case. If it is the case, it's incumbent upon us to find out, because if it is, and we can reduce prices for the consumer at the pump, they expect us to do so and we want to do so. 
   The Bush administration, of course, insists that the spike in gas prices is not attributable to market speculation. That may be why the commission that is supposed to oversee this has not acted as vigorously as they otherwise might. George Soros, a very successful investor, has said this: ``The crude oil market has been significantly affected by speculation.'' 
   The legislation that we will vote on shortly simply directs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to use its full authority and emergency tools to curtail excessive speculation and other practices distorting the energy market. Why would any Member of this body vote against asking this commission to look at that issue to determine whether or not there is validity? If there is not, presumably the commission will so find. 
   Finally, about Chairman Rahall's bill, let me simply say this: What could make more common sense than saying to the oil and gas companies that they should drill or pursue drilling on the 68 million acres of Federal land currently under lease or simply lose those leases? After all, they are leased for the purposes of us producing more product. If they lie fallow and are not being worked, not being investigated, not being explored, not being tapped, then the American consumer finds a dwindling or short supply. And what happens in that context? Prices go up. And yes, oil companies make record profits, but consumers lose. This bill simply says to the oil companies, be diligent in the development of what you have or lose the lease to someone who will pursue the discovery and production of oil. 
   Democrats believe that we need to find product. I mentioned the 68 million acres that you've heard a lot about, that's a lot of acres. But there is an additional 23 million acres in Alaska, 22 million of which is under congressional set-aside for oil production and discovery. Nine hundred thousand acres have already been leased for that purpose. And experts tell us there is more oil there than there is in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge, but our Republican friends continue to focus on the Alaskan Refuge. 
   Let no one be mistaken: The oil companies have many acres to look at onshore and offshore. According to the Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management, these 68 million acres on land and waters, 74  percent of which we have already leased, are not producing oil and gas. 
   Our Republican friends have also charged that we're keeping the best lands out of the hands of oil and gas companies. That is not the case. They can say it again and again and again and again, but it's not the case. In fact, 81 percent--I hope all of my colleagues hear this, and I hope the American public will read the Record--81 percent of estimated oil and gas resources on Federal lands and the Outer Continental Shelf are presently available for development. And here, perhaps, is the most important fact: These resources are equal, as I said, to 107 billion barrels of oil and 658 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That is 10 times the amount of economically recoverable oil that could be produced from opening up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and more than 14 years of current U.S. oil consumption. 
   Finally, Madam Chairman, let me say that there is no silver bullet, we all understand that; to pretend otherwise would be dishonest. We need to be honest with the American public. Unfortunately, for over a quarter of a century we have had mostly administrations or Republican control of the House and the Senate which essentially said that drilling more oil and not looking for alternatives was the policy they wanted to pursue. 
   When we got here, we passed an energy bill that focuses on alternatives. If we only have 3 percent, we have 25 percent of the demand, you can bet your sweet life that those who have the oil all over this world are going to say to us, you pay us what we tell you to pay us. And not until we pursue policies--which this administration has failed to do, which this Republican leadership failed to do--not until that time will we be able to say to our friends and, indeed, some not so friendly, we're not going to pay your price because we have alternatives. We have mass transit provided by Jim Oberstar. We have alternative energies provided by the bill that we passed. We are expecting electricity--which the Republicans oppose--to be produced by alternatives. We have renewable fuel standards passed in this House, sent to the Senate. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this House, we have taken significant steps last year, we're taking significant steps today, and we will continue to take significant steps so that America will be energy independent. That's in the best interest of our national security, our economic security and, indeed, it is critically important for our global health. 
   The bills we are considering on this House floor today are key components of a comprehensive energy strategy that seeks to provide Americans with relief at the gas pump while we wean our Nation from its dangerous addiction to foreign oil. The President said we're addicted to foreign oil. And yet there was a meeting on energy in 2001, just after the President became the Chief Executive, and they convened oil company executives to tell us, what should our policies be? One of my colleagues said, well, whatever they said--because the meetings were secret--their policies failed. Perhaps. Perhaps they failed. One cannot inevitably draw that conclusion, however, because those same companies, 7 years later, are making the greatest profits they have made in the history of their companies. Perhaps their policies failed, or perhaps their policies led to success. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we need to pursue mass transit and invest in expanding it so we can meet the demand of our consumers and of our citizens and of our energy independence. 
   I thank the gentleman for his leadership. And I urge my colleagues to vote for all three of these critically important bills. Are they the sole solution? They are not. Are they the only solution? They are not. Are they the solutions that we will take and then stop? They are not. But they are a step, each and every one of them, in the right direction. Let's take those steps today. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these three bills.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the American public know this game. The gentlelady, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, has just made it clear. Gas prices were $1.46 when President Bush took over the White House, when the Republicans took over the House, when the Senate was taken over by the Republicans. Gas prices are now $3.51. Two oil men reside in the White House and in the vice presidency. 
   Nothing, of course, is your fault, because we have been here, after all, for 14 months. We, of course, have had most of that which we have wanted to pass on economics vetoed by the President. But what we wanted to pass on energy, we agreed with the President and worked on an energy package to get us to independence. 
   Now I want to talk to my side. We know this is a game. We know this is pure politics. We know there wants to be a 30-second ad to say somehow we voted against bringing gas prices down. That is patently absurd, and the American people are too smart for that. The American people are too smart. 
   I urge my colleagues on my side; I don't know that I will get any votes on this side, but this is a game, and it is a game that has gone on for too long. I asked for unanimous consent, but Mr. Price knows this is a game so he wouldn't give me unanimous consent to include this in the bill and pass it this very night. That is not what you want to do. You want a political ad. 
   So I am asking everybody on my side--the House wanted to be in order, I heard from over there. I am asking everybody on my side not to play this game, because it will never end. Don't play this game. Don't fool the American public. This is about sending this bill back to committee. It will take weeks to bring it back. The small business community deserves this bill. Support this bill. Reject this cynical political maneuver on this floor tonight.

I think it's one of the few opportunities I get to make people a little bit happy. But we will save 20 minutes of debate. We will do all but 20 minutes of the allocated debate. There are four sides to this. Five, five, five and five, we will save for tomorrow, and we will commence that at the conclusion of the 1-minutes. There are 10 a side. So that will take about 20, 25 minutes, and we will commence the closing of debate, and then we will have the vote on this bill immediately following that debate.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California, the chairman of the committee, for yielding the time. 
   Madam Chairman, America was regaled today by the President of France, and he talked about America's values. He said that is why the world loves America, because of its values. 
   Now, whether all the world loves America's actions all the time is another question, but they know that one of our cardinal values was that we believe that all men and women are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. No one in America believes that you can pursue life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness without the opportunity to have employment. 
   In America, we have discriminated historically against various groups of people. Some because of the color of their skin. Some because of their gender. Some because of their religion. Some because of their ethnic origin. There have been all sorts of reasons throughout our history that we have discriminated against people.     
   Madam Chairman, for more than 200 years our great Nation has fought for and advanced the timeless values and ideals that are embodied in our constitution: fairness, justice and equality under law. 
   And today through this bipartisan legislation, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, we again take a momentous step in breaking down centuries of rank injustice, unthinking prejudice, and unjustified discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans. 
   It could be gays and lesbians, it could be African Americans, it could be Catholics, it could be Baptists like me. We have all been discriminated against  from time to time. It could be a Jew. It could be somebody of any other arbitrary distinction. 
   What this country really believes is that we should not discriminate against anybody. It so happens this bill describes one somebody, but it really refers to everybody. And it really is saying in this just Nation, we believe in equal opportunity. 
   When the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it prohibited employment discrimination based on race and gender; discrimination that often was open and far too often regarded as acceptable. 
   Frankly, my colleagues, as we sit here in this Chamber, hopefully all 435 of us believe that if we had lived in another time a half a century ago or perhaps a century ago, we would have even then thought it was wrong to discriminate against somebody because of the color of their skin. But we know that too many of our predecessors voted to allow and to further discrimination against people because of their color. 
   I presume that some of those looked back after their service in this body maybe 10 or 20 years later and said, I am historically sorry that I cast that discriminatory vote. I hope that none of my colleagues find themselves in that place today or tomorrow, and tomorrow or 10 years from now. 
   We have expanded the scope of the law's protection to prohibit employment discrimination based on religion, color, national origin, and disability. Today, through this historic civil rights legislation, we would simply add sexual orientation as a protected class, because even in 2007, there is little doubt that gay and lesbian Americans are too often the object of discrimination, not because of their actions but because of who they are. America believes that's wrong. That's what President Sarkozy was saying today. 
   Madam Chairman, let us be clear. This legislation is consistent with our values, our ideals, and America's long history of social progress. Thus, the question before us today is not only whether we will choose to do the right thing and pass this bill, but whether we will choose to stand on the right side of history; saying to some of our fellow citizens yes, you may be different than we are, but you are entitled by our Constitution and by our God and by our values to equal treatment under law. 
   This legislation, in fact, is the logical extension of the law in some 20 States that prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. I should note that the Federal Government, we have taken that action. All the people who work for us, we bar discrimination against them based upon sexual orientation. 
   Madam Chairman, as the lead House sponsor of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, I harbor no illusions that this legislation will topple centuries of prejudice overnight or that we can legislate that prejudice out of existence. That is probably not possible. But what we can do, what we ought to in fairness do this day is say that it is not lawful in the United States to have that prejudice prevent the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of opportunities offered by this great, fair and just Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand with great pride, to vote against discrimination in this great, just land we call America.

   My friend will ask the rhetorical parliamentary question in a few minutes that he has asked every time we have done this, and every time this process is political only. 
   If it were substantive, I tell the gentleman from New York, if you wanted to accomplish this objective, you may get the votes on this side, but you will not get the votes on this side to kill this bill. 
   We have now taken 50 hours longer on consideration of appropriation bills than we did last year with unanimous consents from Mr. Obey. You can groan, but the people who are looking for these funds, the people who want the benefits of this bill, the people who understand the work on both sides of the aisle that has gone into fashioning this bill, the people who have seen us vote on rejecting amendment after amendment on substantive grounds that you offered, and you could have offered this amendment, of course, as well, know full well this is a political process, not a substantive process. Reject this process. Let us move on with the business of the American people. Let's do what they sent us here to do. Let's act. Reject this motion.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker and Members of this House, I said that last Monday would be a day of consequence. It was a day of consequence. We have been criticized as a body for not deciding affirmatively on Monday. What we did decide, however, was that initial failure should not stand because the crisis confronting our country was too great. And Republicans and Democrats together, administration and Congress, chairman and ranking member, each individual Member decided that failure was not an option. 
   On Monday, the dividing line in this House was not between parties--it was between those who believed the dangers of doing nothing outweighed their  reservation about Monday's bill and those who had yet to be convinced. 
   Since then, I believe that the number of the convinced that this action is essential has grown. Some were convinced when a vote in the Chamber led to the evaporation of $1.2 trillion of wealth in about 120 seconds; some were convinced when they heard that America lost another 159,00 jobs last month making a total of lost jobs this year of 760,000 jobs. In a similar period 8 years ago, we had gained 1.5 million jobs--a net turnaround of over 2.2 million jobs. 
   Americans are in trouble. They're expecting us to act. 
   Some were convinced by the stories like this one from a small town car dealer in Utah. He said this: ``I'm not going to be able to pay my employees next week. I can't get the kind of credit line from the bank that I have had through my entire career unless you do something.'' 
   This bill outreaches not only to minorities but to small businesses as well. And I thank the gentlelady from California for her focus on that issue and Mr. Bachus for his focus on that issue. 
   What happens on Wall Street is bound up with the jobs of millions on Main Street, and the retirement of millions on Main Street, and the homes of millions in hometown America, and dreams of millions of our fellow Americans.     
   If disaster strikes those few square miles in Manhattan, it will surely spread until every one of those jobs and retirements and homes and dreams are put at great risk. 
   This week I've heard from the Prime Ministers of Australia and Japan who are telling us that their people are bracing themselves, worried that America will not rise to the occasion. I am proud to be a Member of this House, and when challenged, I believe this House rises to its responsibilities and I believe it will do so today. 
   We sing the praises of American leadership, and today, I think we will deserve that praise. This is the responsibility that comes with our duty as Representatives in the people's House. For all of those reasons, this bill is essential. 
   So many of us have improved the administration's plan, Republicans and Democrats, working together, which came to us as a mere three-page bill, giving essentially a $700 billion blank check to the administration. Republicans and Democrats knew as one that that could not stand. 
   The heart of the bill remains a plan for the government to buy up bad financial assets, restoring the flow of credit so essential to the growth and maintenance of our economy. 
   But we fought to ensure that taxpayers will be the first to profit if and when those assets rise again in value, making the true price tag of this bill far, far less than $700 billion. 
   In fact, Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in the history of America, has said this, ``If they do it right, and I think they'll do it reasonably right''--his expectation is that we will do it reasonably right--he said, if we do that, we'll make a lot of money, we being the taxpayers of America. 
   So we have the opportunity not only to save our economy, to save those dreams of our fellow citizens, but also to make some profit. 
   In addition, we made sure the financial community will be obligated to pay the taxpayers back for their loan. 
   We restricted executive compensation because CEOs whose recklessness helped bring on this crisis should not receive taxpayer-subsidized golden parachutes or extraordinary salaries. 
   We are subjecting the Treasury Secretary's decisions to strong oversight. Republicans and Democrats together agreed that that should be done. 
   Finally, we will help homeowners renegotiate their mortgages to prevent a further flood of 2 million projected foreclosures. That's what this bill is about. That is the action we are asked to take today. 
   On Wednesday, the Senate raised Federal insurance of bank accounts from $100,000 to $250,000, and also chose to add several tax cuts. I personally believe that raising the FDIC can be argued on both sides of the question, but certainly, it ought to stabilize our local banks. However, as all of you know, I strongly disagree with adding those tax provisions because the Senate has chosen to finance them with debt. 
   This crisis is making it painfully clear the dangers of fiscal recklessness and that debt does indeed matter. A lesson, in my opinion, the Senate has ignored. 
   But an emergency like this calls for the courage to compromise. On Monday, Chairman Frank said, ``If we aren't prepared to accept some of the things we don't like, we will not have the power to deliver for the people we care about.'' The chairman was absolutely right. For me, those people are families unable to take out a loan to buy an appliance or pay for college. They are Americans who have worked their whole lives only to see their retirement accounts threatened. They are the millions of workers fearing a pink slip they did nothing to earn. For their sake, for their sake, we must act. 
   I urge all of us to pass this legislation. I urge all of us to vote for this legislation. I know there will be some who will not vote for this legislation. I want them to know that I respect their judgment. We have a difference of opinion. 
   On Monday, America was deeply divided, and their representative body, not surprisingly, was deeply divided. In the last 4 days, Americans in small towns, on farms, in urban areas and suburban areas have reflected upon the consequences of inaction, and while they have not come to the universal thought that we ought to pass this bill, they have told us in the strongest terms we expect the people's House to act in a way that they think best to save our economy, to protect our dreams, to make America whole again.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am pleased to follow my friend Mr. Murphy who just spoke, with whom I agree entirely. This will be a cost savings. I want to congratulate as well PATRICK KENNEDY and JIM RAMSTAD, one a Democrat and one a Republican. 
   But this is not a partisan issue. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is an issue of human beings. It is an issue of people that need help and have been denied it, people who are one of us, as Mr. Murphy so eloquently and correctly pointed out. 
   I rise in strong support of this legislation. I strongly support this long overdue bipartisan legislation to end discrimination against patients seeking treatment for mental illness. Mr. Kennedy spoke of that discrimination. 
   I want to commend Congressman Kennedy and my friend Congressman Ramstad. Congressman Ramstad is going to be leaving us, but he has been one of the best Members that has served in this body, who looks at issues on their merits, not on partisanship. We all ought to do that. 
   This legislation, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, now has 274 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. Under this bill, an insurer or group health plan must ensure that any financial requirements such as deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and out-of-pocket expenses which apply to mental health and addiction treatments are no more restrictive or costly than the financial requirements applied to comparable medical and surgical benefits that the plan confers.  
   Why does it do that? It does it because in America we want healthy people; not physically healthy people or mentally healthy people, but people who are physically and mentally healthy, because obviously there is an extraordinary relationship between the two. Under this bill, we will accomplish that end. 
   It also requires equity in treatment limits. This means that the treatment limits, such as the frequency of treatment, number of visits and days of coverage applied to mental health and addiction benefits, are no more restrictive than the treatment limits applied to comparable medical and surgical benefits. Why? Again, because we want to effect the health of the individuals we are serving. 
   It is important to note that this bill only applies to insurers and group health plans that provide mental health benefits. That is, it does not require plans that do not currently offer mental health benefits to do so. It simply says, if you provide mental health benefits, do so equitably and fairly and equally. That is why PATRICK KENNEDY referred to this as a civil rights bill. It is a civil rights bill. 
   It also exempts businesses with 50 or fewer employees and businesses that experience an overall premium increase of 2 percent or more in the first year and 1 percent in subsequent years. We believe that perhaps will not happen, but it provides for it. 
   Research has shown that there has been no significant cost increase attributable to the parity requirement in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which has made parity coverage for mental health care available to more than 8 1/2 million Federal employees for 8 years. So we have had experience at this. This is not a radical departure. This is, however, the provision of equal treatment. 
   Furthermore, this bill's enforcement mechanisms are real, permitting the IRS to enforce and levy fines and penalties on plans for disallowing employers from deducting health care costs as an expense. 
   The two offsets in this bill were included in the Children's Health and Medical Protection Act, or the CHAMP Act, which passed the House last August. The first increases the rebate or discount that drug companies are required to provide State Medicaid programs for drugs provided for Medicaid beneficiaries. The second prohibits physicians from referring patients to hospitals in which they have an ownership interest, with the ability to grandfather existing physician-owned hospitals. 
   It is telling, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is supported by, among others, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association. 
   On the steps of the Capitol in a press conference with the Speaker, with Mrs. Rosalynn Carter, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad, as well as David Wellstone, I said that the United Negro College Fund has a wonderful phrase that it uses, and that phrase is that ``a mind is a terrible thing to waste.'' That is so very accurate. And if a mind is a terrible thing to waste, it is a terrible thing not to treat, as we would treat the broken arm or the diabetes or any other physical ailment. 
   This bill makes America healthier. This bill will save money. This bill makes good sense, morally and economically. Support this vital piece of legislation.

   Of course, as he knows, it was only 38 days ago that the President made his last request for an addition to the supplemental, and 94 days sounds like longer than I think it has been. But notwithstanding that, we do expect the supplemental to be on the floor next week. That is our expectation. If things go as we hope, the supplemental will be on the floor, and, hopefully, we can get that to the President either very late next week or no later than a week from this coming Monday. We think that is important. 
   As you know, you and I and others were down at the White House to discuss whether there was room for agreement and accommodation on this issue. We are still having those discussions, as you know, and we are hopeful that that can be reached.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his question. And, frankly, I don't want to anticipate what the conferees are going to do, having been appointed just last night. There was a vote on the House floor. Frankly, the vote would have had no effect whether it passed or  failed in light of the fact that it instructed the House to do what it had already done. So if it had failed, presumably the House was going to be in the same position that it otherwise would have been in. 
   But notwithstanding that, I don't want to anticipate what the conferees are going to do in light of the fact that they have just been appointed, but I do know that the chairmen of the conference on both sides, House and Senate, want to see this matter resolved quickly, sent to the President, would want to see the troops funded. We were very pleased to see the Department of Defense make it very clear, as, frankly, General Speer and General Ward made clear to me in Europe, that funding is available and will be able to be accommodated through June. 
   As the gentleman knows, last year when the President made a request for a supplemental, that was not passed until mid-June, that supplemental. So I was pleased to see the Department of Defense indicate that that would be okay. It is not perfect. That is not what they would choose, but, in any event, through the month of June. We hope to get this work done long before that.

   Mr. HOYER. Obviously, we are very hopeful that we will pass a budget, that we will pass a budget in a timely fashion. As you know, we did pass a budget through the House in a timely fashion. The Senate passed its budget. It is now in conference. 
   Because of the April break, Easter-Passover break, we have not reached the April 15th. As a matter of fact, I talked to Mr. Conrad just an hour ago, I talked to Mr. Spratt just an hour ago, and we are very hopeful that we will come to an agreement. 
   I would observe, of course, last year the disagreement was between the Republican leadership in the Senate and the Republican leadership in the House. I understand what the gentleman is saying. Some of the votes in the Senate were overwhelming and bipartisan in terms of some of these issues. So this is an issue that we've got to overcome. We hope we can overcome it and move the budget. 
   But I want to tell the gentleman, he is absolutely correct. I am very focused. Mr. Obey is very focused. We are going to pass appropriation bills in a timely fashion. We hope to finish by the 30th of June. Very frankly, the more quickly we can move appropriation bills, perhaps the more flexibility we will have in June's schedule. But as you know, June now is scheduled for every Monday and every Friday meeting to effect that business, which is critical. 
   As the gentleman knows, we met last year for the full year. We left here in December and nine of the 11 appropriation bills were unpassed. We don't want to be in that position. The gentleman knows, and I know, that part of that problem was the Senate's inability to move its business as quickly as we would like, as quickly as we did. The Labor-Health bill, of course, never passed this floor last year, but we are hopeful that that will happen. 
   I will go over the schedule of the appropriations process with the gentleman at some point in time. We are hopeful that mid-May to the end of June we will pass our appropriation bills. I will tell the gentleman it will be my intention to discuss with both Chairman Spratt and Chairman Obey that if the budget process cannot be resolved, not in this House, but in the other House, that it would be my hope that the House would mark its bills to the House-passed number, as you know we have done in the past; and that would certainly be my intention. 
   Again, I have not discussed that with Mr. Obey at this point in time, that's premature, nor have I discussed it with others, but we are hopeful to move ahead on the appropriation bills. 
   As you know, passage of the budget has a much greater impact in the Senate than it does in the House with respect to the rules process under which appropriation bills are considered in the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. The gentleman and I have a slightly different perspective on what the rule provided. 
   First of all, as you know, motions to recommit were available in both of the bills that were on the floor. The tabling referred to that, if the second bill had not been adopted or the PAYGO provision had not been adopted, they would both be tabled. The reason for that was, we wanted to be consistent with our pledge to the PAYGO 
   principle. 
   What we didn't want, what I don't want, and you and I have discussed this, is, I'm frankly ``perplexed,'' might be the word, as someone who has been in the legislative body for some 40 years; and I think the parliamentarians were accurate in their determination of germaneness, but germaneness has always meant to me in 40 years, I will tell my friend, that it is pertinent to the subject at hand. 
   You know that when you add a PAYGO provision, which frankly you abandoned on your side in 2002, you did not want to be constrained by PAYGO. I understand why you didn't want to be constrained by PAYGO because you couldn't pay for your tax cuts. You talked about spending. We've cut revenues very deeply. There were different philosophical arguments about that; but the fact is, they were not paid for, and as a result, the deficits have in large part expanded very greatly. 
   With respect to the rule, yes, the rule was structured in a way that limited to the subject matter at hand, whether it was the tax bill or the D.C. voting rights bill, motions to recommit to those subjects, as opposed to expanding to subjects that, frankly, from my perspective, are used for political purposes. 
   I will tell my friend that the motion last night and the motion on the previous D.C. bill had nothing to do with D.C. voting rights. And last night's bill had everything to do with trying to focus on our Members being targeted. And, in fact, the memorandum that you sent--not you, but somebody sent around to all of your Members expressed the purpose of your motion to recommit to target Members for political reasons, from my perspective. 
   In that context, if you are asking me if it is my intent in the future to try to limit you from doing that, the answer to that question is ``yes.'' If your question is, do I want to make sure that you have a motion to recommit with or without instructions, a motion to recommit, of course, kills the bill, as the motion to recommit to report back promptly kills the bill. 
   The irony is, the gentleman from North Carolina offered a motion to recommit the other day with respect to guns that related to the District of Columbia. Excuse me, I'm not sure it related directly to the District of Columbia, which would have had the perverse effect of offering the amendment and, if adopted, would have killed the amendment in the same process. That is because it was referring it back to committee. The committee would not have reported out that amendment. 
   If he had really been interested, in my opinion, in passing that amendment, as opposed to politically giving a vote that was difficult for Members on our side of the aisle, what he would have done is moved his gun amendment to be reported back forthwith and had his vote on that up or down. 
   But I will tell my friend, as he well knows, I want to make sure that from my perspective, and I have told him, I will not suggest a change in the rules, we did not change the rules, there was some discussion about that, without discussing it with him. I want your side to feel that you are getting a fair shot at relevant motions to recommit with or without amendments that do not kill the bill in the process. I don't think that is something that is unfair to expect.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We could go on for some period of time on this. We have a different perspective, not on providing fairness for all Members. I said the gentleman from North Carolina; it was the young gentleman from Texas, and I thank you for correcting me on that. 
   Frankly, I want to tell my friend that if the gentleman from Texas was sincere, in my view, in wanting his amendment adopted, he would not have rereferred it to committee. Very frankly, in my opinion, his amendment would have passed. The bill would have been reported back forthwith, and the bill would have passed. 
   We all make a judgment as to what the purposes of amendments are. My view is, the gentleman voted against the underlying bill. The gentleman was opposed to the underlying bill. His motion was to do two things: to provide  an instance where on an issue not related to voting rights in the District of Columbia, but on an issue he thought the majority of the House supported which, I think he was correct, he wanted attached to that, and therefore create a dichotomy for Members. They either had to vote for an issue they were for and kill the bill, or vote against an issue they were for and be perceived as being against the proposition.     
   I understand what you are saying. I do not believe that it is fair legislative process to necessarily believe that that needs to be made in order. 
   Now, having said that, we did not amend the rules. Consistent with the rules, we provided a process on PAYGO. You waived PAYGO on a regular basis when it was in effect. As a result of doing so, you narrowed the scope of amendments. Not only did you do that, but you also waived the necessity to pay for things from time to time. 
   But, having said that, I want to reiterate to my friend, and we have had good discussions and will continue to have good discussions, but I am not going to say that we are going to allow our Members to be put in very difficult positions for what we perceive to be for political reasons only, not for the substance. If the gentleman from Texas had wanted to amend the substance with the motion to recommit, he had that available to him and have it reported back forthwith so it could be adopted. He had that available to him. He chose not to take that route. 
   It caused us some consternation, as was noticed, I am sure by some, particularly to me, because I felt very strongly about that bill. The majority of this House has now passed that bill, with significant support from your side of the aisle. As a matter of fact, it was a bill sponsored by one of your leaders, a former chairman of your campaign committee. 
   We want to make sure that we consider legislation on this floor fairly, and we will certainly work with you toward that end. But I don't want to assure the gentleman that I am not going to try to provide for the consideration of legislation and amendments thereto which are germane and relevant.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman will yield on that, you understood my phrase. It was my perception. I did not question his sincerity. But the perception of what he did, offering the amendment, and within the ambit of the same amendment he offered killing the bill to which the amendment would be attached, appeared to me to be an act that was at least contradictory.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his observations. This has probably gone on longer than the Members or the public wants it to, but let me simply observe that waivers obviously relate to and PAYGO relates to entitlement spending, and while you may not have waived it with respect to spending, because PAYGO does not affect discretionary spending, what it affects, of course, is entitlement spending. 
   The reason it affected the D.C. bill was because the Member from Utah would have had to have been paid and would have been entitled to be paid. So a relatively de minimis sum was involved in that. 
   Frankly, the gentleman and I have a disagreement in terms of the rule that was used. First, the rules have not been amended. They have not been amended. Secondly, this rule was consistent with our rules. 
   The only thing that this rule did that I think caused so much consternation on your side was it adopted PAYGO without opening the bill up to what were amendments that were extraneous to the subject matter and offered the bill on its merits. You were free to offer a motion to recommit, with or without amendments, on the subject matter of the bills, either bill. That was your right then. 
   The tabling simply referred to making sure that we kept our promise that bills would have PAYGO on them, and if they didn't have PAYGO on them, we weren't interested in passing them, because we were going to be faithful to our pledge on that rule. That is what the tabling dealt with. It didn't deal with your motion to recommit. 
   If you had defeated H.R. 1906, the second bill with the PAYGO provision, H.R. 1905 would not have gone forward. But our side of the aisle believed that both were important and wanted them together because we wanted the PAYGO provision in there, a relatively de minimis sum in terms of the budget, but consistent with our rule. 
   If I can make another observation on another matter, you mentioned the supplemental had been pending 94 days. It has been pending 73 days. I think that is an important distinction. That is almost a month of legislative work, if not more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend, the distinguished representative from the State of Texas and a leader in our caucus and in our Congress. 
   I want to say how very proud I am to be associated with my good friend, SAM JOHNSON, an American hero not only to this body, but to veterans who have served in every one of our wars, and certainly the Korean War in particular. I thank him for his cosponsorship of this resolution with me. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation granting the Korean War Veterans Association a Federal charter. It will enable them to expand its mission and further its charitable and benevolent causes. 
   The Association, comprised exclusively of Korean War members, has more than 23,000 members and is one of the few such organizations of its size without a Federal charter. 
   More than 50 years have passed since the war-weary men and women who served in Korea returned home. History has revealed that the sacrifices made by these brave soldiers was instrumental in stopping the expansion of communism, and that their sacrifice effectively contributed to a more peaceful world. Can one imagine if North Korea were in charge of all of Korea, what a dangerous world this would be? Granting this Federal charter is a small expression of our appreciation for the extraordinary courage of our forces who were deployed to the Korean Peninsula. 
   This bipartisan legislation is an opportunity to express our gratitude and respect for our military, past and present, and to give Korean War veterans the long-awaited recognition that they so deserve so that the so-called ``forgotten war'' is and should be forgotten no more. 
   I want to thank, as I have done earlier, my colleague, Representative Sam Johnson, a decorated Korean and Vietnam veteran, for cosponsoring this legislation with me in the House. He honors our House by his service, as he honored this House and this country by his service in Korea and in Vietnam. I know that the Korean War veterans, his colleagues who stood the battle in Korea, are extraordinarily honored by his cosponsorship of this resolution. 
   I want to thank my good friend, Senator BEN CARDIN of Maryland, for his work on this issue in the Senate. 
   This is an appropriate step for us to take. This recognition for our Nation's Korean War veterans is long overdue, but it is never too late to do the right thing. And I am pleased, Madam Speaker, to rise and urge my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution, and again thank the distinguished soldier who serves with us and served his country so well in battle.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman from New York, and I thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for bringing this to the floor. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on this resolution not as a Democrat but as an American. 
   September 11 is seared into my memory just as December 7 was for an earlier generation. Indeed, I know it is seared in the memory of every American. 
   It was a day of horror and of heroism, and each year it will be a day for us to renew our devotion to the ideals that make our Nation what it is, ideals of liberty, tolerance, equality, and the rule of law. 
   On this seventh anniversary, this resolution introduced by myself and the Republican leader, Mr. Boehner, recognizes September 11 as a day of remembrance and resolve. We mourn nearly 3,000 men, women, and children murdered. We pledge to keep their names alive and their memories fresh, and we pledge ourselves, once again, to those who loved and lost them. 
   And we recall the heroism of this day, the light of courage that shines brightest in the darkest hours. We remember the service and sacrifice of our first responders, firemen, policemen, medical personnel, average citizens; 343 firefighters, 37 Port Authority officers, 23 police officers. They served us unto death and they died in service. 
   We remember the heroic passengers of United Flight 93, ordinary Americans who found in themselves unthinkable reserves of heroism and saved the building in which we stand at the cost of their lives. 
   The Capitol's dome rises on this hill as a symbol of freedom and liberty and democracy. Surely that was the target of those terrorists, and they would have succeeded save for the extraordinary courage of the passengers of that flight. 
   We send our thoughts far away as well from this Chamber where our servicemen and women are serving and fighting in harm's way as we speak. 
   Inspired by each and every one of those sacrifices, let us renew our resolve. We commit ourselves to defending our people against any and all future threats. We remain steadfast in our commitment to disrupt, dismantle, defeat, and destroy terrorist networks that endanger all that we hold dear. We will devote to that cause all of our military might, all of our diplomatic skill, and all our moral force. 
   Americans have worked tirelessly to make our Nation safer. This Congress has passed, and the President signed, numerous laws to assist victims, combat terrorism, protect our homeland, and to support the members of our Armed Forces who defend our interests at home and around the world. 
   Most importantly of all, we adopted last year all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. And now we must implement them. 
   We must keep working to keep America secure. We can always do more. And, as the chairman of the 9/11 Commission pointed out, we are not yet strong enough. Today is a reminder that in this uncertain century, even the most powerful Nation on Earth is vulnerable. 
   So let us add humility and watchfulness to our mourning because we are defending something greater and more powerful than our own lives. We are defending the same ideals to which our founders pledged more than two centuries ago, their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. 
   We are defending the American ideals that stretch through our history and animate our spirit even today. And no attack, no attack, can break them. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join with Mr. Boehner and me in unanimously supporting this resolution of remembrance and resolve.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I hope my recitation of the schedule for next week is a little more accurate than my recitation of the schedule last week, which had a little bit of a problem getting done. 
   In any event, my distinguished friend, on Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour business and then at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of those bills will be announced later today. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m., and on Friday the House will meet at 9 a.m. We will consider the following fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills: Energy and Water Development; State, Foreign Operations; and the Legislative Branch bill. 
   In addition to that, in the week following, I am waiting for it to be written up for me, but I know Financial Services we hope to have up on the last week of the session; the Commerce, Justice, Science bill and the Interior bill in the last week; and then in July, the week we get back, which is the second full week of July, we expect to have the Labor-Health bill, the Agriculture bill and the Transportation-HUD bill. 
   In addition, after that, we will have the Defense appropriations bill as we had always planned to have that, approximately mid-July. 
   I want to tell my friend that obviously the three bills that are scheduled for the second week in July may slip to the third week in July because of the difficulty of getting together all of the projects that will be added to the bills as a result of Members' initiatives and the committee's action. But whether it is the second week in July or the third week in July, they will be in mid-July sometime.

   But before the Energy and Water bill is sent to the Senate, we will have those add-ons added to another appropriation bill that will come to the floor and will be, therefore, subject to Members' actions on each and every one of the legislatively added provisions. When that bill passes, those provisions will then be added to the Energy and Water bill and then, and only then, sent to the Senate.

   Mr. HOYER. Let me be precise so there won't be any misunderstanding. I am not sure, but I think your rule dealt with more than appropriations conference reports. I may not be correct on that. 
   But in any event, the rule that will be offered Monday night, hopefully by unanimous consent, will be a rule that will say that a point of order will lie to a conference report from the appropriations conference which has added a project that was not listed in either the House consideration or the Senate consideration, and that point of order would have 10 minutes of debate on either side, 10 minutes for those in opposition to allowing the conference committee report to be considered, and 10 minutes for the proponents of the conference committee report being considered, effectively adding a third to the hour.     
   So it would be an hour and 20 minutes of debate rather than just an hour. 
   Obviously if the point of order is sustained, then the conference committee with the add-on or add-ons would be referred back to the conference committee.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman would yield, obviously the gentleman is correct. There has been a change in the July schedule in part because of the moving of three of the appropriations bills to July. So they will not be considered in June. It was always the intent, however, that there would be an announcement prior to July 4 of component parts of an energy policy, not necessarily one bill but an energy policy prior to July 4. We always contemplated energy bills being on the floor in July. As far as I know, that is still the plan.

   They have reached an understanding and that is moving forward, I believe, but I could not tell the gentleman at this time what will be scheduled or when it will be scheduled.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, we swore an oath to protect this country, to protect our Constitution, and protect our people. 
   Most days in the House of Representatives, we make judgments. Those judgments are between what we think are good and better and perhaps bad. Most days are not like today. This is a day of consequence for the American people. This is a day of consequence to our country. This is a day when the Democratic leader, myself, rises to follow the Republican leader, and they speak with one voice as America faces crisis. That's what Americans want us to do. 
   I congratulate Mr. Boehner for his courage and for his leadership. And I congratulate my good friend Roy Blunt, with whom I have worked on issue after issue to try to bring us together, not on behalf of Republicans or Democrats but on behalf of our people. 
   Why should taxpayers lend out their own money to solve a crisis brought on by someone else's greed? Because when it comes to our economy, none of us, none of us is an island. We are all bound together in boom or bust, in growth or collapse, from the bankers on Wall Street to the smallest rural community that we represent. 
   Imagine, my colleagues, that we do nothing. A million more homes will likely be foreclosed on. Banks would likely be unable to lend. Credit, the lifeblood of any economy, might dry up across America. That means families unable to take out a loan to buy an appliance when their washing machine or refrigerator breaks, or send a child to college. It means retirement savings devastated. It means businesses shrinking all over America unable to meet their payrolls, and jobs lost and families at risk. That's what Mr. Boehner said and that's what I say. That's what Mr. Paulson has said. That's what Mr. McCain has said. That's what Mr. Obama has said. America faces a crisis, and Americans call out for us to come together to confront that crisis on their behalf. 
   It means workers losing their jobs on top of the more than 600,000 that we have lost this year. The meltdown would begin, it is true, in a few square miles in Manhattan. But before it was over, all of us know no city or town in America would be untouched. 
   With this bipartisan rescue plan, I am hopeful, every one of us in this body is hopeful, the President of the United States is hopeful, and I know that every American that we have the honor and privilege of representing hopes that we will prevent the worst-case scenario. 
   Under a plan put forward by President Bush, the government would purchase the bad assets clogging up our financial system, with the goal of restoring the flow of necessary lending and credit. 
   The original plan gave unchecked power to the Secretary of the Treasury to spend $700 billion as he saw fit. We, who represent the American public, who will be at risk, we hope they will not lose and we think they may not, but we said, no, we cannot do that. Our responsibility is to ensure transparency and oversight so that we know how their money is being spent and can ensure to the extent possible that it is spent in as honest and as effective fashion as we can effect. We made clear that this Congress does not write blank checks. 
   Both Chambers and both parties negotiated around the clock. I especially want to thank my colleague, as I have before, my friend Minority Whip Roy Blunt. Roy Blunt came to the table, and everybody that has been at that table has said Roy Blunt represented the American public at that table, as Barney Frank represented the American public at that table. 
   We've made significant improvement to the President's plan. First, we fought to add provisions ensuring that if and when financial institutions helped by this rescue begin to grow again, taxpayers will be the first to share in their profits; so even though this bill authorizes a total of $700 billion, as Mr. Spratt pointed out earlier today, the Congressional Budget Office does not believe that it will be anywhere near that price tag. 
   Some of you have heard me say that I was sworn in to the Maryland State Senate in January of 1967. On that same day in my State, Spiro T. Agnew was sworn in as Governor of the State of Maryland. And in his inaugural address, he said to all of us that the cost of failure far exceeds the price of progress. I think that is what is at stake here today, that the cost of our failure will far exceed the price of the progress we try to effect in this bill. 
   Secondly, we added a repayment clause originally championed by Congressman Tanner. And after 5 years the administration will have to tell us the true net cost to taxpayers and submit a plan laying out how Wall Street and financial institutions will pay back the taxpayer. While the final provision we negotiated with Republicans is not as strong as either of us would have liked, it is a step in the direction that both of us sought. 
   Thirdly, this bill restricts the compensation of executives. We ought not ask taxpayers to take a risk and advantage people who are making millions either as they work or as they leave successful or failed institutions. 
   Fourth, the Treasury Secretary's decisions will be subject to oversight and judicial review. 
   Finally, we will help homeowners change the terms of their mortgages to forestall the 2 million projected foreclosures that could further cripple our economy and devastate our neighborhoods. I know that it is not as good as some would like, but the alternative is nothing, and that is not acceptable. 
   We have ensured that this bill will not reward Wall Street for bad risks. Instead, it will keep local banks open. It will protect retirement accounts. It will help families get the credit they need. It will help small businesses stay alive and hiring. 
   But we must also reform our financial sector to safeguard against another collapse like this, and we will do so. Fiscal irresponsibility and regulatory neglect were at the core of this crisis. We must and we will investigate just how that failure occurred. And we will strengthen regulation and put economic referees back on the field. Responsible oversight must return to Wall Street. 
   Today, though, today, we are doing our best to forestall what Secretary  Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke are predicting would be a disaster. 
   I opened by saying America was in crisis and that this was a day of consequence for our country. They have sent us here to respond. Today, this is not a Republican House or a Democratic House. It is the People's House. And the people, by an overwhelming majority, have asked us to act. They have not said act on this bill in this way because, like us, they're not sure. But what they do know is that inaction is not an option, that inaction will result in greater pain for our people and for our country. 
   So I rise with my friend John Boehner and my friend Roy Blunt and with Speaker Pelosi and with President Bush and with John McCain and with Barak Obama and say this day of consequence, let us meet the challenge, let us act, let us confront this crisis, let us be the best of the people's House.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR THE GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding and I congratulate him on his leadership of this subcommittee and  his leadership in our State of Maryland. I am proud to be Mr. Cummings' colleague. I also thank the gentlelady from Virginia for her leadership in bringing this matter to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I proudly sponsor this resolution allowing the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold the 66th Annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on the Capitol Grounds on Saturday, June 16.     
   Our Nation's tradition of soapbox racing began, Mr. Speaker, as you may know, in 1934, when Myron E. Scott, a photographer for the Dayton Daily News, saw boys racing engineless cars down a hill. This inspired Mr. SCOTT to hold a race and award the winner with a ``loving cup.'' 
   The first year, the race took place in Dayton, Ohio. The following year the race moved to Akron due to the city's numerous hills. With the hard work of countless civic organizations, a permanent track site for the youth racing classic was created with the assistance of the Works Progress Administration, affectionately known as the WPA. 
   Soapbox derby racing in our Nation's Capital has a long and rich tradition as well. In 1938, Norman Rocca beat out 223 other racers to win the inaugural Greater Washington Soapbox Derby, which was then held on New Hampshire Avenue. 
   Over the years, thousands of the region's young people have participated in this great race. Although the location has moved from the original site on New Hampshire Avenue to Capitol Hill, the essence of the race has remained the same: homemade gravity-powered cars, the spirit of competition, and the pure joy of racing. 
   The soapbox derby consists of dozens of drivers, both boys and girls, ranging in ages from 8 to 17. These racers are divided into three divisions: stock, superstock and masters. The local winner of each division will automatically qualify to compete with racers from around the world in the 70th All-American Soapbox Derby in Akron, Ohio, on July 26. 
   The festivities in Akron begin when the racers receive a police escort into town and conclude in the winner's circle with the awarding of scholarships and merchandise. In between, the racers and their families participate in a whirlwind of activities that leave them with enduring friendships and memories that last a lifetime. 
   Mr. Speaker, this event has been called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world,'' and it is an excellent opportunity for the contestants from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia to learn basic building skills while gaining a real sense of accomplishment and competition. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to join with me and the other original cosponsors, Representatives Frank Wolf, James Moran, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Al Wynn, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Mr. Cummings and Mrs. Drake, in supporting this resolution, which honors such an extraordinary and in some respects uniquely American event here on Capitol Hill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, as our Nation commemorates National Police Week this week and the 26th Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Day today (May 15), let us honor the memory of those who have fallen in the line of duty and thank those who carry on their legacy, serving in communities across this Nation, keeping the peace, and protecting the American people. 
   It is altogether fitting that today--with thousands of peace officers in Washington to commemorate these events--the Members of this House will consider this very important bipartisan legislation, the COPS Improvements Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we pass this bill, the new Democratic Majority in this House will again demonstrate its absolute commitment to taking decisive action that protects our communities and combats crime. 
   In short, this legislation reauthorizes the highly successful Community Oriented Policing Services Program, or COPS, which was enacted in 1994 under the Clinton Administration and which helped local law enforcement agencies hire 117,000 additional officers between 1995 and 2005--including 908 officers in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District. 
   In fact, the COPS hiring program--with its emphasis on getting more cops on the beat--is credited with reducing the crime rate. 
   The nonpartisan General Accountability Office, for example, concluded in one study (and I quote): ``COPS-funded increases in sworn officers per capita were associated with declines in rates of total index crimes, violent crimes and property crime.'' 
   Unfortunately, however, the former House Majority sharply reduced the funding for the universal hiring program under COPS in recent years--from more than $1 billion a year in the late 1990s, to $10 million in 2005, to the complete elimination of hiring grants in 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's put these figures in perspective. One billion dollars a years for COPS hiring grants is not an insubstantial sum. But today, in Iraq, our Nation is spending approximately $10 billion a month--or $2.5 billion a week. 
   House Democrats believe it is imperative to reinvigorate the successful COPS program. And thus, this legislation calls for putting 50,000 additional police officers on the streets over the next 6 years by authorizing $600 million a year for COPS hiring grants. 
   Furthermore, this bill authorizes $350 million a year for COPS technology grants, and $200 million a year for hiring community prosecutors. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, through this bipartisan legislation, this House will demonstrate that it is committed to protecting and strengthening America's communities. 
   We will demonstrate that the Federal Government is a committed partner in protecting Americans not only from the threat posed by international terrorism, but also from the dangers posed by domestic crime. 
   I urge my colleagues: Support the COPS Improvements Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I speak on every one of these budgets; and because I have been here a long time, I know the history of these budgets going back a quarter of a century. I sometimes believe the talking points on the other side of the aisle are written by Lewis Carroll, the author, of course, of that famous book which had as its theme saying one thing and meaning another: ``black was white,'' ``up was down,'' et cetera, et cetera. 
   I have listened since 1981 to the economic observations of such people like Phil Gramm, such people like Dick Armey, an economist, the majority leader of your party, and I think to myself how confused the American public must be when the assertions are made, an article by Dave Stockman in today's paper, you may have seen. David Broder wrote an article about that. Mr. Stockman is in a little bit of trouble with assertions that things that he said were true were in fact not true. In fact, David Stockman admitted that in 1983 what he said was true was not true; what he said they thought, they did not think. 
   The American public needs to place it in that context. 
   I have heard a lot, I say to my friend from Missouri, over the last few hours about debates about we are going to make these tax cuts permanent, and we are not. 
   Now, I am sure the American public knows that the President for the last 6 years has been a Republican. I am sure they know that the leadership in the House for the past 6 years has been Republican, and I am sure they know that the leadership in the Senate has been Republican. And guess what? Never did you make those tax cuts permanent. Why not? Because you wanted to play fiscal games. That is why not. 
   You wanted to count your out-years as looking better than they did. Why are you having a $274 billion tax increase in this bill? How do I say that? Because you are not fixing the AMT. Why aren't you fixing it? Because it is STI, your ``stealth tax increase.'' You liked SDI. This is STI, a stealth tax increase, where you say one year we are going to fix it, but, guess what, for the next 4 years we will get that additional tax revenue. A stealth tax increase. 
   There are no tax increases in this bill. In fact, it provides for tax cuts for the middle class. But they have to be paid for. 
   George Bush I and Dick Gephardt, the leader of this House, came together and said, ladies and gentlemen, we have to have fiscal responsibility, and we are going to do it. And the way we are going to do it is we are going to have PAYGO. We are going to pay for what we buy. George Bush signed that. And guess what? The Republican side of the aisle excoriated the President of the United States, George Bush, for entering into an agreement that ultimately would bring us surpluses. 
   I have also listened to these debates and have seen some very earnest, very intelligent, very articulate young men. Mr. Ryan is the third in a series of those earnest, intelligent, energetic, articulate young men, who talk about their vision for America, talk about where they want to take America. 
   Mr. Ryan puts up the children. Now, unlike Mr. Ryan, who I think has children, I have children, I have got grandchildren, and, as some people know, I have a great-granddaughter. And I am very concerned about all of those children whose taxes you have raised almost every year you have been in charge that I have been here, starting in 1981. And you raised their taxes by not paying for what you buy. 
   You talk about cutting spending, I tell my friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to tell my friend that there are more ways to skin a cat than one. 
   I tell the Chair that I have heard the argument of these earnest young men who have all stood on this floor. David Stockman at the age of 34 telling the country as director of OMB how we were going to balance the budget, how Ronald Reagan said we are going to balance the budget. Ronald Reagan ran over $1 trillion in deficits over his 8 years. Over $1 trillion in deficits. 
   There is one person in America who can stop spending in its tracks, only one, and that is the President of the United States. Ronald Reagan ran $1 trillion in deficits, actually $1.4 trillion. George Bush I in just 4 years ran $1 trillion in deficits. And this President in the 6 years he has been President has run over $1.6 trillion in deficits. $4.1 trillion of deficits during the Reagan administration, the Bush I administration and the Bush II administration. 
   Now, I tell the Chairman that my friend does not seem to be paying attention to these dramatic figures. But ladies and gentlemen of this House, I hope you are, and I hope all of our constituents are listening as well, because the rhetoric on this floor is cheap, but the performance is not. 
   During those 18 years of Republican leadership of this country, we ran $4.2 trillion in deficits. During the 8 years that Bill Clinton was President, we had a $62.9 billion surplus. The only President in the lifetime, I tell the Chairman, of my young friend from Wisconsin that that has been accomplished, notwithstanding Mr. Stockman or Mr. Kasich or Mr. Nussle, who all said they wanted to balance the budget, and none, none, none of them did it. None of them did it. 
   Now, we adopted a program in 1993, and I heard the same rhetoric, I tell my friends on this side of the aisle, that I am hearing today, the same rhetoric. Dick Armey not only was the majority leader of the Republican House, it wasn't a Republican House then, but he was also an economist, and an economist still. And Mr. Armey told the President of the United States, if we adopt this program, we are going to have deep debt, high unemployment and annual deficits.     
   That was the representation I tell my friends on this floor. Those representations were all wrong. That's why when we listen to debate on this floor today we see a balanced budget, a responsible budget that invests in our future. 
   Mr. Chairman, if I were speaking directly to him, I would tell my young friend, I have heard about these cuts that you talk about, for a quarter of a century I have heard about these cuts. Why is it that you spent more money as a party with the President with control of the Senate, control of the House by a factor of two, twice as much spending rise under the Bush Administration than under the Clinton Administration. Why is that? 
   Why do you come here and crow about cutting spending when you doubled the rate of growth when you controlled everything? That's what the American public needs to judge. 
   Now, I had some prepared comments here, and I apologize to my good friend who spent so much time doing this. But, ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Carroll is not writing this budget. Alice is not going to have to live under this budget. My children, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren and, more importantly, my country, are going to have to live under this budget. 
   We didn't adopt a budget last year. We didn't adopt appropriation bills last year. We didn't do any of the fiscal business that we should have done last year. Why? Because your party could not agree with one another. So you had no fiscal program. Your fiscal program was spending more money. 
   I hope that this House, for the first time in 6 years, adopts a responsible budget that will move us towards balance. It won't get there overnight. And when I say that, it is not empty rhetoric, because when we, in 1993, passed that program, we took this country for 4 straight years out of deficit. 
   Now, I know you will say, ``Well, we Republicans took over in 1995.'' And my response to that, of course, is, you didn't have the presidency. When you had it all, why couldn't you do it? When you had the presidency, when you had the Senate, when you had the House, tell me why you couldn't do it. 
   I will tell you why. Because it was the President of the United States who said this is the way we are going to do it or I am going to veto it. This President can veto it, and we won't be able to override his veto. I understand that. He is in charge. That's why we have these deficits, because he has not vetoed one spending bill. He vetoed one bill, embryonic stem cell research. Not one spending bill. Every nickel that has been spent in this country has been spent under the signature of George Bush, the President of the United States, every nickel. 
   So I ask my friends, vote for a responsible budget. Move us, as we did during the 1990s, 4 years out of debt, 4 years into surplus, the first time that had happened, and left you folks that took over with a $5.6 trillion surplus that you have squandered into a $3 trillion deficit. And, yes, 9/11 had an impact on that. And your tax cut, we had a very shallow recovery. You know that. Every economist says that. And a relatively shallow downturn in the economy. 
   This budget offered by Mr. Spratt is a responsible budget that provides for tax cuts for the middle class, provides for investment in education and competitiveness of our country, provides for investment in our veterans, provides for investment in defense, using the same number that the President gave us so that we can keep America strong. 
   Mr. Spratt, I thank you. I thank the members of your committee for having the courage and the wisdom and the fiscal soundness to come forth with this budget. It is worthy of support of every Member of this Congress. 
   I urge this House to adopt this budget this day.  
   Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to our republican colleagues, let me say that to hear them talk about fiscal responsibility is nothing less than surreal. 
   In this debate on the fiscal 2008 budget, many numbers have been used. 
   But only two are really relevant on the issue of fiscal responsibility, and the Republican Party's lack thereof--$5.6 trillion and more than $3 trillion. 
   When President Bush took office, he and the then-Republican majorities in Congress inherited a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. 
   The President proclaimed: ``we can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits, even if the economy softens.'' 
   He promised that he would pay down the national debt, and some in the administration even worried publicly about paying down the debt too fast. 
   Well, as we have learned, the President's projections were unequivocally wrong and worries about paying down the debt were completely misplaced. 
   Over the last 6 years, the President and Republicans in Congress--after enacting the most reckless fiscal policies in American history--have turned a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion into record budget deficits and additional debt of more than $3 trillion. 
   In fact, the amount of foreign-held debt has more than doubled under the Bush administration--from about $1 trillion in 2001 to $2.1 trillion today. 
   And, interest payments on the national debt have increased from $206 billion in 2001 to a projected $256 billion under the President's budget for fiscal 2008--consuming more than 20 percent of all individual income taxes. 
   Let me say, too, that until the American people spoke last November and elected Democratic majorities in Congress, the President never--not once--budgeted the costs of the on-going war in Iraq, which today stand at more than $400 billion, with another $100 billion being considered. 
   Thus today, Mr. Chairman, with this budget written and offered by Chairman Spratt, House Democrats will take our Nation in a new direction and begin to clean up the fiscal train wreck left by Republicans. 
   Our budget is a statement of our values and priorities, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to defend our Nation, grow our economy, protect our children and strengthen families, preserve our plant, and ensure that the Federal Government is accountable and efficient. 
   First, this fiscally responsible Democratic budget will bring the Federal budget back to balance by 2012. Over the next 5 years, the cumulative deficit in our budget is $234 billion lower than the President's budget. 
   Our budget strictly adheres to the pay-as-you-go budget rules that were reinstated in January by the new majority, and which Republicans allowed to expire in 2002. The Concord Coalition even says this budget is ``a successful first test of how seriously they [House  Democrats] plan to abide by [the PAYGO] rule.'' 
   Furthermore, this Democratic budget invests in our priorities without increasing the deficit. It provides for a robust defense, boosting Homeland Security funding and providing $3.5 billion more for veterans' services than the President's request for 2008. 
   It also makes critical investments in education, children's health care, transportation infrastructure, and alternative energy research and development--while rejecting the President's request to cut Head Start, LIHEAP, COPS and First-Responder programs, and community development block grants. 
   And, our budget accommodates immediate relief for the tens of millions of middle-income households which would otherwise be subject to the alternative minimum tax--while calling for the extension of middle-class tax cuts that are not due to expire until December 31, 2010. 
   This is a budget that we can be proud of. And, it stands in stark contrast to the extraordinarily irresponsible policies of the last six years. 
   I urge all of my colleagues: vote for fiscal responsibility and a bright future for our children. Vote for the budget that reflects our values and meets the needs of the American people. Vote for this Democratic budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to join him in thanking Paul Hays for the extraordinary service he has given to this institution. 
   Our reading clerk, Paul Hays, who after 19 years in this position as reading clerk and, as has been noted by the distinguished minority leader, 41 years as an employee of this House, has announced he will retire effective Monday, April 30, and begin a new phase of his life. 
   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, Paul Hays, with his deep, crisp, commanding voice is perhaps most recognized to our viewers on C-SPAN, perhaps more than many of the rest of us, because he is here all the time and that voice is heard and his visage is seen. 
   It has been a privilege, I know, for him to serve here, but as I have noted on other occasions when other members of the desk have retired, they serve our country as well as those who have been elected to serve, and we appreciate their service. 
   Since 1789, the House has employed reading clerks, who are responsible for reading aloud, obviously, the text of bills, amendments, motions, messages, special rules and other privileged resolutions and veto messages. Our reading clerks almost always, almost always, have been appointed from the ranks of existing House employees who have extensive prior floor experience. Paul was one of those. 
   Paul, a graduate of Georgetown University, is no exception. In fact, Paul was appointed reading clerk in 1988 by one of the most distinguished persons with whom I have served, one of the most decent Americans that has served in this House, the distinguished minority leader, Bob Michel. 
   It is no coincidence, Mr. Speaker, that given his speaking talents, Paul, as I understand it, intends to do voiceover work in the future. 
   Now, Paul, we want you to be very discriminating in what voiceovers you do. There may be a lot of requests. We want you to know how nice we are being to you today. 
   Paul, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for your service to this institution and to our country. As you go from this phase of your very successful life into the next successful phase of your life, not only do we thank you, but we wish you well.

   We'll do the hate crimes bill rule later in the week, probably Wednesday, for consideration on Thursday. 
   But I understand the gentleman's observation that there was significant debate on both these bills. There are issues that a number of people want to raise on the floor, and I would think that the committee would want to try to make in order some amendments to accomplish that objective.

   Mr. HOYER. Obviously, to some degree, that is dependent upon how quickly the President acts. Obviously, he has a number of days to act. But our presumption is he will act soon. And one of the reasons that we have put the time of 12 noon, I mean, it depends upon how early in the day he vetoes that bill. We may have it back here very soon. I talked to the majority leader in the Senate just an hour ago. It's his expectation that that vote will occur today. It's our expectation that we will send the bill down either late Monday, obviously the funeral is occurring and people won't be here, or very, very early Tuesday so that the President will have it Tuesday. And then it will depend upon how soon the President acts. But it would be our expectation that we would act quickly on any action the President took if he vetoes the bill. 
   We, of course, as you know, are hopeful that he will sign the bill. We think it gives all the money for the troops that the President has asked for, and then some additional monies, and it does not either micromanage the troops or set any precipitous withdrawal dates. But obviously the President has expressed a contrary opinion. 
   So I think you're right; I think the expectation, based upon the President's representation, is that he is going to veto that bill if it comes to him, and we will have to consider that veto.

   Mr. HOYER. Clearly, we are trying to pursue a process which gives notice to Members about what they are going to consider. 
   As you noted, I hope, we waited the full 24 hours on the supplemental conference report so that Members will have the full 24 hours. And as a matter of fact, we were almost to the hour at 5:50 p.m. yesterday. And although there were some Members whom it had caused a problem to because of their schedules, we had said we were going to give 24 hours' notice, and we did give 24 hours' notice, and we want to continue to do that. 
   On the amending process, obviously, we are going to many times require that amendments be filed timely so that Members have an opportunity to see what amendments are going to be asked of the Rules Committee. But we will pursue what we believe to be, and hope in consultation with you, is a reasonable time frame to expect people to notice their amendments. Clearly, they have to be out of committee. Clearly, they have to have time to see the bill and prepare amendments. But we want to have amendments in many instances noted so that the membership can know what they are considering.

   Mr. HOYER. Certainly we want to make a process where all Members on either side of the aisle have the opportunity to note their amendments in a fashion that does not put them in a place where it makes it very difficult for them. On the other hand, obviously, it is not just the floor that considers it. It is the Rules Committee that has to; so you have to consider when the Rules Committee is going to meet as well. 
   And although I appreciate the gentleman's observation about Fridays, I have heard a lot about what we can or cannot do on Fridays, I will tell my friend, or what we should be doing on Fridays. 
   But having said that, assuming a Member is working with his staff and/or the committee's staff or CRS in preparing his or her amendment, obviously if they get it ready and the Rules Committee is going to meet Monday or Tuesday, an expectation that it would be filed by close of business on Friday I don't think is unreasonable, even if we are not here on Fridays, because presumably their staff has been working with them on their amendment and  can make sure that amendment gets filed even if the Member is not physically present here.

   Mr. HOYER. Because you said as long as the bill has been available at least a week before. I want to think about that timeframe. That was sort of an add-on in your comment. I don't want my silence to be perceived as, oh, yes, okay, that's a procedure we can follow. I am not sure we can follow that. But certainly the substance of your comment we do want to follow, and that is give Members a reasonable opportunity to prepare an amendment to a bill. Obviously they considered it in committee and they reported it out of committee, but there may be times, as you observed, when that doesn't happen and it goes more quickly.

   Mr. HOYER. I will try to be precise so that your response will be germane to my observations. 
   Let me say that with respect to the GSE bill, there has been a reference to another committee. That committee has not reported out that bill, so obviously we have to find out what it does. 
   On your general question, let me say it is my hope during the next 30 days prior to the Memorial Day break there will be a number of significant things we will do. We mentioned this coming week's work. We will start the appropriations process. I am hopeful that we will adopt a budget resolution conference report by that time. If we do not, as I indicated last week to you, it would be my hope that we would have the Appropriations Committee move ahead and mark bills to the House-passed level, as we have done in the past, and deem its passage. 
   I would hope that we would pass a number of appropriations bills in May. And as the gentleman also knows, as we have historically done, we will be considering the defense authorization bill in May. 
   So appropriation bills, the authorization bill. There will be some other pieces of legislation, but I expect them to be the major focus of the balance of time between now and when we take the Memorial Day break.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, obviously, the American public sent us here to get its work done. Obviously as well, we have differences on what work we ought to be doing and what the substance of that work ought to be, and they expect us to debate that, and they expect us to have our differences, and then they expect us to resolve those differences through voting and moving legislation. 
   The Agriculture appropriation bill is on the floor. Mr. Obey, myself, and Mr. Boehner had very long discussions about how we would consider the appropriation bills. On or about June 14, it was June 12 and 13 that we really discussed, we came to agreement. We came to agreement on how we would consider the appropriation bills, essentially the time frame that would be accorded to those bills, that we would have open rules on the appropriation bills, and that we would come to only unanimous consent agreements on the constraint of debate.     
   Furthermore, we agreed that we would offer a rule the Monday following June 14 to provide for a point of order on items added to appropriation bills. 
   I believe that I have, as leader, done everything I said I would do. 
   On Monday, I offered a unanimous consent, a request to add to our rules the point of order that the minority felt important to protect its rights. That unanimous consent, obviously, was not objected to. It is now part of our rules. 
   Since that time, on 10 appropriation bills we have had open rules, as we said we would. The agreement, as you have heard me state before, contemplated that you would give us, on the minority side, essentially the same unanimous consents that we gave to you in an election year 1 year ago. 
   Notwithstanding that understanding, we have taken 50 hours longer to consider the appropriation bills since that time than we took last year when you were in charge and Mr. Obey gave the unanimous consent. You've heard me complain about that because I thought that was not consistent with the agreement. 
   Notwithstanding that, we have proceeded on this floor with open rules, and the Agriculture appropriation bill has come to the floor with an open rule. The Agriculture appropriation bill has been on the floor for some, 4, 4 1/2 hours, and we are not really considering the substance of the Agriculture appropriation bill. 
   I know there is upset on your side of the aisle, I say to my friends on the minority side, about another bill. But there was nothing in the agreement that said if you were upset with another bill that the agreement reached between Mr. Boehner and I and Mr. Obey would not be honored. There was nothing that said that if we're angry about another bill that we will disrupt the appropriations process. 
   And, therefore, it is my perception, and I think, based upon the facts that everyone in this country has observed over the last number of hours, that my perception is the agreement has not been honored. I regret that. 
   I will tell you that I pride myself on honoring my agreements, even when it may anger my side of the aisle, because I believe that if we are to proceed in a civil way, in a way that we can trust one another, that is what we ought to do. Notwithstanding the extra 50 hours that we've spent, we were prepared to proceed. 
   Now, let me read just briefly, Mr. Shadegg was on the floor just a little while ago and spoke. This is what Mr. Shadegg said on the 14th: 
   ``As I understand it, this'', meaning our agreement to move bills forward, ``is an attempt to make sure that we don't waste time on dilatory tactics; that, rather, we proceed through these bills in an orderly fashion, but if someone has a substantive objection that should be accommodated. Is that correct?'' Mr. SHADEGG asked me. 
   In response, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee stated, and I quote Mr. Obey: ``It is our hope that you will respond as we did in the minority by agreeing to reasonable time limits on each of those bills in return for that.'' In return for that was giving reasonable time for substantive amendments. 
   Again, my friends on the minority side, you have had 50 additional hours above and beyond the time that we debated the bills last year when you were in charge.  
   And Mr. Shadegg responded, ``Certainly. And I think we will.'' We do not believe that that has been done. 
   During that same debate, on June 14, I stated to the minority, ``We expect to move forward on open rules.'' We have done that. ``But I want to make clear, if we are subjected to what we believe were dilatory tactics, then that would not be consistent with the agreement, and therefore our provision would be that, in lawyers' terms, the agreement has been breached.'' 
   I also stated, and again I quote, ``We are proceeding with reliance on the good faith of each to proceed in a manner that we believe accommodates what has been done last year and what we hope will be done this year, and that is consider these bills with the inclusion of earmarks in the bills in a manner that facilitates their being passed through this House.'' 
   In fact, Mr. Hensarling stated, and again I quote, ``I believe I heard that there is hopefully an expectation of open rules. I understand the majority leader's caveat.'' That was my caveat that dilatory tactics would not be employed during the course of consideration of appropriation bills. 
   He went on to say, ``I understand there is an anticipation of unanimous consents,'' he said, ``UCs, as historic norms dictate.'' 
   I carry around in my pocket, I've shared with my friend, Mr. Blunt and Mr. Boehner, the times that we spent considering the appropriation bills last year. Those were the historic norms that we referred to when on the floor we talked about generally replicating the time constraints of last year. 
   ``I understand,'' Mr. Hensarling went on, ``there is an anticipation that if bills are of historic norms, that debate time may be of historic norms.'' 
   Again, I say to my friends on the minority side, I believe we have followed those dictates and that understanding to the letter. 
   Now, as to the schedule, I want to tell my friends that I have, for many months, articulated the bills that we were going to consider this week. Among those bills were the appropriation bills, the Defense bill, the Agriculture appropriation bill. I've discussed with my friend, ROY BLUNT, the possibility of considering a FISA bill. We also have some conference reports. The WRDA conference report is ready, we believe. We're also going to consider the Defense appropriation bill, consistent with our agreement; and we're going to consider an energy bill. 
   There may be some other conference reports that will be ready. The Higher Education conference report possibly would be ready, although I think that may not occur. There are other bills that we're going to consider. 
   The reason I rise is, first of all, to discuss the agreement that we had, which I think has not been honored, with respect to the considerable appropriations bills. It was not with respect to other bills, but we were considering the appropriation bill. 
   And I tell my friend that I have discussed with the members of my caucus that we are going to complete this agenda. We will complete this agenda if it takes all of next week to complete. That will disrupt my schedule, it will disrupt your schedule, and it will not be a happy time for any of us in this body. I regret that. 
   I hope that those of you on the minority side who have dealt with me through the years believe that I try to treat one another as I want to be treated by them. 
   I regret that we are now going to go to the Rules Committee on the appropriations bills. We will go to the Rules Committee on the Agriculture appropriation bill. We will go to the Rules Committee on the Defense bill. We will go to the Rules Committee on each and every other bill. 
   That does not mean I expect you to sit back and simply say, well, that's fine. I expect that we will not have a happy time over the next coming days. But I also believe that you have not left me or my party with an alternative, if, in fact, we are to proceed with the people's business. 
   We have disagreements. That's fair. Amendments expressing those agreements offered on this floor is fair. Demanding votes on those amendments and on those bills is fair and what the American people expect. 
   What the American people, in my opinion, do not expect is for us to simply do nothing, to simply circle one another, yell and scream at one another, point fingers at one another and not proceed with their business. 
   We believe very strongly that children ought to have health care. I believe you think children ought to have health care. We have a difference of opinion as to how we accomplish that objective. That is fair. 
   What is not fair, from our perspective, is to simply disallow the House to proceed to do its business, to have its disagreements, to make its votes, to express its will. 
   And so I say to you that we will complete the agenda that I have set forth. I hope we pass all those bills. If we don't pass them, so be it. But if we pass, or whether they fail, we will consider them during this sitting, before we recess for our summer break. I regret that, but it is the only alternative with which I think I am left if, as majority leader of this House, I'm going to facilitate the accomplishment of the people's business.

   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time. That was the proposition that the gentleman put to us and Mr. Obey when  we discussed the appropriations bills. We agreed, and we have followed to the letter, bringing every appropriation bill considered under an open rule, every one.     
   There were no constraints imposed beyond unanimous consent constraints so that we had an open process. Everybody got an opportunity to make their points and to vote. 
   There is no one on this side of the aisle who has served for the last 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 years who does not understand the pain that you express of your Members. They have all felt it. You know that, and I know that. Frankly, we had a previous majority leader who was not nearly as tolerant as the present majority leader, I say with some degree of perhaps humor but some degree, I think, of real truth. I believe we have complied with that agreement. 
   We will now conclude the business for tonight, and we will back tomorrow, and we will complete the work that I have set forth on behalf of the majority that the House contemplates. And we hope that we can try, over the next few hours, to reach a greater level of civility on both sides so that we can proceed and try to accommodate the concerns of every Member. But that has not happened.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for yielding and thank him for his extraordinary leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and would allay somewhat the grief that is felt by the former chairman of the Rules Committee, the ranking Republican. 
   Mr. Speaker, on the one hand he says much of this bill is that which we passed last time offered by our friends on the minority side. If that is the case, we, as I understand the premise, we have adopted much of what you have proposed. It's hard to say that you weren't consulted when we have adopted what your contention is, much of what you have proposed. So I would hope that the grief would be allayed in that respect. 
   Secondly, let me say this. No conference. Why no conference? Because a Republican Member of the United States Senate wouldn't let us go to conference. That's why there was no conference. He stood day after day after day objecting to adopting this important reform package. 
   As a result, we couldn't go to conference. So you can't complain on the one hand we are not in conference when it is a Republican Senator from South Carolina who day after day, week after week, objected to doing just that. 
   Today is a proud day for this body. Again, I congratulate my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and a dramatic example of how the Congress that was elected last November pledging to clean up the culture of corruption is making good on its promise. 
   I will talk about that a little bit at the end in terms of rules are nice, but performance is better. Last January, on the first day of this new, Congress we enacted sweeping ethics changes. Today, with this Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, we have a simple, straightforward purpose, to continue to restore public confidence in the legislative process. 
   I commend Chairman Conyers, as I have, for his leadership in making possible this comprehensive reform measure. By shining a bright light on the campaign contributions that registered lobbyists bundle for Members of Congress, the conference report before us increases transparency and gives the American people important insight on the legislative process. 
   By denying Members convicted of crimes their congressional pensions, the conference report ensures that Members who break their oath to uphold the laws of the land will not only suffer public disgrace and criminal sanction, but also lifetime financial loss. 
   There is no reason for taxpayers to subsidize criminal behavior of Members of Congress. Freshman Member Nancy Boyda deserves a great deal of credit for her work on this provision. By requiring Members engaged in any job negotiations to recuse themselves from any matter in which there is a conflict of interest, the conference report before us will end the practice of Members trying to cash in on the legislation they steer through this body. 
   I don't know how many of you had the opportunity to watch ``60 Minutes'' this past Sunday and hear the comments of Mr. Burton and Mr. Jones, but that is trying to address that critical problem. 
   As important as this legislation and the ethics changes made in January are, they alone will not ensure the integrity of our process and this institution. Rather, the Members of this House will ensure the integrity of this House when we conduct ourselves openly and honestly and hold accountable, through a vigorous pursuit of the enforcement of our rules by the Ethics Committee, hold accountable those who abide, do not abide by the rules in the highest ethical standards. 
   Thus we have an obligation to ensure that the Ethics Committee does the job that it was constituted to perform. It did not do so in the recent Congresses. The implementation of rules, while critical, must be followed by effective real enforcement. 
   This conference report is an important step forward, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle, including Mr. Smith, for the work that they have done through the years to bring us to this day and close by congratulating Mr. Conyers and the leadership of our Speaker in accomplishing this objective.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, when the Supreme Court wrongly decides a case, as they do from time to time, particularly when congressional intent is at issue, the United States Congress can and should act to remedy it. That is precisely what this carefully crafted measured legislation, the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, is designed to do. 
   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), and I thank the ranking member as well for the work that they do on this committee. 
   Make no mistake. The Court's 5-4 decision on May 29 in Ledbetter v. Goodyear was wrongly decided. The merits of Lilly Ledbetter's wage discrimination claim seemed beyond doubt. A Federal jury agreed that she was discriminated against. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agreed with Ms. Ledbetter's claims, although the Bush administration switched its position once the case got to the Supreme Court. 
   Most importantly, Lilly Ledbetter was paid less than all of her male counterparts, all of her male counterparts, even those who had less seniority. This clearly was not a case where her performance was suspect. Goodyear gave her a top performance award in 1996. 
   The fact is, the Court majority took an extremely cramped view of the title VII of the Civil Rights Act, holding that Ms. Ledbetter and claimants like her must file their pay discrimination claims within 180 days of the original discriminatory act. In other words, even if the discriminatory acts continued, every week, every biweek, every month, that they would have to look back to the original first check. 
   There are at least three serious problems with the Court's flawed analysis. First, the unlawful discrimination against Ms. Ledbetter did not begin and end with Goodyear's original decision to pay her less than they paid her male counterparts. 
   In fact, every paycheck that Lilly Ledbetter received after Goodyear's decision to pay her less was a continuing manifestation of Goodyear's illegal discrimination. As Justice Ginsburg said  in dissent, each subsequent paycheck was ``infected'' by the original decision to unlawfully discriminate. 
   Secondly, the Court dismissed the realities of the workplace far too casually. Detecting pay discrimination is not easy, and sometimes it may take years to uncover. 
   Now, each of us in this body knows what the other Member of the body makes, but that is not true in almost every workplace in America. Why? Because people generally do not talk openly with their coworkers about their salaries, raises and bonuses. In fact, many employers strive to keep such information confidential. 
   Just consider, Ms. Ledbetter apparently did not become aware that she had been discriminated against until she received an anonymous letter alerting her to the discrimination. 
   Third, the Court majority ignored its own holdings that Congress intended title VII, the majority ignored its own holdings that Congress intended title VII to have a broad, remedial purpose, to make persons whole for injuries suffered on accounts of unlawful employment discrimination. 
   Finally, let me say that those who claim that this bill somehow eliminates the statue of limitations are incorrect. Under this bill, as we thought the law was for 30 years, an employee must still file a charge within the statutory filing period after receiving a discriminatory paycheck. 
   This bill is fair, it is just, and it comports with the intent of this Congress in passing the Civil Rights Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to make sure that what Congress intended is, in fact, what the law remains.

There was concern, and obviously we didn't want to stimulate and depress at the same point in time, so that was under discussion. But I will tell you on the housing bill itself, Mr. Frank has been working on that with his committee, Maxine Waters and others, and with Mr. Bachus and others on the committee. And we would certainly hope to move a housing bill in the near term, certainly no later than the latter part of this month or the very first days of the next month, so that we can pass a bill that would give relief to those who have either been foreclosed upon or are on the brink of foreclosure. We believe that it is essential for us to try to address what is a national problem and a very serious one. And so, that will also go into the consideration, I think, of how much money is needed, how that will be paid for.

   Mr. HOYER. Thank you very much for yielding. 
   I will say that over the last 7 years, the President has told us things are pretty good. There was never a right time for revenues to be increased. Even in the times when the President was telling us the economy was robust, we were growing, we still weren't paying our bills. 
   We feel very strongly on this side of the aisle, and Mr. Bernanke, in a telephone conversation with me, said one of the things we didn't want to do, when you and I and Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi were talking about the stimulus package, one thing we did not want to do is exacerbate the long-term debt that confronts us. Mr. Bernanke is very concerned about that. But certainly in the context of wanting to move quickly in an emergency way where we have an economy now that Mr. Bernanke, although he didn't say it was a recession, he certainly gave the implication that we were on the brink of that, we're very concerned about the economic policies, very frankly, that we think have led to that. 
   But I will say that we have two concerns: Number one, paying for what we buy, not exacerbating the 
   deficit. But clearly we're concerned about getting relief to people that need it in the short term. But my discussions with Mr. Bernanke were, yes, tax increases in the short term he thought were not helpful, but he wanted to make it very clear that he thought making the debt worse over the long term, whether it's for international expenses or domestic expenses, was not helpful to the economy in the long term. 
   I thank my friend for yielding.

I won't debate that now, but I would be interested in discussing it at some point in time because, as you know, in those years revenues fell short of the administration's projections in the previous years.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me the time. I thank him as well for his leadership. I thank Mr. Reyes for his leadership. And, yes, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for his leadership as well, as well as Mr. Smith. 
   This is a very serious issue we confront today. This bill passed the Senate less than 24 hours ago; yet this coequal branch of the government of the United States is asked to do what the minority when it was in the majority would never have done, to take exactly what the Senate tells us to take, or, frankly, what the President tells us to take. 
   Now, let me say that we passed a bill November 15, 3 months ago, which gave the FISA Court and which gave the intelligence community everything they needed, given the technological changes and given the demands of keeping America safe. Everything. The Senate passed a bill out of their committee at about the same time. 
   But I want to tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the Senate you have been slow-walking this bill. You have been slow-walking this bill to put us in the position we find ourselves in today. And you did it because the issue here is not the intelligence community, as Mr. Hoekstra talked about. It is the telecommunications companies. That is what the issue is here. Because title I would have been conferenced months ago. But, no, we do not want to apparently look very closely at what happened between the administration and the telecommunications companies. 
   Now, we passed a statute which said to the telecommunications companies, look, when we make phone calls, they need to be private and you can't disclose those to people, including the government, without a court order. We passed the FISA Court bill specifically to provide for the ability of our intelligence community to intercept communications, but to do so under the aegis of a court. That is what we do in America. It makes us a little different. Some governments, of course, do willy-nilly whatever they want to do. 
   This is not just about FISA. We incarcerate people without hearings, without lawyers. We torture people, contrary to the edicts of the international law, rationalized by an Attorney General of the United States in a memo to the President of the United States. 
   But I tell my friends that nobody in this institution ought to have any self-respect if what you are saying is we ought not to go to conference on this important issue, which is what you say by voting against this extension. This extension is caused almost solely by the members of the President's party in the United States Senate who would not allow this legislation to move more quickly in the Senate. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe our friends on the other side of the aisle and the President of the United States are taking an untenable position. And what is that position? On the one hand, if the Protect America Act expires, America will be at risk. On the other hand, if we extend and keep in force the Protect America Act, the President says he will veto it. Now, I don't know what kind of Lewis Carroll logic that is, but it certainly escapes me. If in fact, and I don't agree with the President, but if in fact it is important to keep the Protect America Act in place, then passing this extension is the best way to do so. 
   Now, I think there are some things that we can discuss in conference. I, frankly, have told the White House as late as just a few hours ago that I think we can discuss possible ways to move forward on this, because there is not a person on this floor that doesn't want to protect America, that doesn't want to facilitate the interception of communications valuable to that objective of protecting America and Americans. 
   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this extension, just as we did by unanimous consent essentially without a vote just a few weeks ago. The contemplation then was that the Senate would act. But the Senate did not act. It did not act until less than 24 hours ago, last night, late afternoon, and now we are confronted with take it or leave it. 
   Do we have no self-respect in this institution? Do we have no sense of responsibility to oversee that which has been passed, to go to conference and discuss our differences? There are differences, as you know. I would hope that every Member would say to themselves, yes, we have that kind of self-respect, and we understand our responsibility as an independent House of the Congress of the United States. 
   The logic of the opponents of this legislation, as I said, escapes me. The Protect America Act is imperative, they say, but they oppose its extension, as I said. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this 21-day extension. I want everybody on this House floor to understand that if we have a 21-day extension, I am hopeful that we will go to conference, I am hopeful the Senate will agree to a conference, and I am hopeful that we can engage Republicans and Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, on the Judiciary Committee, in an honest conference trying to resolve our differences and pass legislation that helps protect America. I want to remind my colleagues that this body has already passed reauthorization, so there is no need to do that. We are ready for conference right now. 
   So, Madam Speaker, in closing, let me urge every Member of this House, whether you are for or against the Protect America Act, whether you are for or against immunity, whether you are for or against title I of this bill, vote for this extension, just as you would vote for a CR and not shut down the government in order to give us time to pass appropriation bills fully. That is what this is, simply to give us 3 weeks, 10 days of which we won't be here, to address this very thorny issue on which there are legitimate differences of opinion. 
   The only other thing one could conclude is simply we are taking the position of ``Take it or leave it, House. Don't exercise your judgment, House. Don't meet your responsibilities to the American people, House.'' 
   That is not what our constituents expect us to do. Vote for this extension.  
   Madam Speaker, I believe our friends on the other side of the aisle and the President of the United States are taking an untenable position on this legislation to provide a 21-day extension of the Protect America Act. On one hand, they argue that the extension of the PAA is vital to our national security. Yet, on the other hand, they come to this floor and oppose--and the President is threatening to veto--the 21-day extension of the PAA. 
   The logic of the opponents of this legislation escapes me. The PAA is imperative, they say. But they oppose its extension? 
   Madam Speaker, I support this 21-day extension. Here's why: it represents progress toward a final measure to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that this body has already passed legislation to reauthorize FISA. On November 15--3 months ago this Friday--the House passed the Restore Act, a bill that modernizes the technologically outdated FISA statute, gives the intelligence community the authority to intercept critical foreign communications, and honors our constitutional principles. 
   As we all know, this is a complicated issue. That is precisely why we're doing this extension today. With this vote, we are declaring that we will not just take whatever legislation the Senate sends us and rubber-stamp it. We are declaring that this body has a prerogative and a role in making law. 
   The bottom line is: responsible people in both Chambers want an opportunity to work out the differences between the House and Senate bills. 
   Let me close by saying, I do not agree with those who contend that the expiration of the PAA will jeopardize our national security. And, I am not alone in this view. 
   For example, Richard Clarke, the former chief National Security Council counterterrorism advisor to Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, has stated (and I quote):  
   Our ability to track and monitor terrorists overseas would not cease should the Protect  America Act expire. If this were true, the President would not threaten to terminate any temporary extension with his veto pen. All surveillance currently occurring would continue even after legislative provisions lapsed because authorizations issued under the act are in effect up to a full year.  
   And, Kenneth Wainstein, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, recently said in an interview--according to the New York Times--that if the PAA expires, intelligence officials would still be able to continue eavesdropping on already approved targets for another year under the law. 
   We must not fall prey to fearmongers who claim that our intelligence community could ``go dark.'' That is simply not true. 
   I urge my colleagues: pass this 21-day extension of the PAA so that we may try to work out our differences with the Senate-passed legislation, and enact legislation that protects our national security and the constitutional rights of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HONORING ROB COGORNO -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, over the years, we have been greatly advantaged by some extraordinary people who work with us and for us. I have been particularly advantaged as the minority whip with an extraordinary man who has worked for me now for 5 years. Prior to that, he worked for Dick Gephardt for many years and has been on this floor working on behalf of not only the majority side or the minority side, depending on what the Democrats were, but also in trying to make sure that this institution talked to one another and worked together as well as it possibly could. 
   He is going to be retiring now after 25 years of service to this institution. He's been a congressional staffer since 1983. He has served as floor director for the majority leader since January of 2007, myself. In that capacity, he has been responsible for scheduling bills and managing the daily legislative program. He's provided tremendous legislative advice to so many of you on the floor who have gone to him and asked him for his counsel. He's provided policy advice to our side of the aisle and policy discussion with your side of the aisle, and he has also been a communications counsel. 
   There is nobody who knows this young man who does not like him. He is a decent, good, very smart, wonderful human being. 
   He served as floor director in my office, as I said, for 4 years. Prior to that, Rob was the chief appropriations staffer for former Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, and he also worked for Representatives ROSA DELAURO and PETER VISCLOSKY. In those positions, his primary areas of focus included appropriations, global health, and foreign assistance. 
   During his career, Rob also worked for former Senator Brock Adams and former Representatives Jimmy Hayes, Cathy Long, and Gillis Long. 
   Rob is a graduate of the University of California Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in physiology and earned a master's in public policy at the University of Washington, and before that, was floor director for the Democratic whip's office. 
   All of us have deep affection for those people who spend extraordinary amounts of time at pay, which is not comparable to what they would be earning in the private sector. And I want to say, Rob Cogorno, to you, how very much I appreciate all that you have done for this institution, all that you have done for me as an individual, and I know I speak for all of the Members that we will greatly miss your advice and your counsel, your good humor and your good judgment. And we say to you, we wish you the very best of luck in everything you do. 
   I might also say that the young man who just gave me another piece of paper with some business is Rob's successor, and I urge Members of both sides of the aisle when he can be helpful to you, give you advice in terms of scheduling or the calendar in terms of when we are doing business, Alejandro Perez, my new floor director.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7060, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of this rule and strong support of this bill. 
   I want to say to my friend, I am mindful of the issue he raises. I think that ought to be addressed and I certainly will look forward to working with him and others in addressing this as we move along; and before, hopefully, we leave here because he makes a good point. 
   I support this bill for two reasons. First, because it provides essential tax relief to American families and businesses. And secondly, just as importantly, because it is paid for. 
   The tax credits extended by this bill, some of the most necessary, are those that support renewable energy and energy efficiency. Business and political leaders agree. This summer, 51 State governors sent us a letter which read in part: ``Extending tax incentives for energy efficiency and conservation will slow the growth of future energy needs, minimize ratepayers' costs, and lessen potential environmental impacts.'' 
   New energy technologies may not end the pain of $4 a gallon gas in the short term, but those technologies which this bill helps to support are the only long-term solutions to our energy crunch. In the meantime, alternative energy tax credits will create tens of thousands of American jobs. We must pass this legislation. 
   Now, I was proud of the fact that the House passed a bill expanding domestic production of oil just this month. But a country that controls less than 3 percent of the world's oil supply, while using more than a quarter, cannot drill its way out of the fundamental problem. Boone Pickens has made that very clear to all of us. 
   That is why I am glad to see the House consider farsighted legislation like this. But I don't just support the goals of this bill, I support it because its tax credits are not financed by even more debt. We are going to incur a lot of debt, we are going to incur a lot of debt in this week. We did so yesterday. Almost all of the Members of this House voted to so-called fix the alternative minimum tax. I voted against that. I voted against it because it wasn't paid for. 
   The means used to pay for this legislation are not controversial. They include a provision to close a loophole that allows hedge fund managers and other high-income corporate executives to defer taxes through offshore tax havens. What does that mean, the rest of us pay more. 
   A large majority of the business community agrees that we should close that loophole. So do majorities in the House and Senate. Only a Republican minority in the Senate, frankly, is putting high-income tax loopholes above fiscal sanity. They are insisting, instead, that we pay for this bill with borrowed money. 
   I understand that bind, the bind that presents for principled Senate Democrats. But fiscal responsibility is not something we can compromise on, especially now. We have a crisis. This economy is in the worse shape it has been in half a century, notwithstanding the protestations that were made in 2001 and 2002 and 2003 and 2004 and 2005 and 2006 about how good this economy was, and the fact that the tax and economic policies being pursued by this administration were making our economy grow and expand and create jobs. The fact of the matter is, we have lost jobs this year; 500,000 jobs. Bill Clinton in the same period of time in his administration created 1.4 million new jobs. That is a net turnaround of 2 million jobs. 
   But fiscal responsibility is not something that we can compromise on, especially now. In crisis, we need to act. But in time of financial crisis brought on, in part, by massive fiscal irresponsibility and regulatory neglect, Mr. Speaker, no matter how much we value this extenders bill, it is simply wrong to pay for it by once more whipping out the national credit card. We don't need to do that. We have not done it, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this bill. They support the policies. All we are asking is to pay for it, and the pay-fors in this bill are not controversial. That is the kind of thinking that swung the Clinton surplus deep into record debt under President Bush and led to more foreign borrowing by this administration than by the first 42 administrations combined. In other words, we have had to borrow more money from foreign governments during the last 90 months than we borrowed in the previous 219 years. 
   We helped to create a crisis of confidence in our financial system which we are being asked to pay for, dearly. Charging our children and grandchildren for our priorities is deeply unwise, and I would suggest immoral. 
   This year, Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, was one of the few Republicans to bravely break with his party and insist that this bill be paid for. He said, and I call my Republican colleagues' attention to what Bob Corker had to say: ``It is the first time in a  long time I thought we had something that was intellectually honest,'' and that is paying for this bill. ``And I have to tell you, my big fear is our tremendous lack of fiscal discipline.'' So said Bob Corker, Republican from Tennessee, when calling upon his body to pay for this bill. 
   That fear of more debt is entirely reasonable. I am glad more and more Members of Congress are coming to share it. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, not because they are Republicans or Democrats, but because they love our country, they want to see our fiscal ship of state righted, realizing we are in a crisis time, and they have an opportunity to act in a fiscally responsible way today. Take that opportunity. Show America that we have the courage to pay for what we buy while at the same time giving tax relief to people who need it, to businesses who will expand and create jobs, and to an energy independence that is so critical for our Nation.

   Frankly, I have not seen it, and I don't know. What I do know is that Mr. Arcuri informed me, and obviously has asked us--Mr. Arcuri feels very badly that a different version than was at the desk was given to the minority inadvertently; and as a result, the minority did not have the document in front of it. It was at the desk, but nobody's gone up to the desk to compare the items. And as a result, we think, in fairness, we ought to have that document in front of you.

   Now, frankly, I don't want to get into moving rapidly. The administration, of  course, came here Thursday and wanted us to pass $700 billion, and they want us to pass this very soon. So ``rapidly'' sometimes is in the eye of the beholder. 
   The point is, you're correct; there was a discrepancy. We think that was not fair. It was not intentional. But Mr. Arcuri, who gave the information to the minority and the information that was on the Web site, was not correct.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is a serious issue, and there are a lot of related issues. 
   The gentleman who spoke before me, and I have a great deal of respect and affection for him, we treat one another with respect. We put a price-gouging bill on the floor because we were concerned about the spikes in pricing. Indeed, we saw, as Ike was coming and bearing down on Texas, before it ever got to the shoreline, there were $5 per gallon prices, before it ever got to the shoreline, before it ever destroyed anything. 
   My friend voted against the price-gouging bill. 
   These are serious pieces of legislation. The Republicans were in charge of the House for 6 years. In 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, they controlled the White House. 
   I have in my hand the eight pages that the administration, Mr. Bush, has submitted to us, President Bush submitted to us, over the last 8 years. Six of those years they were included in the appropriations bills passed by the Republican Congress and Republican Senate and signed by a Republican President. 
   In each of those bills, the administration asked to continue the moratoria on drilling, every one of them, passed for 6 years by your Congress. We didn't have the votes to pass anything. 
   Then we took over the control, because the Congress was fed up, frankly, with a complacent, do-nothing Congress, complicit in moving in the wrong direction, which 82 percent of America thinks we are now on, the wrong direction. 
   This Congress has mightily tried to change direction, and, in fact, we have in many areas, including a comprehensive energy bill last year that the President signed. Sam Bodman said it was a great bill, the Secretary of Energy. It passed in a bipartisan fashion in both the Senate and the House. 
   President Bush, in last year, fiscal year 2008, submitted a budget document, he submitted it, which said, the moratoria should continue. This year, the President submitted a bill, for the 2009 fiscal year, which said the moratoria should continue. 
   So these crocodile tears about how Democrats have taken over and all of a sudden gas prices have spiked, you give us far more credit than we deserve in light of not being able to override the President's veto on almost anything that he didn't want. He signed some things that he didn't want like the minimum wage. He signed some things he said he wasn't going to sign, like the GI Bill. He signed some things that we passed through the House and Senate. 
   But these crocodile tears are unwarranted by your record, and by the submissions of the budgets, by your President, for 8 years running. Now, a couple of months ago, the moratoria which was put on by George Bush, his father, was lifted. Why? Because our constituents are hurting. Why? Because we are being held up by those who are selling oil. Why? Because the market is being manipulated and speculators are impacting on price. 
   You think that's not the case, or do you think all of a sudden demand went down by a third, so it went from $146 down to $92 today, within just a few months. Who believes the free market operates in a way that demand spikes for oil that much in a 90-day period? Nobody on this floor who is rational believes that. 
   Something is rotten in my home of Denmark. And, actually, it's not rotten in Denmark; it's rotten someplace, though. Mr. Abercrombie is going to speak on behalf of this bill, as he met with Mr. Peterson and tried to come together. 
   Originally this bill, the gang of 20 in the Senate, which apparently you don't like, because they are undermining the drill, drill, drill political advantage that you have sought, the 20 said let's deal with four States. We are saying let's deal with every State. We do say with sensitivity, as the previous speaker said about his State, States are going to have the opportunity to make a determination as to whether they want to proceed. 
   Now, you could argue that that shouldn't be the case, because, after all, that's Federal. It's not State property, you get that far out. 
   We have done a lot of work. We have done a lot of work in trying to work across this spectrum. I want to congratulate Mr. Rahall and Mr. Green and others who have worked so hard to try to bring us together. 
   I will tell my friend, we do deal with oil shale in this bill. In your bill, you repeal a section which had caused a problem. We repealed that as well, so your bill and our bill did the same thing on that. Furthermore, we said three States that have substantial oil shale ought to have the same opportunity that the coastal States have to opt in to develop that. 
   Whether the technology is available now, I don't know. In part, I believe the arguments used on this floor, which I will say as an aside, I think was a misuse of this floor. But notwithstanding that, arguments that were made day after day after day were not  accurate, and you knew they were not accurate, which is why it made it so difficult to respond to. 
   None of you ever mentioned the fact that the President of the United States, George Bush, submitted, months ago and 7 years prior to that, and you passed 6 years in a row, on your watch, the moratoria, of which you now wring your hands. 
   All of us are concerned. All through the summer and into the fall Americans have been filling up their cars at record prices in my district and every district, $60, $80, $100 a tank and looking for Washington to help, to see what we could do about it. We are trying to do something about it. 
   Now, you passed an energy bill in 2005. Your Speaker, Mr. Hastert, your majority leader or now minority leader, Mr. Boehner, and my good friend, your whip, said to us, and I won't quote them all at length but I will quote your Speaker, Americans need this bill--your energy bill passed in 2005--to lower their energy prices, to drive economic growth and job creation, and to promote greater energy independence. That's what you said your bill was going to do. 
   You also said, of course, in 2001, that we were going to have the greatest economy we would ever have seen if we passed your economic improvement program. I doubt that any American believes that you accomplished that objective. You passed your bill, the President signed it. Just a short number of months later prices went from $1.46, when you took over, to over $4.20. 
   If it was a successful energy program, it was a successful energy program in driving up the price of gasoline for all of our consumers. To see what we could do about this we met, we talked to Mr. Abercrombie, we talked to Mr. Peterson to try to bring our caucus together. It was a diverse caucus. A lot of people felt President Bush was right, those 8 years that he submitted those bills and that you passed 6 years you were in charge. 
   To relieve the strain on their budgets and their families, not 10 years from now but now, today, I am sure you are wondering whether we will throw up our hands on the work of compromise and retreat into finger pointing. I think we can do better than that on both sides. 
   Both of us want to make sure that we bring prices down, and both sides of the aisle want to see energy independence. We can pass this bill, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act. You say it's not perfect. Many Members on our side say it is not perfect, but it is a very significant step and a very significant expansion of where oil could be found. 
   I would reiterate, there are 68 million acres right now, right now, as I stand here, that could be drilled upon right now without any further legislation, regulation or administrative action. 
   This legislation, this bold step towards a comprehensive energy policy, is worthy of the 21st century. Lower gas prices today, American oil and natural gas for the years to come, that's what this bill promises and will provide, and serious investment in a new generation of energy technologies for a cleaner, more secure energy future. It's all here, and we are all going on record this evening. 
   Here is what the energy package is going to accomplish. First, we are going to drill for more oil and gas here at home. That's what Americans have said. Use our resources. Don't rely on the Middle East. Don't rely on Venezuela. Don't rely on Russia. Certainly, don't rely on Iran. Drill here. 
   We have both said all along, we put a bill on the floor, drill responsibly in presently leased land, that Mr. Rahall led. Most of you, many of you voted against it. For many of my colleagues, I know that drilling is the most contentious part of this compromise, but we have worked hard to find common ground. 
   Drilling will come with strong, new environmental protections. Americans want that. They want resources, but they want them safely gotten. It will take place well offshore, as opposed to the 3-mile zone that will go up for grabs in 15 days if we vote this bill down and do nothing. 
   I don't know how many of you are for that. Maybe all of you are for it on that side. I don't think our citizens are for it. In the areas closer to shore, we are letting the States themselves make the final call. To my colleagues on the Republican side who argue that States won't opt in without revenue sharing, I reply this, if the ground swell for drilling is as strong as you have said it is, and I believe it is, surely our State leaders will listen. 
   Do not ascribe to us the only ones who will respond to the public's desire to find more resources. Certainly our State leaders will respond as well. They will feel comfort that their State has made that determination. 
   That's not to mention the job creation that will occur in States, what a motivation that is. We are also including diligent development provisions, which, by the way, you included in your 2005 bill. We thought it was a good provision. We called it ``use it or lose it.'' You voted against it because it wasn't your bill. You voted for it when it was development in your bill. When we put it on the floor, you voted against it. 
   Second, we are going to take immediate action to lower the price of oil by releasing 10 percent of the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We proposed that; the President said ``no.'' We said don't buy any more. The President said ``no.'' Both of those policies are now being pursued by the administration. 
   Tax incentives for plug-in hybrid cars, solar and wind power, biofuels and energy efficient homes. Why? Because we can't drill ourselves out of this. We need to drill, we want to drill, we are providing for drilling, but that's not the solution. 
   It is part of the solution. We all understand, you say, all of the above. We say, yes, let's invest in alternative research, for cutting-edge energy research, support for mass transit and renewable energy.     
   We need all of those steps if we are going to be energy independent. 
   Some day soon I think we will look back on these investments as the beginning of the end of our oil addiction. We are going to fund them by recovering the royalties the oil companies owe the American people. Who here believes you need to incentivize a company to produce a product that is getting the highest price it has ever gotten in history. I don't find that premise in my free market concept. The free market operates that if people are buying your product and they are paying you a very good price, by golly, you try to provide more product for them. 
   Refineries were operating at less than 90 percent, or about 91 percent this summer, the lowest point they have been at refining capacity in a number of years, not because they didn't have supply. They have got supply. There are no shortages, there are no lines. They are just charging a high price. 
   We are going to fund that research, as I said, by asking the oil companies to pay their fair share. They are making good money and our citizens shouldn't have to pay more to run their government because some oil companies are not paying their fair share. It simply doesn't make economic sense to do billions of dollars of tax cuts to oil companies while our citizens are paying high taxes. 
   All of that is our energy solution. We have not left a stone unturned or a remedy untried. To my Democratic colleagues, I don't think a single one of us is happy with every single provision in this bill. I know I am not. There would have been some additional things I would have liked in this bill. But I also know that is the price of a good compromise, and making good compromises is our business. To my Republican colleagues, you have told us loud and long, and I want to congratulate Mr. Peterson for the work he has done in bringing this issue to the fore and talking about it, not just this year because I have known him for a long time. We served on the Appropriations Committee, and he has been consistent and constant in his focus on this issue. 
   Your Presidential candidate is running for office under the motto ``Country First.'' We would all run on that platform. 
   I am for Mr. Obama, as all of you know. He wants to see change and a new direction. But certainly all of us agree that our country comes first, perhaps not before God, perhaps we would say our family is critical, but certainly country is our consideration.  
   Democrats and Republicans, we are all being watched today and they can see partisan differences, partisan divide, and sending a partisan bill to the Senate. We can perhaps do that, and maybe we will. Our public will not be pleased. This bill is not perfect. It is not everything you wanted; it is not everything I wanted. But it is a substantial expansion on drilling, a substantial investment on renewables, a substantial investment on conservation. We ought to pass this bill.

   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, that provision, of course, was added under your leadership to manufacturing. It wasn't in manufacturing, as you probably know, when it was originally adopted because it was not perceived that the oil companies were in manufacturing as the bill contemplated to be. 
   Then you thought the oil companies weren't doing well enough, and so you wanted to add that provision and you added it under Republican leadership. Very frankly, we thought that was not a wise move at that time, and we don't think it is a wise move now. And very frankly, I don't think the American public thinks that the oil companies will go out of business if we don't give them this tax incentive.

   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, they go no place in the world, my friend, where they pay less than they do in the United States to those nationalized countries that allow them to drill. No place in the world do they pay less. If they went to Venezuela, they pay 93 percent. If they went to Norway, they pay 78 percent. Nowhere in the world, my friend, do they pay less than they pay here, and the difference is made up by your taxpayers and my taxpayers. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a good bill. It is not a perfect bill. But it is a good-faith effort to move this issue forward, to make us independent, to bring prices down, to invest in the future which renewables are clearly the harbinger of, and to make sure that we take the action our public wants. 
   I thank Mr. Rahall for his leadership, and I urge every Member of this body on both sides, vote for this piece of legislation. Move us toward energy independence, not just today but tomorrow and tomorrow.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman and thank him for his leadership, and I rise in strong support of the bill and strong opposition to the amendment that will be offered. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, put this bill in context. I am not sure whether there were 435 of us, I don't know the total vote, but let's say 430. 430 of us this night, this night, voted either to give the States the option to opt out of one of the most important issues confronting us, and that is using American resources for our energy needs, or the other half voted to let the States opt in. So hear me. Everybody on this House floor voted to allow the States either to opt in or to opt out. Pick your bill. But the premise was the same, that States had the authority to act themselves. 
   The amendment to be offered rejects that and imposes, not on Detroit that the gentleman mentioned, there is no legislation on the floor about Detroit, Michigan. There is no legislation on this floor about Indianapolis, Indiana. I don't know what their gun law is. And, very frankly, there is none about Hartford, Connecticut, or Baltimore, Maryland. But the District of Columbia comes here, unfortunately defenseless, from the perspective of some on this floor. Their defense is us. 
   But let me speak to this. 220 years before this Capitol had been imagined and when this city was a swamp, our Founders were asking a question we still hear echoed in the District to this day: How could they establish a Federal city, cut it out from its home State and put it under the rule of Congress without violating the principles they had just fought a war to secure? That was their question. Government comes from the consent of the governed. That is a principle we hold dear, asterisk, except for the 600,000 people who happen to live in Washington, D.C. 
   In the 43rd Federalist Paper published in 1788, James Madison answered the question that was posed, that our authority over the District would be legitimate only if some basic guarantees were in place. The Government, and I quote, ``will no doubt provide for the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it.'' 
   In other words, James Madison thought we would surely secure the rights of the citizens of the District of Columbia. And when we refer to the citizens of the District of Columbia, let us, my friends, be more expansive: Citizens of America who happen to live in the District of Columbia, and, but for Maryland's generosity, would live in Maryland. They are citizens of America who happen to live in the District of Columbia. But should they be disenfranchised because they happen to live in this square that we call the District of Columbia? 
   He went on to say, and ``a municipal legislature for local purposes derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them.'' That is the options to make their policy. 
   Now, listen to the confidence with which Madison wrote. His words suggested that ``no doubt,'' ``no doubt,'' Madison said, that surely the Congress of the United States and the Founding Fathers who had expressed the rights of our citizens would respect those rights, wherever those citizens might reside. And that ``of course'' they will be citizens, not subjects, unlike apparently those in Indianapolis or in other cities. 
   I think his confidence would be shaken if he could hear this debate, if he could see what a congressionally imposed gun policy would do to the District's right to govern itself. 
   We can argue back and forth the gun policy. What we cannot argue back and forth is that the District of Columbia citizens have the right and should have that right to govern themselves. That is the principle that is at stake here. 
   I will leave the argument over gun rights and gun control to other Members. We have a gun law in Maryland. It works well. I don't get any complaints about it. If I did, I would have to address it. I wouldn't expect you to address it, unless you wanted to pass a Federal statute. This is not a Federal statute. This is a statute for one area. 
   Whatever conclusion this House comes to, we are really confronted with a much more fundamental question, as I said: Do we impose that decision on those who have had no say in it, or do we pass the Norton bill as introduced, which I am in favor of, and require the people of the District of Columbia to comply with the Supreme Court's decision through local legislation, as all of us have to do? No more, no less. 
   The people of Maryland need to comply with the Constitution, as do the people of the District of Columbia. But you don't interpose your judgment. In fact, somebody repairs to the courts and the courts decide. The courts decided in this case, and the District of Columbia is moving to comply with the Court's decision. 
   You may disagree with their compliance, and indeed somebody may take it to court and the court will say, no, District of Columbia, you didn't do it right. That happens to us all. But we should not interpose our own judgment. Madison believed that would not be consistent with our principles.  
   If Congress imposes a gun policy on the people of D.C., are we meeting any of those conditions? Are we providing for their rights and consent? No. They do not have the right to consent to anything that goes on here. 
   Do they have a ``voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them''? Well, yes, in a way they do. They elect Ms. Norton. We don't give her a vote. That is wrong. They elect their council. They elect their mayor. But, oh, by the way, if we don't like your policies, we will overturn them. Not because a court has found them to be unconstitutional, but because we interpose our judgment. Madison would have thought that was wrong. 
   Where is their equal vote in this Congress? Are they allowed a ``municipal legislature for local purposes''? Well, yes, sort of, but subject to our interposing our own judgment for theirs. We are not elected to be local city council persons. Well, the City Council still meets. But on this supremely local and sensitive issue, we are preparing to silence it.     
   The principle of federalism, which so many of my colleagues profess, say that local problems are best tackled locally. That is why I suggest 435 of us, there weren't 435 that voted, but unanimously voted, either to allow individual States to opt out of an important policy, or to opt in to an important policy. But we gave those States that right. Both sides gave it to them. Every one of us voted for that option, and we turn around and say, oh, but we are not going to give that option to the District of Columbia. 
   The closer you get to the problem, the more direct knowledge and direct accountability you find. While we in Congress may be close physically, we are still a world away from the gun violence the D.C. Council is struggling to confront, all the while upholding the Court's decision. 
   They know they have to do that. They know the Court will oversee it. Let the law operate as it was intended to do, and if they do not comply with the Supreme Court decision, the Court will say so. 
   I ask my colleagues candidly, who is better equipped to make these difficult decisions, Congress or the people of this community? The people of our communities believe that they are best qualified to make their local decisions. 
   I don't know how you can call yourself a Federalist and answer Congress. A conservative columnist put it well a few years ago. ``You can't favor federalism for only ideas you like.'' 
   Federalism is about allowing local and State governments to make decisions you don't like. So the ultimate issue here is not guns, it is a question of who here is prepared to be consistent in their principles, and of who here is prepared to respect the District's right of self-government, as was referred to by James Madison, which he said, the founders, which I am saying, the founders, took for granted. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this base bill. Whatever position you have on guns, this is an issue of federalism and principle and local option, local government. 
   You voted that way for the States on energy. Vote that way for the citizens of the District of Columbia.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, you only need to open a newspaper or turn on a TV to see the case for this economic recovery package made far more eloquently than I can make it. 
   The financial crisis we are facing would have repercussions far beyond Wall Street--it could endanger the economic security of millions. Crisis or not, we are facing an economic downturn that is very real, one that speaks poorly of the President's economic stewardship. This year, America has lost jobs every single month--a total of 605,000 this year. More than a million American families have been foreclosed on, and the housing market has taken its worst dive since the Great Depression. Household income is down under President Bush. 5.7 million more Americans are living in poverty since he took office. And today, 46 million of our fellow Americans are without health insurance. 
   All of those facts call out, urgently, for this recovery package. 
   This bill provides immediate assistance to those who are suffering through an economic storm not of their making. And, just as importantly, it gives that assistance in a way that stimulates the economy as a whole. It has five key provisions. 
   First, it supports efforts to renew America's outdated, worn-down infrastructure--the roads, bridges, pipes, and tracks that are the foundation of our economy. Infrastructure projects are surefire job-creators. And we cannot expect to be a prosperous nation when more than 150,000 of our bridges are in as dangerous a shape as the bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis last year, and when some of our cities depend on century-old water systems. Past infrastructure investments--from canals to electrification to interstate highways--have brought significant economic growth in their wake. 
   Second, this bill makes a serious investment in several renewable energy and energy independence programs. I am particularly glad that it includes funding for the advanced battery loan guarantee program authorized by last year's energy bill. The program will provide assistance in the construction of domestic facilities to manufacture advanced lithium-ion battery systems, one of the energy innovations we are counting on to break our dependence on foreign oil and revitalize American industry. I was proud to write that provision with Mr. Dingell, and Mr. INSLEE's support has been instrumental in making it a priority. 
   Third, this bill adds resources to the Federal Medical Assistance Program, sending aid to states forced to cut back vital services in this time of shortfall. Surely, even in these hard times, we can set aside money to care for the poor and the sick. 
   Fourth, this bill includes a temporary increase in food stamp benefits. Food stamps can barely buy a month's food for families in normal times. With the recent spike in food prices, we need an increase in assistance to match. Moreover, economists find that food stamps are one of the best kinds of economic stimulus, injecting money right back into local communities. 
   Fifth and finally, the recovery package will extend unemployment benefits for seven weeks, or 13 weeks in the hardest-hit states. Like food stamps, unemployment benefits assist families while directly stimulating local economies. And if we do not act, nearly 800,000 workers who had their unemployment benefits extended in July will find themselves out of luck in a week and a half--dumped into the midst of a brewing economic crisis. 
   Mr. Speaker, the state of our economy demands a comprehensive response. It should include a 21st-century energy policy, sound regulations to protect investors and taxpayers, and the financial rescue we hope to bring to the floor soon. But right now, for the people of our districts, this bill is the single most meaningful thing we can do. I urge my colleagues to pass it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   I rise as someone who has, for 25 years, as a member of the Labor-Health Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee serving with my friend, Mr. Obey, supported increases in funding at NIH. 
   Mr. Castle is absolutely right. Many of those who come to our office want to make sure that we invest properly in the research and the basic biomedical research on disease. 
   John Porter was the chairman of our committee when we doubled the funding of NIH. We did so, of course, over the objections of the Republican budgets, as you may recall, which is why John Porter voted against so many of the Republican budgets because he said it did not sufficiently allow him to do his job. We agreed with him. 
   I care deeply about the process of discovery at NIH that brings so much hope to all the world for conquering and curing so many diseases that afflict humanity. Let me be clear, this amendment does not help medical research in my opinion. Not because it doesn't give it some more dollars. We have had a billion dollar increase, as you know, over the President's request. 
   I do not question the gentleman's motive in offering this amendment. I do question the wisdom of the measure which is, after all, what debates are about. 
   This amendment takes away from the whole spectrum of research, and particularly our ability to translate the research results from that basic research to its application to prevent, treat and cure illnesses that afflict mankind. 
   While this amendment may sound good, as very frankly some of the amendments that have been offered before which say we are going to take from here and give to there, which sound good on the surface, all of us would like to give more money to NIH. Simply stated, we do not have, however, the luxury of supporting research  for the sake of simply having research if we do not translate it, have the statistical data available and the application. I take a backseat to no one in supporting medical research, but to cut funding for other public health service agencies as proposed under this amendment is simply not good policy. It is not good for the health of our people. 
   If the gentleman would like to offer an amendment to increase funding for NIH without harming other health priorities, then certainly that should be discussed and supported. But let me note that this bill includes a $750 million increase in funding for NIH. I said a billion, which is a billion higher than the President's request. 
   If we are to take molecules and turn them into miracles, the research that all of us seek, then we must support the long-term quality of our research efforts. I have done so for the last, as I said, 25 years. It is important for us to do so. But I think, frankly, the gentleman's amendment will harm the objective that he ultimately seeks and that Mr. Castle spoke of and that all of us support. So I urge defeat of this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, this concept of community schools Mr. Walsh correctly refers to is a concept that is present in many States, many communities.     
   My wife Judy was the supervisor of early childhood education in Prince Georges County, Maryland, just down the road. She started a concept in our county of full service schools, community schools. There are now 24 Judy Centers in the State of Maryland. Maryland has paid for them, started them. 
   The problem with a full service community school, as Judy found out and as all of us know, is the turf battles. The turf battles are ferocious. Some people have made fun of the fact that it takes a village to raise a child. Now, obviously, hopefully every child has a good parent. But we have many services available to make sure that our young people, when they get to the ninth grade, are ready to succeed in the ninth and 10th and 11th and 12th  grades. But those services in many communities are discordant and not coordinated. So the concept of a full service or a community school is to bring together services, not in a forced way, but in a cooperative way. 
   Now, the gentlelady refers to the authorization on the appropriation bill. I know that the ranking member is shocked by that ever happening. I remember, perhaps before the gentlelady got here, when Bill Frist added 40 pages in the dead of night of authorizing language to an appropriation bill just a few years ago to preclude insurance company liability. 
   The fact of the matter is this $10 million in NIE is to encourage, facilitate cooperation, not to mandate spending more money; but to encourage educators, social services, child care providers, other services, as they have in the State of New York. I have visited some of them in the city. 
   So I would hope that we would not take this $10 million and add it to an $11 billion program. A critically important program, the gentlelady is absolutely correct, but it is a program that is funded $800 million more than President Bush asked for by this bill. And in order to add that $10 million to an $11 billion program, you will undermine the effort to see if we can create cooperation, in effect magnifying the role of each as they cooperate with one another. That is the concept, and it is a concept that works. 
   Superintendent Grasmick in my State has talked about this concept all over this country. I have talked about it to Secretary Spelling; I have talked about it to their predecessors. In fact, we did pass a bill through the House that didn't make it through conference which LYNN WOOLSEY had sponsored which had this concept. It is a concept that the Education and Labor Committee is now considering. They may go much broader than this. 
   But this is what NIE is all about. It is trying to facilitate better ways to deliver education to our children. And I remind the gentleman from New York, who is my friend and I am pleased to see him as the ranking member, but we do participate significantly in the education of children in this country, particularly children at risk. That is what this attempts to do as well, to magnify the services available, coordinate them, bring them together so they are accessible by people who can't get in their car at $3.15, and drive from this place to the other place to the other place to get services for their children. 
   So I would hope, ladies and gentlemen of this House, that we would reject this amendment. I thank the chairman for including this provision in the bill, and I would hope that the amendment would be rejected.

   You mentioned the programs that you have in North Carolina. BOBBY ETHERIDGE, of course one of the former superintendents of your State's system, your State has been an innovative, progressive leader in education and Jim Hunt has been one of the educational leaders in our country. I have no doubt, because I have worked with him over the last 20 years that I have been in Congress on various programs while he was Governor and since then, that, yes, you have moved ahead in North Carolina, but you have also done it in partnership with many Federal programs. I know that because I have worked with your Governor on that. I simply wanted to make that point. Again, this is a partnership. And I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, this bill was passed in the Senate a little over 2 weeks ago. Since that time we have had an extensive number of meetings, discussions. I'm hopeful, as you know, to have discussions with the whip, with the distinguished Republican whip, my friend, on this issue as well. I think both of us are going to be here tomorrow. We'll take that time perhaps to do that.     
   As I said, and I've said repeatedly, I think every Member of this House wants to pass legislation which will facilitate the interception of particularly foreign-to-foreign communications which may pose a danger to this country. 
   All of us are aware of the fact that technological changes have resulted in some questions being raised because of the fact that we have many of the communications coming through the United States. I frankly think, as the gentleman knows, there is really not a great deal of controversy or difference between the two Houses or between our two sides of the aisle on this issue. There's some differences, but they're not major differences. I think they can be addressed. 
   There are major differences with respect to the second title of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill which comes from the Senate which deals with retroactive immunity, which has nothing about prospective security but is obviously important for us to consider. We're also working on that as well, but I will tell the gentleman that we don't have agreement. But, as I said, I'm very hopeful that we will have legislation on the floor next week. I do not expect it to be, as the gentleman asked, the same bill that passed the House.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   As the gentleman knows, both the RESTORE Act, which passed this House, and the Senate bill both are similar in giving prospective immunity to telecoms that voluntarily or pursuant to order cooperate with us in accomplishing that objective. We believe, of course, that FISA was established so that a court review on process would be appropriate to ensure, in fact, that the collection of information is on foreign-to-foreign. 
   We well understand that, as the DNI has indicated, prospectively you may not know so you need authorization. Our bill provides for that. The Senate bill provides for that. I really don't believe that is a major contention of the bill. That's prospectively. 
   A major contention is, which we believe has nothing to do with security, on what has been done, and, frankly, I'm not sure we know exactly what has been done. As you know, I've taken the opportunity to be up in the intelligence room, in the secure room, and go through the papers that have been provided. My own view is they're not dispositive of the issue; but irrespective of that, we're working on title II as well, and I look forward to having discussions on that with you as well.

   Mr. HOYER. If I might comment on that, as you know, from our perspective, this is one of the problems. This is a very serious, important bill. It's critical to the defense of our country. I want to see that facilitated. I think every Member on both sides of the aisle wants to see that facilitated, but there are serious issues. There are serious constitutional issues involved here. 
   That's why FISA was passed in 1978, very frankly, as a result of an administration that intercepted communications here domestically. You will recall that, I know, and a great concern about that. FISA was adopted by the Congress and signed by the President in an attempt to try to ensure that those kinds of things that happened in the early 1970s were not repeated by the intelligence community. 
   So these are serious issues. Unfortunately, the Senate which had our bill for 2 1/2 months and had spent a lot of time considering a bill long before we passed our bill did not send us a bill until, as I said, about 14 days ago, and we have since that time, notwithstanding the fact we were on break, staff and Members have been working on that. As you know, we have invited the other side of the aisle, ranking members, to participate in that. Some have chosen not to, but we are hopeful that we can move ahead on this, and we hope there is room for positive resolution. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   I've had discussions recently with Secretary Gutierrez, with Ambassador Schwab and others, and Secretary Paulson, who have also discussed this issue with me and I know with you and with many others. This is an issue of importance. We think the discussions are ongoing. Hopefully, they will result in some fruitful resolution. That has not been the case at this point in time. 
   We did have, as you well know, a very significant interface with the administration last year in which I think a very positive result in terms of workers' rights and environmental concerns were addressed by us and by the administration. Unfortunately, we have not moved forward from that point on the other three agreements that were pending at that time, but I think that we will continue to have those discussions, hopefully positive and hopefully have some result.

   Mr. HOYER. I was not planning to speak, but the previous speaker has done what this administration did a little earlier today and has been doing over the days. We call it fear-mongering, trying to stampede this Congress into doing something that is contrary to our oath of office to protect the Constitution of the United States as well as defend our Nation from those who would harm our citizens and our country. 
   The gentleman's assertion that the intelligence community is not able to intercept communications to protect our country is not true. Anybody who heard his words and was concerned by his representations ought to be disabused of the fact of the accuracy of his assertions. In fact, the administration said that in a letter, a six-page letter, and within hours sent out an e-mail saying, No, we're wrong. Telephone companies are cooperating with us. We are able to intercept communications. 
   But what he also did not mention is that we passed a bill 2 1/2 months ago, now 3 months ago, which would have provided the full authority the administration needed to continue doing what they needed to do. Without exception. Secondly, what he failed to say is that when the Senate failed to act for those 3 months, it was because the Republican Party in the Senate precluded that bill from moving forward. But he didn't represent that. And then they sent us the bill 2 days before a break was to be scheduled. That was considered, in my opinion, to try to preclude any further discussion on the issue. They believed they could do that by then appealing to the concerns, rightful concerns, of the American public that we continued to do everything necessary to keep them safe. That's the commitment of all 435 Members of this House. It's my commitment. I speak on behalf of my party, as majority leader of my party, with respect to that issue. Every Member wants to ensure. 
   What he did not tell you, however, was because we only had some 48 hours of session, because we wanted to give it consideration, and because the normal process is to have a conference between the two Houses if there are differences as there are between the two pieces of legislation, we said to all of the Republicans and to all of the Democrats, let us extend by 21 days the Protect America Act so that there is no question. 
   What the gentleman from Georgia did not tell you is that every Republican person voted against that extension. They voted against the extension, and then when it did not pass, they said, Oh, America is at risk. It is like the child who killed both his parents and said, Have pity on me. I'm an orphan. They refused to pass the very legislation which would have kept the act that they say is necessary in full effect. 
   The good news is that we have a statute on the books called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which provides the administration with every authority it needs, but what it requires the administration to do is come to the FISA Court and get approval. There is no backlog in that court. Not a second's backlog in that court. And administration officials have said we would not miss a beat in terms of our interception of communications. Administration officials have said that within minutes approval could be granted, and under the FISA Act, the administration can act and then get approval after the fact. So I'm not sure what the generals were talking about. 
   What the gentleman from Georgia did not mention as well is that we have been working every day since we left session on trying to reach a compromise so that we could move forward on this bill. We had a meeting this day to do that very thing, a meeting which was bipartisan. We had the administration involved. We are hopeful that we can reach agreement. 
   So I want to assure the American public that the leadership of this House is going to do everything in our power to ensure that we protect this Nation and our people and to defeat those who fashion themselves to be radical Islamic jihadist terrorists and ensure that they will be stopped, they will be caught, and that we will prevail in this war on terrorism.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I want to congratulate the chairman. There is nobody in this body who has served longer with more focus on the quality of education, the access to higher education, and whether we're dealing with primary, secondary or higher education, more concern than George Miller of California, and I congratulate him on the service that he has given. 
   I also want to congratulate the ranking member, who himself has been an outspoken advocate of education quality in America. 
   Let me say, before I start my remarks, that I'm always interested to hear the comments of the ranking member of the Budget Committee and of the leader of the Republican Study Committee. I'm interested to hear their remarks because of course they have both said nine new entitlements. I was here with both of them for 3 hours one night, from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. in the morning, and we enacted the largest entitlement that has been enacted since the 1960s, and we were told that was going to cost $395 billion by the administration. The administration did not tell us the truth, and they knew they were not telling us the truth. And the person who knew the truth was prohibited by the administration from giving us the truth on pain of being removed, a civil servant, not an administration appointee. He knew the cost of that program, as he projected it, was $524 billion, or $125 billion more than we were told on this floor. But it was told $395 billion additional entitlement. 
   Now the interesting thing is that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Hensarling both voted for that program. That program has a larger unfunded liability as of this day than Social Security. So I think the lecture on fiscal responsibility is, frankly, not well taken.

   Mr. HOYER. The gentleman, of course, is not on this floor lamenting  the creation of entitlements as is my friend from Texas, so I suggest your question is inappropriate because your concern is about entitlements. But you voted for an entitlement that was the largest entitlement passed on the floor of this House in four decades, about as long as I think the gentleman has been alive. I wish that I could say the same; unfortunately, I've been alive a lot longer than that. So I think the question begs the question, my friend. 
   But let me say about this landmark legislation, the College Cost Reduction of 2007 is yet another example of how this Democratic Congress is committed to moving our Nation in a new and better direction and working on behalf of the American people. 
   In short, this legislation will provide the single largest investment in college financial aid, and about $18 billion over the next 5 years. Now, that is about one-fifteenth of the mistake that was made in the entitlement that you supported, my friend. And it's the largest since the GI Bill was funded in 1944. The GI Bill was an entitlement. And very frankly, the Greatest Generation was worth investing in. And that investment has paid off 100 fold in the economy that this Greatest Generation built in America, and it will do so in this case as well. And it does so at no new cost to the American taxpayer by cutting excess subsidies paid by the Federal Government to lenders in the student loans industry. The administration suggested $16 billion. We're a little above that. So there is not a disagreement as to whether or not there is an overpayment here; it's a question of where you're going to put your money. In fact, it includes a $750 million, not a lot of money in the scheme of billions of dollars and trillions of dollars, reduction in the deficit. 
   A few months ago Bill Gates, the chairman and cofounder of the Microsoft Corporation and one of our Nation's great innovators, wrote in the Washington Post, ``If we, the United States, are to remain competitive, we need a workforce that consists of the world's brightest minds.'' That's what this bill seeks to enhance. Mr. Gates added, ``Education has always been the gateway to a better life in this country.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation not only recognizes that education is a key to personal development, fulfillment and success, but also, and critically, a crucial factor in our national competitiveness, our continued prosperity, and yes, I suggest to all of my colleagues, our national security. 
   Simply stated, this legislation will make a college education more affordable for millions of students and their families. The fact is, college tuition today is exploding. Tuition at 4-year public colleges has grown by 35 percent in the last 5 years. Let me say in my State of Maryland, tuition cost has gone up 43 percent in the last 4 years. America cannot afford to shut people out of the access to college education if we're going to be successful in world markets in a flat world, as Tom Friedman refers to it. Too many students graduate with tremendous debt, and too many others simply don't go to college because they cannot afford it. To address this situation, this bill will increase the maximum Pell Grant scholarships by at least $500 over the next 5 years. That will not come close to what the Pell Grants initially, when they were adopted, replaced in tuition costs, about 70 percent. We're now down to 30 percent. When combined with other Pell scholarship increases proposed by Congress this year, the maximum Pell Grant will reach $4,900 in 2008, $5,200 in 2011, up from $4,050 in 2006. Notwithstanding, the President in 2000, in his campaign, said he was going to increase the Pell Grant very substantially. It doesn't happen. 
   The bill also will cut interest in half on subsidized student loans over the next 5 years, and it will guarantee that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their discretionary income to loan repayments. In addition, this bill seeks to ensure highly qualified teachers in every classroom, a critical need in our Nation, by providing up-front tuition assistance to qualified students who commit to teaching in public schools in high-poverty communities or high-need areas. That is important for our country's ability to compete and to develop every mind in America. There is not a child to waste in America. We know that. 
   It encourages and rewards public service by providing loan forgiveness for first responders, law enforcement officers, firefighters, nurses and others. And it encourages landmark new investment, $500 million guaranteed over 5 years, for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribally controlled, native or predominantly black institutions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a very significant and important step toward realizing the goal of making college affordable for every qualified student.     
   I want to congratulate Chairman Miller once more and the staff and all of the members of the committee and Mr. McKeon for the positive role, whatever position one might take for or against, the positive role that the committee has played. It is a historic investment in our people and our Nation. I urge every Member to strongly support this legislation.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first use of the word ``America''--a name that has come to symbolize liberty, opportunity and an unyielding hope for humanity. 
   In the 500 years that have passed since the word ``America'' was first used, the term has become more of a concept than a name--an idea that celebrates what is truly special about the world in which we live; a principle that defines what democracy, equality, freedom and unity are all about; and a goal that people all over the world have embraced since our country's inception. 
   We have come a long way since 1507--from a simple name on a map, to a moral, political and economic leader among nations. It gives me great pride to mark this 5th centenary of the name ``America,'' and to express my sincere hope that the next 500 years of our country's history provide just as many benefits to the people of the world as the last 500.

   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am extraordinarily happy to rise in support of this legislation. This legislation is very late in coming to this floor as a free-standing bill. It is, however, never too late to do the right thing. 
   This legislation, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, is long overdue. I believe it will pass this House today with broad bipartisan support, as the 9/11 bill did yesterday, making our country safer. 
   At long last, Mr. Speaker, this House is just hours away from finally passing a clean increase in the Federal minimum wage and sending this legislation to the Senate, where we devoutly hope the Members of the other body will do the same without delay.  
   H.R. 2 is the second key piece of legislation in the new Democratic majority's 100-hours agenda, and we are following through on our pledge to the American people to immediately address these critical issues. 
   There is probably not a Member of this House who fails to appreciate that an American who works full time at today's minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is essentially living in poverty. That is not right, Mr. Speaker. That worker, if he or she works 40 hours per week for 52 weeks, makes roughly $10,700 per year. If that mom has a child or that father has a wife and a child, they are essentially living on $6,000 less than we determine to be poverty in America. 
   Passing this legislation today, which will raise the minimum wage by $2.10 per hour to $7.25 in three steps over the next 2 years, is simply a matter of doing what is right, what is just and what is fair. 
   Frankly, Mr. Speaker, if it were up to me, I would do $7.25 an hour now. But we are going to phase this in so that small businesses and others can accommodate this raise. But that will mean, Mr. Speaker, that those on the minimum wage will still have to wait. 
   It has been 9 years and 4 months since the last increase in the Federal minimum wage took effect, and that was under President Clinton. This represents the longest period without an increase since Congress established the minimum wage in 1938, since Congress said we are going to have a minimum in the United States that we will pay people and respect people who work to make themselves, their families and their country better. 
   At $5.15 today, the minimum wage level is at its lowest level, adjusted for inflation, in over 50 years, half a century. In fact, Mr. Speaker, if the minimum wage had been adjusted by a cost of living increase on an annual basis since 1968, a minimum wage worker would not be making $5.15, would not be making $7.25, but would be making $9.05. So, effectively, this raise will be $1.85 less than they would be making if it had been raised on a regular basis. 
   Meanwhile, just since 2000, the cost of health insurance, gasoline, home heating, attending college, food and other related expenses have all increased, in fact, for an average family, about $5,000 a year in that period of time. Yet the minimum wage worker has not received any raise. 
   This legislation will benefit literally millions of Americans. An estimated 5.6 million Americans who make less than $7.25 per hour will directly benefit from this increase. An estimated additional 7.3 million Americans, including family members of those making less than $7.25, will indirectly benefit.     
   Now there are those who will claim this legislation will hurt small business and the economy. I reject that. I believe history shows that that is not the case. In fact, when we raised it in 1997, the economy was having one of its most successful periods of time, which continued long past the adoption of the minimum wage. In fact, according to one recent study, small business employment grew more in States with a higher minimum wage between 1997 and 2003 than in Federal minimum wage States. In other words, in those States that were paying above the $5.15 an hour, their economies grew more and they created more jobs than did those States which had frozen their minimum wage at the Federal minimum wage. 
   In fact, Lee Scott, the chief executive officer of Wal-Mart, has stated that the current minimum wage ``is out of date with the times. We can see firsthand at Wal-Mart how many of our customers are struggling to get by. Our customers simply don't have the money to buy basic necessities between paychecks.'' 
   Now, what is Wal-Mart all about? Wal-Mart is about bringing prices down. It is very controversial how they do it, but the fact is they know their consumers cannot buy even discounted necessities of life on the minimum wage. 
   Mr. Speaker, you and I know that in the richest Nation on the face of the Earth, that is wrong. 
   In a bipartisan way, and I haven't counted the Republican votes, but we are going to get a lot of Republican votes from those who are saying to the American people, as we are, we agree with you. Because 89 percent of the American people, when questioned, believe the minimum wage ought to be raised. Eighty-nine percent of the American people. And, Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of small businesses say this will not adversely affect them. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to pass this legislation. Sixty-four House Republicans joined all Democrats here last July in voting for a $7.25 per hour wage under the vocational education bill. 
   There is simply no reason, I suggest to you, not to support this legislation. In the United States of America, the richest country on the face of the Earth, you should not be relegated to poverty if you work hard and play by the rules. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this reasonable bipartisan legislation. The President of the United States has indicated that he will sign a minimum wage increase. There may be some changes that he wants, but he has recognized, as we will recognize today, that it is long past the time when we need to pay people and give them the dignity that their work demands and has earned. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), who has been the leader on this issue in the House of Representatives and one of the leaders in the country and who chairs the Education and Labor Committee.

   That is what this vote is about, and I thank the chairman for his leadership.  
   Mr. Speaker, today, the United States House of Representatives, the people's House, demonstrated that we are committed to addressing the needs of all of our people--including those who struggle to make ends meet on the Federal minimum wage. 
   Today, the House will pass legislation, on a bipartisan basis, to increase the Federal minimum wage by $2.10 per hour over the next 3 years. 
   The minimum wage, of course, has not been increased since September 1, 1997, making this House action long overdue. 
   Increasing the minimum wage is simply a matter of doing what's right, just and fair. 
   Eighty-nine percent of the American people support such an increase, according to a Newsweek poll. 
   President Bush has expressed his support. 
   And a bipartisan majority of the Senate passed a minimum wage increase in June 2006. 
   Now, we urge our colleagues in the Senate to hold a clean up-or-down vote on this issue as soon as possible. 
   In the United States of America, the richest nation on earth, workers should not be relegated to poverty if they work hard and play by the rules. 
   On Monday, we commemorate the life of a great American--Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   And Dr. King once said: ``Equality means dignity. And dignity demands a job and a paycheck that lasts through the week.'' 
   Today, we heed those words. 
   We must not ignore our citizens who are struggling. 
   We must get the legislation to the President's desk without delay.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Chairman Miller, for bringing this bill to the floor. We campaigned on the fact that we would do certain things; one of those was to try to bring down college costs as they escalate throughout this country. All of us heard, throughout this country, parents who came up to us, students who came up to us and said, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Miller, Mr. McKeon, we need that done. Mr. Wicker, we need that done. 
   This bill is not perfect. It doesn't go as far as some would like. Frankly, I would like to have very substantial impact on the Pell Grants, but we have adopted pay-as-you-go because we think you need to pay for what you buy. So we are constrained. But I hear people saying this isn't going to do anything for anybody. I disagree with that. 
   Madam Speaker, our Nation's economic security and future prosperity are inextricably bound to our ability to compete in the global marketplace. And in the 21st century, a century in which knowledge, skills and creativity are key, our competitiveness necessitates a highly educated citizenry. 
   As the journalist and author Tom Friedman has observed, and I quote, ``The main challenge to America today comes from the fact that all the walls are being taken down and many other people can now compete and collaborate with us much more directly.'' In fact, he has observed that the world is flat. That means we are more competitive. That means that we need to be better able to compete. That means that our young people need to be better educated. That means that we need to give them access to affordable, quality higher education. 
   Former President Clinton also has remarked that, and I quote, ``We are living in a world where what you can earn is the function of what you can learn.'' I think all of us agree with that. That is not a debating item. It is, how do we get there? 
   Today, Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this legislation, the College Student Relief Act of 2007, which is the first step by House Democrats to make college more affordable and accessible. 
   In short, this bill will cut interest rates on need based Federal student loans for undergraduate students from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over 5 years. Why over 5 years? Because we have got to pay for it. It would be very nice to do it like that if we could pay for it. But we are in a position where we are in deep debt. We can't do that. 
   This legislation will cut the cost of college for an estimated 5.5 million undergraduate students and their families. That is a significant number of people. And when fully phased in, it will save the typical borrower, with $13,800 in need-based student loans, $4,400 in savings over the life of the loan. 
   Now, frankly, that is not a big sum when you think of the life of the loan. I understand that. But, frankly, we view large sums differently than some  others, but we make $165,000 a year. Very few Americans are so privileged. 
   The irony of course is that at a time when an education is more important than ever to one's success, the costs of attending college have continued to skyrocket. For example, just since 2001 the tuition and fees at public universities have increased 44 percent when adjusted for inflation, and tuition and fees at private universities have risen 17 percent. 
   Madam Speaker, we simply need to make a college education more affordable and accessible, and this legislation helps us to do that. 
   Let no one be mistaken, H.R. 5 is not a panacea to the high costs of college education. But it is a good first step, and I know that Mr. Miller and Mr. McKeon are going to be looking at ways and means to do better for our students. 
   In the weeks ahead, House Democrats will continue to work on efforts to make college more affordable and to help our Nation maintain and strengthen its leadership role in education and the world economy. 
   Finally, I should note, Madam Speaker, that this bill contains no new costs for taxpayers. It meets all pay-as-you-go budget requirements, containing offsets that pay for the cost of cutting interest rates. This legislation is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans. Eighty-eight percent is the figure, but whether or not they specifically know about this legislation, the overwhelming majority of Americans know that we have to bring the cost of college education down if we are going to remain competitive. 
   I congratulate Mr. Miller on his leadership, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation as a step, a good step that we can take to make ourselves more competitive and to give our students greater access to college.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I first want to recognize Congressman Ike Skelton, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I know how tirelessly he's worked to put this authorization bill together; and more than that, I know that no one in this House is a more dedicated advocate for our men and women in uniform. 
   This bill passed out of committee unanimously, and I expect it to pass the full House overwhelmingly, as well. That's because it's a bill that begins to repair our military while putting the needs of our troops first, a bill that responds to the Armed Forces' immense challenges while keeping them on the cutting edge. Let me touch on a few of its key provisions. 
   First, it authorizes $70 billion for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the war on terrorism. No doubt, an overwhelming majority of the American public would agree that our mission in Iraq has been marred by gross errors of judgment from our highest-ranking civilian officials, unending bloodshed, and a chronic lack of political progress. But at the same time, 150,000 American troops are still on the ground in the midst of that violence, they have done everything our Nation has asked of them, and I believe they must have the resources they need to defend themselves and try to stabilize Iraq. This bill recognizes that reality, and it includes funds to keep our troops safer under fire: funds for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, up-armored Humvees, and personal body armor. 
   Second, this bill acknowledges the tremendous debt we owe our troops in this time of war. And the bill's military pay raise--a higher raise than the president requested--is a small way of beginning to pay that debt back. It also protects their access to health care by keeping down medical fees for our troops and retirees. 
   Third, this bill begins to restore our Nation's military readiness. With our forces stretched to the breaking point, Army National Guard units have, on average, less than two thirds of their required equipment. Army Vice Chief of Staff Richard Cody has testified that the Army ``no longer has fully ready combat brigades on standby should a threat or conflict occur.'' That is simply too dangerous a risk to take. I'm glad that this bill takes some steps to mitigate it, authorizing nearly $2 billion for unfunded readiness initiatives, $800 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment, and larger active duty forces: 7,000 new soldiers, 5,000 more Marines, and more than 1,000 new sailors. 
   Fourth and finally, this bill's investments in high-tech equipment will keep our military the world's most advanced. It includes funding for next-generation fighters, like the F/A-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; for advanced Navy vessels, from small littoral combat ships to new attack submarines; and for the initial deployment of a national missile defense system. At the same time, I realize that spending on this scale always opens the possibility of waste and abuse; that's why I'm grateful that this bill also comes equipped with increased congressional oversight of Defense acquisition programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, never in recent memory has our military been so worn down. The road back to readiness will be long and hard--but it can begin today. I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation--vital for our troops and our families, and equally vital for our Nation's security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of this rule. I suggest further, if we were all adults on this floor, everybody would say this rule, outside of the ambit of what amendments are made in order on the defense bill, is an appropriate rule. It is an appropriate rule to respond to a mistake that was made. 
   As the gentleman from California observed earlier in debate, mistakes are made. Unlike the previous instance some years ago, which were discussed on this floor of the deficit reduction bill where the minority was not notified, the assertion the minority was not notified was absolutely inaccurate,  and Mr. Goodlatte would say that. In point of fact what happened was Mr. Peterson learned of it, talked to Mr. Goodlatte about it, then discussed it with me, and they decided jointly and bipartisanly to proceed. 
   Unlike the Deficit Reduction Act, the first thing that Mr. Peterson said in arguing for the override of the President's veto was, there is a problem here. He wanted all the Members to know what the problem was. There was not a Member on the floor who didn't know what the problem was. 
   When they voted, a majority of the minority party voted to override the President's veto because they believed the policy proposed in that bill is a good one. The overwhelming majority of Democrats voted for that bill, and 316 out of 435 of us--there weren't 435 of us; there were 11 absentees. So 316 out of about 424 voted for this bill. 
   This bill, unfortunately, included fourteen-fifteenths of the bill we passed, and really a larger proportion of that because in terms of pages it was probably 95 percent, 98 percent of the bill. 
   Now, a mistake was made. It was not a venal mistake. It was not a conscious mistake. And the mistake was made, as everybody ought to know, by the Clerk of the Congress and OMB, and they both made the same mistake. And the mistake they made was reading from the printed copy as opposed to the parchment copy. OMB didn't read from the parchment copy, we didn't read from the parchment copy, because the belief was a decision made 10 years ago by the Deputy Clerk not to proofread the parchment because changing the parchment was too expensive, but to read from the printed copy which then, if found in error, could be corrected and reprinted and then programmed for the parchment to be printed from that. And both our side--our side, the Congress--and the OMB made the same mistake. They assumed, as normally is the case, that the parchment reflected exactly what the conference printed report said. 
   Unfortunately, in this instance it did not. We still don't have a full explanation of how that happened. But obviously, notwithstanding the fact that parchment indicates that title III in the table of contents is included, when you go to page 169, the end of title II, and you turn the page to 170, you go to title IV. Now, one would have thought it would have been a pretty simple proofreading job if you read the parchment. Unfortunately, the print document which was used by OMB and the Congress to proof did in fact include title III. 
   Okay. So we made a mistake. The administration made a mistake, we made a mistake, the bill was not whole. 
   This is, my friends, not an unusual situation. In an 1892 case, which was relied upon in the budget case as well, the Court clearly said: Whatever the facts are internally to the House of Representatives, what the President signs is the statute, is the law. 
   The Supreme Court says clearly, therefore, that what the President sent us back and the veto overridden is in fact what the court has found is the law. Now, unfortunately, it doesn't include title III. We want to pass title III. 
   This bill took some 15 months, 18 months of deliberation. The farm bill expires tonight or tomorrow, Friday. So we can either do another extension, which is possible, or we can pass what was overwhelmingly passed in the Senate, overwhelmingly passed in the House of Representatives, and, as I said on the floor last night, was passed in exactly the same form without title III as was passed in both Houses. There were no changes. No alterations. That was not the case in the deficit bill that was referred to by Mr. Boehner yesterday.     
   In fact, a very substantial difference was made in the bill without notice to the Democrats, a $2 billion change, I might add, changing from 36 months to 13 months the implications of the reimbursement of Medicare for implements. 
   Now, that is all to say that this is not without precedent, number one. There are a number of cases that hold that what we did yesterday was exactly appropriate, and that law is not subject to question. Everything is subject to question, but not valid question or winning question. 
   So what have we done? 
   First of all, I discussed it with the Parliamentarian. I had not done so when we had the colloquy with Mr. Boehner. I then discussed it with the chairman. The chairman discussed it throughout the next few hours with Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Harkin and others. 
   I discussed it with Mr. Reid to figure out, a mistake has been made, how do we correct that, in fairness to everybody, on a bill, that, by the way, the Deficit Reduction Act was passed by a two-vote margin in the House, and in the United States Senate was passed because of the Vice President's vote. And we were not informed, so we were somewhat concerned about the $2 billion mistake that had been made. 
   In this case, that is not the issue at all, and it's a bill that was, in a bipartisan basis, passed by a majority of the Republicans and overwhelming majority of Democrats. 
   So what solution did we come up with? Resending the bill that, under the Supreme Court's edict is, in fact, law if it is overridden in the Senate, so that fourteen-fifteenths of what is the Congress's intent will be accomplished. 
   The rule then says, but in an abundance of caution, we'll also provide for the passage of the entire bill and send it over to the Senate, as has been passed overwhelmingly in both Houses. 
   In addition to that, we said, the bill does not include title III that is going to be in the veto message that's sent to the Senate. 
   I know for the public, this is pretty esoteric, and they don't really care. What they care is the substance. 
   But the point that I'm trying to make is, we are trying to correct a mistake and serve the agricultural community, serve those millions of people who are relying on the nutritional aid, serving those people who are relying on the conservation assistance throughout this country, to have this bill, after 18 months almost of consideration, serious bipartisan working and overwhelming bipartisan votes in both Houses, enacted into law. 
   But we are also providing separately for the passage of title III. In other words, we're doing title III twice, once as the full bill so we can repass the full bill. If the Senate decides, as I hope it will, to pass that again, then we will not only have passed fourteen-fifteenths, we will have passed fifteen-fifteenths in another bill, and they will be reconciled and they will be consistent with the law and with the will of this body representing the American people. 
   Now at about 7 p.m. last night, those of you who heard the colloquy, I indicated to Mr. Boehner we ought to talk about this. I went by Mr. Boehner's office to explain to him what I thought the solution to this problem was and discuss it with him. He was not at his office. I left a message and my phone number at 7 o'clock last night. I have not yet received a response to that visit. 
   I went to his office to suggest that, pursuant to my representation on the floor, we discuss that. I have not yet received a phone call. 
   I did talk to Mr. Blunt last night. I've talked to Mr. Blunt this morning. I frankly am offended, I will tell you, by the mischaracterization of what we are doing here by the representatives of the minority leader's office. 
   There are no games being played here. There was a mistake made. And if we were adults and nonpartisan and wanted to deal with this in a responsible way, I suggest we would have agreed on this proposal. 
   Now, unfortunately, we didn't get to an agreement. I don't allege that anybody on your side has agreed to this. But to suggest that it hasn't been discussed, informed, and I called as soon as I came in this morning, the leadership on your side, to explain exactly this procedure. 
   Now you can disagree with the farm bill or not disagree with the farm bill. I understand that additional games are going to be played, as it was my perception last week were played. On Thursday, 131 or 132 of you decided, notwithstanding the fact that I am sure you are for funding the troops in Iraq, you voted ``present.'' That was your decision. 
   It's my understanding now that perhaps you're being urged, some of you who are for this bill, to deny the two-thirds on the suspension of a bill that has gotten essentially three-quarters of  this House and 80 percent of the United States Senate supporting it. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, at some point in time the American public expects us to act as adults, not simply as partisan protagonists, to conduct business, notwithstanding the fact because we are humans, and those who work for us are humans and are under great stress. They have to work around the clock. They work 15-hour days, sometimes longer days. And we expect them to act without ever making a mistake. That is unreasonable. And when they make mistakes, and when we make mistakes, it is appropriate for us respond in a way that will correct those mistakes and, at the same time, carry out the policies that are overwhelmingly supported by this body. 
   My friends on both sides of the aisle, I would hope that we could do that. I regret that the minority leader has not called me back. I regret that he has not sat down and, with me, had the opportunity to discuss this. I had a discussion with him before the vote last night. It was a very calm, reasonable discussion, Mr. Lawrence and I, outside the middle door. We knew there was a problem. We knew we had to solve it. I think this does, in fact, solve it from the standpoint of adopting the policy overwhelmingly supported by this Congress of assuring that title III is addressed, and assuring us of the opportunity to make sure that it's not subject even to any lawsuit question by, again, passing the entire bill supported by, as I said, over 75 percent of the Congress of the United States. 
   I understand there may be questions about which amendment was allowed in order to the defense bill and which wasn't, so on that case, you may vote differently on the rule. But on the addressing of the mistake that was inadvertently made, and I stress again, by the Congress and by the Office of Management and Budget, same mistake apparently was made, that we can correct this as adults treating one another in a way that each of us would want to be treated to act so that we adopt policies that are supported by this Congress.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank you. I hope I didn't imply that. What I said, what I meant to say, if I misspoke, not that the--we, first of all agree and, as I've said, we're going to do what you suggest in an abundance of caution to assure us, ourselves, and I would hope that we would all, or least those who are for the farm bill would vote for it, the entire bill will be put on suspension. In light of the fact we had 75 percent of this House support that bill, that would be more than enough to pass it on suspension. We're going to do that in an abundance of caution. 
   In addition, we're going to do title III separately so the Senate can have that option as well, so if on the veto override they do fourteen-fifteenths of the bill, they can do the one-fifteenth, that is, title III at the same time so they would contemporaneously move forward. 
   When I refer to, and if I offended the gentleman, adult behavior, this is not a political problem. It is a procedural problem that we need to cure, and we've been working to cure it. You and I have had discussions about it, very positive discussions about it over the last 12 hours. And I would hope that we could proceed on that basis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time. I thank the gentleman for his comments. 
   I simply rise to say that this rule accomplishes exactly, in my opinion, what the minority whip wants to accomplish. It provides for the full passage of this bill under suspension, which the gentleman was for when it passed before, which I was for, and I will vote for. And that suspension accomplishes exactly that objective, so that any defect caused by the mistake will be cured. 
   Secondly, it's not blame. I, frankly, think the decision that was made 10 years ago was a rational decision. The decision was not to use the parchment copy as a copy to mark on to correct. There was no criticism there. It was simply that's when the decision was made. I think it, frankly, was a good decision. 
   The problem was, neither OMB nor ourselves used the parchment copy. We used the printed copy. The printed copy did, in fact, have title III in there. And obviously both the President and ourselves thought that the bill that was signed was the full bill. It ended up not being so, so we're going to correct that. I think we're correcting it properly. 
   I would urge all Members to vote for the rule, vote for the full bill, the farm bill which, as I said, got over 75 percent of the House and over 80 percent the Senate. Vote for title III so that, frankly, that can be passed more quickly by the Senate under its rules, and the leader has already indicated he will move forward on that. 
   If you have a disagreement, you won't vote for that. I understand that. And I think we will, therefore, cure the issue at hand. 
   I congratulate the Rules Committee for adopting this rule. I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule, and if we do so, we will adopt a farm bill that I think will be good for the country. I think we will enact a farm bill which will be unimpeachable in either aspect, and I think we will have done what the American people expect us to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY AND PLEDGING SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS OF FLOODING IN SOUTHERN MEXICO -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I made this announcement some 10 days ago or a week ago, and we frankly didn't follow it very well, but I want to take another try. 
   On both sides of the aisle, you have correctly expressed concern about how long our votes are taking. There are times when votes take a longer time, we have Members down at the White House, we are just going to finish a committee markup, they are voting, or something like that. We understand that. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like everybody to hear this, because you are going to be angry with me. You are going to be angry with me today. 
   There were some 140 votes cast by the time the time ran out on this vote. That meant there were some 280 people who had not voted after 15 minutes. This vote took 25 minutes, give or take. Both sides of the aisle and the committee chairmen who are in a markup and it takes so long to get back to the markup, and we have witnesses standing there, both sides had this problem. 
   So I am asking you for your cooperation. Look at the clock, and when the clock hits 5 minutes left, come over here. Don't look at how many Members have not voted and think to yourself because there are so many Members that haven't voted, we're going to call the roll. 
   I want to say to my side, I am not going to, frankly, want to lose votes. You don't want to lose votes. They didn't want to lose votes when they were in charge. I didn't blame them. Either side. But don't take the position that they will wait for as long as they need to wait, because that is inconsiderate to every Member who comes here in a timely fashion and then has to wait because somebody else doesn't. 
   Now, I will tell you this: I am an offender. I am not pointing a finger. If I am pointing a finger at you, I'm pointing four fingers at me. I have in the last week, so I could get up here and pontificate, tried to make sure that I got here on time. But I haven't been getting here on time. I have done the same thing as you. That's why I know you do it. Look at that. 
   So I am asking all of us to try to work together so that when the bell is rung and the roll is called, you are here on time. We will keep these votes in the vicinity of 17 minutes, and some of you are going to miss votes. 
   Let me clarify so you understand. The Speaker's position articulated at the beginning of the session, if you are in the well with a card in your hand, you will be allowed to vote. But if somebody yells in the back of the room  ``one more,'' if somebody is walking through the door, I do not guarantee you that you will be able to vote. We are going to call the vote. 
   Thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, Mr. Speaker, let me say, this is truly a proud and historic moment for this institution, the people's House in our Nation. Today, for the first time in our history, the Members of this great body have elected a woman, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), to serve as our Speaker. I want to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Speaker Pelosi, as well as her husband Paul, and her children and all of her family. 
   Last November 7, the American people delivered a resounding message that was heard in every corner of this Nation. They want change and a new direction in our Nation. Today, as we open this new 110th Congress, with hope and great optimism, we will take the first steps in offering the voters precisely that by changing the way business is done in Washington. 
   As we open this new chapter in American history, we will seek to elevate results over rhetoric and put progress before partisanship as we affirm our commitment to transparency, accountability, and civility. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rules package includes sweeping ethics reforms that begin to address some of the most egregious transgressions of the recent past. Among other things, we will ban gifts, including meals and tickets, from lobbyists and the organizations that employ them. We will ban lobbyists and the organizations that employ them from financing travel for Members or their staffs, except for one-day travel to visit a site, attend a forum, participate in a panel, or give a speech, all obviously in the pursuance of the Members' duties. We will require Members and staff to obtain preapproval from the Ethics Committee for permitted travel; and, Mr. Speaker, we will end the K Street Project, a practice that brought shame on this House when some Members promised access in return for patronage hiring. 
   Now let me say, very frankly, as importantly as these rules changes are, they alone will not ensure the integrity of this institution. Rather, the Members of this House will ensure the integrity of this institution when we conduct ourselves with integrity and hold accountable those who fail to abide by these rules and the highest ethical standards.     
   Thus during the next 2 years, we have an obligation, each and every one of us, to ensure that the Ethics Committee does the job that it was constituted to perform. The implementation of rules, while vital, must be followed by effective, real enforcement. 
   Through this rules package, Mr. Speaker, we also signal our sincere intent to foster an environment in which civility, consensus, and compromise are nurtured. The American people are tired of partisanship. They are rightfully demanding progress on the critical priorities that face our Nation. Surely we will disagree on many issues, but that does not require us to be disagreeable, and we surely can disagree without impugning or questioning the motives, the character of our colleagues. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, this rules package restores fiscal discipline by reinstating the budget rules that helped us produce record budget surpluses in the 1990s and which previously were supported on a bipartisan basis. 
   Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot continue on our current fiscal course. In the last 72 months, our Nation has turned a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion into a deficit of  more than $3 trillion. It is, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, immoral of this generation of Americans to force our children and grandchildren to pay our bills. Our current course threatens our economic as well as our national security. Pay-as-you-go budget rules will help us restore the fiscal discipline that the American people demand. These measures represent the foundation of our mission and the basis for the good work we will do together as one body with the best interests of those we serve at heart. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a profound responsibility to fulfill and make hard choices. However, we also share an extraordinary opportunity that is distinctive in the American experience, to heal a deeply divided Nation, to conquer national doubt and restore public confidence in the United States Congress. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to working with each and every one in this body in our pursuit of that progress. 
   In conclusion, let me leave you with the words of our 35th President, John Kennedy, who said this: ``Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past. Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, let us now embrace our responsibility and fulfill the trust that the American people have placed in us to lead, to govern effectively, and to make the greatest Nation on Earth even greater. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would ask unanimous consent that the remaining time allocated to me be controlled by Mr. Hastings of Florida, a member of the Rules Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (OBSERVING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--a man who answered humanity's highest calling and profoundly transformed the world in which we live. 
   Yesterday, like many of our colleagues here, I had the privilege of joining with my constituents in rejoicing, remembering and giving thanks to God for the wisdom that Dr. King imparted and the enduring spirit he shared with all mankind. 
   And at an event at St. Mary's College in southern Maryland, I encountered a man who told me that the third Monday of every January isn't just a national holiday--it's a national holy day--and he was exactly right. 
   The commemoration of Dr. King's birthday and the ideals for which he stood represent a sacred trust--an opportunity to take note of the heights we have reached as a Nation and celebrate the hard-earned triumphs of African Americans, while also demonstrating the courage to accept that we are sill far from perfect and much good work remains undone. 
   Coretta Scott King, who provided a shining example of strength and determination in her own right, once said, ``Struggle is a never ending process and freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it in every generation.'' 
   I would take that statement a step further and say that it is up to us to win it and earn it in every day, hour, minute and second of our lives. 
   If we take nothing else from the life and work of Dr. King, it should be that each of us shares the responsibility of preserving the legacies of peace, equality and understanding that were left in our hands. 
   And if we take nothing else from yesterday's commemoration, it should be that our work is never done, and our mission is never completed. 
   In his letter from a Birmingham City Jail in April of 1963, Dr. King reminds us all that, ``Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability--it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.'' 
   One of those co-workers is a distinguished Member of this body, an inspiration to all of those who continue to fight for social justice and equality, and the sponsor of this legislation. I, of course, am referring to our colleague and my very good friend, Congressman LEWIS of Georgia, who I regard as nothing less than a national hero for demonstrating the courage to confront centuries of prejudice and racism and helping to move us toward a day where men and women are judged by the content of their character not the color of their skin. 
   As we continue to be co-workers with both the American people and the divine spirit that guides them, we should never forget Dr. King's immortal words from that Birmingham jail or the lessons he taught. 
   We are indebted to men and women like Dr. King and Coretta Scott King and JOHN LEWIS. Through their courage and their fortitude, we are a better Nation today. 
   While this important day is indeed a day of remembrance, it also is a day of reaffirmation--reaffirmation of the principles that guided Dr. King's life.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, this important legislation, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, is designed to do one thing, enfranchise Americans fully with a voting representative in the House of Representatives. I have the great honor of representing the great State of Maryland. Maryland, at the request of the Federal Government, gave some square miles of its State to our Federal Government and to the people of America. 
   At that time there were Marylanders living, just a few, but Marylanders living within the confines of what was to become the District of Columbia. Now, this was post-1787, so that the miracle in Philadelphia did not contemplate disenfranchising those voters in the various States, as my friend from Texas mentioned, because the residents that then became, because of the generosity of the State of Maryland, residents of that Federal district, were then residents of the several States. 
   Washington, D.C. is the only capital in a democracy in the world, in the entire world, that does not have a voting representative in its parliament, in the world. Clearly, the successor residents of the District of Columbia succeed residents of the several States. The continued disenfranchisement of more than half a million Americans is unconscionable, is indefensible and wrong. 
   Since 1801, when Washington, D.C. became this Nation's capital, the citizens of the District of Columbia have not had representation in the Congress, not in the House of Representatives and not in the Senate. It is wrong, as a matter of principle, because District citizens pay Federal taxes, sit on juries and serve on our Armed Forces, like all other Americans who enjoy full representation in this body do. 
   If they move tomorrow to Maryland or to Virginia or to Texas or to California, they will be fully enfranchised. They are not second-class citizens, but the area in which they live is being treated as a second-class area, this, the Nation's capital. You cannot cite another capital in the world that does that if they allow any of their voters to be represented in a true democratic institution. 
   It is wrong politically, because District citizens since 1801 have effectively been a ward of Congress without the opportunity to make their voice felt on the legislation that affects only them. Ironically on this bill, we are going to again have a motion to recommit, which affects only the residents of the District of Columbia. 
   It is wrong, I suggest to you, morally as well, because the United States professes to have the truest form of representative government in human history. We are proud of that, rightfully so. Yet we deprive the citizens of this Nation's capital of their voice in their national legislature. 
   Let me add, the United States is the only representative democracy, as I have said, that does that. The absence of representation in Congress for District citizens underscores the failure of the Congress to use the authority vested in it, by the Constitution, to correct an injustice. 
   I want to say to my friends in this body, so many of you have voted ``aye'' on propositions that only recently the Supreme Court of the United States has said are unconstitutional. You put in language to say, oh, well, it's constitutional because of X, Y and Z, to try to substitute our judgment for the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, but repeatedly you have voted for legislation which the Supreme Court has said is unconstitutional, and you know it. 
   We have spent $379 billion, 3,200 lives. We will vote tomorrow on a bill that seeks to spend $100 billion more so that the citizens of Baghdad, the citizens of Baghdad can have a parliament in which the citizens of Baghdad have a vote; but too many will vote not to give the same right to our sisters and brothers who live in the District of Columbia. 
   The authority I refer to for the constitutionality of this is, of course, Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, is the so-called seat of government clause, under which ``The Congress shall have power ..... to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,'' exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, for as I remind you, those residents of the several States or their successors, who are now residents of the District of Columbia.  
   Plain and simple, this sweeping language gives Congress ``extraordinary and plenary'' powers over our Nation's capital city, including the authority to adopt legislation to enfranchise the District's 550,000 Americans with a full vote in this House. 
   I am far from alone in my view of Article I, section 8. Twenty-five legal scholars, which have just been entered into the Record, make that assertion. 
   As the chairman of the committee, I am not used to quoting Kenneth Starr, and I quote Kenneth Starr, not as the supreme expert, but certainly as not a partisan of my party. 
   In fact, I would remind every Member of this House, this bill was reported out of the Republican-chaired, Republican-majority Government Reform Committee just last Congress. 
   Mr. Davis is a cosponsor, not only a Republican leader, but the former chairman of a committee and former chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, not just a back-bencher, but a leader in the party, who said this is constitutional, but in any event, it is the right thing to do. 
   Mr. Starr's tightly reasoned testimony before the House Government Reform Committee in 2004 in favor of the substance of today's measure should be required reading for every Member of the body who believes that somehow this may be a partisan vote. In fact, as we mentioned, we give to Utah as well, as has been historical practice, to usually do two at a time, as we did Alaska and Hawaii. 
   That doesn't unusually enfranchise, I would suggest, Utah's voters. I come from a State that had an at-large Representative for most of the 1960s. His name was Carlton Sickles. He lived in the county in which I grew up. He was an at-large Representative, yes, before Reynolds v. Sims and Baker v. Carr, but that was for the State legislature purposes. He was an at-large Representative in the State of Maryland. I am not sure that anybody here served with him. 
   We, the Members of this House, must never be seduced into thinking there is such a thing as settled injustice. Here me, settled injustice. The author of the Dred Scott decision was a Marylander. There is a statue of him, a bust of him, as you enter the old Supreme Court Chamber. 
   That was the constitutional law. It was wrong. It was wrong legally, it was wrong ethically, and it was certainly wrong morally. It is time, my friends, in this body, today, to stand up, speak out for democracy and justice for our fellow Americans. If we can fight for democracy in Baghdad, we can vote for democracy in Washington, D.C.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I am proud today to join Congresswoman JAN SCHAKOW-SKY--who continues to do a great job as a Chief Deputy Whip--in recognizing the importance of International Women's Day on March 8. 
   Almost 100 years ago, a group of courageous women proposed creating an International Women's Day to honor the women's rights movement and to continue the fight for universal suffrage. This day has since expanded in scope to serve as an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of women, and recommit ourselves to ending discrimination and violence against women across the globe. 
   Since the first commemoration of International Women's Day in 1910, women have made significant advances. Women have been elected to the highest levels of government across the world, and they serve as the leaders of nations such as Chile, Liberia, and Germany. An estimated 10.4 million businesses in the United States are owned by women. Worldwide, women receive eighty percent of all micro-loans to start small businesses. In the United States, women are graduating from high school and college at record rates. 
   However, while these accomplishments are indeed significant, we still have far more work to do. In the United States and across the world, women still face obstacles to political and economic equality. While women work two-thirds of the world's working hours, they earn only one percent of the world's income. Of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty, 70 percent are women and children. Violence against women continues at a horrific rate. These are unacceptable statistics, and we must do everything we can to change them. 
   As we mark this year's International Women's Day, we must renew and reaffirm our commitment to stopping violence against women and putting an end to discriminatory practices so that all women have a real opportunity to participate in society to the fullest. 
   By recognizing International Women's Day and all that it represents, we give hope to women across the world. We honor the women who have fought--and continue to fight--for their rights, and I am proud to stand with them as we continue efforts to achieve equality and justice. 
   Again, I thank Congresswoman SCHAKOW-SKY for introducing this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, today I join Congressman GENE GREEN and a bipartisan group of the Texas delegation in supporting the renaming of the Department of Education headquarters building to the ``Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building.'' 
   It is a fitting tribute to name the building that houses the Department of Education after President Lyndon B. Johnson. Under his watch, over 60 education bills were signed into law, several of which changed the face of education in America. 
   One such bill enacted by President Johnson is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. For the first time, Federal funds were explicitly directed to elementary and secondary public schools. These funds have improved the quality of education received by millions of students over the past 42 years.  
   President Johnson soon followed this measure with the Higher Education Act of 1965. This legislation made a college education possible for millions of Americans by creating the Federal student aid program. 
   Additionally, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 contained the provisions creating the Head Start Program, which has put generations of preschool-age children on the path of learning and success. Head Start gives children the foundation they need in order to be successful in school in the future. 
   As President Johnson himself once said, ``Poverty must not be a bar to learning and learning must offer an escape from poverty.'' By opening the doors of education to millions of Americans, President Johnson improved countless lives and put the American dream within the reach of many. 
   I thank Congressman GREEN for bringing this bill to the floor so that we all may recognize the contributions of President Johnson to this Nation and to our educational system.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support legislation by Congressman JACK INSLEE that will save thousands of lives by speeding the kidney donation process. 
   By making paired kidney donation legal, this bill will facilitate the identification of kidney donors and speed the process by which donors are matched with patients. In fact, this bill could increase the number of live kidney donor transplants performed each year by 14  percent according to a study by the Journal of Transplantation. 
   In addition to the positive effects for kidney transplant patients, speeding the donation process will also help reduce federal spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill will reduce Medicare spending for dialysis by $500 million over 10 years. 
   This legislation has a wide base of support from the medical community, including the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Society of Transplantation, the Kidney Fund, the Transplant Surgeons, and the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations. I am proud to add my vote of support to this list. 
   This bill will give much needed hope to the more than 95,000 people who are waiting for a life-saving organ donation. I commend Congressman INSLEE for introducing this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   The debates we have been having over the past few days are consequential and about the most important thing that this body does, and that is uphold the law. Not just pass the law, uphold the law. 
   As I said a little earlier in this debate, part of that was overseeing the executive branch to ensure that they execute our laws appropriately and legally. And the Congress has been given under the Constitution the authority to seek information. The Judiciary Committee has sought information and that information has not been forthcoming. The Congress, as Mr. Boehner said, cannot do its job if the Congress simply fails to assert its constitutional role. 
   Now there is a situation that we confront that a large number say they want to adjourn. They have been making motion after motion after motion to adjourn and they haven't been voting for it, but they have been making it. 
   And now they walk off the floor on the assertion that we are not working. They assert that we are not passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. They assert that, but they all voted to a person not to give us the time to perform our extraordinarily important duties in resolving the differences between the Senate and the House in a conference committee. 
   Now, I will tell my friends on the Republican side of the House, they know as well as I do that the reason the Senate did not pass us a bill 3 months after we passed our bill to them was because of Republican delay in the United States Senate. That's the reason this bill is so late getting to us. That is the reason we don't have the time to work it out. That is the reason we are not passing legislation. 
   Now, the President asserts that the expiration of the Protect America Act will pose a danger to our country. The former National Security Council Adviser on Terrorism says that is not true. Former Assistant Attorney General Wainstein says that is not true. Numerous others, and the chairman, have asserted that is not true. Why is it not true? Because FISA will remain in effect. 
   The authority given under the Protect America Act remains in effect. And if there are new targets, a FISA  Court has full authority to give every authority to the administration to act. 
   So I tell my friends, we are pursuing the politics of fear, unfounded fear; 435 Members of this House, and every one of us, every one of us, wants to keep America and Americans safe. Not one of us wants to subject America or Americans to danger. 
   The President's assertion is wrong. I say it categorically: the President's assertion is wrong. Now the President says he will delay his trip to stay here and work with us. I know Mr. Reyes and Mr. Conyers will be contacting Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Leahy to discuss with them how we might move forward. They in turn will talk with their Republican counterparts, as well, to see how we can move forward. 
   But the time that we asked for, less than 24 hours after the Senate passed us a bill, the time we asked for to elect this process, which is the normal legislative process to bring the Senate and the House together to fashion a bill that both Houses feel comfortable with, feel is good for America, was denied to us yesterday by unanimous vote by the minority party and gave us no time to accomplish that objective. 
   The President said he was going to veto it, which is why I presume all of you voted against it, because, of course, in the first 6 years, we never passed anything to the President that he wasn't supportive of. We were a very cooperative Congress with this President. This President is not used to the Congress saying, We may have a different view, Mr. President. We, too, have a responsibility and we may see it slightly differently than you. 
   But, yes, as the leader on the other side said, we have come together. We worked together. We passed a stimulus package together. We can do that on this bill. But we can't do it overnight. This matter is much too serious to do it overnight. 
   My friend from the Rules Committee indicates that this does not give us full time for debate on this rule. He opposes this rule. The interesting thing is he says contrary, we ought to be considering something overnight, overnight, without any time to consider it in conference. 
   The minority has now effected a strategy that they tried to use on the agriculture bill: let's work, but by the way, we are leaving. And why are we leaving? We are leaving so we can preclude a majority responding to a quorum call and if a majority does not respond, we will have to go out of session. So it is somewhat ironic that on the one hand they say we ought to be doing something, and on the other hand they walk out to preclude us from doing our business.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comment. There is no urgency. That claim is a claim made to stampede this House and the American people, I tell my friend from California. And the reason that there is no urgency is because in 1978 this Congress passed legislation to ensure the fact that we could intercept communications while at the same time protecting our Constitution. That is why there is no urgency. 
   Is there an important reason to act? There is. Do we have every intention of acting? We do. But we will not be presented with a bill on Tuesday night and be asked to pass it on Wednesday afternoon without full and fair consideration. That is our duty, that is our responsibility, and that is what we will do.

RES. 980, AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY TO INITIATE OR INTERVENE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN SUBPOENAS -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   We are dealing, in these days, with serious issues. And serious people have been considering these issues in committee, and we will now consider them on the floor. This matter has been pending now for over half a year. 
   Madam Speaker, in 1885, a young scholar wrote an influential book about the United States Congress entitled ``Congressional Government.'' And in that book he offered the following observations about legislative branch oversight, and he said this, ``Quite as important as legislation is vigilant oversight of the administration. Not any particular administration, but of the other coequal branch of government.'' 
   He continued, ``It is the proper duty of a representative body to look diligently into every affair of government and to talk much about what it sees. The informing function of Congress, not just informing ourselves, but informing the American public as well, the informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function.'' An interesting observation. Many years later, in 1913, that young scholar, Woodrow Wilson, became President of the United States. 
   Congressional oversight of any administration is absolutely imperative to the proper functioning of our government, to our system of checks and balances, and to the fulfillment of our constitutional duty. A President who is forced to answer for his administration's actions, decisions, and conduct is a President who is less likely to amass power beyond that which the Constitution proscribes for his office or to imperil the welfare of our republic form of government. And that is the constitutional interest that today's resolution addresses. 
   I support the rule before us because I believe in a system of checks and balances in which no branch holds itself above the constitutional objectives of the sharing of authority, which the Founders wisely believed was essential to protect against the abuse of that authority by any one of those branches. 
   The issue before this body is not fundamentally whether the current administration acted properly and within the law when it dismissed seven U.S. attorneys in 2006, that may be the issue at some point in time, but unless we have the information to get to that point, such a question will be moot. Nor is this a partisan clash between a Democratic House and a Republican President. Rather, the basic issue before this House is this: whether this body and the committee system, which is central to our duties to perform meaningful and vigorous oversight, can simply be ignored by the executive branch when this body seeks testimony and documents relevant to an important public policy controversy. 
   As the New York Times noted this morning, ``If Congress fails to enforce its own subpoenas, it would effectively be ceding subpoena power. It would also be giving its tacit consent to the dangerous idea of an imperial President, above the law, and beyond the reach of checks and balances.'' 
   What profit it a Nation if we include checks and balances within our constitutional framework to protect our country's freedom, and more importantly, our people's freedom, if, in fact, we honor it only in the breach? And as Bruce Fein, the constitutional scholar and former Department of Justice official during the Reagan administration, has stated, ``If Congress shies from voting for contempt in this case, secret government will become the rule.'' This is perhaps the most secretive administration in our history. This is a danger to our democracy. 
   He went on to say ``that Congress would be reduced to an ink blot on the constitutional map.'' That is why every one of us, every one of the 435 of us who have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States and uphold its laws, ought to vote for this resolution, because it does not matter whether there is a Republican President or a Democratic President, for them to refuse to respond to a subpoena of the Congress of the United States, and to even come here and claim a privilege, which they have not, our democracy will be lessened. 
   I urge my colleagues to carry out the intent and the vision of the Founders and the writers of our Constitution. Support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, we are trying to move along the business of the people of this country. 
   I rise in strong support of this extraordinarily good legislation.  
   Mr. Chairman, this legislation truly represents a new direction in America's energy policy, and it will thereby strengthen our national, economic and environmental security. 
   Twenty-eight years ago, President Carter said (and I quote): ``This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our Nation.'' 
   President Carter was correct then, but we failed to act. 
   We must not fail to act today. 
   We must pass this comprehensive legislation, which will reduce our reliance on foreign oil by investing in the infrastructure needed to deploy homegrown bio-fuels, providing incentives for plug-in hybrid cars, and promoting the use of mass transit.  
   This legislation also repeals a number of tax subsidies that benefit the oil and gas industry, and includes landmark energy efficiency provisions that will save consumers and businesses at least $300 billion through 2030. 
   In fact, the energy efficiency provisions will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 10.4 billion tons through 2030--more than the annual emissions of all the cars on the road in America today. 
   In addition, it extends existing tax credits for the production of renewable energy; spurs innovation by supporting high-risk, high-payoff energy research; and bolsters research on renewable energy and global warming. 
   Furthermore, the bill requires our government to become carbon-neutral by the year 2050, moving forward on carbon capture and sequestration, promoting clean energy exports to developing countries, and directing the administration to lead the global effort to achieve a binding global warming agreement. 
   It is my hope that the house will send this bill to conference with a strong vote so that we can reach consensus on issues such as the use of renewables, the development of new technologies, and the fiscally responsible extension of needed energy tax provisions. 
   This bill will help us achieve that goal. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I understand that. But I just got it, and we just got it on the desk as to what you were going to add. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the distinguished ranking member has outlined what's in this bill. It is emblematic of the problem we have seen  for 12 years where we have ignored conservation, where we have ignored alternative energy sources, where we have ignored reaching out with the understanding that petroleum is going to run out from wherever we seek it and that we therefore need to move in a new direction and adopt a new policy and to adopt a policy on the future, not on the present, adopt a policy that looks to our children and grandchildren's future as well as the future of ourselves. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this motion puts together a complete substitute with three key differences from our bill. It includes refinery streamlining, provisions that were rejected, rejected in the 2005 Energy Conference Committee, rejected. We were not in charge. That's in this bill. These provisions override environmental law, reduce public participation, and do so for no real benefit. 
   The provisions in the 2005 law have never been used, and the provisions in this substitute is a solution in search of a problem. The substitute also includes Arctic refuge drilling, as the gentleman has made clear. 
   We repeatedly rejected that proposition. It could have been offered in a separate amendment. It was not, but it's not hidden in this bill, and we ought to know that. It does not produce oil for more than a decade, while conservation has immediate opportunities. 
   Finally, the substitute also includes alternative fuel standards; H.R. 3221 does not. We decided to let the committee of jurisdiction work that matter. It is in the Senate bill. I have said repeatedly over the months that standard will be in a bill that we send to the President of the United States. 
   But the Energy Committee is going to be working on that, the Senate has worked on that, and we will work our will. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is an extraordinary bill. We said when we ran for office that we would provide a new direction for energy independence for America, for security reasons, for security reasons, for economic reasons, and for environmental reasons. We are meeting our promise today. 
   Reject this substitute, which you have not possibly had the time to read, and enact one of the most far-reaching, new-direction, future-oriented energy bills that this House will have ever passed. Reject the substitute. Vote for this bill. Let us move so the American public can have confidence in a better America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, one of our most senior Members and a gentleman who is deeply committed to civil liberties and the protections being accorded that our Constitution guarantees to every citizen. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Reyes, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, an individual who has been involved in law enforcement all of his life before coming to the Congress of the United States, who understands the necessity for constraints on those in power. 
   We all understand as well the threat that confronts us from terrorism. And every Member of this body, without exception, wants to assure the safety and security of our homeland and of our people. Every Member of this body wants to assure that we have given to those in charge of protecting this country the tools necessary to accomplish that objective. 
   Our Founding Fathers were convinced that if we worked hard at it and cooperatively, that we could accomplish both of those objectives. 
   I want to congratulate Mr. Reyes and Mr. Conyers for working hard at  this. I participated myself, as I have said the other day when we passed another bill, to accomplish what I believed was much better as far as both objectives. 
   I believe that every Member in this House wants to protect America. Each of us will exercise our judgment when this vote comes on whether or not this bill is supportable given what I think is the failure to pay attention, as it should have, to the constitutional protections while focusing on the protections against terrorism and against those who would harm and undermine the interests of our country. I regret that. 
   I spent time talking to Admiral McConnell. ROY BLUNT, my friend, and I spent time talking to Admiral McConnell. We spent time reviewing the legislation. I believe that we could reach agreement. I will tell my friends here that I think if we had been dealing with Admiral McConnell, that we would have reached agreement. It became evident, however, that that was not the case. I say that candidly and disappointedly. It became obvious that we were dealing with the administration. There are many of us in this House who believe the administration has focused on the security interests, unfortunately to the exclusion too often of the constitutional requirements. 
   I will be voting against this legislation, not because I don't want to give the tools to our security apparatus that I think they need, that I want them to have, that I think the American people expect us to make sure they have, but because I believe we have not reached the balance that our Founding Fathers expected. 
   Now, there would be some on my side and many on the other side who will vote for this legislation. From my perspective, however, we have much work that remains to be done. Mr. Reyes, Mr. Conyers, and Mr. Hoekstra will be working very hard during the coming days to fashion permanent legislation. 
   This legislation is for 6 months. And my plea to each one of us on this floor and to the administration is to work together to ensure that we protect both the American public from terrorists and, as our Founding Fathers expected our Constitution to do and as conservatives have always focused attention on, protecting our people from the excesses and abuse of those to whom we give power in this country. Because we have done that through the decades and centuries, our country is unique and respected for that protection of liberty and freedom. 
   So I urge my colleagues, whatever the outcome on this floor tonight, as we proceed over the next few months, let us work together as Americans committed to both of those objectives.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS--Continued -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I take a back seat to no one in this House on loving this institution. 
   The issue, my friends, is not whether we have respect for one another. Too often, it is demonstrable on this floor that we don't. 
   The issue is, Will the American people have respect for us? That is the issue. That is the critical issue that confronts us this evening. Not because any of us are pointing fingers at anybody else in this House. 
   But unless you were sound asleep prior to the last election, unless you were living in another country in another land in another time, you know what the people thought about this, the people's House that we love. That, my friends, is why we are in the majority, because the people thought changes were necessary in this House. 
   The people asked for change. They asked for accountability. There have been some things said on this House floor that are not accurate. Mr. Tiahrt said that Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker, and Mr. Boehner, the minority leader, would make independent appointments to this. 
   Mr. Capuano changed that as a result of the suggestions of these Members. It was a good change because it meant that Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi are going to have to agree on six people. 
   It has been said on this House just now that this replaces the Ethics Committee. It absolutely does not. Does it complement it? I think it does, but it does not replace it. Nor does it substitute its judgment for the Ethics Committee. 
   The Ethics Committee can continue to operate as it does now and can initiate, it does not need to wait on this committee. It can initiate the defense of the ethics of this House, 435 of us elected by our neighbors and friends. We are all sad when one of us comes short of the expectations of our constituents, as we should, because we know only too well, those of us who have served for significant periods of time in the public's fear, that the acts of each of us is often attributed to the rest of us. 
   There needs to be a confidence level among the American people in the people's House. How are they going to  have that confidence? I suggest to you that it is my belief, as one who is not for many of the things that the so-called groups are for, who think that it is going to change, it will not change, many times, the substance of what we deal with. 
   I happen to have come to the conclusion that this proposal that Mr. Capuano and others have made, and I regret the fact that this is not a bipartisan proposal. One of my best friends in life, not just that served here in this House, is Senator BEN CARDIN. Many of you know how close he and I are. He and Bob Livingston worked on the last major ethics reform together and came together in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I am one who works in a bipartisan fashion. Ask Bob Ney and the Help America Vote Act. Ask Steve Bartlett on the Americans with Disabilities Act. I believe in operating that way. I wish this were a bipartisan product. 
   If we had the vote on the Republican alternative, I would vote against it. Why would I vote against it? Because it has within its framework submitting to the Justice Department after 45 days a complaint that the Ethics Committee has not dealt with. I don't think that is appropriate for a violation of the rules. It should be within the bosom of this body. This proposal copies it there. 
   This does not give subpoena power to people to go on fishing expeditions. It gives to six people, selected jointly by Mr. Boehner and Speaker Pelosi, who I hope and believe that they will agree upon people of very high integrity and good common sense. Because when they say, and somebody comes along and says in a press conference, STENY HOYER has violated the rules, none of us can protect ourselves against that. That's the business we are in. We are all targets and we are all vulnerable. 
   But it is my belief that this body will be composed of the kinds of people that I think Speaker Pelosi and Mr. Boehner will appoint, and not Members. 
   I am a lawyer. I will tell you, the public is not too convinced that lawyers are good at self-regulation. Some of you are doctors. The public is not particularly convinced that doctors are good self-regulators, or CPAs or other professions. 
   That's what we are talking about. We are talking about to the American public we do act properly, we do keep the faith. We are honest, and we are prepared to answer for our conduct and give confidence to you, the American people, that it is the people's House, not our House, the people's House. 
   I suggest to you, my friends, that whatever can happen, whatever could happen, whatever scenario you fear can happen right now with the existing process, all this does, it adds a complementary body, hopefully, and I believe, of citizens of very high repute who will, in turn, be able to say to the American public, yes, this group of Americans is honest, hardworking, and serving you well. 
   Are there, from time to time, exceptions? There are. But let us have the confidence to tell to the American people our conduct is, and we want it to be, above reproach, and we do not fear the oversight and accountability that this proposal suggests. I urge my colleagues, have confidence in those that Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi will appoint. Have confidence in yourselves and in your colleagues, and let us this night give confidence to our constituents and the American people. 
   Vote for this proposal.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   In response to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, let me read a statement from the President's veto message of March 8, 2008: 
   ``My disagreement over section 327 is not over any particular interrogation technique; for instance, it is not over waterboarding, which is not part of the current CIA program.'' He doesn't say that it will not be a part of the CIA program. He has very carefully worded, ``It is not part of the current program.'' 
   That is why I tell my friend this legislation is relevant. That is why, in my opinion, his Presidential candidate, although he seems to have changed his mind, passed his own bill, which the President, of course, signed and then had a signing statement that he wasn't sure that he had to follow it, that torture was not the policy of the United States of America. I agree with that. It's not. It should not be. But we need to make a very clear statement that it is not. Why? Because the rest of the world is looking at us and wondering what are the values that this great Nation we respect so much values? 
   Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the President could have made a clear, unequivocal statement that this great Nation does not and will not torture those in our custody. He should have signed this important intelligence authorization conference report into law. But instead, he vetoed it, because it requires all American intelligence agencies to comply with the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogations. 
   Let us be clear: This veto was unfortunate and misguided. It threatens to further degrade America's moral standing as others have said, including Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State in this administration. It threatens to undermine our credibility in the international community and to expose our own military and intelligence personnel to the very same tactics and treatment. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Member here believes that our Nation must take decisive action to detect, disrupt, and, yes, eliminate terrorists who have no compunction about planning and participating in the mass killings of innocent men, women, and children in an effort to advance their twisted, demented aims. We can, we will, and we must prevail in the war on terror. However, in the pursuit of those who seek to harm us, we must not sacrifice the very ideals that distinguish us from those who preach death and destruction and say that their ends justify whatever means they may use. 
   During the current administration, we have seen the line blurred between legitimate, sanctioned interrogation tactics and torture. And there is no doubt, our international reputation has suffered and been stained as a result. The excesses at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo are well known, as well as the administration's belief that the Geneva Convention against torture is, and I quote, quaint. Let me repeat that for my colleagues. The administration's advice that it got from counsel was that the Geneva Conventions against torture is, quote, quaint, close quote. I would suggest to you it is as relevant today as it was when it was signed. 
   These incidents and others sully our great Nation's good reputation and allow our enemies to foment fear and stoke hatred. Requiring all intelligence agencies to comply with the Army Field Manual on interrogation is an attempt by this Congress, passed by majorities in both Houses, to repair the damage that has already been done. Furthermore, the techniques permitted by the Army Field Manual have been endorsed by a wide array of civilian and military officials as both effective and consistent with our values. 
   Here, in fact, is what General David Petraeus wrote to members of the Armed Forces in Iraq last May. I believe it has been quoted, but it bears repeating: 
   ``Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary.'' 
   General Petraeus went on to say: 
   ``Our experience in applying interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual ..... shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not a question of whether we must combat and defeat terrorists. We must. However, we must never let it be said that when this generation of Americans was forced to confront evil that we succumbed to the tactics of the tyrant. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, vote to override this unjustified and deeply misguided veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   The previous speaker I have great respect for; I think he's one of the very conscientious, very able Members of this House, and I think he is one of the fiscal conservatives that follows a consistent policy. I don't think that's true  of all his colleagues. I think they talk a fiscally conservative game sometimes, but don't play a fiscally conservative game. But let me tell my friend this: expenditures are both domestic and non-domestic. And my friend is leaving, Mr. Flake. I guess I'm not going to talk to him about it. But the previous speaker spoke about fiscally conservative actions. This President has sent down to us a request for $196.4 billion in expenditures, not in Anchorage, not in Baltimore and not in Mississippi or California, $196.4 billion for Baghdad and Kabul. But, he says, water resources development is too much for America. He doesn't pay for a single cent of that $196.4 billion, not a cent, but he says in order to develop the levees to save New Orleans, it has cost us billions of dollars because they weren't adequate; or to build bridges that don't fall down in Minnesota, he says this is too much money. And I understand that WDRA doesn't cover bridges. But the point is it covers investment in our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, like most of our House colleagues, I am deeply disappointed that the President has chosen to veto the Water Resources Development Act. It is critical to the health of our people, to economic development in this country, and the safety of our communities. 
   The WDRA conference report, which passed the House and Senate by overwhelming bipartisan votes, 381 Members of this House said this investment is good for America, and in the Senate, 81 Senators said this investment is good for America, because it makes critical investments in our Nation's water resources and infrastructure. 
   In short, this conference report will enable the Army Corps of Engineers to maintain our Federal shipping channels, preserving jobs and bolstering the economy. It will allow the Corps to work with States and local communities on necessary environmental restoration projects, and it will permit the Corps to ensure the safety of our citizens by shoring up our aging levees, dams, and reducing the possibility of flooding. 
   Furthermore, this conference report makes specific investments in the gulf coast, which was so damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I see my friend, Mr. Melancon, on the floor of this House. He knows how critical this funding is for his region and for America. For example, it would restore Louisiana's coastal wetlands, which provide increased hurricane and storm damage protection which ultimately will save us billions of dollars. It would raise and enhance flood protection levees surrounding the City of New Orleans, and it would make improvements to the drainage canals that significantly contributed to the flooding of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Many of us have been there and have seen that damage. 
   Unfortunately, despite the beneficial investments called for in this conference report, the President has chosen to stand in the way of this bipartisan legislation, this overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation, in an attempt to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility. Fiscally responsible people invest in their future. Fiscally responsible people maintain their infrastructure. Fiscally responsible people know that clean water and safe harbors aid our commerce and the health of our people. That is conservative investment. Let us be clear, the President wants to make a stand on fiscal responsibility. This is the wrong bill to have done so. 
   The WRDA conference report is a multi-year authorization through which Congress would appropriate about $2 billion a year for the Corps to undertake important projects. Furthermore, this conference report reflects a backlog of 7 years of project requests because the 107th, 108th and 109th Congresses failed to enact a water resources bill. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this House, let us fulfill our promise to communities all across this Nation, not to Baghdad, not to Kabul, but to the cities and States that I've mentioned. Let us meet our responsibility, the vital fiscally responsible investments in projects that facilitate commerce and economic development, provide eco-system restoration, and protect human life and property. 
   Let us exercise the responsibility that the Constitution of the United States gives to us, and that is to set policy and invest the resources of our public in a better future for our country. 
   Vote to override this mistaken veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3043, DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I first want thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, David Obey--who also chairs the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education--for his hard work and vision in putting this appropriations conference report together. 
   I also want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs--Congressman Edwards of Texas--for his outstanding work on this conference report and his unwavering dedication to our Nation's veterans. 
   This is an excellent, fiscally responsible conference report that makes vital investments in expanding access to health care for our people, in educating our children, in job training, in medical research, and in providing the largest single increase in the 77-year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Simply put, this conference report deserves the overwhelming support of members--just as the individual bills did when they were considered in both the House and Senate. 
   Recall, we passed the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill on a bipartisan vote of 276 to 140, with 53 Republicans joining a nearly unanimous Democratic caucus. 
   The Senate passed its own version of this bill 75 to 19. 
   And, both chambers passed the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill by overwhelming margins--409 to 2 in the House, and 92 to 1 in the Senate. 
   This conference report demonstrates our democratic priorities--as well as the President's misguided, shortsighted budget proposals, which would cut funding for Labor, Health and Education programs by $3.6 billion below the enacted funding level in fiscal year 2007. 
   If the President had his way, he would cut vocational education; eliminate all student aid other than work study and Pell Grants; cut medical research; cut law enforcement grants; cut education for children with disabilities; cut rural health programs; cut clean water programs; and cut the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program. The American people do not support such a proposal. And neither do Democrats. 
   Thus, this conference report provides $9.8 billion above the President's request for Labor, Health and Education programs--which barely keeps pace with inflation and population growth. 
   Through this conference report, 1.2 million more Americans would have access to community health centers, and we would increase funding for programs that help parents pay for college, for No Child Left Behind programs, for vocational education and Job Corps, and for medical research into life threatening diseases. 
   Through this conference report, we also will keep our commitment to our Nation's veterans, providing $3.7 billion more than the President requested for veterans' medical care, claims processing personnel, and facility improvements. 
   The President has said such funding is unnecessary. 
   We absolutely disagree. 
   The idea that we cannot find the funds necessary to invest in health care, education and medical research, and in medical care of the men and women who have sacrificed for this country is patently absurd--and it must be rejected. 
   How is it that the President can demand that this Congress spend another $200 billion of taxpayers' dollars for his failing policy in Iraq while he seeks to shortchange critical programs at home? 
   His vain attempt to try to claim the mantle of fiscal responsibility by threatening to veto this conference report--particularly in light of his disastrous and irresponsible fiscal policies--will fool no one. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an excellent conference report that reflects the priorities of the American people, and rejects the President's misguided proposals. 
   Finally, let me say that Mr. OBEY effectively dispensed yesterday--in his speech at the National Press Club--with the Republican complaint that this conference report threatens enactment of the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill. 
   Only once in the last 5 years did the Republican Majority send the President a free-standing Military Construction conference report. Three times you packaged that bill with others. And last year, you failed to even enact a Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill. 
   I urge my colleagues: vote for this fiscally responsible conference report, which makes critical investments in our Nation, our people and our future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. My friend from Arizona is having a good time. I don't blame him, but this is something that is good for the country. It is good for literally millions of people who have grown tobacco. 
   Let me say to my friend from Arizona: A, I don't smoke; B, I have never smoked. And when redistricting occurred and I got most of the tobacco-growing areas of Maryland, I went down and met with the Farm Bureau. I said, Look, I'm new to you. You don't know me. Actually, they did know me because I had been in office for some time. But I said, I want to tell you something right out front; I think smoking is bad for people's health, and I am not for it. 
   About eight of the 10 to 15 tobacco farmers that were there said to me after the meeting, they came up to me and said, You know what, we don't smoke and we don't want our kids to smoke. 
   That aside, Maryland has had one of the most successful tobacco buyout programs in America. In my district, the tobacco-growing area of Maryland, 90-plus percent, almost 95 percent of  the farmers have taken the buyout, which means they can no longer ever on the property they own have tobacco grown for the purposes of smoking tobacco. 
   There were literally, as you can imagine, hundreds, and across the country there are thousands and thousands of farmers so situated, families who have been involved in this process for most of their lives and who produce a product, used alternatively, can have extraordinary value. But the problem is the research has not been done on it. Why has it not been done on it? Because the tobacco product was a very valuable product for a bad purpose; that is, smoking. Harmful to health and a destroyer of life. 
   Very frankly, some of the Farm Bureau came to me and said, Do you think we can find an alternative use, because we have a lot of expertise in growing this product, and we have facilities to do so. We think it can have some beneficial effect. My good friend said he thought that was the case. He is correct. There are a lot of good things in life that can happen, and his proposition is why this money, why here? 
   Well, because I represent my district. But I also believe this has national implications that if we can get a product from tobacco that is useful, and I want to discuss some of them, that will be good for our country, good for our economy, good for jobs, and good for people who have been displaced from the very lucrative but harmful vocation and who are now put to perhaps not having nearly the livelihood they expected to have. 
   The amendment seeks to eliminate funding for an important research project being undertaken at the University of Maryland. One of America's extraordinary research institutions, a land grant college established in the mid part of the 19th century, it seeks to develop safe and beneficial nonsmoking uses for tobacco. 
   The Alternative Uses of Tobacco Project has several very important objectives. First, we are seeking to take advantage of the many beneficial nonsmoking uses of tobacco. Most people would not think of the tobacco plant as having a use beyond smoking. They would be wrong. I didn't know that either, frankly. 
   Tobacco naturally produces high-nutrition proteins, one of the highest of any product, industrial raw materials and large amounts of biomass which can be used for renewable energy. Think of it. We talk about corn, we talk about other things, and we want to talk about cellulosic to produce energy. We just passed a farm bill seeking to do that. Think if all of the tobacco farms in America could be turned into energy producers, an extraordinarily positive contribution to the economy of our country.     
   Secondly, we're trying to revitalize tobacco-producing communities across the southeastern United States by shifting their focus away from the traditional use of the crop and generating new markets and new industries for beneficial new nonsmoking purposes. 
   Unlike Maryland, the Federal buyout, as you know, didn't eliminate the growing of tobacco; and in many States that have buyout programs they didn't eliminate the use of tobacco for smoking purposes. Maryland did. So that if we could give alternative uses for a product and get it out of the sale of use for smoking products, what a health benefit that would be for America. 
   So I suggest that this $400,000 is an extraordinarily good investment in health care, in the economy for our people. 
   Third, we are attempting to develop new technologies for producing leaf proteins. Leaf proteins are as nutritious as milk protein, but, unlike other protein sources, they are generally nonallergenic. Tobacco may be the largest producer of leaf proteins of any agricultural crop, but its historically inadequate processing technologies have limited their development. 
   Now, let me tell you something. The tobacco companies do not grow tobacco. They sell cigarettes. So they do not have an incentive to do this. The people who have an incentive to do it are the tobacco farmers, but, guess what, the tobacco farmers don't have a lot of money. It's the tobacco companies that have a lot of money. 
   So the tobacco companies rely on, I'm sure in your State as they do in mine, land grant institutions who have focused on agricultural research, as does the University of Maryland, as does the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. 
   So I have some other things to say, but I think you get the point. 
   Mr. Flake is a friend of mine. I have great respect for Mr. Flake. Not only that, I think he offers his amendments in a very positive way. I've never seen him get mad at anybody. I've never seen him criticize anybody. I've never seen him say a cross word to anybody. He sets forth what is a correct proposition, that, look, we could save a lot of money by not having any of these earmarks and we wouldn't do this research or maybe the State could do it or maybe somehow the farmers could get together in a cooperative and do it. But they haven't done it and the Federal Government has historically invested in long-term progress. 
   Now, very frankly, the best example is the space program. The space program has made an extraordinary contribution in the creation of jobs outside of the space program, and agricultural research colleges have done the same for farming and feeding the world. We honored with a gold medal a university professor who fed the world, billions. 
   So I ask my friends, this is $400,000. We will spend $400,000 in Baghdad in the next hour or so. I don't know what the Citizens Against Government Waste think of that, and I frankly don't think they think of this particular item. I understand that. They think generally we ought to stop wasting government money. I agree absolutely. 
   And if you think research in a product to turn it to pharmaceutical use, if you think that research in a product to turn it to better energy production, if you think research in a product that may be available to give us better protein production, then I think, my friends, Mr. Obey has said, we get the point. So I say this, and I'm laughing, this is a serious investment in good things for all people. 
   I hope that, notwithstanding the fact that he is my friend, that you will reject the gentleman's amendment, and I thank you for the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have proceeded for 10 appropriation bills with an open rule with an agreement we would reach a unanimous consent agreement on those rules within the framework of the time that we spent last year. 
   I said on the floor that we spent approximately 52 hours longer on the first 10 bills than we had last year under unanimous consents that Mr. Obey agreed to. I am informed by Mr. Obey that our staff has recomputed the time, and when one includes the Agriculture bill, it is closer to 80-plus hours longer under open rules. That was certainly not shutting anybody down or out. That was not our intent. In fact, it was not our practice. As I pointed out then, we complied, we think, with the letter of that to which we agreed. 
   We now find ourselves in the context of trying to move forward on very important legislation. This bill was open, of course, for debate and amendment for an extended period of time. The debate was not used for amendments or debate about the substance of the bill before us. 
   In fact, it is my understanding the Rules Committee talked to those who wanted to offer amendments in this rule. It is not shutting out all amendments. In fact, what it is doing is including a number of amendments on both sides of the aisle. It includes in the self-executing, to which the gentleman refers, a balanced group of amendments, all of which, we think, will be agreed to. 
   Mr. Flake is going to offer some amendments, one I have a particular interest in. He was given the choice of what amendments that he wanted to offer. Yes, we have limited amendments, because we have limited time and we want to complete this bill. 
   When we complete the debate on this bill, it will be just a little shorter than the bill that was considered last year. Just a little. We think it is fair. But we are here because we did not pursue the agreement that we thought we had with the open-rule process. 
   Now, we still have one additional bill to go, the Defense bill. We are discussing that. We are hopeful that perhaps we can proceed as we have proceeded in the past, with an open rule on that bill. 
   But we are trying to facilitate the doing of the people's business. We said we would do that. That is what we are doing. We believe that Members have been treated fairly. 
   Yesterday, on SCHIP, there was a request of me to include an additional hour of debate. That was agreed to. I think that was a good and full debate. We had very significant differences on that bill. The bill was approved by the House. I think this bill will be approved by the House and moved. That will leave us just one appropriation bill. I think by the end of this week, we will have passed all of our appropriation bills.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his observations, and I reclaim my time.  
   Mr. Speaker, very frankly, as I have said, we have spent almost 80 hours more on the first 10 bills than we spent last year under the unanimous consents we granted to you under Mr. Obey's leadership. Given that fact, we considered a lot of amendments. 
   From my perspective, frankly, in a group of 435, the reason you have a Rules Committee is because you can't possibly accommodate all 435 Members if they want to offer one.

   Mr. HOYER. As the former chairman of the Rules Committee, you know that. 
   Mr. Speaker, in fact, in my opinion, although we allowed it, there were an extraordinary number of redundant amendments, 1.25 percent, 1 percent, .75 percent. I understand that. They were message amendments. I understand making messages. That is part of what we are about. 
   This rule that the gentleman is very concerned about is a precedent. Frankly, we argued for following the precedent of last year. That was not done. 
   We are now trying to get the business of the people done, while at the same time giving a fair number of amendments, as we do on almost every other bill, but not every amendment. We think that we have done that. We think that we are fair in terms of the amendments that are included in the self-execution, because they are not just Democratic amendments. There are a balanced, equal number of amendments, and one other significant amendment I think will be unanimously supported, I hope and believe, and will facilitate the consideration of this bill and substantively move ahead the work of our country and our people.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman on behalf of Mr. Sensenbrenner and myself, and for all those who have been involved in this effort. 
   Joint Statement of Representatives Hoyer and Sensenbrenner on the Origins of the ADA Restoration Act of 2008, H.R. 3195 
   On September 29, 2006, we introduced H.R. 6258, entitled the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2006. This bill was a response to decisions of the Supreme Court and lower courts narrowing the group of people whom Congress had intended to protect under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Supreme Court had interpreted the ADA to impose a ``demanding'' standard for coverage. It had also held that the ameliorative effects of ``mitigating measures'' that people use to control the effects of their disabilities must be considered in determining whether a person has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity and is protected by the ADA. This holding was contrary to Congress's stated intent in several committee reports. 
   We introduced H.R. 6258, which was designed to reverse these holdings, at the end of the 2006 legislative session. We intended this bill to serve as a marker of our intent to introduce future legislation to address this issue. On July 26, 2007, we introduced similar legislation, H.R. 3195, the ADA Restoration Act of 2007, which ultimately garnered over 240 cosponsors. A nearly identical bill, S. 1881, was introduced in the Senate on the same day by Senators Harkin and Specter. 
   H.R. 3195 as introduced would have amended the ADA to provide protection for any individual who had a physical or mental impairment or a record of such an impairment, or who was treated as having such an impairment. The purpose of this legislation was to restore the intent of Congress to cover a broad group of individuals with disabilities under the ADA and to eliminate the problem of courts focusing too heavily on whether individuals were covered by the law rather than on whether discrimination occurred. The bill as introduced, however, was seen by many as extending the protections of the ADA beyond those that Congress originally intended to provide. 
   In order to craft a more balanced bill with broad support, we urged that representatives of the disability and business communities enter into negotiations to try to reach an acceptable compromise. We maintained contact with these communities over the course of their negotiations and supported them in their efforts to understand the needs and concerns of each community. After several months of intensive discussions, negotiators for the two communities reached consensus on a set of protections for people with disabilities that garnered broad support from both communities. These protections would significantly expand the group of individuals protected by the ADA beyond what the courts have held, while at the same time ensuring that the expansion does not extend beyond the original intent of the ADA. 
   This compromise formed the basis of the amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 3195 that was voted out of the House Education and Labor and Judiciary Committees with overwhelming support on June 18, 2008. The substitute bill was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee by a vote of 43-1, and out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 27-0.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady from Colorado for her leadership on this issue over the years, and I thank the former Governor of Delaware, our colleague, Congressman Castle, for his leadership on this. This bill in my opinion reflects the best in bipartisan cooperation to try to respond to the American public and their concerns and their needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, today for the third consecutive day in this 110th Congress, the new Democratic majority in the House is considering very important legislation that will pass on a bipartisan basis. On Tuesday, we passed legislation implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to make America safer. That bill passed 299-128 with 68 Republican votes. Yesterday we passed a long overdue increase in the Federal minimum wage by a vote of 315-116 with 82 Republican votes. That is a positive message to the American public that we can and we want to work together. There will not be unanimity, but today we will pass H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, legislation offered, again, by the gentlewoman from Colorado and the gentleman from Delaware. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is not a bold prediction to say that this legislation will pass today, because this House approved identical legislation last May by a vote of 238-194 with 50 Republicans joining 187 Democrats and one Independent. There are, as that vote reflects, bipartisan concerns about this legislation. It is my personal belief that they have been addressed in this legislation carefully drafted to do so. The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 63-37 before the President vetoed it last July. 
   Mr. Speaker, in short, the DeGette-Castle bill would increase the number of embryonic stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research. Current policy limits, as we all know, the use of Federal funds for research only to those stem cell lines that existed when President Bush issued an executive order on August 9, 2001. This policy severely restricts the potential for lifesaving breakthroughs because only 22 of those 78 stem cell lines are available for research and a vast majority of those 22 lines are aged, contaminated or have been developed through obsolete methods. 
   It cannot be stressed enough, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation only authorizes Federal research funds for stem cell lines generated from embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. That seems to me to be a critical consideration for all who will vote on this legislation. 
   I believe this legislation does not seek to destroy life. Others disagree. I understand that. It seeks to preserve and protect life. In fact, former Senate majority leader Dr. Bill Frist who formerly opposed this legislation but now supports it has stated: ``I strongly believe that embryonic stem cells uniquely hold specific promise for some therapies and potential cures that adult stem cells cannot provide.'' 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, we have a moral obligation to provide our scientific community with the tools it needs to save lives and this legislation in my view accomplishes exactly that. We understand this is a difficult issue to many Americans and that it raises important questions that humanity  has yet to adequately answer. That is why this legislation also directs HHS and the National Institutes of Health to issue ethical guidelines that will ensure the highest standards of scientific investigation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation enjoys the overwhelming support of Members of this Congress and the American people, many of whom are affected by diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and injuries of the spinal cord and nervous system. This legislation represents the hope of millions of Americans who are waiting for us to take action. That is why we have urged action early in this session. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, as they have before; and I urge the President to reconsider his veto when this bipartisan legislation reaches his desk. Again I congratulate Ms. DeGette and Mr. Castle for working together assiduously and without flagging on behalf of the American people. This is a good bill for our country and for those who face great challenges of health.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, as a young man I worked on Capitol Hill for a United States Senator, along with the Speaker, Senator Daniel Brewster. 
   From time to time, Clarence Mitchell, Jr., one of the giants of American history in civil rights in America, would visit Senator Brewster; and I would have an opportunity to meet him. I was honored and awed to meet him. Many called him the 101st United States Senator. Clarence Mitchell, Jr., was the brother of Parren James Mitchell. 
   Shortly after I graduated from law school, I was honored by the citizens of my district who elected me to the State Senate. I went to the State Senate as a young man, but there was a young man 6 months younger than I. His name was Clarence Mitchell, III, Clarence Junior's son. We served together.  
   Over the years, I got to know very well Juanita Mitchell, an extraordinary family, an extraordinary family whose matriarch, Ms. Jackson, was an extraordinary leader in her own right. 
   Parren J. Mitchell was my friend. In 1981, many years after I met the Mitchell family for the first time, I ran for Congress. Juanita Mitchell and Parren Mitchell and Clarence Mitchell, III, were very helpful to me in that campaign. I represented a large African American population. They have always been very supportive of me and I of them. Parren Mitchell did a radio ad for me during the course of that campaign urging all in Prince George's County to elect me. That was a significant help, in my opinion, to my election.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RELATING TO THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, forty years ago this week, America's Israeli allies triumphed over the greatest threat to their nation's survival since it was founded in 1948. By emerging from the Six-Day War victorious, Israel demonstrated that a country devoted to liberty, equality and democracy could not only exist, but flourish, in one of the most volatile regions in the world. 
   In the weeks leading up to June of 1967, Israel's Arab neighbors amassed an immense force along their shared borders with the Jewish state. Their goal--as Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser then put it--was ``the destruction of Israel,'' and they assembled 465,000 troops, 2,800 tanks, and 800 aircraft on Israel's doorstep to achieve this malicious goal. 
   In the armed conflict that followed, Israel defended itself honorably, courageously, and effectively--winning the war in just six days and taking control of lands previously held by the invading nations. And in an unprecedented act of compromise, Israel offered to give back the captured lands in return for nothing more than a promise that Israel's neighbors would join them in pursuit of peaceful co-existence. 
   Furthermore, Israel stated that the City of Jerusalem, which was placed under Israel's control as a result of the war, would once again be open to peoples of all faiths and nationalities--a provision that allowed Jews, Christians and Muslims alike to freely worship in the holy city. 
   These actions in defense of peace and equality--undertaken by Israel just weeks after being attacked--help to demonstrate why the U.S.-Israeli relationship remains so strong to this day. The Israeli people have always worked hard to find common ground with their neighbors, even while facing profound threats to their safety and sovereignty. And just as Israel has never turned its back on the principles and values that all free nations share, America will never turn its back on her. 
   It gives me great pride to support H. Con. Res. 152, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem and recognizing the preceding struggle--and I look forward to many more years of fruitful partnership between the United States and Israel.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 451) directing the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to respond to the indictment of, or the filing of charges of criminal conduct in a court of the United States or any State against, any Member of the House of Representatives by empaneling an investigative subcommittee to review the allegations not later than 30 days after the date the Member is indicted or the charges are filed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the minority leader, in closing on the resolution that will be voted on in a short time, correctly observed that every Member of the House needs to be held accountable for conduct which undermines the faith, respect and confidence that the American public has in this institution. We agree with that. In fact, we have been saying that for years and we have acted to effect that objective. This resolution, we believe, furthers that effort. 
   Essentially, Mr. Speaker, what this resolution says, it directs the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to respond to an indictment of or the filing of charges of criminal conduct in a court of the United States of any State against any Member of the House by empaneling an investigative subcommittee to review the allegations not later than 30 days after the date the Member is indicted or charges are filed. 
   As I said in my statement with reference to the previous resolution, this will be a general process of the House so that every Member knows that this process will be employed, not on a partisan basis, but on the basis of conduct and on the basis of actions that have been taken. 
   It also says, however, to the committee that if they find that such an investigative committee, under the circumstances that the bipartisan committee reviews, do not feel that going forward is appropriate, they can report that back. That, I think, responds to the concerns properly raised by the gentleman from California. This resolution under this suspension is the general of what the other resolution is on the specifics. 
   Mr. Speaker, I said that Nancy Boyda from the State of Kansas came here and offered legislation which essentially said that if Members were found guilty of a crime that adversely affected their service in the Congress of the United States, that their pensions would be at risk. That legislation was overwhelmingly adopted. I congratulate the gentlelady from Kansas for her focus on ensuring the ethics of this body and that the public is not subsidizing criminal or unethical behavior which subjects a Member to removal. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume in support of the suspension to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Mrs. Boyda).

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his question. 
   What the resolution anticipates is applying generally that which the resolution offered by the minority leader raises specifically because we believe that the Ethics Committee ought to ensure for the American public that ethical conduct which does not call in question the House of Representatives' standards of official conduct is being pursued. 
   But I will tell the gentleman further that I have great confidence in this Ethics Committee, led by a former member of the judiciary, I might add, who knows the law and who knows process. And I have full confidence that she and the Members of the Ethics Committee on both sides, and, as the gentleman knows, it is five Republicans and five Democrats, would summarily have a form available to them that would say if someone gets a traffic ticket that is not subject to further action. You and I would agree with that without hesitation.

   The gentleman is correct.

   Mr. Speaker, we believe this resolution is well-crafted, and it's well-crafted to effect the end that it seeks.

   We think that's what the American people want. That's what we are pursuing. We think this legislation is very clear on that issue.

   Mr. HOYER. The gentleman is welcome. 
   The pain of accountability is evident. What this resolution says, and I am pleased that the gentleman from California is going to vote for it, is that the American people are going to have confidence that when a criminal act is committed by a Member, whatever that act, that the Ethics Committee will look at it. 
   I said earlier in the course of this debate that I have full confidence that the Ethics Committee will dismiss summarily, summarily, the examples that the gentleman from California raises. That's not what the American public are concerned about. 
   Yes, perhaps it's politicized. But when Duke Cunningham takes $2.5 million of bribes to put earmarks in bills and calls the Defense Department and says, give Mr. Wade a contract, the American people knows that's something they want looked at. They want action taken. That Member was not expelled until conviction. 
   When Mr. Abramoff takes trips with a lot of people to Scotland for free, the American people knows that's not a traffic ticket. It's not demonstrating in front of the Embassy of Sudan to say stop the genocide in Darfur. The American public knows the difference. 
   When a gentleman gets $5,000 in chips to put in his pocket and pay his bills with, they know that's not a traffic ticket, particularly when legislative action is taken shortly thereafter on this floor. They know the difference. 
   I would hope that every Member would vote for this, because I believe that every Member in this House wants an ethical House, Republican and Democrat. Why? Because unethical conduct, yes, criminal conduct, reflects on every one of us, because the American public too readily assumes, well, if one does it, all do it. 
   That is not the case. I believe that I am privileged to serve with those of you on the Republican side and those on the Democratic side with some very ethical members of our society who have been chosen by your neighbors to represent them in this body. 
   All we are saying in this resolution is that, ladies and gentlemen of America, we are going to hold accountable each and every one of us if we do not act in accordance with your justifiably high expectations. I hope every Member of this body votes for this resolution and says to our constituents, this body will be an ethical, honest body representing your interest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I intend to support this resolution, and I agree with the minority leader. The allegations that have been made are extraordinarily serious. They, if proven true, should lead to the expulsion of the Member in question. They, of course, have not been proved true. They are allegations. 
   Having said that, I also intend to and have called for a resolution to be considered tonight under suspension. That resolution speaks not only to the Jefferson case, to which the gentleman from Ohio limits his privileged resolution, but also speaks to any allegations of serious criminal conduct that may be made either through indictment or other charging documents; and it calls for action by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in any and all of those cases. 
   We appreciate the sensitivity of the minority leader to this issue at this time. It is, frankly, the first time I recall such a resolution being offered by the minority. For over a year, the Ethics Committee essentially didn't act, didn't operate. In fact, when it did and it held the former majority leader as having adversely affected the ethics of the House, the chairman was summarily removed from the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct; and, in fact, two of the members that had the temerity to vote to have a consequence for actions that reflected on the House were removed from that committee. 
   But I welcome the minority leader and the minority party's interest in pursuing this matter. I presume that the gentleman's resolution will pass unanimously. I also hope that the suspension resolution will also pass unanimously because there are, of course, unfortunately, a number of allegations being made publicly about Members of this House; and irrespective of what party they may fall into or be members of, it is critically important for us to hold accountable those Members and to assure the American public that the Ethics Committee is looking at those allegations, investigating those allegations, and making reports not only to the House of Representatives but to the people.     
   We swear an oath to not only defend the Constitution, but to uphold the laws of our land. As Members of this House, we have an absolute obligation to conduct ourselves in a way that does not violate the standards of official conduct or bring into disrepute the House of Representatives. Hopefully, we will agree on that proposition. 
   So I say to my Republican friends, we welcome them to this focus on holding accountable Members who violate the trust of the American public. We certainly intend to support it. I hope they will support the subsequently offered resolution, which says that in every case we will pursue this focus. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Chutzpah is a wonderful word. Chutzpah is the position of a person who has been involving themselves in activities for a long period of time and then accusing somebody else of doing the same and being sanctimonious in the process. 
   That aside, Mr. Speaker, this House was told in November of last year by the people of this country, clean up your House, get rid of the culture of corruption. That's what they said in 2006, on November 7; and that's what we're doing. We adopted one of the strongest rules packages dealing with ethics in the history of this House, eliminating all meals and gifts from lobbyists. Arm's-length transactions. No travel. We just passed a lobbying disclosure bill 2 weeks ago, which most of us voted for because we want to be in on the effort of cleaning up this House. 
   My young friend from Florida apparently forgets that in January we passed a pension bill which says that if you're convicted and expelled, you won't get your pension. That was the Boyda bill, Nancy Boyda from Kansas, who came to Congress on a pledge to clean up the Congress. And she was elected to do just that. 
   Earmarks. Earmarks were quadrupled over the last 14 years. We have now adopted a rule that says they're going to be transparent. You're going to know who made the request for earmarks, that there is going to be some check on those earmarks. 
   Now, my young friend from Florida says that our resolution, which will be on suspension, was just seen. I will tell him, and there is no way he would know this, I saw the leader's resolution just minutes ago. 
   But that is not the issue, Mr. Speaker. The issue is the American public did indeed send us here to act ethically, honestly and openly and do the people's business, not the special interests'. And that's why they made a change in this House in November of 2006, that's why we unanimously on our  side are going to support this resolution, and that's why we're going to support the suspension bill. 
   Because not only do we believe it ought to be done in this instance, but there are a lot of Members publicly under investigation in this House whose homes have been raided by Federal officials, but they're not in this resolution. They have not been indicted. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to act. The public needs to know we're acting, and we need to hold accountable those who fail to meet their public duty and trust to the American people. This leadership is committed to making sure that we do just that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is not about petting dogs. This is about people who are hurting. This is trying to reach out to people who have been savaged in many ways by this economy and the policies that have led to an economy where average working incomes are down $1,000 and where gasoline prices have exploded over 200 percent from $1.46 to $3.56. I would remind you that under the Clinton administration they went from $1.06 to $1.46, 5 cents a year during the 8 years of the Clinton administration. They are going up 5 cents a week during this administration. 
   People are stretched. 
   I didn't hear people come to this floor and say $30 billion for Bear Stearns. It was outrageous, putting the taxpayers' money--Mr. Flake says he did. Thirty billion dollars. We just talked about $2.5 billion for literally tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps as many as 1 million people. There is a crisis, and they have asked us to respond. 
   I want to congratulate the chairman of our committee. I want to thank the ranking member of the committee. I want to thank all the members of the committee for giving this their attention and trying to come up with a solution that works. Was this a partisan, divisive solution? Absolutely not. The Secretary of the Treasury has said that this is a product that merits serious consideration. 
   For a time, I thought he was for it. I am not sure now. There seems to be some internal division within the administration. Mr. Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that this is a good thing to do. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, today through this comprehensive landmark legislation, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act, this House is going to act not to pet dogs but to help people. This House will take decisive action to keep hundreds of thousands of families at risk of foreclosure in their homes and will help stabilize the housing markets across the Nation that have been wracked by an unprecedented drop in home values over the last 2 years. 
   Make no mistake: The slumping housing market has had negative, rippling effects throughout our economy. It is not just people in houses that are having problems, but the subprime crisis has affected our entire country and the availability of credit. And thus it is imperative that we take responsible, reasonable steps such as this to strengthen our weak economy and ultimately benefit not just those who are at risk of losing their homes, but every American. 
   As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke pointed out in a speech on Monday, Monday, just a few days ago, at Columbia University, ``High rates of delinquency and foreclosure can have substantial spillover effects on the housing market, the financial markets, and the broader economy.'' 
   And the answer is, don't pet your dog. It was bad behavior. Leave him alone. Or punish him. What we want to do is help people do the right thing. 
   He continued: ``Therefore, doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interests of lenders and borrowers, it's in everybody's interest.'' Those are Bernanke's words. Not Chairman Frank's. Not mine. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what this legislation, the product of hard work by Chairman Barney Frank and so many others, is designed to do: Avoid preventable foreclosures. 
   There is little question that after an historic housing boom in the first half of this decade we now are faced with a housing crisis. Foreclosures soared to an all-time high in the last quarter of 2007. According to Mortgage Bankers Association, more than 1.2 million properties received foreclosure notices in 2007, up 75 percent from 2006. And 1 in 33 homeowners is projected to be in foreclosure over the next 2 years. So much for a great economy. 
   This legislation, in short, will expand the FHA program so that borrowers in danger of losing their homes can refinance into lower-cost, government-insured mortgages that they can afford to repay. 
   I've heard so much talk about a family-friendly Congress. Family values. Caring about children. What can be more family friendly than keeping families in their homes? I think not too many things. 
   But to be clear, this bill will minimize taxpayer exposure. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of putting homeowners into affordable loans under the bill would be not $30 billion, not $20 billion, not $10 billion, but a total of $2.7 billion. A few days in Iraq. A few days in Iraq. Not a month. A few days in Iraq. 
   Contrary to the rhetoric coming from some, this bill is not a bailout for irresponsible lenders or borrowers. Only primary residences are eligible. Investors and lenders must take significant losses, as they should. The owner of the old mortgage can only receive 85 percent of the current value of the home. 
   And in return for an FHA guarantee on the mortgage, borrowers must share with the government any profit from the resale of a refinanced home. The government will only have liability if the borrower defaults and the amount recovered in foreclosure is below the outstanding debt still owed. 
   Furthermore, this legislation includes tax provisions to expand refinancing opportunities and to spur home buying. 
   It increases the VA home loan limit for high-cost housing areas, which we passed before, enabling veterans to have more homeownership opportunities. We are having people come home from Iraq. We are going to be talking about that. They may have lost their home because they went to Iraq and they couldn't keep their home. This helps them get back in a home. 
   And it includes FHA modernization provisions that have already passed this House, as well as GSE reforms such as strengthening the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and raising their loan limits to increase liquidity in the mortgage market. 
   Chairman Frank has talked to Secretary Paulson about that. I have talked to Secretary Paulson about that. I am sure many of you on your side of the aisle have talked to Secretary Paulson about that. He thinks this is absolutely essential. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's mitigate the effects of the bursting of the housing bubble. Let's prevent hundreds of thousands, and perhaps up to 1 million people, from foreclosure and allow American families to stay in their homes through this responsible legislation. 
   Let's stabilize our housing market and help millions and millions of homeowners who are not at risk of foreclosure, but whose neighbors are at risk for foreclosure, and if they are foreclosed upon, will see their home values deteriorate. So the assistance is not just to those at risk of foreclosure, but to all those who are in communities where homes are at risk. 
   Let's pass this comprehensive, bipartisan legislation today and work to get it to the President's desk without delay. I am hopeful that the President will see fit to sign it. Vote ``yes.'' Vote ``yes'' on the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Vote ``yes'' for the families of America.

It's not as extensive, as you know, as the Webb bill, which has also been worked on pretty hard by former Secretary of the Navy Webb, Jim Webb, the Senator from Virginia. Both bills obviously seek to make sure that our warriors who come back, those who have defended freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, that when they come back, we invest in their education so they, in turn, can grow our economy and our country and do what the veterans of World War II did. But we're looking at those and they're under discussion.

   Mr. HOYER. We certainly, as you know, passed a number of pieces of legislation which have attempted to look at a number of different issues. One, of course, was the manipulation by the OPEC nations to artificially inflate prices. The other thing we have looked at is price gouging at the pump. We passed that. The other item we looked at, of course, was the energy bill itself. And the other was we asked the FTC to look at manipulation. We wrote to the FTC about 3 weeks ago. The FTC gave  attention to our letter and is now exercising, as I understand, its jurisdiction under the legislation that we passed to look at prices. 
   In addition, we have numerous hearings scheduled. We've had some this week, next week, and the week after looking at various different aspects of this. Clearly, our consuming public, whether they be commercial, which are probably having the most critical problem because that's their livelihood, as well as those of us who are not driving for commercial sake but for important sake, to get to school, to get to work, to get to hospitals, to do all those things, we are very cognizant, as I know all of us are, of the strain that is being put on the consumers of our country.     
   Not only are they seeing an economic downturn, but at the same time that they are having reduced capacity to purchase things critical to them, gasoline and home heating oil are going up almost every week 5 to 10 cents. And so we are addressing that. We met with all the chairmen who reported out the energy bill last year and asked them to address this issue short term, medium term and long term.

   Mr. HOYER. One of the things I know I am personally for, and I think the Speaker is for that, as well, and we have urged the administration to take action, is not purchase additional oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time. I would be opposed to taking oil out of the reserve. But if we stop purchasing oil for a period of time, reduce our demand as we fill the SPR, not only will we reduce demand, economists tell us that would have an effect on price, perhaps about the same as the gasoline tax holiday that you refer to. 
   There are a number of pieces of legislation. Mr. Welch has a bill. Mr. Lampson has a bill. And many, many other Members have a bill. The administration, we believe, can do this on its own. We think that would be good policy while we have this crisis to stop filling up, not reducing, but to stop filling up our own reserve and reduce demand. Economists tell us that would have a positive effect on bringing prices down as well.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to say that both the Speaker and I believe that the administration, in reaching an agreement that you refer to, made a positive step in terms of incorporating within trade agreements a consideration of workers' rights and environmental concerns so that our manufacturers and our job producers in the United States had a fair, more level playing field in which to compete and that our workers were competing with workers who had the right to organize and were getting decent wages. 
   The Colombia agreement, as you know, was not sent down here after agreement between the administration and the House leadership. The response was to simply not take it off the agenda but take the time limit during which we might consider that. That was an interim step which did not, as the Speaker has pointed out, take Colombia off the agenda. It simply didn't put it on the agenda for immediate consideration. But that is still on the agenda. It is still available, a force, and it is still under discussion.

   Mr. HOYER. The gentleman is going to, I think, outline our understanding of the agreement. But the answer to your question is yes. Every earmark starting with Monday forward, obviously we know that these two bills are moving tonight, our agreement is that every earmark going forward will be included in the bills. 
   The only complication is both sides have recognized that on the Energy and Water bill, it is going to take a very substantial time, so that the earmarks that would otherwise be included in the Energy and Water bill will be included in a subsequent bill, to then be attached prior to the Energy and Water bill going to the Senate. But that will be open for full debate and amendment to remove those earmarks. 
   So the answer to your question is yes.

But we want to move the Energy and Water bill. It will not move out of this House. All of the earmarks that would be attached to that bill will be attached to another bill, will be listed, will have the author and the assertations and they will be subject to a vote on the House floor as any other. 
   So prospectively all 10 bills moving forward will have it. It is just that the Energy and Water will be not done together; they will be done separately.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman, first, for his comments. Secondly, I thank the gentleman for his question. I happen to believe, I want the gentleman to know, that the rule you were involved with that the minority leader and I have discussed is a good rule. It's a good rule because if something is dropped in conference that nobody knows about it, whatever it may be, I'm not going to mention any specific projects, but we've talked about some during the course of the last 2 days, we will in the rule provide for 10 minutes on each side. So, essentially, what we're doing is expanding under those circumstances by a third the time available for debate on a conference report. 
   So it is a pretty substantial extension of time. I think to the extent, again, the gentleman was involved, it's an appropriate extension of time so that we do ensure what all want to ensure and that projects that do not justify inclusion in bills and this House or the Senate rejects them or wants to reconsider them, that we have that opportunity. So the debate will be included in the rules recommendation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I join all 434 of my colleagues in rising to express our sorrow, our regret, our sympathy, yes, and in some respects our outrage that this calamity has been visited on so many of our promising and wonderful young people. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a grieving Nation tries to comprehend the senseless, horrific violence on the campus of Virginia Tech University on Monday, the full scope of this tragedy is only now beginning to come to light. Thirty-two innocent people, 32 young people of promise, some people not so young who were at great risk and survived, 32 people were stolen from their families and friends at the hand of a deeply disturbed young man who ended the carnage by taking his own life. More than two dozen others were injured during this random, murderous rampage. 
   Today, a profoundly saddened Nation recognizes that these were not mere strangers, although we may not have known the victims personally. They were members of our national family and in so many ways they were a reflection of us. They were hope for the future. They were brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers who were so full of life, hope and promise for a better future, for themselves, their families, their country and indeed the world. 
   Those slain included a 20-year-old political science major from Dumont, New Jersey, who attended Virginia Tech on an Air Force scholarship; an 18-year-old freshman from Centreville, Virginia who distinguished herself in drama and on Virginia Tech's dance team; a 22-year-old senior from Martinez, Georgia who was majoring in psychology, biology and English and who served as a role model for many; a 76-year-old engineering professor and Holocaust survivor who survived one of the worst terrorists and despots the world has ever seen, Adolf Hitler, to come home and to teach young people, to make them better able to meet the future and to have that ability robbed from him by a senseless act. And so many others, Mr. Speaker. 
   We may never know the answer to the question ``Why?'' Why have so many loving, promising people been taken through such senseless violence? However, let us mourn their loss and extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathy to their families and to their friends and to their fellow students. 
   Today, our thoughts and prayers are also with those who have been injured as well as Virginia Tech's students, faculty and staff, alumni and the entire campus community as they endeavor to cope with this monumental tragedy. Let us remind them they are not alone. Not only are they in our hearts but they will be in our prayers. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for giving me this time to join him and the Virginia delegation in recognizing the tragedy and reflecting our remembrance of those who have been hurt, those who have lost their lives, and those whom they left behind.

I will not ask for that unanimous consent because it has not been agreed to. And under our rules, I therefore am constrained to ask for the unanimous consent. 
   The Senate passed yesterday, by unanimous consent, without objection, obviously, by definition, the Transition Medical Assistance and Abstinence Education Program. That program is a program which provides for transitional medical assistance for those who transit from welfare to work. It's a very important program. It, unfortunately, expires on June 30. We will not  be here on June 30. This could have been passed, and I would hope would have been passed by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, that has not occurred, and therefore I will not be offering, as I said, such request. 
   I would say, however, that it will be our intention to offer this as soon as we return the first week that we're back. We believe this is very important to pass. And as a result, we will move it as quickly as we can. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this is indeed an important day for our country, for the House of Representatives, and for the American people. An important day because we focus on the protection that we owe to our people and to our country, not only from terrorists but from those who would undermine the Constitution of the United States. 
   Let me just briefly put in context where we are today some 7 years and 2 months after the start of this administration. From 2001 to 2006, the President of the United States did not veto a single bill. Why did he not veto a single bill? Because the Congress would not send him a bill that he did not want sent to him. It was a complacent, complicit Congress. And as a result of that complacency of the representatives of the American people, the administration came to believe that it could do anything it wanted without oversight or accountability. 
   And because of that, when we were put at risk by 9/11, the administration's response, perhaps led by the Vice President, was that we do not need to follow the law. There was a law in place. It's still in place. It still provides for the protection of the American people. It's called the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act. But as too often has been the case in this administration, they chose not to follow the law. They chose, instead, to follow their own predilections. And that's why we are here today. 
   In addition to that, we were in a condition where technology had changed. The administration was absolutely correct on that point. And both the Intelligence Committee in the Senate and the Intelligence Committee in the House knew they had to respond to that. As a matter of fact, Mr. Hoekstra and Ms. Harman, as the chairman and ranking member, and Mr. Goss prior to that, knew that we had to move towards that. That is now a result of the legislation we see before us. 
   My good friend and distinguished colleague, the former attorney general of the State of California who's been in this body for some years. He was here,  then he went back to California. He read from the letter of the attorneys general. One of them was Maryland. I talked to him yesterday. 
   Sometimes people put letters in front of us that are not accurate and we don't check all of the facts. I presume that the other attorneys general that were presented with this letter are in the same position. 
   Let me read from this letter: ``Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller authored S. 2248 to solve a critical problem that arose when the Protect America Act was allowed to lapse on February 16, 2008.'' Hopefully, everybody in this body knows that information is inaccurate. Senator Rockefeller started to draft his legislation, and the Senate Intelligence Committee, long before February of 2008, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Judiciary Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee, long before that ever happened. That information is inaccurate. I don't hold the attorneys general personally responsible for that inaccuracy. But I will tell you, my own attorney general, a signatory on this letter, had been misinformed. That's unfortunate. 
   I presume by the association, the overwhelming majority of these attorneys general are Republicans, but I don't think it was a partisan letter, per se, but it is shocking to me that an attorney general of a State in this country would say, ``whatever action is necessary to keep our citizens safe.'' There have been those down through history who, when we have been at risk, have said whatever action we take is justified, and the Constitution has suffered in that process. 
   We have a responsibility to do both, not just one. The attorneys general in their letter also said this: ``Intelligence officials must obtain FISA warrants every time they attempt to monitor suspected terrorists in overseas countries.'' That is categorically false. I do not believe that any one of the attorneys general that signed this letter believed it to be false, but it is wrong. They are misinformed. 
   We have an opportunity today to move this process forward to protect America and protect our Constitution. Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Intelligence Committee, a committee from the Senate, passed a bipartisan bill. And I am so interested to hear all of the Members on the Republican side talk about how a Senate, bipartisan-passed bill ought to pass this House. 
   My, my, my. If Congressman DeLay were here now, he would turn over in his seat. His premise was the Senate doggone well ought to pass House bills and not ask any questions. That was his position. He had no intent to pass, no matter how bipartisan a Senate bill was, Tom DeLay had no use for talking to Senate Republicans about what he ought to pass. 
   And by the way, if the President said pass it, if it was the Patients' Bill of Rights that he didn't want and it passed the Senate and the House, it didn't pass out of the conference committee because the President didn't want it. And by the way, on the prescription drug bill that a large number of your caucus was against, you passed anyway. It took you 3 hours to vote it, but you passed it. And so many of your Members came kicking and screaming to the final result and lament that vote this very day, and all of you on that side of the aisle know it. Not all of you, but a large number. 
   Our responsibility is not to take a Senate bill or a House bill at face value. It is to exercise our best judgment to serve the American people as best we can.     
   I will close with this: Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the committee, strong proponent of the bipartisan bill, said this on March 11, 2008, just a few days ago: 
   ``Today's House proposal reflects progress in bringing the two bills together, and it is a step in the right direction.'' He concluded his statement by saying this: ``As soon as the House sends us this new bill, we will once again roll up our sleeves and get back to work on a final compromise that the House, the Senate, and the White House can support.'' 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this House, that's what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they created the House of Representatives and the United States Senate and they gave to the President of the United States a role in the legislative process. We have an opportunity today to serve the protection of our country, the interception of communications dangerous to our people, and to uphold our oath to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States. Let us take that opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my extraordinarily generous friend from Michigan, for whom I have not only great respect but great affection as well. I want to thank him for his more than half a century of leadership on issues of health care in America, on extending health care and insurance to every American, to ensuring  that in this great country of ours every American has the opportunity to receive the extraordinary quality health care that we have available in this great country. 
   I also want to thank my good friend, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Charlie Rangel, who has for so many years fought the good fight. As he said on this floor, this is an opportunity for us to extend to children the benefits of health care. I want to mention the President's intent as well. 
   I want to thank my friend from California, Pete Stark, who has been the Chair of this subcommittee and who has been so faithful. 
   And I want to thank Mr. McCrery and the ranking member of this subcommittee. I understand we may have a difference of view, but we are working together now, as the American people expect us to do. 
   I said on this floor last night that we would have a robust debate on this important legislation, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. I think we have had that robust debate. 
   While we may disagree on elements of this bill, I believe that virtually all of us agree that it is unacceptable and, indeed, immoral that millions of children in the wealthiest Nation on the face of the Earth do not have health insurance. That is unlike every industrialized nation in the world, other than ourselves. 
   This historic legislation addresses this national challenge, building upon the successes of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which received strong bipartisan support in the Republican-led Congress in 1997 and which was signed into law by a Democratic President, President Clinton. 
   Under this bill, 11 million American children, six million who currently are covered under SCHIP and an additional five million children who currently lack health insurance, will have access to quality, affordable health insurance. It seems to me that is why so many of us serve in this body, to ensure that our people have that access. 
   Let us be clear. Contrary to the claims of some, including, sadly, at this point in time, President Bush, this legislation does not expand the SCHIP program. Let me repeat that. This legislation does not expand the SCHIP program. Instead, this legislation provides the resources needed to enroll children who are eligible under existing law but who are currently not enrolled. Let me reiterate. The CHAMP Act maintains current law regarding eligibility for SCHIP. 
   Furthermore, this legislation ensures seniors access to the doctors of their choice by stopping a scheduled 10 percent payment cut to doctors. It phases out overpayments to private plans. 
   My friends on the other side, of course, want to make sure that the government is very careful in its expenditure of funds, and it urges us to adopt the practices of the private sector, which are driven by competition on price. However, in this case, we have mandated by law that the competitors receive 100 percent reimbursement while the competitors that are favored receive 111 to 130-plus percent. That is a little bit like the prescription drug bill where we can't negotiate for price. 
   This bill maintains competition and access, and in so doing, the bill would extend Medicare solvency by 3 years, while protecting seniors and people from disabilities from having to pay higher monthly premiums. In addition, my friends, this bill improves Medicare by, among other things, providing new preventive benefits. 
   I must note, Mr. Speaker, that nearly 3 years ago, in the middle of a presidential campaign, President Bush said the following, and I quote. And this, by the way, was at the 2004 Republican national convention when President Bush was seeking the votes of Americans throughout this country to be reelected President. 
   This is what he said: ``America's children must have a healthy start in life,'' to which clearly all of us as we watched the television said, Amen. ``In a new term,'' he said, ``we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs.'' 
   Mr. President, that is what we are doing this afternoon. 
   But now, unfortunately, a mere 36 months later, the President is threatening to veto legislation that does precisely what he said he wanted to do in 2004 as he was running for President and seeking the votes in that convention. 
   Mr. Speaker, contrary to the claims of the President and other opponents of this bill, it does not constitute a government takeover of health care. That is a straw man. That is a shibboleth. That is not accurate. In fact, three-fourths of the children in the SCHIP program receive care today through private insurance plans that contract with the States. 
   Nor is the bill fiscally irresponsible. A curious claim, I would say, coming from the President and congressional Republicans whose policies added more than $3 trillion to the debt. I got a letter just a few days ago, maybe you got it as well, Mr. McCrery, from Secretary Paulson. He said, ``you know, we are running up against the debt limit.'' 
   Does anybody here know in the 4 years preceding this Bush administration's policies how many times we raised the debt? Not once. But we have raised it five times in the last 6 years, if we raise it again. 
   So when we talk about fiscal responsibility, it is fiscally responsible to invest in the health care of our children, because they will be healthier citizens, more productive citizens, and we will have a better, more economically viable country. In fact, the Democratic majority has taken pains to pay for this legislation and abide by pay-as-you-go budget rules which provided for 4 years of surplus immediately preceding this administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, the question before the Members of this body really is this: Do you support reauthorizing this critical program and providing health insurance to eligible children, eligible children, eligible children, or not? I urge my colleagues, vote to provide health care for our children. Vote to improve and protect Medicare. Vote for the CHAMP Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   As my friend from Wisconsin has heard me say so often, I am at once amused, and at the same time deeply disappointed because I have watched an unending series of young, earnest, very bright Republican leaders stand on this floor or stand in the OMB or in the White House, led by David Stockman, and then John Kasich, then Jim Nussle, and now PAUL RYAN, all very able representatives who served in this body, who come before us and assert, with a certitude that is unflappable, that they have the answer to bringing economic well-being to America. 
   During that 26 years that I have observed those serious, I believe, conscientious young men make that representation, without fail they have presented budgets that have put this country, without exception, every year of their budgets $4.1 trillion further in debt. And then they said in 1993, when we adopted an economic program sent down by President Clinton, ``this is going to destroy our country.'' They called it the largest tax increase in history. They were, of course, not telling the truth. That was not the fact. 
   In fact, the largest tax increase that has occurred in this country since I have been in Congress, in terms of real dollars, was the Dole-Reagan tax increase in the early 1980s. 
   So I come before this House to say I hope the American people will understand that the representation we have just heard has been made over and over and over again. And the results of the policies promoted by that rhetoric have been unending and inevitable large deficits. In fact, of course, the revenues are substantially below, as the gentleman knows, the projections that were made.     
   Mr. Speaker, today the Members of this House can proudly vote for a budget conference report that addresses our Nation's critical needs on national security, education, health care, the environment and many other areas, while also making a 180-degree turn away from the most reckless fiscal policies in the history of our Nation. 
   My young friend from Wisconsin knows well that spending over the last 6 years was twice the rate of spending in terms of percentage increase under the Clinton years. Twice. Of course, the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate and the presidency, and spending was at twice the rate of growth that it was during the Clinton years. 
   I urge every Member of this House, on both sides of the aisle, to vote for this responsible Democratic budget conference report. It will be a change from the past, because we will adopt a budget, and I say you are probably even going to adopt appropriations bills, unlike last year. 
   First and foremost, this Democratic budget provides robust defense spending levels, because our national security is our highest priority. This budget provides more homeland security funding than the Bush administration requested. It funds the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and it increases funding for veterans health care and services by $6.7 billion. 
   We talk about supporting our troops. If we support our troops, we need to honor our veterans, and we need to honor our veterans with more than just talk. We need to make sure that their health care is provided. This budget does that. In fact, this budget is $3.6 billion more than the President requested. Of course, he requested that before Walter Reed, before the long lines, before the American public was aware of how underfunded veterans health care is.  
   Furthermore, after 6 years of fiscal irresponsibility, this budget will bring our budget back into balance in 2012. President Reagan, President Bush I and the 7 years of Bush II, never one balanced budget year in those 19 years. During the Clinton administration, 4, half of the budget years had surpluses. 
   Now, the great falsehood, the great deceit, the great misrepresentation perpetrated by many of our friends on the other side of the aisle is that the budget somehow raises taxes. That is simply and absolutely untrue. 
   Now, the Republicans pride themselves on not raising taxes. They simply borrow money from the Chinese, the Japanese, the Saudis, the Germans. In fact, they borrowed over $1.2 trillion over the last 6 1/2 years to fund their spending increases. 
   It is somewhat humorous, I think, that our Republican friends are claiming that this budget raises taxes by failing to extend cuts that the Republicans themselves designed to expire in 2010. By their logic, last year, when the Republicans still controlled both Chambers of this Congress and chose not to extend the taxes, in your budget proposal, remember that, my friends on the other side of the aisle, you did not suggest extending these tax cuts. It is ridiculous. 
   Don't take it from me, just listen to the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, which yesterday stated, ``The budget conference report would not raise taxes. If anything, the budget resolution assumes that Congress will cut taxes.'' 
   This is true. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the budget accommodates the extension of middle income tax cuts, as the chairman has said, and provides immediate relief for middle income taxpayers affected by the Alternative Minimum Tax. We want to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax. In fact we want to fix it by giving 81 million Americans a tax cut. 
   In addition, this budget increases funding for Head Start, LIHEAP, accommodates a $50 billion increase to cover millions of uninsured children, and rejects the administration's harmful cuts to environmental programs. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, for our friends on the other side to complain that this budget provides for an increase in the debt ceiling strains credibility. The rule that is in this bill was in your budgets repeatedly. 
   In just 6 years, this administration and Republican Congress turned a projected budget surplus of $5.6 trillion into an over $3 trillion deficit, an $8.6 trillion turnaround to the red side of the budget on your watch when you controlled all of the levers of this House. And you raised the debt ceiling 4 years in a row. 
   The new Democratic majorities in this Congress have inherited a fiscal debacle that today, through this conference report, we can begin to address and make right. This is a budget that we can be proud of, and it stands in stark contrast to the extraordinarily irresponsible policies of the last 6 years. 
   I urge all of my colleagues, vote for fiscal responsibility and a brighter future for our children and for our country. Vote for this Democratic budget.

If the gentleman would yield, I am not sure I am accurate because when you say come before the House again, what we will do is take  the Senate bill from the desk, substitute the House language, ask for a conference, move to go to conference, and then you will have in order your motion to instruct conferees. To that extent, the bill will come before us, but only to that extent. In other words, the budget that was passed by the House, we will take the Senate bill from the floor, substitute the House language. 
   The reason we need a rule, frankly, is we asked unanimous consent to do that procedure, a unanimous consent which we had given to you in 2003 and 2005. For whatever reasons, it was not your personal determination, but it was the determination of your side not to give unanimous consent for that purpose. Therefore, in order to effect that objective, we need to pass a rule to allow us to do that which is what we will do Monday night.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this will be one of the serious votes that we cast during this session. This will be a vote on whether or not we are going to allow bigotry to manifest itself in hate and result in violence. 
   My friend, Artur Davis, rose and he said he didn't know anybody of faith who recommended violence. I would suggest that tragically the citizens of the United States know all too well some who claim to be men of faith and who have issued fatwas to kill those not of their faith, and that if they do so, Allah will reward them. We call them terrorists. They kill not because of individual wrongdoing or individual action. They kill because of the membership in a faith or a race or a nationality, because perhaps we are Christian or we are Jews or we are Americans. And we call them terrorists. 
   This is an important vote. Neither the exercise of bigotry nor the rationalization of bigotry ought to be sanctioned in this great House, but we know through the centuries it has been. We know there were those who in times past rose on this floor and rationalized slavery and rationalized why we should not have antilynching laws in America. We know that. We lament it, and we say to ourselves had we  lived in those times, had we lived in the 18th century, hopefully we would have been beyond our time, or in the 19th century hopefully beyond our time, or in the 20th century hopefully beyond our time, as Martin Luther King, Jr., urged us to be. 
   We serve now in the 21st century, and we know that there are those in America and throughout the world who preach hate against a class of people not because of their actions, not because of their character, but because of who they are. That is what this vote is about today. 
   Through this legislation, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Members of this body will make a strong statement in favor of values that unite us as Americans: tolerance, respect for our differences, and justice and accountability for those who perpetrate violent acts against others. 
   It has been too recent that lynching was rationalized in our country. It is too present in today's society that some across the sea and, yes, some here rationalize violence because of membership in another class different than they. It is long past time to bring the existing Federal hate crimes law, which was enacted nearly 40 years ago, into the 21st century. Under existing law, Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes is limited to those acts directed at individuals on the basis of race, religion, color, or national origin. 
   Let me say something about that to my friends. We have come to accept in America in the 21st century that it is not respectable nor acceptable to be bigoted against those who are black, be bigoted against those who are women, be bigoted against those who are Catholic or Baptist or Jews or Muslims. It is not respectable. It is not acceptable. You don't talk about that in the restaurant anymore. 
   But there is a class in America that is still respectable, rationalized many times by faith. But then segregation was rationalized for faith-based reasons. 
   My friends, this is an important vote of conscience, of a statement of what America is, a society that understands that we accept differences. We may not agree with those differences, but we know if society is to be free that we must accept differences.     
   That is the bedrock of what America means, not just to us, but to all the world. 
   And so today, my friends, I say we have an important statement to make, not a bill to pass, but a statement to make about the values of our country. 
   I had a prepared statement here, I won't read the balance of it. But I hope that every Member has the courage and the perspective, that when they rise from their bed 20 years from now, they will be able to say, unlike some of our predecessors in centuries past who failed the test of tolerance, to say that we had the courage to live out the principles that makes America such a wonderful, great, decent and just Nation. 
   Vote for this bill. Vote for our principles. Vote for your faith that teaches that we reach out to lift up and to love. Vote for this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, today, through this legislation--``The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act''--the Members of this body will make a strong statement in favor of values that unite us as Americans: tolerance, respect for our differences, and justice and accountability for those who perpetrate violent acts against others. 
   It is long past time to bring the existing Federal hate crimes law, which was enacted nearly 40 years ago, into the 21st century. 
   Under existing law, Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes is limited to those acts directed at individuals on the basis of race, religion, color or national origin and only when the victim is targeted because he or she is engaged in a Federally protected activity, such as voting. 
   This legislation broadens this provision to cover all violent crimes motivated by race, religion, or national origin, when the defendant causes bodily injury or attempts to cause bodily injury. 
   Furthermore, the bill expands current law to prohibit the same conduct, if such conduct is motivated on the basis of the victim's gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. 
   Mr. Speaker, the fact is, the Federal Government has long had a history of combating crimes based on prejudice. 
   This bill simply expands the current law to groups that historically have been affected by violence and thus it responds to the reality in America today. 
   According to the FBI, race ranks first among motivations for hate crimes and sexual orientation ranks second among the reasons that people are targeted. 
   Some people ask: Why is this legislation even necessary? 
   To them, I answer: because brutal hate crimes motivated by race, religion, national orgin, gender, sexual orientation and identity or disability not only injure individual victims, but also terrorize entire segments of our population and tear at our Nation's social fabric. 
   Let us be clear: This legislation does not affect free speech, or punish beliefs or thoughts. It only seeks to punish violent acts. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, this bill would allow the Federal Government to provide assistance to State and local law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute hate crimes, and would clarify the conditions under which such crimes could be federally investigated and prosecuted. 
   Enacting these important additions to current law will send a very powerful message that crimes committed against any American--just because of who he or she is--are absolutely unacceptable. 
   Not surprisingly, this legislation is supported by 31 State attorneys general, and more than 280 national law enforcement, professional, education, civil rights, religious and civic organizations, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys Association and the National Sheriffs Association. 
   I urge my colleagues: Vote for this legislation, not only because it is important and necessary but also because it is the right thing to do.

   This motion, my colleagues, reeks with the stench of cynicism. Let me tell you why. The distinguished chairman rose and asked for unanimous consent to add the protections to members of our Armed Forces who are either serving or have served, and he then asked to protect our senior citizens. He  asked for unanimous consent to do that, and the gentleman from Texas objected, so it was not added. 
   Then the chairman rose and asked that we substitute ``forthwith'' for ``promptly'' so their amendment could be immediately adopted, and the gentleman from Texas objected. 
   How cynical can you be to offer an amendment, I tell my friend, which in its own framework will kill the very proposition you are making? For if this amendment prevails, what will happen is, the bill will be killed and the protection of the Armed Forces that he seeks, the protection of the seniors that he seeks, will be killed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me comment on the ranking member's observation about political posturing. 
   First, let me say I wonder what the President was doing standing in front of that sign saying ``Mission Accomplished'' on that aircraft carrier with taxpayers' dollars. Let me suggest to you that he was politically posturing, trying to take credit for a great victory that occurred 4 years ago. No one in America believes that the mission has been accomplished. No one in America thinks we have had a success. 
   Let me say that it was totally appropriate for the Speaker and for the majority leader in the United States Senate to sign a bill and let the public know that this is what the Congress believes. 
   My friend may think political posturing is taking responsibility, which is our constitutional duty, as opposed to simply rubber-stamping what the President wants done. There has not been any question asked for the last 4 years by this Congress. There has not been any interposition of a correct policy as opposed to the President's failed policy. 
   We don't see that as political posturing, I tell my friend--we see it as exercising the constitutional duty that the American public expects us to do as their independent representative. 
   This is only the second veto. Why is it only the second veto? Because you wouldn't pass anything the President didn't want. That is not the role of the Congress of the United States. The role of the Congress of the United States is to make policy. That is what article I says. That is what we are doing. 
   Mr. Speaker, regrettably, the President has chosen not to follow the will of the American people and bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate by vetoing legislation that fully funds our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, that holds the Iraqis accountable for making progress, and that calls for a responsible redeployment of American forces who are mired in a civil war. 
   It is our duty now as the elected representatives of the people to try to override the President's veto even though we may not succeed, and even as we prepare to meet with the President today to discuss next steps. That is our responsibility. We intend to do it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe our President, who was wrong 4 years ago when he stood under a banner announcing ``Mission Accomplished,'' is wrong again. The escalation of American troops in Iraq does not represent a change in this administration's failed policy. In fact, it is the fourth time we have escalated troops. In fact, it has been tried, unsuccessfully. 
   The President's claim last night that ``We've begun to see some important results'' is unfortunately contradicted by the facts. I wish it were true. I want to succeed in this effort, although what success is is ill-defined or not defined by the President. 
   In fact, Iraq is wracked by violence, including massive car bombs, almost daily. The U.S. death toll in April of 104 made last month the deadliest of the year and the sixth most lethal month since the war started, notwithstanding this increase in troop presence. 
   Senator Hagel, who recently returned from Iraq, stated: ``This thing is coming undone quickly, and the Maliki government is weaker by the day.'' 
   And the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction just reported: ``The U.S. project to rebuild Iraq remains far short of its targets, leaving the country plagued by power outages, inadequate oil production and shortages of clean water and health care.'' 
   I suggest to my friend, in that context, the Congress ought to be impacting on the policies that are being pursued that are not succeeding. 
   Finally, let me say, and I call the attention of my friend, the ranking member, to this because he referenced this. The President's claim last night that this legislation ``substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders'' is totally inaccurate. 
   But let me tell you what is not inaccurate is that our military commanders have made none of the decisions on the policies we have been pursuing in Iraq, and that is the tragedy. The decisions have been made not by military men and women, but by the President, by Mr. Cheney, by Mr. Rumsfeld, by Mr. Wolfowitz, and, yes, by Mr. Bremer. 
   We have seen nothing, I tell my friend, but a series of political decisions made on this war over the last 4-plus years; would that it have been otherwise. We do not seek to micromanage our military, which has done everything we have asked of them. Rather, we do continue to question the decisions of top administration officials, including, yes, the President,  whose judgments regarding this war have proved repeatedly, almost without exception, wrong. 
   Indeed, it is ironic that the President makes this claim when, in fact, we are mired in Iraq, because politicians who I have just referenced made decisions that prove to be wrong and did not lead to success. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress must not continue to simply rubber-stamp this administration's request. Our Founding Fathers did not think that was our role. They thought our role was to make independent judgments on the people's behalf and have the courage to pass legislation reflecting that judgment. 
   This legislation responds to the will of the American people and sets forth a policy to take us in a new direction that requires Iraqi responsibility and the pursuit of the political solution that General Petraeus and the Iraq Study Group say was essential if we were going to succeed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle: Listen to the American people, fully fund our troops, hold the Iraqis accountable, support responsible redeployment of American troops. Vote to override this veto.

   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension. There will be no votes, however, until 6:30. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 for morning hour business and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of the suspension bills for the week will be announced later this week. 
   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10. In addition to suspension bills, we will consider H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act. Now, because we have come to a point where, as you know, the committees have just recently been fully organized, they are starting to have hearings but because we have not produced as much legislation, we have been dealing with a lot of work so far, I know the gentleman will be upset and my colleagues will be upset that they will have to work at home on Friday. 
   I want to reiterate that. When Members are home, they are working. They are listening to their constituents. They are having town meetings. They are attending meetings. They are attending the chamber of commerce or the Lion's Club or the Rotary or the PTA. 
   So that, although we will not be here on Friday, I want to assure the public that I know, I know that Mr. Blunt knows and every Member here knows that when they are not here, they are in their home, they are working on behalf of their constituents. So we will not be here on Friday as scheduled because the flow of work will not be ready for Friday that we can go through the regular order. 
   As I have told the gentleman and his colleagues, we really do want to get to the regular order so that there are opportunities to consider bills in committees, report them through the Rules Committee, amend them on the floor and proceed as both sides, I think, would like.

   Mr. HOYER. I will say to my friend this is such a difficult process on this side of the aisle. We considered last week a piece of legislation, and one of your Members went to the Rules Committee and asked for an amendment. We gave him an amendment, and then he wrote, apparently, and it caused a great deal of controversy, that we allowed the amendment and he really didn't want the amendment. 
   So then we came to the floor with the amendment still allowed. Of course, he didn't have to offer it. Nobody was forcing him to offer it. But there was great consternation that we had allowed the amendment and, indeed, a substitute, which you apparently didn't want either. So it is very difficult for us. Now we bring a bill that has an open rule and it is so lacking in controversy that it ought to be perhaps a closed rule or a suspension. 
   We will try to figure out what you really want, and when we do, we will try to do something that pleases you. We are having difficulty so far.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from California. Of course, the gentleman to which he refers, as he knows, voted for the rule. In addition, as the gentleman knows, we gave your side the opportunity to have unanimous consent to amend the rule. You chose not to ask for that. We would not have objected to it. It gives us both good talking points, I suppose, but I think the point of this whole discussion is we want to get beyond talking points. 
   I say to my friend, and everybody in this House knows that Roy Blunt and Steny Hoyer are good friends who spend time together and respect one another, like one another. It is very difficult, I know, having been in your position for 4 years, not to take the opportunity to express grievances about what you believe is not being done that is fair to particularly the minority side. I understand that. 
   I simply want to say that we intend, as we have said, and one of the reasons we are not meeting Friday is because we have told committees we want them to do the regular order, have hearings, have votes in committee, bring bills to the Rules Committee, allow amendments, and as a result, they have said that is going to take us a little more time. So we do not have work to do. And we are not going to hold Members here, as Roy Blunt and I have discussed, if we don't have work to do. But we are going to try to get to substance. 
   I will say, for instance, on today's bill, we were very pleased that 57 Members on your side of the aisle voted with us on this. It was not a bipartisan two or three or four or five or six Members. A quarter of your caucus, indeed over a quarter of your caucus, voted for this bill. It was a bill that we needed to get through on substance. We think that speaks well for the substance, and that is what we are really talking about. We want to get to substance in a fair way. And we want to work with you, Mr. Dreier. 
   Certainly, I want to work with my good friend, the Republican whip, who is, I think, very sincere in his desire to make sure that we have legislation move through this body in a way that all the participants can feel they got a fair shot, whether they win or lose. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Certainly, those dollars which are allocated in contemplation of the administrative officer having an ability after a change, obviously, in management, if you will, to some degree, to have some flexibility, and as they plan, we will have a better idea of how they are going to spend that money, which will obviously have to be approved in the funding resolution out of House Administration, brought to this floor and voted upon by the Members. But certainly, parts of that fund would be available if the House decided to create a committee. You refer to the Select Committee on, I am sure, Energy.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't know that that refers to all the money. That probably would not be accurate. And if I go further than I have already gone, I may be incorrect, and I don't want to misinform either you or the body because I have not talked to either House Administration or to Mr. Obey about the specific allocation of these funds. Obviously, if the CR passes, they are appropriated to this fund for the CAO under the language that you read subject to the Appropriations Committee's approval.     
   However, in terms of the select committee or committee, my expectation would be that that specific item, not necessarily other items, would be subject to the funding resolution out of House Administration and come to this body.

   Mr. HOYER. Well, if it is included in the House Administration funding resolution, and I am not saying that it will be, it may be in some other vehicle. But, if it did, that usually comes middle of March, late March, so that the committees can have a sense of what their funding capabilities are.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't think I said a time on Thursday. As you know as well, perhaps better than I do over the last years, particularly as you were the leader, you cannot always predict the time frame. But I would hope on Thursday we would get out at a reasonable hour to facilitate Members returning home.

   Mr. HOYER. I want to have Members be very clear. If we are able to do our work within the time frame of Thursday, it may well be a late Thursday. When I say late, 5, 6, 7 o'clock Thursday, as opposed to 1 or 2 o'clock. So I maybe answered too quickly on the Friday schedule. Because on Friday we very definitely will be trying to get out, as I have said, no later than 2 o'clock and as close to 1 as we can. That gives us 4 hours. As you know, we have agreed that we will go in at 9. So that gives us 4 hours of legislative time to work on Fridays. 
   Committees, as I might tell my friend, you might be interested, the Government Operations Committee will be having hearings on Friday of next week, notwithstanding the fact that we are not here. So not only are they working at home, but there also will be people working here in Washington, notwithstanding the fact that we are not on the floor.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't want to prolong this, but I do want to say that the gentleman is correct in terms of, that is why I answered glibly and quickly. So I think the gentleman may be correct. I don't want to pledge that, but he may be correct because of the factors that he has pointed out. 
   I would say, in closing, that I know there has been some, joviality is a kind word, about what Mr. Dreier mentioned in the schedule getting out at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. 
   But I will say with all due respect to my friend, notwithstanding that joviality, we believe that the last 3 weeks in terms of what this House has done in terms of its ethical standards, in terms of dealing with the safety of Americans in the 9/11 bill, in terms of dealing with the minimum wage, energy, dealing with college costs, dealing with prescription drugs and dealing with stem cell research, dealing with passing a CR that has funding for work that sat on the tarmac, if you will, and never got off the ground to the President for approximately 14 months or 13 months. We believe that we have provided a schedule in which we have done very substantial work. We hope the American people are pleased with that, and we continue to try to do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mr. Obey, who was the ranking member in the last Congress, and who worked with Mr. Lewis to try to pass our appropriation bills and, in fact, we passed all but one of the appropriation bills. Unfortunately, we reported the Labor Health bill, which is the largest bill, other than the Defense bill, in June, and it failed to ever get to the floor of this House because it included minimum wage, and that was not favored by the majority. 
   Now that we are in the majority, we are left with unfinished business. The gentlelady from Virginia mentions cutting something. We haven't cut anything. As a matter of fact, we have added $1 billion. 
   If you had passed your appropriation bills, you may have been able to fund at appropriate levels. But you did not pass your appropriation bills. Yet, we hear on the floor today constant complaining from the other side of the aisle that they don't like the way we fixed their failures. 
   Well, very frankly, I think the American public will. First of all, the American public will be pleased that we are acting, that we are moving on this legislation, which is, essentially, the funding of 9 appropriation bills that failed to move through the House of Representatives and the Senate and to the President as they should have. 
   Mr. Obey has worked very hard with Senator Byrd. I know Mr. Lewis' staff has been very engaged in this as well. I know the Senate staff has been engaged in it. And I am hopeful that this bill will not only pass this House with a very handy vote. 
   There are many people in this House, on the Republican side of the aisle who asked to achieve exactly what Mr. Obey has achieved in this bill. He has taken care of the veterans. He has taken care of veterans health. He has taken care of, for the first time in 4 years, trying to get college students Pell Grants that will give them some additional help to fund their college costs. When we had that vote on the floor of this House, we had 124 Republicans join us in that vote. This is one additional step in trying to get college students a more affordable education. 
   Mr. Obey has moved in a number of areas to make our investments more productive and a better return for the American people. And this bill will provide for getting last year's business done that was left undone, so that we can move on to have what Mr. Wamp wants, and I want, and Mr. Obey wants and Mr. Lewis wants. That is, full and open discussion of the bills in subcommittee, in the full committee and on this floor. I think that is what we will have. 
   But ladies and gentlemen of this House, we need to complete last year's undone business. It wasn't our fault that it was not done. But whoever's  fault it was, it is not useful to say that it is your fault or my fault or somebody else's fault. It is useful to say we need to move forward. We need to fund government services. We need to fund the priorities of the American people. That is what this continuing resolution does. 
   I congratulate Mr. Obey, and I urge all of our colleagues to support this bill so we can finally, one-third of the way into the fiscal year, finally do what we should have done by September 30 of 2006.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments, but I want to say, first of all, when he talks about $463 billion, I read in the newspaper today where OMB was very pleased that we stayed within the caps imposed by the Republican-passed budget. We took the Republican-passed budget, we took those numbers, we stayed within those caps. That is exactly what you did, Mr. Lewis, when you were chairman of the committee because that was the direction from the Budget Committee. I am understanding that the White House even said that they were pleased with the fact that we stayed within the numbers when you talk about spending. 
   Secondly, let me say that you and I both served on the Appropriations Committee for a long period of time. In recent years, of course, we have not passed all the appropriation bills in the calendar year, much less the fiscal year, and we would pass omnibus appropriation bills with hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars larger than this bill. One was passed January 31, the other was passed February 5. They were passed as conference reports with 1 hour of debate and no amendments, in which substantial legislative language had been added in conference and not vetted on this floor or in committee. 
   I understand the gentleman's representations, but he and I have been here a long time and we have a long history of knowing what has transpired in the past. This is a process that was required by the failure of the last Congress to do its work. It has been done in a way that tries to get it done so that we can get on to do exactly what the gentleman wants for the 2008 bills, give them a full airing, full hearings. And I predict to my distinguished and very close friend, Mr. Lewis, we are going to have a lot more hearings as we did when we were in charge, we had more hearings than we have had. 
   We are going to have oversight, and we are going to have careful scrutiny of the taxpayers' dollars. And I look forward to joining my friend in that process in the regular order. We are doing this so that we can get on to that process to do exactly what the gentleman suggests because it is the right thing to do. And I look forward to working with him on that process.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for his remarks. And I thank Mr. McKeon for his leadership and willingness to work together on a difficult issue. 
   I certainly want to acknowledge and thank my friend Jim Sensenbrenner, Congressman Sensenbrenner, who has been chairman of the committee, the Judiciary Committee, who has been a leader in this Congress, and his wife, Cheryl. Cheryl, like the young man we just saw speak, Congressman Jim Langevin, has shown great courage, but also has shown that disability is not disabling; that we ought to look at the ability people have, what they can do, not what they can't do. All of us can't do certain things. I urge people to look at what people can do. And that's what this bill was about in 1990. That's what this bill is about today. 
   And I am very pleased to be here to speak on behalf of this bill. I think this bill may well pass unanimously, and the public might conclude, therefore, that this was not contentious and difficult, it was both--not contentious in terms of enabling those with disabilities to be fully included in our society, but how to do that; how to do that in the context of making sure that the business community could live with this, that the disabilities community could live with this, and that we did, in fact, accomplish the objectives that we intended. 
   I want to thank as well the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups who came together with the disabilities community with a common objective. Randy Johnson worked on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. And Randy Johnson, at a press conference that was held when the Senate passed this bill just a few days ago, said that he was a staffer here in 1988 and '89 and '90 when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. And he made the observation that--he sat on the floor, he worked with the leadership on the Republican side and the Democratic side, worked particularly with my friend, Steve Bartlett, Congressman Steve Bartlett from Texas, who was intimately involved in fashioning and working out the compromises necessary to overwhelmingly pass the ADA in 1990. And he said it was clear then that the intent of Congress had been misconstrued by the Supreme Court--this is Randy Johnson, Republican staffer, leader now in the Chamber of Commerce of the United States who helped fashion this bill. And this bill really says, yes, we agree with that in a bipartisan way. The Supreme Court misinterpreted what our intent was. And our intent was to be inclusive. 
   Civil rights bills are intended to be interpreted broadly. Why? Because we want to make sure that every American has the benefits that America has to offer, the opportunities that America has to offer, and to empower them to help America be a better country, to bring their talents and their skills and their motivation to bear in the public and private sectors. 
   I want to thank as well Nancy Zirkin, Andy Imperato, my--as I call him my lawyer, Chai Feldblum, who has worked so hard on this for now 20-plus years. It's been 18 years since we passed the ADA, but as Mr. Miller knows, it's been 20-plus years--25 years really--that we've been working on getting to this point. 
   I also want to thank Mike Peterson of H.R. Policy and Jerry Gillespie of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
   There are so many people that I could spend the next 5 or 10 minutes mentioning just name after name after name who made this happen. I won't do that, not to diminish them in any way, but to say that this is the result of the efforts of many--not of me, but of many; not of Mr. Miller alone or the ranking member alone or Mr. Sensenbrenner, but many dedicated to this cause. 
   We are here to build on the accomplishments of the landmark Disabilities Act of 1990. We wouldn't be here at all, however, without the hard work, frankly, of a very close friend of mine, former Member of Congress, Tony Coelho. Tony Coelho had a vision. Tony Coelho suffers from epilepsy. There is nobody who knows Tony Coelho that thinks he is not able to do anything, everything, and all things. Tony Coelho empowered all of us to think larger, to understand how to bring about real change for those with disabilities. 
   Tony Coelho, an epileptic, was asked to leave the seminary because he had epilepsy because the church concluded he really couldn't do the job. It was the church's loss and our gain. He made a tremendous contribution to this institution. But much more importantly, in  the last some 20 years that he has not been a Member of this institution he continued to make an extraordinary contribution, not just to those with disabilities, but to our society, in expanding our consciousness and inclusion. 
   And I mention his name, but I also want to thank my friend, Steve Bartlett. Steve Bartlett, Congressman, then the Mayor of Dallas, now in the private sector, but engaged in the eighties and nineties and engaged in the passage of this bill today, was extraordinarily helpful to us. In 1990, the original ADA was the product of the vision of so many. 
   I also want to thank my former staffer, Melissa Schulman, who worked indefatigably as we passed the ADA in 1990. 
   When the first President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act 18 years ago, America became the world's leader on this central test of human rights. The ADA was a project in keeping with our oldest principles and founding ideals. As President Bush the first, as I call him, put it at the signing ceremony, and I quote, ``Today's legislation,'' he said, ``brings us closer to that day when no Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' 
   Thanks to the ADA, that day became closer on July 26, 1990. Thanks to the passage of this bill today and the signatures Mr. Miller indicated next week, and the expected signatures of the President, with hopefully the first President Bush present, tens of millions of Americans with disabilities will now enjoy even fuller rights, and the rights that we intended them to enjoy when we passed the ADA--the right to use the same streets, theaters, restrooms or offices, the right to prove themselves in the workplace, to succeed on their talent and drive alone. 
   We've accomplished much in terms of public accommodations, in terms of reasonable accommodations. I was sitting there with Michele Stockwell, my policy director, as we watched Jim Langevin give his speech. What a wonderful accommodation he has in that chair that stands up. Weren't all of you impressed when he said, ``I rise to support this legislation?'' ``I rise.'' And he does rise. Why? Because he has a reasonable accommodation which, notwithstanding the failure of his legs to work the way he would like them to work, his chair reasonably accommodates and has him rise to speak to this body as a testimony to the consciousness of having been raised to make sure that a person like Jim Langevin--of great ability, of great ability, not disability, but of great ability--can come here, having been shot at the age of 16 inadvertently, by accident, disabled, graduated from high school, graduated from college, elected to the Rhode Island House, elected to Secretary of State of his State, and now a Member of this body. What a testimony to making sure that we made sure Jim Langevin could get through the door; we made sure JIM LANGEVIN could get the kind of education he wanted and have access to that education. What a testimony to what this Congress has done, but more importantly, what so many courageous people with a disability have shown us all, that a disability is not disabling. It may rob us of a single or maybe even multiple ways that some people do things, but not of all things. 
   Sadly, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision, we have yet to live up to our promise fully. That's what we're trying to do today. We've made progress on access, we've made progress on listening devices, a lot of progress. One of the places we haven't made the progress we wanted to was employment. So many people want to work, want to be self-sufficient, want to be enterprising, want to have the self-respect of earning their own way, but have been shut out. And the Supreme Court didn't help us. That's what this bill is about. 
   Over the last 18 years, the Court has chipped away at that promise and at Congress' clear original intent. We said we wanted broad coverage for people with disabilities and people regarded as disabled. Important phrase, ``regarded as disabled.'' What the Supreme Court really said, well, if you can make sure that your disability does not disable you. Tony Coelho takes medicine for his epilepsy, and so he functions. And if you saw him, you would say he's functioning fine. But if I said, but I won't hire you, Tony, because you have epilepsy, the Court said that was okay. Nobody on this floor believed that was the case. If he was discriminated against because he had a disability but could do the job, we said that's wrong. The Court did not agree with us, and we're now changing that and making sure that our intent will be lived out. 
   We never expected that the people with disabilities who work to mitigate their conditions would have their efforts held against them, but the courts did exactly that. Those narrow rulings, which will be changed by this legislation, have closed the door of opportunity for millions of Americans. We're here today to bring those millions of our fellow citizens back to where they belong--where we want them, where we need them, under the protection of the ADA. 
   By voting for final passage of the ADA Amendment Act, we ensure that the definition of disability will henceforth be construed broadly and fairly. We make it clear that those who manage to mitigate their disabilities can still be subject to discrimination; we know that intuitively and practically. This legislation says we know it legislatively. And we recognize that those regarded as having a disability are equally at risk and deserve to be equally protected.     
   This bill, which was approved by the Senate last week unanimously, has come so close to a signature thanks to the tireless work of the members of the disability community, leaders from both parties and business groups, a coalition as broad and deep as the one that created the original ADA. 
   I want to recognize the cosponsor of this bill, as I said earlier, JIM SENSENBRENNER, tireless in his advocacy, and his wife, Cheryl. I want to thank my good friend Tony Coelho. As I said at a press conference last week, I have served in the Congress for 28 years. There will be a time when I will retire. And I will look back on my career. And one of the proudest achievements I will have is the work that I have done at Tony's insistence and request on behalf of the Americans with Disabilities Act and those who are challenged by being shut out of our society. 
   Finally, it is my honor to dedicate this bill to a pioneering disability advocate and an inspiration behind the ADA. He is listening to us. He died some years ago. His name was Justin Dart. Justin Dart, like JIM LANGEVIN, was in a wheelchair. It didn't disable him. Indeed, it empowered him. It empowered him to educate all of us. It empowered him to educate those with disabilities as to what they could do and accomplish by their efforts to join together, to educate us and to educate the country. His bride, Yoshiko Dart, carries on that torch. 
   When Justin Dart spoke last that I heard him at the White House, he said I may not be with you for a long time. But I want you to keep on keeping on. Justin, that is what we do today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, Mr. SENSENBRENNER and I submit the following regarding S. 3406:   
   For over a decade, courts have narrowed the scope of the ADA and have thereby excluded many individuals whom Congress intended to cover under the law. The unfortunate impact of too narrow an interpretation has been to erode the promise of the ADA. 
   With the passage of the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) today, we ensure that the ADA's promise for people with disabilities will be finally fulfilled. Our expectation is that this law will afford people with disabilities the freedom to participate in our community, free from discrimination and its segregating effects, that we sought to achieve with the original ADA. 
   The House of Representatives passed the ADA Amendments Act, H.R. 3195, on June 25, 2008, by an overwhelming vote of 402-17. The purpose of this legislation was to restore the intent of Congress to cover a broad group of individuals with disabilities under the ADA and to eliminate the problem of courts focusing too heavily on whether individuals were covered by the law rather than on whether discrimination occurred. 
   That commitment has now been echoed by passage in the Senate of the ADA Amendments Act, S. 3406, by unanimous consent. We welcome the opportunity to pass today the version of the ADA Amendments Act passed by the Senate, here in the chamber where it began its journey on July 26th, 2007. 
   We are particularly pleased with the alliance of business and disability representatives who came together to work with us on this bill and support its passage throughout both houses of Congress. Last January, we personally encouraged these groups to work together to reach an agreement that would work well for both people with disabilities and for entities covered under the law. We are pleased that they have been able to do so throughout this bill's legislative process. 
   H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act passed by the House, and S. 3406, the ADA Amendments Act passed by the Senate, are identical in most important respects. 
   Both H.R. 3195 and S. 3406 contain identical language concerning mitigating measures, episodic conditions, major life activities including major bodily functions, treatment of claims under the ``regarded as'' prong, ensuring regulatory authority over the definition of disability, and conforming Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to be consistent with the changes made by the ADAAA. 
   Hence, the Report of the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary, as well as our Joint Statement introduced into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on June 25, 2008, continue to accurately convey our intent with regard to the bill we are passing today. 
   While the intent is the same, as discussed more fully below, S. 3406 takes a slightly different approach than H.R. 3195. Consequently, we want to make it clear that where the House Committee Reports and our joint statement used the term ``materially restricts'' to establish points in various examples, those examples should be read to convey the same points, and the term ``materially restricts'' should be understood to refer to the less demanding standard for the term ``substantially limits'' prescribed by both H.R. 3195 and S. 3406. For example, the statement in the House Education and Labor Report that ``the Committee expects that a plaintiff such as Littleton could provide evidence of material restriction in the major life activities of thinking, learning, communicating and interacting with others'' should be understood to mean that the Committee expects that a plaintiff such as Littleton could provide evidence of substantial limitation in thinking, communicating and interacting with others. (See Littleton v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 231 Fed. Appx. 874 (11th Cir. 2007)). 
   The key difference between the two bills is that S. 3406 uses a different means to achieve  the same goal that we achieved with H.R. 3195. As we explain below, we are comfortable accepting this approach. 
   In H.R. 3195, we achieved this goal by redefining the term ``substantially limits'' to mean ``materially restricts'' in order to indicate to the courts that they had incorrectly interpreted the term ``substantially limits'' in Toyota Motor Mfg. of Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, and to convey to the courts our expectation that they would apply a less demanding standard of severity than had been applied by the Supreme Court. 
   Our colleagues in the Senate, however, were uncomfortable with creating a new term in the statute. Hence, they achieved the same goal through a different means. 
   Instead of redefining the term ``substantially limits,'' S. 3406 states that such term ``shall be interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes'' of the ADA Amendments Act. This is a textual provision that will legally guide the agencies and courts in properly interpreting the term ``substantially limits.'' With regard to the findings and purposes that the textual provision requires the agencies and court to use, S. 3406 incorporates all of the findings and purposes of H.R. 3195, including statements that Congress intended for the ADA to provide broad coverage and that this legislation rejects the Supreme Court's decisions in Sutton and Williams that inappropriately narrowed the scope of protection of the ADA. 
   In order to explain how it intended the definition of ``substantially limits'' to be interpreted, the Senate added findings which highlighted the fact that the Williams decision placed a too high threshold on the definition of substantially limits and that the EEOC's interpretative regulations were similarly drafted or interpreted to create a burden not contemplated by the Congress. Consistent with these findings, the Senate added two purposes which directed the EEOC to amend its regulations to reflect the purposes of the ADA as amended by the ADAAA and which noted that the thrust of ADA inquiry should be directed to the compliance obligations of the covered entities rather than the scope of the disability experienced by the individual asserting coverage under the Act. 
   While we believe that the approach we adopted in H.R. 3195 would have been workable for the courts--i.e., providing a new definition of ``substantially limits'' in order to convey to courts our intention that they should apply a lower standard of severity than they previously had--we accept the considered judgment of our colleagues in the Senate that their approach achieves the same end, but in a manner more suitable to their interests.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, 3 months ago, the American people sent a resounding message, a message for change. They voted for a new direction in our Nation, including a new direction for the war in Iraq, which will enter its fifth year next month. 
   This week on this House floor the Members of this great body can demonstrate that we not only have heard the voters' message, but also that we have the collective will to send one of our own. 
   The bipartisan resolution before us asks the Members one straightforward question to be answered. Do you approve of the President's proposal to deploy more than 20,000 additional troops in Iraq, or do you not? Thus, this resolution is a clarifying moment for the Members to say precisely where they stand on the President's plan. 
   There is little doubt that our Iraq policy is not succeeding. Our Commander in Chief, President Bush, acknowledged on this floor last month during his State of the Union address that, and I quote, ``Whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.'' 
   I voted for the authorization, and I did not vote for failure. But the policies being pursued by this administration have not led to success. 
   After nearly 4 years at war, after more than 3,100 of our finest sons and daughters have given the ultimate measure of sacrifice in Iraq, after more than 25,000 have been wounded, after the expenditure of more than $400 billion on this war effort by the American taxpayer, our success seems as remote as ever. 
   Not surprisingly, two-thirds of the American people oppose the President's escalation plan. So do many current and former senior military officials, and Prime Minister Maliki has expressed his disapproval as well. 
   I oppose the President's plan for several reasons. First, we simply cannot ignore the many miscalculations made by the administration about this war, from sending too few troops, to grossly underestimating the cost, to failing to properly plan for the postwar period. 
   The President repeatedly said that his policies were working. He was tragically wrong, just as he is wrong today, in my view, about this escalation. 
   Secondly, this troop escalation does not represent a new strategy. In fact, we have tried at least four escalations in the past, none of which has succeeded in quelling violence. 
   The time for more troops was 4 years ago, 3 years ago, perhaps even 2 years ago, but not today. 
   The fact is our commitment of forces has never, has never been commensurate with the risk the President says exists. Never has the President, the Commander in Chief, suggested the resources necessary to succeed. This is too little, tragically, too late. 
   Third, we cannot disregard the deep skepticism and warnings of our military leaders. General Abizaid, not just another soldier, but the former chief of the Central Command in charge of our effort in Iraq, has stated that, and I quote, ``More American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own future.'' That is the consequence General Abizaid believes of the President's policy. 
   Former Secretary of State Powell, one of the military leaders so successful in Iraq I, stated, and I quote again,  ``I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing the communitarian violence, this civil war, will work.'' That is General Powell. 
   And even Senator McCain, who supports the President's escalation nonetheless, said just last week, ``I don't think it enhances our chances for succeeding in Iraq.'' 
   It is obvious that there is not a military solution to the violence in Iraq. We need a diplomatic surge, a surge of Iraqi responsibility. 
   We must implement an aggressive diplomatic strategy, as suggested by our friend, FRANK WOLF, both within the region and beyond. The Iraqis must take the lead on security, and the mission of American forces must shift from combat to counterterrorism, training and logistics. And we must begin the responsible redeployment of our forces. 
   Now, let me close by urging Members to disregard the arguments of those who seek to mischaracterize this resolution. Some say that the resolution will demoralize our troops. In a democracy it is proper and essential that we debate the tactics and strategy we are employing when we are asking young Americans, and some not so young Americans, to be at the point of the spear. It is easy for us to talk about tactics and strategy, not so easy for those who are in harm's way. 
   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Pace, says this debate will not adversely affect morale if we make it clear, as we have made it clear over and over and over again, that we will not abandon, we will not underman, we will not undersupply, we will not undertrain, and we will not defund those who we have put in harm's way. We will support our troops today, tomorrow and every day thereafter. 
   Some say that this resolution will demoralize our troops. Yet General Pace, as I said, says otherwise. 
   Others say that this resolution has not received adequate consideration. Yet, I tell my friends, in the first 6 weeks of this new Congress, we have held 52 House and Senate hearings. For the last 4 years this Congress has been absent without leave, and the American people know it. We did not demand accountability. We did not look at strategy. We did not question the President's policies. Fifty-two hearings have been held to date, and Chairman Lantos has announced that he will hold a full committee hearing on all pending resolutions related to Iraq when we come back from the President's Day break. 
   Some say that this resolution is merely symbolic. To them I simply state that the bipartisan expression of the will of this House, when it mirrors the views of the vast majority of the American public, cannot, must not, should not be casually ignored. 
   Some say that this resolution signals retreat in the war on terror. As one who is absolutely committed to prevailing in the war on terror, to protect our people, to protect our country and, yes, to protect my three daughters, my three grandchildren, and my great grandchild, I am absolutely committed to policies that will protect us from terror and defeat those terrorists who threaten us. Continuing to support failed strategy, however, weakens our efforts in the war on terror. It does not strengthen them. 
   Furthermore, our failure to implement an effective strategy in Iraq has clearly, indisputably, resulted in encouraging and enhancing the ability of terrorists to recruit and to spread their twisted, hateful, violent ideology. 
   Finally, my colleagues, some assert that this resolution is a first step to defunding our troops in the field. This is categorically false. 
   While the new majority will explore other opportunities to affect Iraq policy, our commitment to our men and women in harm's way is unwavering. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is not a Member of this body, not one, on either side of the aisle, who does not pray for our Nation's success in Iraq. 
   Our brave service men and women have performed there with valor and with great honor. They have done everything that a grateful Nation has asked of them since the beginning of this war. We will not abandon them. I say to them directly, we will not abandon you. We will support you and we will assure that you are trained and equipped for the mission that we give you. 
   This is a critical moment, I tell you, my colleagues, in our Nation's war effort in Iraq. The President's policy is failing and his most recent proposal promises more of the same. This resolution is a first step in our attempt to forge a new direction in Iraq, and I urge every Member to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. I was watching this debate from my office, and I was constrained to come to the floor. 
   There are legitimate issues raised by this resolution as to whether or not you support or do not support the escalation that has been proposed by the President. But no one ought to hide behind the troops. No one ought to come to this floor and say that this Congress, 435 of us, will not support whatever soldier or sailor or marine is deployed to Iraq. Whether it is today or tomorrow, they will have our support. 
   And when we say in this resolution they are serving, it means if they are serving, if the Commander in Chief has sent them there, we will support them. 
   And very frankly, for my friend from New Mexico to come to this floor and make the representation that somehow we have limited that support to those who currently are on the ground is not an honest representation, in my opinion. 
   There are those of us who disagree as to what supporting the troops means. My friend, the former chairman of the committee, just got up and said he has not gotten any calls lately, but we got a lot of calls in in 2003 and 2004 and 2005. And today, Chairman Murtha of the Appropriations Committee is saying we do not have the armored Humvees for these new troops that are going to be deployed or in the process of being deployed.     
   So when you come to the floor, my friends, debate the substance of this policy, but do not hide behind the troops, do not assert that anybody on this floor does not have every intention and commitment to supporting to whatever degree necessary our young men and women and, as I have said, some not so young, who are deployed in harm's way at the point of the spear. Because no one in this Congress, and our troops ought to know, that no one in this Congress will not support them when they are deployed at the point of the spear.

And the assertion, I tell my friend, that was made by the gentlewoman from New Mexico that the verbiage of this resolution says, because serving, it does not mean those who will serve, obviously, as soon as they are sent into theater, they are serving in Iraq and they are covered by this resolution.

I make that representation to you, that assertion, and I make it as strongly as I can possibly make it. 
   This is about a policy, a policy as to whether or not we ought to send 21,000 additional people. And as the gentlewoman from New Mexico said she herself has great reservations about that policy, but rationalizes voting against the resolution which opposes that policy on an assertion that I think was not correct. And if she wanted that clarification, I am glad that I could give it to her. I thank the gentleman. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

All of that happened under the grip of Republican ideology. Eight years in the White House, 6 years with all the levers of power, and after all that, they suggest more of the same. 
   Every time they try to change the subject, every time they pretend to be agents of change, we will answer with the simple facts of failure. We have faith in the facts. We will stake an election on that faith. And when we win, we will govern secure in that faith.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-62) -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, earlier today, the President of the United States, in defiance of bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate, and in defiance of the will of a great majority of Americans, vetoed fiscally responsible legislation that would ensure that 10 million children in our Nation receive health insurance coverage. That's approximately 4 million more children than are covered under the highly successful Children's Health Insurance Program today. 
   I remind the Members of the House that that program was adopted in 1997 by a Republican-controlled Congress with strong Democratic support, a bipartisan program. Let us be clear, this is a defining moment for this Congress and for a President who has labeled himself a compassionate conservative. 
   The President's veto, my colleagues, must not stand. The President wrongly claims that this bipartisan legislation is fiscally irresponsible. But the truth is the Children's Health Insurance Program legislation, forged by Members on both sides of this aisle, is paid for. It does not add to the deficit or to the debt. Moreover, President Bush, whose policies over the last 6 years have instigated record budget deficits and spiraling debt, should not be lecturing anyone on the issue of fiscal discipline. This administration, I suggest to all of us, has pursued and enacted the most fiscally irresponsible policies perhaps in American history. In fact, even as the President vetoed this CHIP legislation, all of it paid for, he has asked Congress to approve another $190 billion to protect Baghdad and its environs. Mr. President, we need to protect the children of Bowie, of New York, of Peoria, of Miami, of California. 
   In fact, even as the President vetoed, as I said, this legislation, he sent to us a $190 billion request for more money for the war in Iraq, the civil war in Iraq, a place where, very frankly, it is far past time where the people of Iraq took the responsibility to defend and secure their country. 
   This legislation that the President has vetoed is about securing the health of America's children. With this veto, the President is playing politics, pure and simple. 
   After running up record deficits in debt, he is now trying to establish his fiscal bona fides with his conservative political base by denying health services to children. 
   Mr. President, it won't work. Mr. President, it shouldn't work. Mr. President, it is not compassionate, nor is it common sense. 
   Senator Hatch, no one's idea of a liberal or of a Democratic spinmeister, said on the Senate floor last week, and I quote, ``It is unfortunate that the President has chosen to be on what, to me, is clearly the wrong side of the issue.'' That was Senator Hatch. 
   I hope all of us in this body, Republican and Democrat, decide, when this vote comes up, to determine whether or not the Congress should make policy or whether we will be subservient to the President's veto in protecting children. 
   I hope all of us, Republican and Democrat, liberal, moderate and conservative, will join together to respond to the children of this country and their families who agonize about not having the health insurance they need so that their children can be kept healthy. 
   Senator Roberts of Kansas remarked, another leader in the Republican Party, ``I am not for excessive spending and strongly oppose the federalization of health care. And if the administration's concern with this bill were accurate, I would support a veto, but bluntly put,'' said Senator Roberts from Kansas, who served in this body, ``the assertions of the President,'' he said, ``are wrong.'' Technically, he said that the premises were inaccurate. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation is not only supported by majorities in the House and Senate, it is supported by doctors, nurses, private insurers, children's advocates, 43 Governors. The list goes on and on and on. But most importantly, most importantly, it's supported by the parents of children who are working, working hard every day, playing by the rules. Perhaps both are working, if they're fortunate to have two parents in the home, or a single parent, mom or dad, working hard, but making too little to afford insurance and working for an employer who can't give them insurance. Most of all, that is the constituency, that is the voice we ought to hear, that is why we ought to override this veto. 
   According to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released just this week, 72 percent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans, support this legislation, 69 percent of independents. What is perhaps most stunning of all is that, with this veto, the President has violated his own pledge at the Republican National Convention in 2004. You've heard me say this before, but let me say it again: ``In a new term we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government programs.'' ``We will not allow,'' said the President, ``a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' Mr. President, that is what you have done by this veto, stood between those children and the insurance they need. 
   I urge my colleagues, override this veto, support this motion, and on October 18 let us vote for the children. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (DARFUR ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the United States has many tools in its national security arsenal. And one that is too often overlooked and under-utilized--despite the fact that it works--is economic leverage. 
   Today, it is long past time that the United States--and the international community--exert maximum pressure on the Sudanese government to stop the suffering in Darfur, where an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 civilians have been slaughtered and 2.5 million more have been driven from their homes. 
   The United Nations has identified the situation in Darfur as the worst humanitarian and human rights crisis in the world today. The United States has labeled the killings there as genocide. 
   We must not turn a blind eye to this horrific human suffering, which shocks our collective conscience. Thus, the United States must lead the international community in turning up the pressure on the Sudanese government through an effective divestment campaign similar to the one employed against South Africa three decades ago. 
   The Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act--introduced by a leader on this important issue, Congresswoman Lee--seeks to utilize targeted divestment to exert further pressure on the Bashir government in Khartoum. 
   This legislation requires the Treasury Secretary to establish a list of companies whose business activities in Sudan directly support the genocidal practices of the Bashir regime in Khartoum. The measure also authorizes State and local governments which choose to divest their pension fund holdings from companies on the list, and it contains ``safe harbor'' provisions for managers of mutual funds and corporate pension managers who choose to do the same even though their charters may mandate that they seek to maximize gains. 
   Furthermore, the bill would ban U.S. Government procurement contracts with companies on the Treasury list and authorizes the prohibition of these types of contracts at the State and local level. 
   The fact is, while the United States currently prohibits companies from conducting business operations in Sudan, millions of Americans are inadvertently supporting Bashir's government by investing in foreign companies that conduct business operations there. 
   According to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, the Khartoum regime ``relies heavily on foreign investment to fund its military and the brutal militias seeking to eliminate the non-Arab population of Darfur.'' In fact, it is estimated that as much as 70 to 80 percent of oil revenue in Sudan is funneled directly into the military. 
   Given our experience in South Africa, we know that increasing economic pressure through targeted divestment can work. We have been talking with the Bashir government for years now--with little effect. It is time to leverage our dollars in an attempt to stop the suffering in Darfur.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (IRAN SANCTIONS ENABLING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act of 2007 (H.R. 2347), which would authorize state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in entities with investments of $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector. 
   As Iran continues to pursue its nuclear agenda--in defiance of UN sanctions and international pressure--the United States must leverage not only its diplomatic resources but its economic influence when it comes to Iran. Simply put, we must act aggressively to ensure that we are not providing Iran with money to develop nuclear weapons. 
   This legislation will help us do that. 
   Among other things, this bill would require the publication of entities, both inside and outside the United States, that have an investment of more than $20 million in Iran's energy sector. Any entity designated on this list could delay publication of its name if it demonstrates that it is taking steps to divest from Iran. 
   Furthermore, the bill provides a safe harbor for investment and pension fund managers from lawsuits alleging that divestment would lower a fund's profits. 
   Mr. Speaker, Iran's support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah is well known and it is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by our State Department. 
   In addition, the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has made repeated outrageous statements toward the United States and our ally, Israel, even calling in October 2005 for Israel to be ``wiped off the map.'' 
   Given Iran's continued hostility and defiance of the international community, it is imperative that we use all the tools in our national security arsenal to attempt to change Iran's behavior. And, state-level divestment campaigns are an essential way for state officials to prevent retirement funds from helping Iran pursue nuclear weapons and fund terrorism. 
   Although U.S. companies have been barred from directly investing in Iran since 1996, there are investment avenues not covered by those restrictions. This bill would close some of the loopholes in previous legislation and executive orders by prohibiting public pension funds from investing in foreign companies that do more than $20 million in business in Iran's oil and gas sector. 
   Iran is already struggling with domestic instability, gas rationing and falling foreign investment. This legislation provides a useful diplomatic and economic tool to further push Iran toward complying with international pressure, both to stop its nuclear activities and to cease its sponsorship of terrorist groups. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   The DOD authorization bill will, of course, be considered on the week of the 18th, I believe. That's the week of the 18th. The supplemental is obviously on our radar screen, and we hope to pass the supplemental before we leave as well. I was hoping for next week. That still is a possibility, but I'm not assured that they will be in place, ``they'' being Mr. Obey in our discussions.

   Mr. Obey has been discussing with the Senate how they think we can best move forward as expeditiously as possible and so that we can try to achieve the end. 
   As you know, there is substantial discussion about what is in the supplemental. The President, as you know, has indicated that and Mr. Nussel has indicated that if anything above the dollars asked essentially for Iraq and Afghanistan are included for investment here in this country on various different items, perhaps dealing with unemployment insurance, perhaps dealing with energy credits so that we can ensure the expansion of alternative enterprises for alternative fuels, those are all being discussed to see whether they are possibilities in terms of passage and, hopefully, signature by the President. 
   We think that there are a number of items that are critically important to pass now that we think this bill is appropriate for but we don't have agreement on at this point in time. But Mr. Obey is working today and hopefully tomorrow, and we have a number of meetings today to see if we can move that forward. 
   So I regret I do not have a more definitive answer for you, but that is the candid answer.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As it relates to the first item, the GI Bill, there is a comprehensive GI Bill, as you know, sponsored by Mr. Webb. Also Ms. HERSETH over here and others have legislation which tries to respond to the critical need that our veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq now have because they have substantially less generous benefits and, therefore, less opportunity to reintegrate themselves into the community and stabilize themselves and their families. We believe that is a cost of the war. 
   I don't believe that under the current suggestion, and I'm not suggesting that it's in or out at this point in time, I'm not suggesting there is anything in or out in terms of proposal, but it is my belief that that would not require a waiver of the PAYGO given the context in which it may be considered. What I mean by that, and not to be too esoteric, is that we may respond to the need this coming year as opposed to a longer term.

   Mr. HOYER. As you know, we came together and we agreed on the passage of a stimulus package. We passed a stimulus package because we thought our economy was either about to go in recession or was in recession--not at the time when we passed it, but that  seems to be the case now--and the stimulus package was designed to either keep us out or to bring us out of a recession and to try to help our people who are at risk. As you know, we did that on an emergency basis. The reason we did that on an emergency basis, we felt, in terms of stimulating the economy, you didn't want to stimulate and depress at the same time. So the answer to your question, for instance, on unemployment insurance, that may well fall in the same category from our perspective.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his observations. I think he and I have a difference on the perception of some of the items that he mentioned as being analogous to some of the other items that we have discussed. 
   On the AMT, for instance, there is a disagreement on that alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax was not intended, I don't think by any of us, to impact the people that it is now impacting. I believe strongly that we ought to fix the AMT, not just for this coming year, but permanently, and we ought to pay for that. And the reason I think that we ought to do that is, A, it clearly falls within the ambit of PAYGO, and secondly, because I think that our generation incurred this liability and we ought to pay for that liability. 
   But some of the things that we have already mentioned I think are more analogous, not to tax extenders, giving additional tax relief or fixing the AMT, but are, as the UI is, unemployment insurance, directed to an emergency that confronts us as a result of a substantial downturn in the economy, which is analogous, I think, to the stimulus package, which is why we didn't consider that to be a PAYGO issue and were prepared not to address it in a PAYGO way.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You mentioned the States. One of the things that we're very concerned about is the very substantial fiscal adverse impact to the States that will be caused by the change in the Medicaid regulations proposed by the administration. That is one of the items under consideration because that change, as I understand it from Mr. Waxman--as a matter of fact, we just talked about it--will have a very great adverse financial impact on the States. I'm sure you received a letter similar to the one that I received from both Democratic and Republican Governors asking us to address that. 
   So there clearly are some items which have impact on the States. Very frankly the discussion is, how many of those do we try to address, if any, in the supplemental? How many do we address in the stimulus package? Or how many do we address in separate legislation? 
   One of the positive aspects of the stimulus package, as you will recall because you and I were in the room, was that Secretary Paulson, on behalf of the 
   administration, the Speaker, you and I and Mr. Boehner sat down together and talked about how we can get from where we were to where we wanted to get, and we came to agreement. We have been unable to do that, as you know, on some of these things that we think are of serious concern, and the Medicaid regulations are an example of that.

   I don't have information now about the status of that bill, where it is. Obviously it's a bipartisan bill, Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Walden and others. It is a bill that, very frankly, has been brought up in the context of whether it might be included in some other pieces of legislation, so that it obviously has bipartisan support. I will look at it and discuss it with Mr. DeFazio and let you know where we are on it.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Without going into the polemics of the politics that we exchange on this of what legislation we have passed through here, which was, we think, directed at trying to address the short-term problems, dealing with OPEC, dealing with manipulation of prices, dealing with price gouging, which many, if not all of you, on your side voted against. Suffice it to say I think all of us are concerned about the high prices of gasoline. Suffice it to say that all of us, if we're honest, know that in the short term it's going to be very difficult to impact on that. Thirdly, that the solution longer term is obviously moving towards alternative sources of energy and renewable sources of energy. 
   We passed a major piece of legislation last year. Happily we passed it in somewhat of a bipartisan fashion, not totally, I don't mean everybody unanimously voted for it. But the President did sign it. The President said it was a step forward. For the first time in a very long period of time it said our automobiles need to be more efficient. For the first time in a very long time it required the use of alternative fuels. So that we addressed initially, and there's much more that needs to be done, longer term solutions. 
   Short-term solutions are tough. There is discussion about the SPR. There are discussions about taxes, gasoline taxes, as you know. There are other discussions. If you have ideas, we would be glad to have them in terms of what can be done in the short term.

   Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, many of you have heard me, and Mr. Dreier as well, over the years speak to how extraordinarily advantaged we are in the House of Representatives, and the American people are, by the quality and commitment of the staff that serves this institution. 
   It doesn't serve Republicans or Democrats, but it serves the purposes of assuring that this institution runs in a way that gets the business of the American people done in a way that's productive and positive for them and for our country. 
   Regretfully, I am going to observe the retirement of one of those people. Happily, I can extol his virtues. I've known him for a very long period of time. I've seen his work, conscientious, able, and a very positive impact on this institution. 
   Mark O'Sullivan, who is sitting just to my left on the second-level rostrum, has been with us 31 years in the House, and he commutes from Baltimore every day. I don't know whose district he is in, maybe Mr. Cummings' or Mr. Ruppersberger's. I'm not sure whose district he is in, but I'm sure they are happy that he is living there, although he's totally bipartisan, I'm sure. 
   He has done an outstanding job. I have always found him to be in even humor, even in the toughest of times. Even in the times when the body sometimes gets more loud and uproarious than at other times, he maintains an even demeanor. And, as I say, the competency and the talent and the commitment and the character he has brought to his job has advantaged our country and the House of Representatives. 
   Mark, we thank you. Congratulations to you. We wish you the very best, and we look forward to seeing you back here in the near future and repeating it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are few Members on this floor whom I respect more than the gentleman who has just spoken. JIM MCCRERY from Louisiana is going to be a loss to this House and to our country. He is a thoughtful, fair, and considerate legislator. He represents his State well. He has represented this House well. And I congratulate him for his service. But people of goodwill can disagree, and I want to make an observation on this punitive measure. 
   In 2004, the Republicans passed a tax bill. Historically, manufacturers had gotten a tax break to incentivize keeping jobs here and trying to grow jobs in America. The oil companies were not included in that law, as the gentleman knows so well, but the Republicans added oil companies into the category of manufacturers. Now they are being taken out. So he says we added them in and now it would be unfair to take them out. They weren't in originally; we are taking them out. 
   Mr. Speaker, this important legislation is an explicit recognition that our great Nation must make critical investments today in the development of clean, renewable energy and energy efficiency; energy investments that will strengthen our national, economic, and environmental security for generations to come. 
   I appreciated Mr. McCrery's observation that part of this bill was a good bill. He disagrees with other parts. That's understandable. But we must simply begin to break our addiction to fossil fuels, not because the oil companies are bad. They're not. They produce a product that's absolutely essential and they create jobs, good-paying jobs. So this is not about trying to take it out on the oil companies, but it is to say that fossil fuels are a wasting resource. That is to say, we're going to use it up, it's going to go away, and we need to look to alternatives. 
   This morning's headline in the New York Times states that the harsh reality is ``Gas Prices Soar, Posing a Threat to Family Budget.'' The fact is the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.14 this week, an increase of 19 cents in just the last 14 days. Some energy experts fear gas prices could hit $4 a gallon by this spring. Diesel prices are hitting new records daily, and oil hit a record high of $100.88 a barrel on Tuesday. 
   This, again, is not about the bad oil companies. What this is about is America's dependence on foreign sources of oil and on oil generally. Either it's going away or we will be in the grasp of OPEC, of nations who are not particularly friendly to us: Venezuela; Saudi Arabia sometimes, sometimes not; Iraq; Iran; other oil-producing states that can go away in a second. We are vulnerable, and we need to look to alternatives. That's what this bill seeks to do. 
   To be clear, this legislation alone will not bring down gas prices. But it is a vital step forward and may bring down gas prices 3 years from now or 10 years from now or 15 years from now. This bill is nothing less than a critical investment in the low carbon economy of the future that will result in the creation of millions of new jobs. 
   It extends the production tax credit for wind, geothermal, and other renewables to 2011 and renews the investment tax credit for individual homeowners and businesses to maintain incentives for solar energy through the end of 2016. Without the prompt extension of these tax credits, renewable energy project work stoppages could cost 116,000 jobs at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy. 
   Furthermore, this bill will spur the commercialization of the next generation of automobiles by establishing a $4,000 credit for the purchase of a plug-in hybrid. Tax credits, tax incentives, are to get something that you need and might not otherwise get unless you get an incentive. I'm going to speak to that with reference to the oil companies in just a second. 
   It will encourage investments in cleaner fuels, creating economic incentives to invest in biofuels, including biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. And it will close the so-called ``Hummer'' tax loophole, which encourages taxpayers to buy gas-guzzling SUVs. That makes no sense. 
   In addition, this legislation will create incentives for the construction of energy-efficient buildings and the retrofitting of existing homes, which will reduce pollution and energy use. 
   Finally, the energy conservation bonds included in this bill will spur investments in efficiency, create jobs, and reduce carbon emissions. 
   I would think all of those objectives are objectives that this House, in a bipartisan way, would seek to achieve. 
   Now, in keeping with this Democratic majority's commitment to fiscal  responsibility, this legislation will not add to the deficit. I will tell you that your previous bills dealing with tax incentives could not make that comment. Rather, the tax incentives contained in the bill are offset by repealing $18 billion in unnecessary tax subsidies over the next 10 years that otherwise will be enjoyed by the largest oil and gas companies in America. Mr. McCrery referenced a discussion about that. 
   Last year alone, the five largest oil companies had a combined profit of $123 billion. God bless them. But it only provokes this question: Do these companies need taxpayer subsidies to look for new product? 
   I'm a big proponent of the free market system. Supply and demand works. The demand for oil is high. The prices reflect that demand, and they are the highest they have been in history. They don't need any incentive to look for new product. The incentive is the free market system which is buying their product for the highest prices they have ever sold it. So it is foolish to ask the taxpayers to not only pay those high prices at the pump but also to pay additional taxes because the oil companies aren't paying the same kind of level of taxes that they are. Last year alone, as I said, they made the highest profits they have made. 
   The answer, of course, to my question, do they need incentives to get new product? They do not. They do not. There is not an oil company executive in the world who's going to say let's not look for new oil when their product is getting the highest prices they have gotten in history. 
   Even President Bush, and I want all my Republican friends to hear this. There aren't very many of them on the floor. There aren't very many Democrats on the floor. But I hope they are watching on television. President Bush, a former oil company executive, said in 2005, and I want you to hear this quote, George Bush, President of the United States, former oil executive, 2005: ``I will tell you, with $55 a barrel oil, we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore.'' I'm sure all of you got that. At $55 a barrel, the President of the United States said we don't need incentives for the companies to explore. 
   Prices now are almost 100 percent above that dollar figure which the President of the United States said would obviate the need for incentives. With the price of a barrel of oil hovering around $100, do we really believe that this incentive is justified? The President of the United States said no. Hopefully, this Congress today will say no. 
   This legislation is a thoughtful effort to set our Nation's energy priorities and thereby strengthen our national, economic, and environmental security. 
   Last year when we passed the Energy Independence and Security Act, the President and Senate Republicans removed a package of economic incentives, including the extension of tax credits for wind and solar energy and biofuels. We must move towards those alternatives. With this bill, we continue the fight for this critical aspect of our energy policy. 
   I thank the chairman for his leadership on this very important piece of legislation, and I thank the Republican colleagues on the committee as well for working on this product. 
   We may have differences, but this is a critical issue for the future of our country and for generations yet to come. Vote for this bill.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, as all of us know, we have been considering for a number of years now the question of how we ensure that we have ethical conduct in this body, but more importantly, how we give confidence to the American people that we are handling their business in a fashion which they can trust and be proud of. It is a difficult effort. 
   We had scheduled for tomorrow a rule which would have established a process of access and oversight that many believe would be an improvement. The committee that was set up was chaired by Mr. Capuano, and Mr. Smith, Lamar Smith, was his ranking member or cochair. 
   Mr. Smith just an hour ago or so, or 2 hours ago, brought a new proposal, which we had not seen, to the Rules Committee. We have asked Mr. Capuano about that proposal. He has indicated that he wants an opportunity to review it because he had not seen it before. 
   In light of that, I have had discussions with the other side of the aisle with reference to a procedure in which we would not consider the rule that was proposed, the rules change that was proposed, tomorrow. We do expect to consider it soon, but not tomorrow. 
   Tomorrow, and I will be asking at the end of this for unanimous consent, I have discussed with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt doing the seven suspension bills. There are eight suspension bills scheduled for today. One of them is the Andean bill, which I think is not of any controversy, the 10-month extension on that bill. I will be asking for unanimous consent, therefore, for tomorrow to be a suspension day. 
   This will give Mr. Capuano and Mr. Smith the opportunity to discuss a new proposal which has been put on the table just this afternoon, and they will discuss that. 
   I know that Mr. Boehner and Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker, have had discussions. I presume those discussions will continue. 
   So my expectation is tomorrow, after the unanimous consent, we will conclude this bill. We will then have no further business. We will have the Andean suspension bill. After the conclusion of the Andean suspension bill, we will have no further business for today that Members would be voting on. And then we would, tomorrow, consider the seven suspension bills, and my presumption is it will be a relatively early day tomorrow, Thursday.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. I don't know exactly what time. I would hope sometime around the middle of the day, noon or thereabouts we would consider the veto, maybe closer to 1 o'clock, but certainly in the middle of the day. 
   Of course our expectation is that so many of your Members will determine that this policy is absolutely one that ought to be adopted that we will override the veto and that 4 million additional children will be covered. That's certainly our hope. I know that's not your expectation. 
   So in the event that that does not happen, I think the answer to your question is, I would certainly be prepared to discuss the matter with you. No one has any intention of, frankly, seeing children dropped from the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   As you know, the President's proposal, if we adopted the President's proposal, would result in a net reduction of 840,000 children from the current program. We think that's not appropriate and, therefore, we want to move legislation forward, appropriate funding levels, and we would certainly be available to discuss that. 
   We do anticipate, however, and are very hopeful that the Congress will work its will on this legislation.

   But if not, as we have in the past, I want to say something; my friends on my side of the aisle know this. I have always found the gentleman from Missouri, the Republican whip, to be open to discussion and reasonable discussion to see if we can move forward. 
   I don't know what exactly was said on the other side, but I would reiterate that nobody, I think, in this House, as I said in the debate, closing the debate on the CHIP bill when we passed it through this House very handily, that I believe every Member of this House wants to ensure that children have access to health care. And we need to work on how that can be accomplished. We think the bill we passed does that. But we certainly will be available to make sure that happens however we can get it done.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We are desirous, of course, of passing all 12 appropriation bills out of conference, through both floors, and to the President. We want to do that. We are working towards that end. 
   I will tell my friend I have talked to Chairman Obey. There are discussions going on between the House and Senate. He is correct, there hasn't been a conference yet. There are still some  issues that need to be resolved. But we are hopeful, in answer to your question, that appropriation bills will be on the floor and will be passed and will be sent to the President prior to the 16th of November. And as I have told my friend before, we have no intention of getting to a place where the government is shut down. The best way to do that is passing our 12 appropriation bills and having the President sign them. We hope we can reach that objective, but obviously at this point in time, much work remains to be done. But we hope to be doing it. 
   The Senate, as you know, was not in session this week and we are here in an abbreviated session because of the untimely and sad death of our colleague Jo Ann Davis. But we hope to move appropriation bills and we hope to have them on the floor, as the gentleman asked, prior to November 16.

We are hopeful that they will have bills on the floor next week and can get through those bills in a relatively short period of time so that we can move ahead. But I didn't want to leave the impression I thought that all 12 would possibly be moved through by the 16th of November.

But we will certainly pass at least the Peru FTA along with the Trade Assistance Adjustment. 
   I will say to my friend that Panama is another bill that I think might be possible; however, the gentleman knows there is a problem that has arisen unrelated to the provisions of the trade bill but which are of great concern to many Members on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   First, let me respond to a point Mr. Brady has made a number of times. The point I am referring to is if we did not spend any money on private collection, we would not collect $1 billion. We can accept that as accurate. But the assumption is that we wouldn't spend any money in the public sector to collect that money. But I will read figures that say if we did that, we would geometrically collect more than a billion dollars by a factor of two or three or four or five. I will read that figure, Mr. Brady. But you keep reading the figure, the assumption of which is we are simply going to drop collection. We are not going to drop collection. 
   Today, through this important legislation, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act, this House will reiterate that the collection of taxes is a core governmental function that should not be contracted out to private companies. 
   But no one, no one should be mistaken. Our objection to the private collection of taxes is not simply philosophical; it is practical, as well. 
   First, there simply is no evidence that private tax collectors are more efficient. In fact, the opposite is true.

I regret that, but that's the fact of life; and we can either stop doing business until they agree to do so, or we can try to move forward and try to reach some agreement. 
   I will tell my friend that there were Republican Senators involved in the discussions, as he may know, and he is correct that there will probably be a new bill on the floor, but I tell my friend that that bill will incorporate items that were either in the Senate or House bill and will be items that we believe and hope, as I said, are now agreed between what we hope to be a majority of the House and a majority of the Senate. To that extent, it will be like a conference report because the expectation is it would not be amended in the Senate because, of course, we're facing the September 30 deadline.

But in any event, as I said, we will be treating this much like a conference report. We regret that we're not in conference; and therefore it will be treated more like a conference report than it will be a new piece of legislation because I would reiterate to my friend, it is, essentially, not a new piece of legislation. It is a compromise that we have tried to reach with bipartisan participation in the Senate side. Unfortunately, notwithstanding invitations, not on the House side. 
   The bill will, hopefully, be a bill, as I have said to my friend, that can be agreed upon and sent to the President so that we can provide for the Children's Health Insurance Program to continue and, obviously, to expand, as we hope it will.

   Mr. HOYER. I understand your angst because we shared that angst. We had a lot of angst, as you recall, and I asked the majority leader on a number of occasions when they were going to have conferences that were called, that had conferees, to which our conferees were never invited, some the most senior Members of this Congress, namely Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel, who were not invited to conferences. So I understand the gentleman's angst. I really do. 
   But having said that, I think it is unfair to say a bill that has not been seen. I would again reiterate to my friend that, as I understand it, there will be nothing in the bill that we will hope to consider early next week that was not included in either the Senate bill or the House bill, both of which passed respective bodies. But we haven't been able to get to conference. Meetings have obviously been held. We hope agreements have been reached which would be acceptable to both bodies so that we can move those bills as if a conference had been held. But because a conference hasn't been held, this is the alternative available to us.

   Mr. HOYER. My expectation is we will have a continuing resolution on the floor next week. We don't intend to shut down government. I know that a number of Members on your side have indicated it's not their intention to shut down government. We, therefore, need to provide for an alternative which will provide for government to continue because, again, we are experiencing the same frustration you had, as you know, that while we have passed all 12 appropriation bills, that has not been the case in the Senate. The Senate has passed four of their appropriations bills. We haven't conferenced them yet, so that we are going to need a CR to continue government in operations, and I expect to have that on the floor next week.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't want to commit myself to a time frame, but I can tell you, in discussions with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he wants a longer term than a shorter term. In other words, I don't think he is looking for a week-to-week. It will be a longer term than that. I don't think I want to prejudge his decision which he may not yet have made, but my expectation is, I tell my friend, that it will be a longer term than shorter term, and by that I mean more than a couple of weeks.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question. I know it's a very important one for his Members and ours. 
   We had hoped, as you know, when I inherited or succeeded, however one looks at it, to the scheduling authority from Mr. Boehner, Mr. Boehner had scheduled October 3, I believe, it may have been the 6th, October 3 or 6 as the ending date. I would have hoped Mr. Boehner was accurate in that assessment, but I thought it was not realistic at that point in time. So I was more pessimistic but apparently not pessimistic enough. 
   I scheduled October 26 as our target date for adjournment. It seems that we are not going to make that. I am very hopeful, and I'm not going to bet on it, but I'm going to plan on November 16 being our last day. 
   Senator Reid, the leader of the Senate, has indicated that they will be out the last 2 weeks of November. From my experience serving here, it doesn't get better just because you get into December, that we would be able to adjourn sine die until the second session of the Congress, probably to begin the 3rd week in January, although the Speaker and I need to discuss that, and I want to discuss it also with you and Mr. Boehner. But my thought would be that we would come back the 3rd week in January. 
   In addition to that, because we are not going to adjourn sine die on the 26th of October, which I had hoped but which is not realistic at this point in time, I had scheduled the four Fridays of October to meet. I want all the Members to know, and I discussed this with the whip earlier in the week, that we will not be meeting on the 5th of October, that Friday, nor will we be meeting on the 19th so that, because of Columbus Day, the Members will have from Thursday late afternoon, and I don't commit to any particular time on Thursday, the 4th, until Tuesday the 9th at 6:30 p.m. before we come back.

   hold Members here for Friday simply to be here on Friday. It has been made clear to me that most Members on both sides of the aisle don't think that's a sensible policy. I agree with that. As a matter of fact, I think my friend has made that observation to me as well.

   Mr. HOYER. But we have to find out the workload. As you well know, as you get down towards the end, if we are going to have any shot at adjourning on the 16th of November, when the Senate is scheduled to leave for the last 2 weeks, if we have any shot of doing that, it will be because we complete that work which we think must be done, should be done prior to that. And, therefore, I am reserving those Fridays, and if we have work, we will be working. And the logical follow-on is that if we don't have work, although we won't give the kind of notice we are giving for the 5th and 19th, we will try not to have Members here simply watching the other body.

   I don't want to be specific on that because I don't want to anticipate where the Senate might be at that point in time. The leader in the Senate, although he had represented that they perhaps might be there in December, he has indicated now that his hope and plan is that they will not be there in December so that hopefully he is focused as well and the Senate is focused as well on the 16th of November as the adjournment date. If that is not and we have not done what we need to do by that time, hopefully we will be able to accommodate that certainly by late October and letting the Members know what we are going to do. 
   We will not be here, clearly, the week of Thanksgiving. That is a guarantee. I would not want at this juncture, because there is still a lot to happen over the next 6 weeks, to be definitive about what other weeks we would not be here.

It does not help, in my opinion, the debate to impugn the integrity of those who are serving our country in uniform in harm's way. 
   I believe that General Petraeus is an honorable man of great integrity who has served our country well. I may disagree with him; he may disagree with me on issues. But that does not in any way, any more than you and I might disagree and we are good friends, undermine our respect for each other's opinion. 
   And as I say, I want to articulate, because you bring up the issue, that I believe that that impugning of his integrity and of his patriotism and of his commitment to this country was inappropriate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I must say to my friend on the other side of the aisle, I believe it's never the wrong time to do the right thing, and this is the right thing. 
   My friend mentions trial lawyers. Trial lawyers are in the business of redressing grievances. Juries and judges are in the business of deciding whether the grievance deserves redress, not trial lawyers. Trial lawyers raise the issue. Judgments are not given by trial lawyers, but by judges and juries. 
   Equal pay for equal work. When we put the principle as bluntly as that, I doubt that anyone in America would disagree. It's a basic ideal of fairness. Is there a woman on this floor that believes they ought to be paid less than the men that do exactly the same kind of work? And I would suggest the answer to that is no, whether they're staffers or Members. I hope there is not a female page who watches these proceedings that believes that they are less valuable than the male pages that serve this House. They are equally valued, irrespective of gender. 
   The value of work lies in a job well done, not in the gender of the worker; but within my lifetime, it was a radical notion. For decades, it was perfectly acceptable for women to earn less simply because they were women. 
   We celebrated the 60th anniversary of the integration of the Armed Forces just a few days ago. Colin Powell spoke, and he indicated that he was too small to really remember the ramifications of that executive order, but he said to himself, how strange it would seem today to think that men and women would be segregated by unit and by housing because of the color of their skin. It is equally wrong to make distinctions of gender in payment for services. 
   Thanks to the hard work of generations of women advocates, we've closed that gap from 61 cents back in 1963 to 77 cents on the dollar today. Being 77 percent right is not enough, we need to be 100 percent right. We need to pay dollar for dollar for work performed. 
   In fact, it depends on staying hidden, it depends on keeping women in the dark. Because, of course, it's against the law not to pay equally, but if you don't know that you're being discriminated against, how can your grievances be redressed? In fact, the Constitution of the United States says, as all of us know, that Americans are guaranteed the right to petition the Congress of the United States for redress of grievances, and yet we keep people in the dark as to whether or not, in fact, they are aggrieved. 
   By now, we have all heard about the Lilly Ledbetter case. Ms. Ledbetter was a supervisor at a tire plant in Alabama, and for years she was paid less than her male coworker. I would be interested if any Member of this House is prepared to come to this well or stand at one of these microphones and say it was right to pay a supervisor that was a woman less than a supervisor who was a man. And if you do come to this well and say that, I look forward to debating you on that issue. 
   But Lilly Ledbetter had no way of knowing that she was being paid differently. She didn't know the truth. And by the time she found out, years after the discrimination began, the court said it was too late, time had run, statute of limitations gone, insurance run out. She didn't have the right to redress her justifiable grievance. 
   Her case is hardly unique. Justice Ginsburg has written that ``comparative pay information is often hidden from the employee's view.'' In many workplaces, merely asking a coworker about his or her pay is a firing offense. Far from protecting privacy, rules like that can protect an employer's power to discriminate. 
   And should we say, well, I know the employer discriminated, but we don't want to have a lawyer take that case because, after all, we don't like lawyers, they bring to our attention wrongdoing, they ask for redress of grievances, they petition the jury and the court; this is wrong. You know, a famous individual from my State, Justice Thurgood Marshall, did that. He was a trial lawyer. And he petitioned the court and said, it is wrong to segregate blacks and whites, it is wrong to give secondary education to African Americans, just as lawyers come and say it's wrong to discriminate on gender as opposed to quality of work. 
   In many workplaces, as I've said, merely asking a coworker about his or her pay is a firing offense. That's why this bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, is so necessary. It is time to do the right thing. It may be too late for some, but it's the right time for many. 
   It amends the Equal Pay Act to bar retaliation against employees who share or inquire about pay information. It strengthens sanctions against discriminatory employers--which have not been adjusted for 17 years. It clarifies acceptable reasons for differences in pay related to factors other than gender. And it authorizes additional training for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission staff to better identify and handle wage disputes.     
   I want to recognize my colleague Congresswoman DeLauro for working so hard for so long and so passionately to bring this bill to the floor. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support it. It's the right time. It's the right place. It's the right time.

   Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I know that all of you are concerned about the schedule. There was some hope that we would be able to get out late tonight. We have been unable to reach an accord on unanimous consent on the adjournment resolution. As you know, the Senate has not passed an adjournment resolution. As a result of that, we will be here tomorrow. So we are going to proceed in the following way: We will have no further votes tonight. I have discussed that with the minority, and they are not going to be asking for votes on amendments, and so we will be having no further votes tonight. 
   We will meet tomorrow at 9. We will be considering whatever amendments and the Military Construction and Veterans bill, we will vote on that. We will then have a rule on the adjournment resolution, and that will be the balance of our business. 
   It is my hope, again, not knowing what might transpire during the course  of the day, that we would be able to complete the business that will be before us before 1 o'clock tomorrow, perhaps earlier, again, depending upon how many votes we have and what action is taken on the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. I thank Mr. Davis for his work on this legislation. And I rise in strong support. 
   I want to commend the chairman on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Congressman Waxman of California, for his hard work and leadership on the five, not just this bill, but on the five government accountability and transparency bills considered on the House floor this week. This has been a very significant week for transparency, openness, and accountability in government, and I commend the chairman for his actions and the committee for its. 
   It is no mere coincidence that the four bipartisan bills we have considered so far have passed with an average of 340 votes, including on average 112 Republican votes for every one of these four and now fifth reform bills. So there is not a narrow partisan agenda here. What the committee has been bringing to the floor are bills broadly supported because we know that transparency and accountability in government have not been the norm. We need to restore the public's faith in its government. 
   In fact, there is a clear demonstration of the new Democratic majority's commitment to change the way business is done in Washington, to restore accountability for government practices and congressional oversight and to reach bipartisan consensus when possible. The four bills included measures to increase public access to government information by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act. After all, this information is gathered by taxpayer dollars. 
   To provide whistleblower protection to Federal workers who specialize in national security issues. To nullify an executive order issued by President Bush giving former Presidents and Vice Presidents broad authority to withhold presidential records or to delay their release indefinitely. The public has a right to know, and this legislation facilitates the redress of that right. 
   Lastly, to require the disclosure of donors to presidential libraries so there cannot be secret, very large contributions to Presidents before they leave office. 
   It should be noted that the first three measures passed overwhelmingly despite veto threats from the White House that apparently does not want openness or accountability or transparency. 
   All four bills are reasonable, prudent, and consistent with our Nation's democratic values and openness and accountability. 
   The legislation before us today, the Accountability in Contracting Act, is equally important. In short, this legislation would instruct Federal agencies to minimize the use of no-bid contracts. Why? Because we want lowest prices. How do we get lowest prices? By competition. That is the free enterprise system. This bill says let us pursue the free enterprise system. 
   It would promote the use of cost-effective, fixed-price contracts and limit the duration of no-bid contracts awarded in emergencies to 1 year. 
   This bill also would require the public disclosure of the rationale for using no-bid contracts and require agencies to report to Congress on contracts on overcharges.     
   Madam Chairman, it is unfortunate, but true, that problems in government contracting have arisen again and again during the last 6 years, and indeed before that, from the $2.4 billion, however, in no-bid contracts for Halliburton, that soon-to-be Dubai company based in Dubai, to the failed contracting in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
   Furthermore, Madam Chairman, it should be noted that spending on no-bid contracts has more than doubled under the Bush administration, even as hearings have exposed a pattern of reckless spending, poor planning and ineffective oversight by Federal contract officials. 
   This legislation, like the other four bills brought to the floor by Mr. Waxman considered this week, will help us begin to restore accountability and transparency to government. The American people expect and deserve no less. 
   This is a new day in this new Congress. The days of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil are over. This Congress embraces its constitutional responsibility to conduct real, meaningful oversight, as well as our value of openness and transparency. 
   Two days from now is St. Patrick's Day. The Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of Ireland, will be at lunch just a few feet from here any minute. Honor St. Patrick; vote green on this accountability legislation.

   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, I want to say that I spoke a lot about accountability and the lack of accountability in the last Congress, and in my opinion, the two Congresses before that. The chairman of the Government Reform Committee was one of the few chairmen, in my opinion, in the last Congress who undertook some oversight responsibility, and I commend him for that. I think we need to go further; we are going further; but I commend him for his recognition that oversight is a critical responsibility of this Congress, just as the referee is a critically important component of any football game or basketball game. 
   So I thank him for what he has done in the past. I thank him for his cooperation in working with our chairman on the three bills that we passed this week so far, and I would hope that we can pass this bill. If we make it better in conference, that's fine; but this is a good bill and an important bill, and I thank the gentleman for his efforts.

   On the D.C. bill, they are marking up right now, so I am in the same position, because they haven't finished their markup. They are marking up as we speak on that bill.

   Mr. HOYER. I appreciate your yielding and appreciate your observation. Although I am not now on the Appropriations Committee, you are correct, I served there for 25 years. I am on leave. I have no expectation of going back soon, I hope. 
   In any event, the gentleman is correct. As you know, the bill we are talking about is probably, as we discussed on the floor, one of, if not the most important bill that we might consider this year on funding our troops, supporting our troops in Iraq, and dealing with the policy that we are pursuing in Iraq. 
   Obviously there is a broad spectrum of views on that. Just as obviously, if you had some bills that in many instances come with an open rule, very frankly, I don't know about your experience, but our experience has been that there are a wide range of views. 
   It may well be that we will solicit a request for possible amendments and make decisions on them, because this is, to some degree, as you know, not a straight appropriations bill in the sense that this is where the money is, in or out, up or down. This is a consideration of policy and authorizing bills. Usually the tradition is to have amendments offered in the Rules Committee and the Rules Committee determines which amendments they want to make in order. 
   I cannot anticipate what we are going to do at this point in time. The gentleman's point is well taken, but we will have to see how we want to bring to this floor to try to reflect in the final product, as best we can, the views of the American people, which are divided, and I think will be reflected in the floor vote on that bill.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal). 
   I want to say at the outset that I am pleased that Mr. McCrery is on the floor. There will be other times to say this, but Mr. McCrery is one of the respected Members of this House. I think he serves us well as ranking member of the Ways and Means. I know he'd rather be chairman of the Ways and Means, but we like him as ranking member. He has indicated he is not going to be with us in the next Congress. That's regrettable because he is one of the good Members of this Congress, and I want to say that to my friend. 
   Now, let me talk about the question at hand. Mr. Speaker, we debate here in the House, and many Americans have the opportunity to see this debate. This debate is a relatively simple  debate. It's not just about the alternative minimum tax or the consequences of not putting a so-called patch, and nobody in America knows what that means but simply it means saying that the alternative minimum tax won't affect 25 or so million people in America. None of us on either side of the aisle want that to happen. The issue is not whether or not any of us feel that ought to happen. It is do you pay for it? Do you provide for the revenue fix that will be necessary if we cut that revenue? 
   Let me say to my friend from Louisiana, he has said a number of times on this floor that the President didn't count the revenue for this year from the AMT. He didn't provide the money to pay for it. He simply didn't anticipate the revenue. What he did not say, however, is that the President did anticipate the revenue for the next 9 years. Furthermore, the President anticipated in 2006 that we would have the revenue generated by the AMT in the year we're going to so-called fix, so that the administration sent us a budget counting on this revenue that we are about to say we won't receive. 
   So I tell my friend from Louisiana, it is somewhat misleading, I think, not intentionally, I understand, to say that the President didn't rely on the revenue for this budget. That's true. He relied on it last year and the year before that and the year before that and the year before that and the year before that and in 2001. And he relied on it, I tell my friend, to offset your tax cuts because, as you recall, in your 2003 tax cut, part of the revenue that was anticipated was this revenue that the gentleman says he does not want to collect and that the President is not relying on for 2007. He's accurate but in a very narrow sense, because the President has relied upon it every other year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely correct and that's my point. But in previous years the President has told us in his budget this revenue would be available, and he has relied on that to offset what would otherwise be larger deficits either as a result of tax cuts or of spending. He has relied on this money. 
   So what we are saying on this side of the aisle is let's pay for the revenue that the President anticipated if we're not going to take it, and none of us want to take the revenue that is generated by the alternative minimum tax in this fiscal year.     
   So, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't pay for it, what do we do? Because the President relied upon it in previous budgets, and, frankly, the Congress did as well on both sides of the aisle. If that revenue does not come in and we don't pay for it, there is only one thing to do: borrow. And this administration has borrowed more money from foreigners than any administration in history all together. From Washington to Clinton, all together they didn't borrow as much money as this President has borrowed from foreign governments and put our country at risk. We're saying let's stop that. And in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen of this House, we said let's stop that. Who's ``we''? President Bush, the Democratic House and the Democratic Senate said let's stop that, and we adopted PAYGO. And in 1997 we had another agreement, and a Democratic President and a Republican Congress said let's continue that policy because we believe it's a good policy. 
   And just a few years ago, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, Jim Nussle, who is now the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said PAYGO is a policy that has worked, and we ought to pursue it. But as my friend knows, in 2001, we simply abandoned PAYGO. Why did we abandon PAYGO? Because demonstratively it had worked. For the previous 4 years we had, for the first time in the lifetime of anybody in this House of Representatives, had 4 budget years in a row that produced a surplus. Four. Why? Because we had a PAYGO in place. Why? Because when we wanted to take actions, we had to have the consequences of our actions and tell the American public it was not a free lunch. We would have to pay for it. 
   That's simply what this bill does. It pursues the policy of fiscal responsibility. It abandons the policy of fiscal irresponsibility and the pretense that there is a free lunch that we have been pursuing for the last 7 years and incurred that $1.6 trillion, give or take $100 billion, in the last 7 years. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this House, no one wants to have a tax increase for these 25 million people. It was never intended. But some of my Republican colleagues say we didn't intend this, so we ought not to pay for it. That's like saying I didn't intend to run the stop sign and have an accident, and therefore, we don't have to pay for the consequences. We have relied on this money, the President has relied on this money. But we're saying we're not going to collect it, but we will responsibly pay for it. 
   In closing, let me say that CHARLIE RANGEL likes to quote Russell Long, who said, ``Don't tax me. Don't tax thee. Tax the man behind the tree.'' Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the policies that we pursue are not taxing me and not taxing thee, but taxing the children and the grandchildren behind the tree. 
   It takes courage to pay for things. The largest expansion in entitlement programs in the last 25 years was done with hardly any Democratic votes and all Republican votes, and it wasn't paid for. We were told that it was within the budget. It wasn't. It wasn't paid for. Our children and grandchildren will pay that bill. 
   Have the courage, the wisdom, and the good common sense to adopt this legislation, and urge our colleagues in the other body to share that courage, to share that common sense to morally step up to the plate and have this generation pay for what it buys. Pass this important bill and pay for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I was not going to participate in this debate, but the gentleman from New Jersey doesn't fully understand what we've been about for the last 2 months. He talked about the rank and file. Mr. Dingell, the senior Member of this House, myself, Senator Baucus, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Members of the rank and file on your side of the aisle who had not voted for this bill and didn't vote to override the veto. Mr. Barton was in some of those meetings. Mr. Deal was in some of those meetings. We met for almost 100 hours with rank-and-file Members on your side because we felt so strongly we wanted to address some of the issues of concern. 
   We haven't gotten there yet, but I want to tell the gentleman, first of all, he says this bill is not for indigent children.     
   Medicaid is for indigent children. This is for children of hardworking Americans who are not making enough because either their employer doesn't provide insurance or they can't afford the insurance to cover their children. We tried very, very hard. I defy you, and you haven't been here that long, I understand that, but I defy you to find another instance where that many hours has been put in by such senior Members, including two of the most senior Republicans in the United States Senate who voted for this bill, as did 18 of their colleagues in the United States Senate, and 44 of your colleagues here voted for this bill, and 45 for the previous bill. This is a very significant bipartisan bill. 
   And this bill responded to some of the concerns raised by the President. You continue to talk about adults. There are parents on here at the States' choice, as you know. Your State's choice, my State's choice. However, we precluded, as you know, in this bill nonparents, and rather than a 2-year phaseout, we did a 1-year phaseout. We responded to the President's concern about $83,000. We capped it at 300 percent. We responded to the question of trying to identify and to make sure that we add people who are authorized to be in this country. 
   So I think the gentleman's comments about the Democratic Party, or Democrat, as he likes to refer to us, is totally inaccurate, I will tell my friend. We've worked very hard. Why have we worked very hard? Because we think that 4 million children who the President of the United States in 2004 got on the Republican National Convention floor seeking the votes of all of his fellow citizens to be re-elected as President of the United States, said, I want to add millions of children currently eligible to this program who are not yet served. I tell my friend that's what this bill does. That's why we are so surprised and disappointed that the President rejected this bill and vetoed it and said, as the Speaker said, I forbid this bill going into effect and adding those 4 million children.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I always think my friend from Arizona is so rational, and I thought he was today. I always appreciate his remarks. It's a shame that together we have not reached what I think we need to reach, whether it's on entitlements, which are obviously an extraordinary challenge, or on discretionary spending, or on taxes, on revenues, on paying for what we buy. 
   The flower-strewn path unpricked by reason. Nineteen years of Republican Presidents during my term in the Congress of the United States have presided. They're the one person in the United States of America that can stop spending in its tracks. The only person. Nineteen years of Republican Presidents, $4.13 trillion of deficit spending and $1.68 trillion of that has been in the last 6 years. Eight years under Bill Clinton, $62.9 billion-surplus. That is the 27 years that I have been in the Congress of the United States. 
   Now you can attribute that to all sorts of things, but I attribute it to the fact that Democrats have taken the position we ought to pay for what we buy and we ought to have responsible budgets. The Republicans have not passed a budget except for once in an election year. If we pass this one, as surely I hope we will, it will be a precedent. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the chairman of the Budget Committee, John Spratt. I also want to congratulate the ranking member, who I don't see on the floor, but who is a responsible Member of this body. I disagree with him on some things but he engages in the debate in a responsible way. 
   I want to thank the members of the Blue Dog Coalition as well for their work, patience, and commitment to passing this budget conference report. This is the first budget adopted in an election year since 2000, the last time we were before this administration, and it is a signal accomplishment of this Congress and a demonstration of our ability to govern effectively. 
   This conference report is the continuation of the Democratic majority's effort to turn away from this administration's failed policies. In fact, the most reckless fiscal policies in the history of our Nation. 
   As the father of three grandchildren and as the grandfather of a great-grandchild, I am extraordinarily concerned about that. We have two young women sitting next to my colleague and friend, Congressman Rogers. I don't know whether they are grandchildren. They are grandchildren. We have put those young children who sit here, these beautiful young women, deeply into debt. This budget is about keeping them out of further debt. 
   Let's remember, President Bush and the former Republican majorities in Congress turned a projected budget surplus of $5.6 trillion, and was that a real surplus? It was not. It was a projection for 10 years. Nobody really knows what's going to happen in 10 years. But it was a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion, on which the Bush administration relied, and in reliance on it, did some things that were extraordinarily irresponsible. 
   We are now more than $3 trillion in additional debt in just 6 years. We went from $5.9 trillion of debt to now $9.8 trillion. Almost $4 trillion, which is to say an 80 percent increase in the indebtedness of this Nation in 84 months while the Republicans enjoyed 6 years of hegemony. Total, absolute control. 
   Yet some of our Republican friends complain, audaciously so, that this budget conference report includes an increase in the debt limit. How soon  they forget. They forget or, more accurately, they deliberately ignore that they increased the debt limit four times in 5 years. Under Bill Clinton's Presidency, during his last 4 years the debt was increased not once. Not once. The debt limit increase included in this conference report is a direct result, a direct and predictable result of the fiscally irresponsible, failed policies of the Republican party, policies that could not be changed overnight. 
   Nevertheless, congressional Democrats have proposed a fiscally responsible conference report that returns our Federal budget to balance by 2012 and abides by the pay-as-you-go budget rules that we reinstated in January, 2007, which were abandoned in 2001. Why? Because you could not and did not have the courage to pay for your tax cuts. 
   The only way you could pass your reduction of revenues was to waive PAYGO because you did not have the courage of convictions, nor the votes of your conference to cut spending by the amount you cut revenue. To-wit: Exploding debt. 
   It's a budget that meets the critical needs of our people, making investments to keep America safe, to boost economic growth, and create jobs, to provide tax relief, and to help families struggling in the Bush economy. This budget matches the President's request for defense, while shifting funds to high priorities, such as nuclear nonproliferation programs. It increases homeland security funding over the President's request. And it rejects the President's proposed cuts to first responder-programs, who, in any emergency caused by terrorists or by natural events, will be the first responders. 
   It increases funding for veterans health care by $3.7 billion, increases funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives so we can become energy independent, as well as funding for scientific innovation, education, training and social services to grow our economy, create jobs and make the lives of our people better. 
   Furthermore, it accommodates an immediate and long-term fix to the alternative minimum tax and additional middle class tax relief. Middle class tax relief in this budget. 
   Finally, this conference report rejects the President's harmful cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, State and local law enforcement programs, such as COPS, and to Environmental Protection Agency grants to protect public health. It also rejects the President's proposal to increase fees for veterans and military retirees by $18 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majorities in this Congress inherited a fiscal debacle last year. Today, through this budget conference report, we continue to address it and to meet the critical priorities of the American people. 
   This is a budget that we can be proud of. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for fiscal responsibility, vote for the appropriate priorities for our country, vote for a brighter future for our children, vote for the conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I had the great privilege of being elected to the Maryland State Senate in 1966. There were two other individuals--there were a lot of other individuals, but there were two other individuals who were elected with me. The other two were elected to the House of Delegates. One of those was BENJAMIN CARDIN, who is now Maryland's junior United States Senator. The other individual elected that had same year was Paul Sarbanes. 
   Paul Sarbanes served for 4 years, then was elected to the House in 1970, served in the House for 6 years, and in 1976 was elected to the United States Senate. I was in the State Senate and had the privilege of working hard for his election that year. He served longer than any other individual representing our State, and one of the programs that he fostered was the program that we are reauthorizing today. 
   He can swell with pride not only on the substance of this legislation but also on the fact that his extraordinary son, who now represents a district that he used to represent, the Third Congressional District of our State, is now sponsoring and shepherding this legislation through the House of Representatives. 
   My colleagues have spoken about the substance of this legislation. John Smith in 1607 came up a bay that was pristine and essentially unspoiled. In the next 400 years, man, in his somewhat irresponsibility, has not husbanded that asset that God gave us as he should or as she should. 
   This legislation, sponsored by Senator Sarbanes many years ago, now shepherded by his son, Congressman JOHN SARBANES, was an effort to ensure that we understood what Congressman Gilchrest talked about and the importance of this asset we call the Chesapeake Bay, not just to Maryland, not just to Pennsylvania or Delaware or Virginia, but to our country. An extraordinary ecological resource. 
   So I rise simply not to recite what my colleagues have already recited but to congratulate JOHN SARBANES, to say how proud we are, as I know he is as well, of the extraordinary service given to our State by his father, Senator  Paul Sarbanes, the original author of this legislation, and to thank him for carrying this torch forward on behalf of a resource that is priceless, as the ad says. 
   So I thank him for yielding this time, congratulate him for his efforts, and urge my colleagues to strongly support this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5540, legislation introduced by Representative John Sarbanes which seeks to permanently reauthorize the National Park Service's Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network Program. 
   Those of us fortunate to live in this region have been blessed with a multitude of magnificent natural resources, not the least of which is our Nation's largest estuary--the Chesapeake Bay, a body of water that has played such an important role in shaping the cultural, economic, political, and social history of our region. 
   Unfortunately, the Chesapeake Bay of 2008 is not the pristine body that Captain John Smith first charted on his expeditions some 400 years ago. Indeed, earlier this year, the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program released the Chesapeake Bay 2007 Health and Restoration Assessment which found the overall health of the bay remains significantly impaired. 
   In the 110th Congress, I have joined with my colleagues in successfully advocating legislation to improve the health of the bay. 
   We've strengthened the ability of the Army Corps of Engineers to undertake bay oyster restoration, water pollution control, and environmental infrastructure projects in the 2007 WRDA bill. And, we've included approximately $438 million in mandatory funding to help Chesapeake Bay watershed farmers in their ongoing efforts to implement practices to prevent runoff and control shoreline erosion. 
   H.R. 5540, the legislation we consider today, takes another important step forward in our efforts by permanently authorizing a program that has already done so much to raise awareness of the fragile health of the bay and directly engage our region's citizens and visitors to take an active role in fulfilling our shared goal of restoring the Chesapeake. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 156 museums, State parks, wildlife refuges and other sites in 6 States and the District of Columbia, was established to link together these wonderful places in the hopes of enabling visitors to better understand and appreciate the role they can play in the bay's survival. 
   The program enables sites to compete for grant funding--which must be fully matched--for projects that will help conserve, restore and interpret their roles in the bay's natural, cultural, and social history. 
   The Gateways Program is a critical component to fostering a commitment among our citizens to restore the bay and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. HOYER. I am reasonably confident it will be sometime next week. It is my hope it will be earlier in the week rather than later in the week. But I cannot say that at this point in time. There's still work being done on the bill. Chairman Obey is working very hard on a draft proposal that can be enacted in a short time frame. 
   We are aware of the time constraints of which the gentleman spoke. I anticipate we will include a package of items that we believe are a cost of the war, the GI benefits that have been discussed, and also items that address a small number of pressing needs. We are strong believers in PAYGO, as you know, but we understand that we have to deal with the other body and the White House, who has not supported that effort. We are sometimes not in agreement with their position, and we will have to keep working on that issue. I know Mr. Obey is working hard on that.

   Again, I would reiterate, as you know, we feel very strongly that the  new entitlement program for the GIs, which is something we strongly support, but ought to be paid for as a new entitlement so that it does not add to the debt. 
   The Senate did not agree with that proposition. As a result, that is not in the bill that has come back to us from the Senate. So we are currently trying to figure out what to do on this issue, but we feel very strongly that the GI Bill ought to be adopted one way or the other.

   Mr. HOYER. Not next week. Although, as you know, we passed a major energy bill last year that was signed by the President that looks to real solutions to the problem of reliance on petroleum products and that is relying on alternative energy sources. We believe strongly on this side of the aisle that both from an environmental standpoint, a global warming standpoint, and an energy independence standpoint that looking to alternatives is absolutely essential. 
   As you know, gas prices have risen very, very substantially during the course of the last 7 1/2 years. As I have indicated before, during the 8 years of the Clinton Presidency, they rose approximately a nickel a year, from $1.06 to $1.46. Under this administration, they have gone from that $1.46 to now $3.86, $3.90, $4, and over $4. 
   I know your contention is that it has just been in the last 12 months that this has happened. We disagree with that proposition. It's an interesting proposition to try to sell to the American public. But the bottom line is, frankly, for the last 35 years, since the late seventies when we had the long gas lines, we have not moved to alternative energy sources in the way we should have, in my view, so that we could not be held hostage by some, frankly, who have profit, understandably, in mind, but not necessarily the best interests of our consumers or our country. We support a diversified clean energy portfolio for our country. 
   I want to make an observation because I have been listening today with interest. You may find this of interest. We have nearly a whole refineries' worth of capacity idle right now. Not for lack of supply, but for lack of use of existing refineries. As a matter of fact, we are at 87 percent, which is about 10 percent below what we usually are over the last 10 years. So for whatever reasons, refiners are now at 10 percent below the capacity they usually are on average over the last 10 years at this time. 
   Secondly, since 2000, drilling on land has increased dramatically. Your side of the aisle has talked a lot about how we need more capacity to drill. I will tell you that since 2000, drilling on land has increased dramatically, climbing 66 percent. A two-thirds increase. Notwithstanding that increased drilling, gas prices have increased. 
   In addition to that, I will tell my friend that oil and gas companies hold leases to nearly 68 million acres of Federal land and waters on which they are not producing oil and gas. It is our belief and experts' belief that these 68 million acres of leased but currently inactive Federal lands and waters could produce an additional 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day. That is existing leases on existing land that are not being used today. 
   As a matter of fact, well less than half of the currently authorized leased land for oil drilling is not being used. It would nearly double if we did that total U.S. oil production and increased domestic natural gas production, by 75 percent. That is without a single new lease or single new drilling authorization being passed. 
   It would also, of course, cut U.S. oil imports by more than a third and be more than six times the estimated peak production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that is discussed so much on your side of the aisle. 
   So while we are trying to focus on understanding what effect high prices have today and what manipulation may be going on in the marketplace today that is impacting on prices, we do continue to focus on the long-term solution, which is not, frankly, looking at petroleum products, which are a wasting resource and which will not in your lifetime and my lifetime but in our grandchildren's lifetime not be the source of energy to either power our cars or our economy but alternative sources of energy. 
   We look forward to working with you on all of those. We believe that there is a lot of excess capacity in refining, excess capacity on leases for oil and for natural gas that currently exists that, for whatever reasons, are not being pursued now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I am pleased to be here with all of you young people. 
   About, well, 45 years ago I was about 5 years older than you are now and I started working on this Hill for a Member of Congress. His office was on the sixth floor of the Longworth Building. You know enough about our offices to know that he was a junior Member, being placed on the sixth floor of the Longworth Building, those spacious offices that you have visited with various different items from time to time. 
   I had an opportunity, not as intimately as you have had because I did not have access to the floor as somebody working in an office, but I did have the opportunity to see the Members, to talk to some of the Members, to see what they were doing. 
   You have had an opportunity that very, very few Americans will ever have. I presume most of you are 16 years of age. Maybe some have reached 17. Maybe some are late 15. In any event, you average 16 years of age. As Mr. Kildee pointed out, you have seen firsthand the best and the not-so-very best. To that extent, hopefully you have said, you know, they are a lot like us. Sometimes we are really good, and then sometimes not quite as good as we would like to be. 
   Because you have had this special window on your democracy, we call this the people's House. It is the people's House because every 2 years we have to go back to the people and get their imprimatur. We call it a vote. We have to be rehired. The Founding Fathers established that so we would stay in close touch with the people and reflect their hopes, their aspirations, yes, even their fears, their angst and sometimes their prejudices. 
   But we are a representative body. And there are too many people frankly around the country who don't have a lot of faith in this body and who don't think it works very well, and they see us on television largely in confrontation. You have seen us more at work and cooperation than sometimes happens on this floor. 
   So, on behalf of both my friend Mr. Boehner and myself and Speaker Pelosi, I would urge you to go home to your respective schools, your respective communities, your respective families, and talk to your peers about your experience. Some of it will be perhaps not quite as positive as some of us would like. 
   But my experience has been, as President of the Senate when I was in charge of the Page Program in the Maryland State Senate and here, that the overwhelming majority of you will go from this place with a very positive view of how our people work, the passion they bring to their commitment to representing their community, and the integrity they have with respect to the issues that they argue on behalf of.     
   Do they all believe the same? No. Any more than all of you believe the same. I know there have been no debates in the dorms. I know that all of you have said, yes, we agree 100 percent. And if I thought that, I would think you were a strange group of people indeed. 
   You have been here at an historic time. Young women, you must be extraordinarily proud of the fact that for the first time in history we have a woman leading this body. Now, we have a woman presiding officer right now, she is from Florida, Ms. Castor, but we have a Speaker of the House who is a woman. And African Americans, you must be extraordinarily proud that for the first time in history we have an African American who is the nominee, presumptive, but is going to be the nominee of one of the major parties. And you can also be proud of the fact that we have a gentleman, John McCain, who served his country in war, and served as a prisoner of war for 5 years experiencing very substantial physical abuse, and came back to America as a young man and rose now to be his party's presumptive nominee for President of the United States. What an historic time for you to have served here in the House. 
   And I say served, because, frankly, the work of this House was facilitated by everything you have done. Sometimes the tasks may have seemed simple, but they were important to us accomplishing the people's business. And so on behalf of Mr. Boehner and myself and Mr. Blunt and Mr. Clyburn and Speaker Pelosi, I thank all of you for the work you have done, for the kindnesses that you have shown us; and I hope you in turn feel that you have received from us the courtesy and respect you deserve as outstanding representatives of your generation that may in time be referred to as well as one of the greatest generations.  
   Thank you for your service. God bless and good luck.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this legislation that is before us will fund our government this calendar year. That was not done last year. Would that it had been done sooner. Would that it had addressed the priorities that we believe the American public supported strongly in November of last year. Would that we were investing the appropriate amounts in education, in health care, in the environment and community health centers and NIH basic biomedical research. Would that we funded them at reasonable levels. 
   The President indicated that he was going to veto, as Mr. Lewis said, a bill that was not at his figures. I have observed that this President believes that his budget was sent down on tablets, not on paper. I think that's unfortunate. 
   The Constitution of the United States, of course, gives to the Congress of the United States sole authority to set policies for the United States. In fact, our Founding Fathers never contemplated the budget autonomy that this administration has sought for itself. 
   However, having said that, as Mr. Obey, our chairman has said, rightfully, the votes are what they are. The necessity to come to compromise in a democracy is inescapable if, in fact, both sides can create stalemate. In this instance both sides could create stalemate. That is not, however, the objective of our side. We believe that we ought to, and have a responsibility to, fund our government. This bill does that. This bill does that after having passed all 12 of our appropriation bills prior to the August recess. Unfortunately, we find ourselves at this late date, however, not having completed all of our conference reports and having to move forward. 
   This bill is a relatively long bill, not the longest bill we will have considered in this manner, but a relatively long bill. It looks even longer if you only print on one side of the page to make a more dramatic presentation. 
   Having said that, this bill incorporates all of the bills that passed this house. This is not as if these are items of first impression. They are bills that we considered in this House and passed with essentially overwhelming bipartisan votes. 
   I remember when Mr. Lewis' side was in charge of the House and they got five or six Democrats to vote for it, it was a bipartisan bill. We've averaged 60 votes, if you take out the Legislative bill, on which essentially games were being played, and perhaps the Foreign Ops bill. You have over 60 average votes on the Republican side.     
   This is bipartisan legislation. Ninety-five percent of the bill that is presented here has been considered before. I want to congratulate Mr. Obey for the work that he's done. I want to congratulate Mr. Lewis for the work he's done. 
   More specifically, I want to thank the staff. The staff rightfully ought to be exhausted. This staff has spent unbelievable amounts of time in putting this bill together. 
   It is like every bill we pass, not a perfect bill. It is a bill, as Mr. Lewis said, that the President has indicated that he might possibly sign. That is, after all, the reality in a democratic environment, where you have the people, having selected a Democratic House, and as one of my friends observed the other day, they elected a third in the Senate. Two-thirds of the United States Senate was elected in 2002 and 2004. Only a third of the Senate was elected in this last election. So it may not be as reflective of the will of the American people as this House is. 
   This House did its business on time. This House passed responsible bills. Yes, it was $22 billion over. Mr. Lewis may be surprised to know that from 2002 to 2006 he spent more on discretionary spending. I know you are going to want to hear this figure: you spent a higher percentage of GDP on discretionary spending than these bills do. 
   We have invested. We believe the investments included in this bill are the minimal that we ought to make, and we're hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle can vote for this bill in a nonpartisan, bipartisan fashion. There will be some who vote against these bills because essentially they believe we ought not to be investing significant sums in education and in health care and public safety. The President's budget reflected that philosophy. That is not our philosophy. It's not the philosophy, we believe, of the American people. 
   So, my friends in this House, I would urge as we come to the end of this session that we pass this bill. It is not what each and every one of us wanted in this bill. There's more perhaps in  this bill than some want and less than some others want, but it is in the exercise of the democratic process the possible. It funds our government, it moves us forward, and it is worthy of our support. 
   I thank the chairman; and, yes, I thank the ranking member for their work, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this omnibus appropriation.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 643) recognizing September 11 as a day of remembrance, extending sympathies to those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and their families, honoring the heroic actions of our Nation's first responders and Armed Forces, and reaffirming the commitment to defending the people of the United States against any and all future challenges.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Members who rise tonight to speak on this important legislation do so not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as one, as Americans united in the defense of the great Nation and the ideals for which it stands: Freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law. 
   Six years ago, as all of us know, on September 11, 2001, it is a day, Mr. Speaker, that none of us will ever forget as long as we live. September 11 is seared into the American consciousness, much like December 7, 1941, and November 22, 1963, as a day of infamy, a day of unspeakable horror, a day of unmitigated evil, and yes, a day of incredible heroism. 
   On this eve of the sixth anniversary of September 11, this resolution, jointly introduced by myself as the majority leader and by Mr. Boehner as the Republican leader, recognizes this as a day of remembrance and resolve. 
   We remember the nearly 3,000 innocent men, women and children who lost their lives on September 11. And we extend, once again, our sympathies to their families, friends, and loved ones. 
   We honor the courage and heroic actions, service and sacrifice of our first responders; firemen, policemen, medical personnel, as well as our valiant servicemen and women who now are in harm's way thousands of miles from this Chamber. 
   Mr. Speaker, you will recall with me that 343 members of the New York Fire Department lost their lives on that day, in addition to the thousands of people who lost their lives in the two towers. Twenty-three New York policemen lost their lives, and 37 officers of the Port Authority of New York lost their lives on that day. 
   We must remember, however, that what they did, along with their colleagues in the fire department, the police department and the Port Authority Police, was saved tens of thousands of people who got out of the buildings before they collapsed. We lost people, of course, in the Pentagon as well, people from my district and districts throughout this country. 
   Today, we reaffirm our commitment to defending the American people against any and all future challenges. I mentioned the Pentagon. I mentioned  the World Trade Center. But a plane that perhaps, Mr. Speaker, was flying towards this Capitol, or perhaps the White House, was taken down by some brave Americans who learned what was happening that day through their cell phones. And they resolved, on that day, to give the last measure of devotion to their country by giving their lives that that plane might not reach its target but crash in the fields of Pennsylvania.     
   As this resolution states, Mr. Speaker, we remain steadfast in our determination to disrupt, dismantle and defeat terrorist organizations, and we will harness all elements of our national power: military, economic, diplomatic, and, yes, moral, to effect that defeat. 
   In the aftermath of September 11, Americans, awakened to the threat of international terrorism, collectively declared, Never again. And, over the last 6 years, thousands of Americans have worked tirelessly to improve our Nation's security and to protect our people. 
   Have we done enough? No. Do we need to do more? Yes. However, this Congress has passed, and the President has signed, numerous laws to assist victims, combat terrorism, protect our homeland and to support the members of our Armed Forces who defend our interests at home and abroad. 
   Perhaps none of these measures has been more important than the passage this year of H.R. 1, legislation implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Among other things, this legislation requires 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger aircraft and 100 percent screening of seaborne cargo before it gets to U.S. ports. It ensures that first responders can communicate with each other, improves rail and mass transit security, and seeks to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. 
   Without question, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 will help us harden our defenses and combat terrorism. However, no one should be mistaken: legislation alone cannot immunize our Nation from attack. 
   In fact, as the Chairs of the 9/11 Commission wrote just yesterday in The Washington Post: ``Six years later, we are safer in a narrow sense: we have not been attacked, and our defenses are better.'' But, as they point out, Mr. Speaker: ``We still have a long way to go.'' 
   It is therefore appropriate that we pass this resolution of remembrance. But it also must be a resolution of resolve that we will not allow the situation that existed on 9/11 to be maintained and, in fact, we have not. We are stronger; but as Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean pointed out, not yet strong enough. 
   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, let us recognize September 11 as a solemn reminder of our vulnerability. Let us also be reminded that we are part of something much larger than ourselves. We are the land of the free and the home of the brave, and the terrorists who sought to break our spirit only clarified our purpose and steeled our resolve. Mr. Speaker, may God continue to bless our great country. 
   I have talked to a reporter just a few minutes ago. That reporter, Max Cacas, was listening to Leader Gephardt and Speaker Hastert on that September 11, 2001, on the Capitol steps, state our resolve. Then, Mr. Speaker, you may recall, the Members spontaneously sang ``God Bless America.'' It was a prayer and it was a resolve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important resolution. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee might manage the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING 9/11 REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, as you know, we will not be in session tomorrow night. 
   Many of us remember some 6 years ago when we first had a meeting in the Capitol Police headquarters, many of us, after the traumatic morning and afternoon; and we resolved that we would show to the country a unity and a resolve that the terrorist attack would neither cow us nor deter us from the defense of freedom and liberty and our country and its people. 
   We are now, of course, 6 years later and continue to be involved in a battle to defeat those who by terror would intimidate us and hurt our people and our country and our way of life. 
   In a moment we will be led by Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner to the front steps of the Capitol. We will have a brief ceremony to again show to the country and, indeed, to the world that while we may have differences in debate, there are no differences in our unity of purpose to defend our country, our Constitution, and our people, and to ensure that the friends of liberty around the world will know that they have a friend in the United States of America. 
   So I would ask all of you to join us as Speaker Pelosi and Leader Boehner lead us out to the front steps on the House side. We will organize there, stand, and we will be led in the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' by the United States Marine Corps Band. We will have some comments by the Speaker and by the leader, and then we will conclude, as we did on that evening 6 years ago, with the singing of ``God Bless America.'' I think that was one of the most moving moments in my service in the House of Representatives. I am sure that many of you feel the same way. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the House will remain in session, but we would ask all Members to join, as I said, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Boehner, and myself on the front steps of the Capitol. We will proceed now.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EXPRESSING DEEP CONCERN OVER THE USE OF CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, last summer, Hezbollah militants kidnapped two Israeli soldiers and instigated an armed conflict in which they indiscriminately fired thousands of rockets and mortar shells into Israel with the hope of inflicting as many civilian casualties as possible. 
   And what was most disturbing about Hezbollah's actions was not that they targeted innocent men, women, and children with their attacks--the world has come to expect such cowardly tactics from terrorist organizations that are dedicated to inflicting anguish and destruction. 
   Rather, it was the fact that Hezbollah embedded their equipment and bases of operations amid the Lebanese civilian population--effectively using them as ``human shields'' to protect them from retaliation. 
   This brutal exploitation of a civilian population--and others like it that take place all too often in areas controlled by Hezbollah and Hamas--stands in direct violation of international humanitarian law and laws of war during armed conflict. 
   Today, I am proud to join with my fellow Members of Congress in condemning the use of human shields in armed conflict--and I stand with all of the people of the world who understand that the role of a soldier is to protect civilians, not exploit them for security or political gain.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not cut and run. It's think and succeed. It's a good policy to try. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight this House will adopt this reasonable conference report that fully funds our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and that responds to the will of the American people, who are demanding, demanding, that our Nation change course. I urge all of our Members here, on both sides of the aisle, to support this bill. 
   After the Senate passes this conference report and it is sent to the White House, I urge and implore the President to sign this bill, even though he seems determined to veto this legislation, thereby defying the will of the American people, 70 percent of whom disapprove of his handling of the war in Iraq. 
   I know there is not a Member in this body who does not pray for our success in Iraq and for the safe return of our brave servicemen and women who serve us there. However, we cannot ignore the facts. After the loss of more than 3,300 American soldiers and nearly 25,000 injured, and after the expenditure of more than $400 billion, which will be after the end of this fiscal year some $600 billion, on a war now in its fifth year, even President Bush and Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledge that our efforts are not succeeding. 
   The Defense Department has concluded that the situation in Iraq is ``properly descriptive of a civil war.'' The Army Chief of Staff has issued warnings about the effect of the war on America's overall military readiness. And the Iraq Government has failed to meet political goals, such as reversing debaathification, drafting a plan for national reconciliation and disbanding militias, all of which are essential if we are to reach a political solution, as General Petraeus says is necessary. 
   In fact, last week, six ministers loyal to Muqtada al Sadr withdrew from the Iraqi Government, imperiling the chances of political resolution, which General Petraeus, as I said, says is imperative because, quoting again General Petraeus, ``There is no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq.'' General Petraeus: ``There is no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq.'' 
   Meanwhile, the violence in Iraq continues. In just the last 2 weeks, a suicide attack inside the Iraqi Parliament killed eight, and spectacular car bombs, which occur almost daily, have killed hundreds. 
   Thus, Mr. Speaker, the question before the Members again today is this: Will we change direction in Iraq, or will we continue to stay the course with a failing policy? That is the question before this House tonight. 
   The answer, I think, is clear. After 4 years of rubber-stamping this administration's failed policy, not a service to the American people, this Congress must insist on accountability and a new direction. As the Speaker has said, more blank checks from this Congress would constitute an abdication of our responsibility and of our duty. 
   In short, this conference report protects our troops, requiring deployments to adhere to existing Defense Department standards. Mr. Murtha has not adopted these standards, nor has Mr. Obey, nor have any of us on this side of the aisle. These are Defense Department standards for training, acquiring equipment and armor, while allowing the President to waive those standards that are the Defense Department standards if, in his judgment, national security requires it. How much  more responsible a position can we take? 
   The conference report holds the Iraqi Government accountable. I think that reflects the sentiments of the American people, who believe that the Iraqis need to step up and take responsibility. What Secretary Gates said was if we do not have a consequence of not taking responsibility, they will not do it. 
   In fact, even if Mr. Maliki wants to do it, he will not be able to get the disparate factions in Iraq to do it, unless they feel a necessity to do it. We've seen that here in this Congress. That's democracy at work. So this is an assistance to the Iraqi Government to bring people together, because it says if you don't, there is a consequence. The American public supports that alternative. 
   And it includes a responsible strategy for a phased redeployment of U.S. forces and refocuses, refocuses our efforts on fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. There is nobody in this Congress who does not want to nor is not committed to confronting and defeating terrorism. No one should be misled by the false claims of those who argue that we must follow the same failing stay-the-course strategy. This bill does not constitute capitulation or micromanaging this war. 
   This may sound harsh, but had somebody told Custer that you are not supporting the troops unless you leave them here, they would have been wrong. As retired General Paul Eaton, who was in charge of training the Iraqi military in 2003 and 2004 recently stated, ``This bill gives General Petraeus great leverage for moving the Iraqi Government down the more disciplined path laid out by the Iraq Study Group. The real audience for the timeline language is Prime Minister Maliki,'' as I have said, ``and the elected Government of Iraq.'' So concluded Paul Eaton, the general in charge of training Iraqis in 2003 and 2004. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want and deserve a Congress that holds the Iraqis accountable for making progress. The American people are paying a steep price; our children are paying a steep price for this war. They haven't been given the bill yet, but they will be. And our young men and women, and not so young men and women, are paying with their lives, with their limbs, and with their health. 
   The American people want and deserve, as I have said, a Congress that holds the Iraqis accountable, that holds the administration accountable for implementing a policy designed to succeed. This conference report gives us that opportunity. 
   I urge all of my colleagues, on every side of the aisle, from whatever party, support this conference report. I urge the President, when we pass this conference report, when the Senate passes it and we send it to the President, sign this conference report. It fully funds our troops, it does not micromanage the war, it tells the Iraqis we expect accountability; because if they take accountability, our troops will be safer, our country will be better off and Iraq will be on the path to democracy that we hope for her and pray for her.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend Mr. Ackerman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership and commitment for decades to issues of human rights, humanitarian concerns, and peace. 
   I thank my friend BARBARA LEE who has been such an extraordinary leader. She worked for a gentleman that is a great hero of mine, Ron Dellums, who, when he was on this floor raised his voice for peace, raised his voice on behalf of the dispossessed, raised his voice on behalf of those who were under attack. BARBARA LEE has continued that very strong voice in representing that district. She is one of the experts in this House on issues relating to Africa, issues relating to AIDS, and on efforts to attain peace and securing this world for the citizens of this world. 
   I am also, Madam Speaker, very pleased to join my friend CHRIS SMITH. I had the privilege of cochairing the Helsinki Commission with Mr. Smith for a number of years and serving with him for 15 years on the Helsinki Commission before I became the minority whip and took leave from the commission. I want to thank him. Not only in a collegial sense does he participate in these matters, but probably as much as any Member in this House of the 435 and the literally, probably, 2,000 that he and I have served with over the years has personally, individually, gone to some of the most troubled spots in the world. No publicity, no large delegation, no Air Force plane; I am going to speak briefly about the fact that we were able, but on his own. 
   He and FRANK WOLF, two of our Members who have gone to people in trouble and at risk and taken their hand and heard their story and brought it back and exposed it to the light of day. I thank Mr. Smith for his leadership over the more than two decades, almost a quarter of a century that he and I have served together in this House. 
   This is a serious issue. 
   I want to congratulate JERRY MORAN. JERRY MORAN had not been on many codels or traveled. BARBARA LEE came over to me as he was speaking and said he got the message. 
   That is why we travel. Sometimes the public thinks that traveling is just a junket. Going to Darfur is no junket. Living in Darfur is much worse. 
   When I determined that I was going to take a delegation overseas as my first trip as majority leader of this House, I thought that I wanted to go to someplace where it was important that we tell the world that we thought they ought to be paying attention to. The world has been paying attention to it, so many people have gone to Darfur. But we went to Darfur, 11 of us went to Darfur, myself, BARBARA LEE from California, JERRY MORAN from Kansas, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN as the ranking Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, GREG MEEKS from New York, BRAD MILLER from North Carolina, G.K. BUTTERFIELD from North Carolina, BOB GOODLATTE from Virginia, RAY LAHOOD from Illinois, JOHN BARROW from Georgia, and JIM COSTA from California. A delegation of Democrats and Republicans who, when the plane took off from Andrews Air Force Base, flew not as Republicans or Democrats, but flew as Americans, flew as Americans who were concerned about humanitarian distress. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California, Congresswoman Lee, for her hard work in bringing this important bipartisan resolution to the floor this morning and for her dedicated leadership in focusing attention on the continuing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Davis from Illinois for yielding. I particularly want to thank my good friend, CAROLYN MALONEY, the distinguished Representative from New York, who has been such a giant on behalf of this issue and family issues generally. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body, from the most conservative to the most liberal, shares the conviction that the surest way to improve the quality of life in our Nation is to strengthen our families. Strong families enhance well-being, improve children's self-esteem, and significantly increase the odds that children will succeed in school and grow up to be good parents themselves. 
   Study after study shows that a strong predictor of child well-being is the degree to which a parent and child bond in the first months of a child's birth. The more constant and nurturing that bond is in the early months of life, the better off the child will be down the road. That is why this is such an incredibly important piece of legislation. 
   The Federal Government, in many ways, as an employer, has been a leader, not a follower, a leader in efforts to ensure positive employee policies. In fact, the private sector has adopted many of these same policies. 
   We all know that the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act has been an outstanding success in helping to promote healthy families. So this is not so much about the mother or the father, it is about the child, and the sense of well-being and groundedness that the child has. 
   Unfortunately, all too often people who have availed themselves of the law to take care of their newborns, or care for ailing parents, have had to make economic sacrifices because the Family and Medical Leave Act does not entitle anyone to receive an income. 
   Now, very frankly, it's all good and well for most of us, or all of us that serve in this body to say, well, we could take off 6 weeks without pay. Most of us could do that. Certainly my good friend Mr. Issa could do that. I could do it. 
   But very frankly, I have three daughters, and they may be able to rely on Dad to help them do it, but if Dad were not able to do it, they would not be able to do it. They've all had the opportunity to spend time with my three grandchildren as those grandchildren were born in early years, and that was not only beneficial to my grandchildren, it was beneficial to the community in which they will live. 
   Currently, the Federal Government does not provide paid parental leave to its employees. Employees must use accrued annual and sick leave if they want to maintain an income stream while they're out. 
   By providing 4 weeks of paid leave to Federal employees, which, by the way, most Members of Congress already do, for their employees for the birth and adoption of a child, H.R. 5781 recognizes that economic security is a critical ingredient in ensuring that parental leave succeeds. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is the Nation's largest employer. It should set a strong, positive example for how the needs of the workplace and the needs of the employees can be balanced, and indeed, the needs of the children can be met. H.R. 5781 is an important step in doing just that. 
   Again, I congratulate CAROLYN MALONEY, who has been a real leader on this effort for her entire career in the Congress of the United States. I'm so pleased to be her ally in this effort. 
   I also want to turn to my friend, TOM DAVIS, who himself has been a giant, along with FRANK WOLF, and a partner of mine, in promoting the well-being and appropriate benefits for our Federal employees, on whom this country relies in so many ways to give them a government that is a partner with our private sector in maintaining the greatest country on the face of the earth. And I thank Mr. Davis for his leadership. 
   I'm sorry Mr. Davis will be leaving us at the end of the year and will not be serving in the next Congress. And I will say, I am sure, many times, how beneficial his service has been to Federal employees, and how beneficial his service has been to the Washington metropolitan region and, indeed, to the country. And I thank him for his leadership on this particular effort.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished Speaker for recognizing me for this delightful opportunity. 
   Madam Speaker, you will appreciate this as much as anybody in this House. I was elected in a special election on January of 1981, actually May of 1981. The Maryland delegation had eight members. Fifty percent of the members of the Maryland House were women, Mrs. Holt, a Republican, Mrs. Spellman, my predecessor who had a cardiac arrest and her seat was declared vacant, Mrs. Byron, a distinguished wife and daughter-in-law of two Members of Congress, and actually there were four Byrons that served in the Congress of the United States, and Barbara Mikulski, were all members of the Maryland delegation. 
   It was a wonderful delegation. One by one, those women left for one reason or another. Senator Mikulski, of course, became the first woman elected to the United States Senate without a relative preceding her. 
   One by one, they were replaced by a male. Those were good males, I want you to know. But our delegation became an all-male delegation. It was, to that extent, not fully representative of the people of our State. We have been advantaged now, not only because Marylanders have elected an extraordinary individual to serve them. She is a highly educated individual. She traveled throughout the world. Her father served in the Air Force. She is well educated. She didn't go to the University of Maryland, which was a lamentable fact, but she went to a great school, Wake Forest University. She got her law degree in New Hampshire. She has served the community well and has served citizens' organizations well. 
   So in a very real sense, she has been a representative for a very long period of time. This day, however, she begins her career as a representative elected by the constituents of the Fourth Congressional District. 
   Madam Speaker, I know that I speak on behalf of yourself, on behalf of all the Members of the House and certainly on behalf, Donna, of the Maryland delegation, we are extraordinarily proud that you have joined us. Our delegation will be stronger, better and more representative because of that. And this institution will be stronger for the strong advocacy that you will bring on behalf not just of the people of the Fourth Congressional District, but the people of this Nation. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply honored to introduce to you a young woman to whom some years ago I gave an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. She determined that she was going to go to Wake Forest. But she has been my friend for a long time. Ladies and gentlemen, the newest Member of this body, Donna Edwards from the Fourth Congressional District.  
   She is a mother, lawyer, and long-time community activist and organizer. 
   Born in Yanterville, North Carolina, she moved frequently as a child. 
   Her father was in the Air Force, and she traveled throughout the country and world. 
   She graduated from Wake Forest University and later the Franklin Pierce Law Center (in New Hampshire). 
   Before attending law school, she worked as a contractor for Lockheed Corporation at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. 
   After law school, she clerked for a superior court judge in Washington, co-founded the National Network To End Domestic Violence, and  became executive director of the Arca Foundation, which gives grants to civic groups, organizations that study the media, and public policy groups. 
   She helped lead the fight to pass the Violence Against Women Act, providing comprehensive funding to shelter and offer services to victims of domestic violence and their children. 
   The Washington Post has called her ``bright'' and ``tough-minded'' and recently said: ``Poised, persistent and principled, she would make a fine representative for the fourth district'' of Maryland.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him for his work on this bill. I thank Mrs. Maloney as well. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I would hope we would defeat this motion. Again, this is a motion to recommit promptly. If in fact the motion maker wanted to change the substance and offer an amendment that would go into effect, he would have offered a motion to amend and report back forthwith. The effect of this motion, as we all know, is to delay for some period of time the passage of this bill. My friend from Georgia will get up and ask the rhetorical question that we all know the answer to, does it kill it? It does not kill it. But, my friends, we have 5 legislative days to go in this session before we break. We ought to pass this bill now. We ought to pass this bill and tell the Federal employees of this country, who work for all of us, all 300 million of us, some 2 million civilian Federal employees, that we honor their service. 
   But, more importantly, this is not just about those who will get leave. It is, as I said in my statement, much more about the children, who will have better nurturing and a sense of self-confidence in their early months of life. Scientist after scientist, educator after educator, tell us that if that occurs, if that bonding occurs in the early months, children are much better off, and if those children are better off, our communities and our society and our families are better off. 
   I would ask all my colleagues to oppose this motion. Pass this bill. Say to the children who are perhaps yet to be born and have just been born, we want to ensure the best start we can for you in life in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I want to thank the chairman. No one has worked harder to get us to this point in time in a bill that can be signed by the President and passed by the Senate. No one has worked harder than David Obey has on that objective, and he spent months at it. His staff has worked extraordinarily hard. 
   I also want to thank my counterpart, the minority leader Mr. Boehner who just spoke, and thank him for his efforts. This agreement would not have been reached without his leadership and his cooperation, and I appreciate that.     
   I also want to thank Mr. Lewis for his work on this effort as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, this supplemental appropriations legislation is the result, as has been said, of a bipartisan compromise that addresses critical needs of the American people. 
   Will every Member be happy with the substance of the two amendments that we are going to consider? The answer to that question is no. 
   Will every Member here get what he or she wants? Again, the answer is no. That is, after all, the legislative process. 
   However, our Nation is at war. We have 150,000 men and women in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. Catastrophic floods continue to wreak havoc in Iowa and other States in the Midwest. And millions of our workers are struggling to make ends meet because they've lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 
   These two amendments that we will consider address these needs, as well as others. 
   The first amendment will provide funding for our troops on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each Member will decide how they should vote, and their vote should not be questioned on that particular amendment. 
   It is also important to note that the second amendment includes important policy provisions regarding the war in Iraq. 
   First, it prohibits military construction funds from being used to establish permanent bases in Iraq. We have addressed that previously in this House and overwhelmingly supported that proposition. 
   Secondly, it requires reconstruction aid for Iraq to be matched dollar-for-dollar by the Iraqi Government. With the price of oil being what it is, having been told by the administration that the oil in Iraq would pay for all reconstruction, that is a reasonable and appropriate requirement. 
   Additionally, the second amendment includes major legislative items that the White House has agreed to accept. That is a good sign that there is an opportunity to work together when the interests of the American people are at stake. We don't always do that. The American public is concerned about that and disappointed by that. But this night, we have come to such an agreement, and the American public can be pleased by that. 
   Among other things, this amendment expands the education benefits that veterans receive under the GI Bill to restore the promise of a full, 4-year college education, and allowing servicemembers to transfer educational benefits to their spouses and dependents. That was a bipartisan agreement. It's something that we can be pleased about as a country. It's something that we do, in fact, owe our veterans, and we will redeem that promise this night. 
   Thus, this legislation supports our troops not only when they're abroad but when they return home as well. 
   We know from our experience with the original GI Bill that this legislation will foster an educated workforce and a vibrant economy. The greatest generation, after all, not only defeated fascism--Charlie Rangel, at a later time, fought for our country in the field--but they also came home, that greatest generation, and built the greatest economy the world has seen. This bill will help in many ways redeem the promise for this generation of men and women who are asked to defend our country and its freedom. It is the right thing to do. We will do it this night.  
   The President initially indicated his opposition to an extension of unemployment insurance. But this second amendment includes a 13-week extension for workers in every State who have exhausted their benefits. Again, the right thing to do. 
   The administration also had placed a moratorium on seven Medicaid regulations, the result of which would cut services for seniors, families, and those with disabilities. The administration, after conversation with both sides, has decided and agreed to a moratorium on six of the seven regulations. That's good for the States, but more importantly, it's good for those whom these dollars will help in a time of trouble. This provision has overwhelmingly been supported in this House previously, both sides of the aisle, who voted for protecting the Medicaid safety net by a vote of 349-62. I am pleased the administration has joined us in the support of this effort. 
   The second amendment also includes critical disaster assistance in the wake of devastating tornadoes and floods, which all of us have seen on TV over the last few days, as well as funding to strengthen New Orleans' levees, as requested by the President, and housing vouchers for those left homeless by Hurricane Katrina. 
   I want to again commend Chairman Obey and Chairman Rangel. Chairman Rangel played a key role in getting us to this agreement, and I thank him for that. 
   I also again want to thank Minority Leader Boehner and Ranking Member Lewis for their leadership on this legislation. 
   Some will say this legislation is not perfect. To that extent, they can apply that to any piece of legislation that we consider, but this legislation is a good piece of legislation. It will provide for our troops in the field, while addressing critical priorities here at home. It will have my support, and I urge the support of this body for such amendment as they believe to be appropriate in the best interests of our country.

   Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, as for the schedule for the balance of the day, I have had discussions with the minority. Mr. Arcuri will be offering the rule on the energy extender bill. We will not vote on the rule tonight. There will be no further votes tonight. After discussion with the Republican side of the aisle, we have agreed, and we will do a unanimous consent, but we will be coming in at 8 a.m. tomorrow. 
   The reason for coming in at 8 a.m. tomorrow, as I think all of you know, is that the Jewish holidays start at sundown tomorrow night. To accommodate, therefore, our Members getting to their homes to be with their families, it is necessary for us to complete our business by, hopefully, no later than 12:30. Therefore, we will be coming in an hour early. We haven't discussed this, but hopefully, perhaps, we could dispense with 1-minutes as well so we can get right to the business at hand if that's possible. We will try to get all Members out of here by 12:30 so that we can observe the holidays for our Jewish colleagues. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we hear these debates and they sound so simple on both sides. The public must be very confused. They want low taxes. And the gentleman from Texas talks about putting taxes down. The problem the gentleman from Texas has is he is a member of a party that has controlled this country's government at the Federal level for almost a decade. The President has a veto pen, and he has not allowed any spending that he didn't like. 
   The problem, of course, is for a decade their premise has been that they can spend money, and they spent money at twice the rate that was spent under the Clinton administration for 8 years. Spending. But they didn't pay for what they bought, because they call that taxes. And they are correct. If you buy things and you pay for them at the Federal level, you pay for them with tax revenues. Now we have a very simple solution, you can stop buying things. But they didn't stop buying things, they doubled the rate of growth of spending from about 3 1/2 to 7 percent. And they cut revenues. 
   Now you don't have to be much of a mathematician or an accountant to know what happens: Budgets, deficits, spiraled. 
   Now, of course, they didn't worry about that because the Vice President of the United States, the Republican Vice President, said debt doesn't matter. That's what he said. And you could see that they really meant it because they have added $1.6 trillion, and that is with a ``T,'' to the debt, deficit, spending. 
   And by the end of this year, they will have doubled the national debt, and they have been in control of everything and could stop spending in its track with a Bush veto. 
   And they said if we did that, the economy would blossom and of course their candidate for President says the underpinnings of our economy are sound. 
   I will tell you, my neighbors don't think that is the case. They are paying more for groceries and they are paying more for gasoline. They are losing jobs. They are having a tough time. 
   My constituents are better off than most. But this country is having a tough time. And all of the things that they said their tax cuts would produce and their economic program would produce, just like Herbert Hoover and Calvin Coolidge, proved to be dead flat wrong. 
   Employment, we were going to spur employment, spur growth. Under Bill Clinton, the average monthly addition of jobs was 216,000 per month. Under this President, under your economic program, I don't know whether any of you know how many jobs you have produced over the last 90 months, but I will tell you, 38,000 per month. What is the problem with that? The problem with that is you need 100,000 jobs per month to stay even. 
   Bill Clinton in the first 8 months of his last year, which is analogous to this year, added 1.4 million jobs in the job market.     
   Under your economic program, President Bush has lost 600,000. That's a net turnaround of 2 million jobs lost in this economy; not producing 1.4 and losing 6. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we're here on Sunday, at a quarter of 10 at night. Why? For the worst financial disaster that we've seen in this country since the Depression, or the Coolidge and Hoover years. Debt didn't matter then either under Mr. Coolidge or Mr. Hoover. Debt doesn't matter, said the Vice President of the United States. 
   We're here on this rule because we believe debt does matter. And I understand what the gentleman from California said. We have a philosophical disagreement. That philosophical difference of agreement is we want mental health parity, but we know it's got to be paid for. We want energy independence and alternative energy research and wind and solar, but we know somebody's got to pay for it. The average American family knows that. They want solar heating in their home they know somebody's got to pay for it. 
   Now we're here, because right now, as a result of failure of this economic program, they can't get a loan because we've incurred so much debt that people have locked up because they're not sure loaning money is a safe thing for them to do. That's why we're here tonight, because of the failure of an economic program that was fiscally irresponsible and was, from a regulatory perspective, neglectful. No oversight. No fiscal responsibility.

   Very frankly, as you recall, Mike Oxley, the chairman of the Banking Committee under the Republican leadership, we passed regulatory legislation then. It was opposed by the administration. And Mike Oxley said, and I won't say what he said, but essentially he said, in a different way, that the administration gave them the back of his hand.

   Mr. HOYER. Let me just make one continuing point.

   So I tell my friend that, from a regulatory standpoint, the articulation of policy by the present President and your candidate for President has been that they do not believe in keeping the referee on the field.

   I ask the gentleman again, do you believe that any of those statistics are inaccurate?

   Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, because I want to end and don't want to have a full debate on this. I've given the gentleman some time. 
   Let me say this: If the American public who is listening to this debate believes the economy is in good shape, so be it. They ought to act on that premise. 
   In fact, we know the economy is not in good shape. Notwithstanding the fact that when they offered their budgets, after many of the events that the gentleman referred to, which have been, obviously, troubling to the economy, which were challenges to the economy, but they continued to indicate that they were going to balance the budget. The budget deficit, debt, has doubled in 90 months, borrowed more money from foreign governments than all of the other Presidents combined, and we have a $1.6 trillion, which may go as much as $2 trillion operating deficit in the 8 years of this Bush administration, may go that high, as opposed to, I tell my friend this, you're at $1.6 trillion now and growing in the national deficits that you've run up in 8 years. Under Bill Clinton, $62.9 billion surplus and four surplus years in a row.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. No, I want to conclude my debate, Mr. Dreier. But thank you very much for participating in this. 
   I want to say we're here tonight saying simply that what we want to do is incredibly important. We want to pass mental health parity. We want to pay for it so our grandchildren don't pay for it. We want to pass energy independence legislation, wind, solar, tax credits. We want to pass tax credits for individuals. We want to pass tax credits for businesses to grow, but not by incurring more debt because, notwithstanding Vice President Cheney, debt does matter, and it matters to our children, it matters to our economy. And that's what's happening with our economy; so much debt that it crunched us down. And finally people said we're not going to loan anymore, and we had that credit crisis. And that's what this is all about. 
   Not only this bill, but this bill, by the way, is very much related to the bill we're going to consider tomorrow, this $700 billion that the administration has asked us to come up with, and I'm going to vote to do it. I'm going to vote to do it because I think the guy on Main Street, the guy on the farm, the guy in the small business, the guy who wants a job, the guy who wants to pay his kid's college expense, help him with it, the guy who wants to buy a new refrigerator because the old one broke down, he needs to have availability of credit, or his life is going to be very much undermined. That's why we're considering this bill tomorrow. That's why I'm going to vote for this bill tomorrow. 
   But I don't delude myself that it's the result of an economy that was advantaged by the economic program that we have seen over the last 8 years. 
   So I say to my friends that this rule, we may ask to withdraw this rule. We were going to call for a vote. We've told people there aren't going to be any votes. We may ask to withdraw this rule at this point in time and bring it back tomorrow, conclude the debate at that point in time for however much longer time that might take. But we have to get to, clearly, the bill to rescue our economy from the fiscal irresponsibility and the regulatory neglect that we have been experiencing for the last 8 years in America. 
   I hope Americans carefully consider the consequences of the economic program that is being pursued, and frankly, that Senator McCain says he wants to continue to pursue. We think that's not prudent policy, it's not good for our people. 
   I thank my friend for yielding the time.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, clearly, what we are dealing with is an unfortunate situation. The unfortunate situation is that apparently--and again I just learned about this about an hour and a half ago when Mr. Peterson, the chairman of the committee, told me he and Mr. Goodlatte were discussing this problem and how to proceed. Apparently what happened is title III, which I understand is not very controversial, but in any event, title III came up on the screen for the printing on the parchment that is sent to the President, but, unfortunately, for whatever reasons, it was not printed out and it was not caught in the proofing of that. Apparently, as well, the White House did not catch the fact that the bill was not inclusive of title III. 
   Frankly, I have not looked at the bill to see whether there's a title I, II, and then goes to IV, which would have been self-evident that there was a missing title. 
   In any event, without having researched it or talked to anybody about precedents, what has happened is that the House and the Senate passed in exactly the same form that which was vetoed by the President. Now, we passed more than that, but that which we have just voted on was passed in both Houses in exactly the form we just voted on. 
   The vote, therefore, superficially, off the top of my head, without having researched this, is that what we have done is we have passed that which we originally passed through the House and the Senate and sent to the President, notwithstanding the President's veto, and something that we did also pass, which was incorporated in that bill, was neither vetoed nor signed by the President because, unfortunately, as a result of a clerical error, it was not included in the bill. 
   I, in discussions with Mr. Peterson, understand that he and Mr. Goodlatte were in discussion on this issue when they first learned of it, and I don't know how long they knew about it before I found out about it; that, as I thought, their agreement would be that we would pass, subsequent to passing the initial bill, the title III either by unanimous consent or under the suspension calendar. 
   I don't know the conversations that occurred between Mr. Peterson and Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Peterson is on the floor, I know. I don't know exactly where he is. But it was his understanding that that would be an acceptable way to proceed. That was where I thought it to be.

   Mr. HOYER. Well, as I said, everything that we voted on was passed by the House and the Senate in exactly the same form. Obviously, I agree with your premise that the bill as passed out of Congress was not the exact same bill because of the deletion of title III,  apparently by error. Title III, as I understand, is not particularly controversial. I understand that from the discussion between Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Peterson. 
   So a mistake was made. A deletion was made. The President and the White House did not catch it. We didn't catch it. The President vetoed a bill. The bill that he vetoed, he sent back here. We have now said notwithstanding the veto, we believe the provisions that we both passed should in fact become law. 
   Now the gentleman is correct, which is self-evident, and I can't disagree with your proposition that the bill was not in exactly the same form, and as I indicated at the beginning, because I only learned about this about an hour and a half ago, these are off-of-the-top-of-my-head opinions, and are probably worth that much.

   Mr. HOYER. We hope to have, again, as result of discussions between Mr. Peterson and Mr. Goodlatte, either by unanimous consent, which may not be possible, or under suspension because, again, I understand from Mr. Peterson that title III is not a controversial title. Clearly, title I was controversial. Other titles were controversial. But if that is the case, then we can pass this by suspension tomorrow with suspension authority and send that to the Senate and hopefully they will then in turn send that to the President that title which has not yet been enacted or, frankly, acted on by the President, would either be signed by him or vetoed by him and we would consider it in that context.

   Mr. HOYER. I am looking for the exact date, but the farm bill expires tomorrow, and we have to extend the farm bill or go back to the 1949 extension. 
   Again, I would say to my friend I am operating with some concerns about the questions that are raised. But, again, I say, first of all, what happened in the Deficit Reduction Act is that the bill that was sent to the President, the provisions were never passed by the Senate. 
   Every provision that was sent to the President was sent to the President after overwhelming votes from the House, overwhelming votes from the Senate in exactly the same position. Title III was passed by the Senate and the House, and inadvertently left out. 
   In the Deficit Reduction Act, figures were changed in the bill subsequent to passing the Senate and never passed by the House. So I would suggest that the analogy between the two is not apt. In addition, there was no bipartisan discussion on that change. 
   In this case, Mr. Peterson and Mr. Goodlatte are both on the floor. I didn't participate in those conversations. But I was informed by Mr. Peterson, because I said, have you talked to Mr. Goodlatte about this. He said he had. There had been significant discussions about that. There was concern about getting the farm bill passed because of the expiration of the existing authorization. 
   As a result of those discussions, my personal thought was there was bipartisan agreement that we could proceed this way. We did proceed that way. I don't think I can amplify my response more than that.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Again, I want to say how much respect I have for Mr. McCrery. I think he is one of the most positive Members of this body. I think he has worked productively with Chairman Rangel, and I have great respect for my colleague. He will be leaving, and that will be a loss for the Congress. I wanted to say that before I begin. 
   Let me say that we have disagreements. However, and on the overall issue that he raised in closing about paying for this, he is accurate. Now, some of these extenders even pre-date the time when the Republicans were in the majority in 1995 and through 2006. But I think there is consensus on extending them. The difference is, should we pay for them? There are only a number of options, a few options available to us. We can pay for them, or our children can pay for them. Somebody will pay for them. There is not a free lunch. 
   My view is this supply side economics pretends there is somewhere out there where the tooth fairy is going to deliver the money. There is not a tooth fairy. It is the parent who delivers the money under the pillow when the tooth is lost. But we are the parents, and we need to act as adults. We need to pay for what we buy. And if what we buy is giving somebody a tax incentive because we believe that they will do something good that will advantage our community and our country, then that is fine. I am supportive of that. But we ought to pay for it, because that is our decision.     
   One of the gentlemen spoke about his two children. I have three children. I have three grandchildren, and I have one great-granddaughter. I'm equally concerned. I'm concerned about the $4 trillion in debt that we've added over the last 6-plus years, and now some $400 billion this year alone. But that is the general philosophy.  
   The specific philosophy here is we need to be energy independent. We need to be sure that our policies that we pursue do not continue to make us hostage to those who have petroleum products. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first want to commend Chairman CHARLIE RANGEL and all of the members of the Ways and Means Committee for their hard work on this very important, farsighted legislation, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. 
   This week the American people are paying, on average, $3.79 per gallon for gasoline. Mr. Hensarling observed that I was laughing when he said the Democrats have been in charge and look what's happened to gas prices. I was laughing because the absurdity is rejected by the American public, that somehow policies that we've adopted over the last year, when the President vetoes anything he doesn't want, has affected those gasoline prices to me is patently absurd and clearly rejected by the American people. It was, I thought then and think now, a laughable proposition to make. 
   Motorists are paying $4 per gallon, more than $2.50 per gallon more than they were paying when the current administration took office. 
   To show you the difference, when Bill Clinton was President from 1993 to 2001, gas prices rose from $1.06 to $1.46, 40 cents, or a nickel a year, a nickel a year during those 8 years. During this President's administration, prices are rising a nickel a week. 
   There is no doubt that this explosion in gasoline prices is squeezing hardworking families who live in every one of our districts who also are coping with the rising costs of food and groceries, health care and education. 
   This legislation is not a panacea to those immediate concerns. Would that we had one. But it does represent an important step in our continuing effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Among other things, the bill will establish a new tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic biofuel production from now through 2015, so that we can rely on the Middle West and perhaps other parts of our country, rather than the Middle East. It will extend this $1 per gallon biodiesel tax credit, and makes it available to all potential sources of diesel that can be made without petroleum. And it allows jet fuel produced from biomass to qualify for the credit as well. 
   Furthermore, this legislation will reduce our dependence on imported fuel for our electricity sector by extending and expanding tax incentive for sources of renewable energy including wind, solar and biomass. 
   It also will encourage the use of plug-in hybrid cars and provide incentives for energy conservation in residential homes, commercial buildings and appliances; all of which, I think, the American public applauds. 
   Additionally, this bill will help create hundreds of thousands of ``green jobs.'' It will spur American innovation and business investment, which will strengthen our economy today and in the future. And it will provide tax relief for millions of Americans, expanding the child tax credit for the families of 13 million children, helping 4.5 million families better afford college through a tuition deduction, and saving 3.4 million teachers money with a deduction for classroom expenses, so when they buy something for their classroom, like a business expense, they'll be able to deduct it. 
   Now, many on the Republican side object to this bill because the Democratic majority, in keeping with our commitment to fiscal responsibility and pay as you go budget rules, insists that this legislation be paid for and not add to the national debt. 
   That's a fundamental difference between our two sides. One believes that tax cuts somehow pay for themselves. Mr. Bernanke doesn't believe that, Mr. Greenspan doesn't believe that, but our Republican colleagues clearly believe it, and they've pursued that policy, which has, as I said, put us over $3 trillion in additional debt over the last 82 months. 
   To them I simply say: It is long past time that the Members here insist that our Nation pay for the things it buys. To not do so takes the discipline out of the democratic process, because if we can simply charge that which we buy, there will be no discipline on the part of the electorate to say no, we don't want to be taxed to buy that. And I guarantee the system would stop buying it. But if there is no discipline, if we're not paying, my grandchildren will not be able to vote and exercise that discipline. 
   History, I suggest to my colleagues, is littered with the stories of formerly great nations that began their demise through fiscal profligacy. It is within our power to ensure that the United States of America is never added to that list. 
   The method by which Chairman Rangel and the committee have paid for the cost of this bill is laudable. Important. This legislation closes loopholes that allow corporations and executives to avoid U.S. taxes by shipping jobs and investments overseas. And because our obligations do not stop, average working Americans, therefore, must pay more if the wealthiest among us who can seek tax havens do not pay their fair share. 
   This legislation is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent bill that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our environment, create thousands of jobs and strengthen our economy, and provide tax relief to millions of hardworking Americans. 
   I commend Mr. Rangel, Mr. McDermott, the members of the committee, and I commend Mr. McCrery for his responsible stewardship as the ranking member and his working to try to bring consensus. We have not reached it in this instance, but I do commend him for his efforts. 
   And I urge my colleagues, support this important legislation which moves us towards energy independence and a fair and equitable tax system.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HONORING THURGOOD MARSHALL ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from California (Mr. Schiff), congratulate Mr. Payne for his leadership on this effort, and Mr. Gohmert for his joining in bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   I come from the State of Maryland, and Thurgood Marshall is one of the great sons of our State. But I must tell you something that you will find, I think, ironic. If you go to the State capitol which is the oldest State capitol still in use as a State capitol in this country, and you look on the east front of the capitol and you walk out the front, there is a statue on the east front that overlooks the Annapolis harbor, and that statue is of a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from the State of Maryland. His name is Roger Brooke Taney, the author of the Dred Scott decision. 
   But if you walk out the door to the west and look out on Rowe Boulevard, there is another statue, another Justice, another son of Maryland; and that Justice is Thurgood Marshall.     
   I have always thought it somewhat ironic that juxtaposed in the Maryland State Capitol are these two justices, both of whom were learned, both of whom served their country, one of whom, however, whose judgment was skewed by the times in which he grew up, whose brilliance was diminished by his failure to see the promise of America, and another who--notwithstanding the fact that he was discriminated against and his people were discriminated against by a country that professed a promise of equal opportunity for all. Nevertheless, the love for his country rose above that segregated environment to preach the principles and to seek their reality. 
   Today we recall the life and legacy of one of America's champions of civil rights, Thurgood Marshall. Justice Marshall is, as I have said, one of Maryland's greatest sons. 
   If you come to my office and visit the majority leader's office, you will see, just outside of my door, six portraits of very distinguished Marylanders. One, the first President of the United States, John Hanson. Now, I know that George Washington was technically first President of the United States of America, but John Hanson was the first president of the Continental Congress. You will see others, signers of the Declaration of Independence, but there will be that picture just outside of my door of Thurgood Marshall, because of what he stood for and what his life stands for today. 
   Few lives were as consequential to the cause of American equality, and it's fitting that we pause the work of legislating and remember that life. Thurgood Marshall said that his life-long fascination with the Constitution began in grade school, when, as a punishment, interestingly, as a punishment, a teacher forced him to read it cover to cover. Even then he must have been struck by the gulf between that document's promise of equal protection and the reality of a segregated America, a gulf that turned that promise into a lie for millions of our citizens. 
   Thurgood Marshall spent his career working to restore that promise and dismantling the structures of segregation piece by piece. Nearly two decades before the famous case of Brown vs. Board of Education, he was at the forefront of a legal movement that aimed to chip away at discrimination through the courts. 
   His first victory was also in some ways his sweetest. He convinced the Maryland Court of Appeals to desegregate the University of Maryland law school 6 years after that very school had barred him on account of his race. Over the years to come, he rarely lost a case. In fact, he won 29 out of 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court. 
   Another famous Marylander and his wife, whom I know, is Speaker Jackson, himself a distinguished African American leader of a distinguished African American family. I know so well the Mitchell family, Clarence Mitchell, Jr., the NAACP's representative in Washington, known as the 100th Senator; and Juanita Jackson Mitchell, one of the first African Americans admitted to the University of Maryland law school. 
   Some of the credit must go to Thurgood Marshall and his legendary powers of persuasion. But credit, I think, also belongs to the powerful simplicity of his argument that separate can never be equal, that the Constitution belongs to Americans of all colors. His career as an advocate culminated with Brown, which overturned ``separate but equal,'' and it overturned it for good. Not only did it overturn it finally, but also for the good of our people. 
   Thurgood Marshall later distinguished himself as a Federal judge and a solicitor general before President Lyndon Johnson nominated him as America's first African American Supreme Court justice. President Johnson called the appointment, and I quote, ``The right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man, and the right place.'' 
   Justice Marshall, of course, as we all know, proved him absolutely correct.  He served on the Court with distinction for almost a quarter of a century as one of its leading defenders of individual liberty and civil rights. Other civil rights leaders gave us inspiration, uplift and prophetic challenge. Thurgood Marshall added something to that contribution, dogged advocacy and the discipline of the law. 
   As a newspaper editorial put it at the time of his death, ``We make movies about Malcolm X, we get a holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King. But every day we live with the legacy of Justice Thurgood Marshall.'' Thurgood Marshall would be the first to acknowledge just how far America remains from the promise of equality, an equality that exists in fact, every bit as in law. 
   But he would be the last to be discouraged. He said that ``A child born to a black mother in a State like Mississippi, by merely drawing its first breath in the democracy has exactly the same right as a white baby born to the wealthiest person in the United States. It's not true, but I challenge anyone to say it's not a goal worth working for.'' 
   The great thing that we remember about Thurgood Marshall, as I said at the beginning, is that confronted with segregation, confronted with racism, confronted with a negative reaction to his color, he, as so many civil rights leaders have done in the past, as Nelson Mandela did in South Africa, as so many other civil rights leaders throughout this world have done, he rose above the hate and the division to bring clarity to our Constitution and unity to our people. 
   How appropriate it is to remember Thurgood Marshall on the eve of his 100th year.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. 
   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow. 
   On Tuesday the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business and 9 a.m. on Friday. 
   We expect to consider H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act; H.R. 3355, the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007; and H.R. 3996, Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007; the conference report on the fiscal year 2008 Labor-HHS appropriations bill. If the President vetoes the WRDA bill, we will expect to take up that veto as well. 
   Also, Members should note on Wednesday, President Sarkozy of France will address a joint meeting of the House and Senate. I would like to say to all the Members who are listening, I would hope that they would make a special effort to be here for the address of President Sarkozy. 
   I would make the observation that the new President of France is someone who, I think, holds great promise for partnership with the United States. I think he has expressed that inclination. I think that is a very significant, positive step forward, and I hope that most of us that will be able to, within the framework of legislative business, be here to hear his address.

   Mr. HOYER. As I said in my announcement, it is my expectation that the Labor-HHS conference report will be on the floor next week. I don't know whether it will be Wednesday or Thursday of next week, but I expect it to be on the floor next week. 
   The conference, much of the work of the conference, as I indicated last week, the preconferencing was occurring, both parties were involved in that preconferencing, and hopefully that has led to what will be a relatively brief conference. I do not have information whether or not they were able to conclude today. I know they met this morning and into this afternoon. I don't know whether they have concluded.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   And I know that point has been made, but I want to tell you, very honestly, I hear you make the point, but not only did you package almost all, the majority of bills in 2005 and 2006, but you packaged them in the calendar year, that is to say, 3 months from today, before they were passed. And so that, although that is your desire, and it is my desire, we share that view, you're absolutely right. These bills ought to be considered individually, one at a time, on their merits, sent to the President, and he ought to have the opportunity to veto them or sign them individually. 
   But I would remind the gentleman that in fiscal year, I believe, I may be wrong on the fiscal year, fiscal year 2005, it was not until February 2005 that that bill was passed, with eight or nine of the bills incorporated in an omnibus. And in either the year before that, or the year after that, in January, eight bills were sent. 
   Now, I may be off one or two bills on the numbers, but my point is, the gentleman is correct. Unfortunately, that has not been the practice, either under your leadership or our leadership. And I think it's unfortunate, personally. But we're going to move these bills, as I said last week, hopefully as quickly  and effectively as possible; and, hopefully, the President will sign them. They've passed with an average of 285 votes, some closer, some different than that. Averages lie in that respect. But they have passed pretty handily both Houses of the Congress. In the Senate every one has passed with a veto-proof majority. That's not true in the House. But we're hopeful that we can get these bills to the President and signed by the President, whether they're individually or in packages.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. On that point, because I think it's important for our Members to understand and for the public to understand what's going on. The gentleman is correct. You took the Veterans bill out of the Housing bill. We think you liked the Veterans bill. We're not sure you liked the Housing bill, and so you took them apart so you could pass what you liked and leave what you didn't like alone. 
   As you know, the first 2 months that we came in, we dealt with the eight bills that you had not passed. They were all domestic bills. You passed the Defense bill, the MilCon bill, Homeland Security bill, all of that, broad bipartisan support on our side, your side. Education was left on the table. Health was left on the table. Environment, left on the table. Space, left on the table. Law enforcement, left on the table. 
   We understand the decoupling. Decoupling is to put us in a position where we don't have any options. You'll take what was passed with 409 votes in this House. It was $4 billion over what the President requested, billions of dollars under what the veterans said they needed. 
   And now the President says he is going to sign that bill. Why is he going to sign that bill? Because I think he believes it's politically feasible to do it. It's $4 billion over what the President asked for, and he said we shouldn't ask for more than he asked for. We asked for $4 billion more than he asked for for veterans, and he's going to sign it. Overwhelmingly supported here in the House, and we would override his veto. He knows that, so I don't think he's given us much, very frankly. 
   And we are trying to figure out how we can get Education signed by the President, funding No Child Left Behind signed by the President, NIH, cancer research, heart, lung and blood research, diabetes research signed by the President. 
   So very frankly, your decoupling was to make sure that you got the bill you liked signed. Our coupling may be to ensure that we get the bill that we like signed. So very frankly, the efforts, I think, are the same. The priorities just may be different.

   I have not mentioned something, but I do want to mention, so the House knows and, frankly, the public knows as well. As you know, we have been working very hard on the Children's Health Insurance Program, trying to get as many children as possible covered by children's health. I want to thank the whip. I had the opportunity of meeting with Mr. Boehner. Their staffs have been engaged. Our staffs have been engaged. Senate Democratic and Republican staff and Members have been engaged. We're still working on that.     
   As you know, Senator Reid attempted to get a delay in the consideration of the bill on the Senate floor. That was objected to by Mr. McConnell, or actually Mr. Lott on behalf of Mr. McConnell, and they took it up today. Mr. Reid asked for another extension. That was objected to by Mr. McConnell this time. So they considered it today. 
   But I want the whip to know that we are intending to continue to pursue discussions. Obviously the Senate has to send the bill back here. But we want to continue to pursue these discussions to see whether or not we can come to agreement so that we can send a bill to the President that, hopefully, he would sign but, if he doesn't sign, that two-thirds of us on this side of the Capitol and two-thirds on the other side of the Capitol would be prepared to see it move forward.

   Frankly, we have a disagreement on whether you were denied time. We did pass the bill, but we have been pursuing, as the gentleman observed, and I appreciate the participation of those Republicans, one of whom is sitting on the floor, who have participated in numerous meetings, whether or not we can accommodate the interests of both sides in passing legislation to include the children, expanding it to 10 million. But notwithstanding the fact that we passed it, as I explained to the House, we wanted to get that bill to the Senate so that they could have it ready for consideration. 
   We were in agreement that it ought to be moved over until next week. Senator Reid asked for that so we could continue to work. As I advised Senator Reid, the leader, I advised him that I thought there were good-faith discussions going on. I thought there was an opportunity to move forward. I am still hopeful that that is the case. And as a result, I am hopeful that we will take the additional time, the next day, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, to try to see if we can come to agreement. 
   As you know, you, Mr. Boehner and I met, and Mr. Boehner's observation was there may be significant numbers that could accrue as a result of the discussions and negotiations. We're hopeful that that is the case. If that's the case, then we would be successful in adding the 4 million children that we seek to add to the President's 6 million plus. 
   What I wanted to indicate before we close this colloquy is that I am hopeful we will still take that time, and I have indicated to a number of people that I want to pursue, we want to pursue, those discussions with the opportunity to perhaps take some additional action if agreement is possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding and would observe, as I have before on this floor, that there is no Member of this House who has been involved any more deeply, any more passionately, any more effectively to protect, preserve, and expand the availability of health care to the American people more than my friend John Dingell, the chairman of the committee. I want to congratulate him. Not only has he done that, but his father before him did that as well. 
   Madam Speaker, last week we watched as Senator Ted Kennedy returned from the treatment of his brain cancer to cast his vote in favor of this vital Medicare bill. I don't have to tell you how many of us in both Chambers were moved to see that lifelong crusader for health care come back to cast one more vote for America's seniors. 
   With that as inspiration, the Senate joined the House in voting by overwhelming margins for legislation that would and does replace a 10.6 percent payment cut for thousands of doctors in Medicare with a 1.1 percent increase, a cut that would put at risk coverage and availability of doctors for our seniors. The bill extends expiring provisions and bonus payments critical to rural communities and providers. The bill expands the preventive services that are available to our seniors. The bill phases mental health parity into the Medicare program. And it improves protections and assistance programs for our low-income seniors, about whom all of us are concerned. 
   Three hundred and fifty-five of us in this House voted to pass this legislation. Three hundred and fifty-five in an overwhelming bipartisan vote which said this is good legislation, our people need it, and we're going to pass it. Sixty-nine Members of the United States Senate stood up and supported this piece of legislation. And I was pleased to see so many Republicans lining up with us. This is an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill as it was sent to the President of the United States. 
   Preventing these Medicare cuts isn't a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It's an issue of protecting and preserving the health care that over 44 million seniors count on, depend on, and, yes, deserve. And our message to the President was unambiguous: We will stand with our seniors and our health care providers, our military families and our disabled. And when it comes to protecting and preserving the health care they depend on, we will put aside party politics and we will stand together. Three hundred and fifty-five of us, sixty-nine in the Senate. 
   Today President Bush decided that the overwhelming majority of the Congress was wrong. He will have to explain, however, to America's seniors why he was so willing to stand between them and their health care. 
   But, thankfully, we don't have to take ``no'' for an answer. Thankfully, the Constitution provides us with the ultimate policy-making authority. And I expect, hope, and urge that the 355 of us that stood for this legislation just a short time ago will do so again today, not in opposition to the President but as a proponent of legislation which seeks to solve a problem and to provide health care for our seniors. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to override this misguided veto. And with their support, this bill for our seniors will become law and they will be better for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (ON THE PASSING OF CONGRESSWOMAN JUANITA MILLENDER-McDONALD -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   It is with deep sadness that I rise today to note the passing of our colleague and friend, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents in California's 37th Congressional District and a devoted representative who cared deeply for those she served. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was someone who never allowed the conventions of her surroundings to define the role she would play. Because she understood that education would unlock her budding potential as a community leader, Juanita achieved something extraordinary by earning a bachelor's degree from Redlands University at the age of 40, and a master's degree from California State University at the age of 47. 
   Because she recognized her duty to give back just a little of what she had learned, Juanita made our children's future her life's work by teaching math and English in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
   Because she could not sit idly by when she had much to offer, Juanita turned to public service in 1990, becoming the first African American woman to serve on the Carson city council, the first African American woman to chair two committees in the California State assembly, and the first African American woman to chair a full committee in the U.S. Congress. 
   And because she never let go of her abiding faith in the fact that our tomorrows can be better than our todays, Juanita will be remembered, remembered as a leader who inspired action, drove progress and labored diligently to improve the lives of people throughout our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the advocates of equal rights for women and minorities have lost a powerful voice in the U.S. Congress, one that always sought to bring people together by elevating the bonds that unite us as Americans and as human beings. Children and the working poor have lost a compassionate  ally. Men and women seeking to participate in their own governance have lost a steadfast guardian of voting rights who fought to expand the reach of democracy, not only in spirit but in practice as well. And defenders of human rights have lost a champion of their cause who never missed an opportunity to remind the free world of its obligation to help alleviate suffering and restore fundamental human dignity to those who have gone without it for far too long, such as those suffering in Darfur. Juanita Millender-McDonald personified what it means to serve others before serving self. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want Juanita's husband, James, and her children and grandchildren to know that the thoughts and prayers of a grateful Nation are with them as they mourn their loss. We join them in their mourning but we also join them in their joy of a life well-lived.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is an important bill with an important objective, and the objective is to protect our country and to protect our Constitution. 
   Ironically, the ranking member has just said that by having oversight, by having checks and balance on the intelligence community, somehow we politicize it. Our Founding Fathers, in the best sense of politicalization, wanted the civil sector to be involved. That's the purposes of this committee, I suggest to my friend. 
   The fact of the matter is the intelligence community conducts critically important activities that we want them to conduct. But we give them extraordinary powers, and because of that, we need to make sure that they're not politicized. In fact, the irony is that I think most objective observers would say two things: first of all, that the defense establishment of our country has been probably the most politicized it's been in my 26 years in the Congress of the United States. That is not true, in my opinion, with the present Secretary, by the way, or with the present Deputy Secretary. 
   Secondly, they have abandoned oversight. I have said many times that the previous Congress and the Congress before that and the Congress before that exercised less oversight than any previous Congress in which I've served. In fact, there was much more oversight by the Democratic Congress of the Clinton administration, in terms of oversight hearings, numbers, depth, than there was in the entire framework of the last 6 years under Republicans in the House, the Senate, and in the White House. This is a serious piece of legislation; it requires serious consideration. 
   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, my good friend, Congressman Reyes of Texas, and Mr. Hoekstra as well, who I think brings experience and judgment to this issue, although we have significant disagreements. 
   This, as the chairman has said, is the first authorization bill in 3 years to come to this floor. This authorization bill ought to come to the floor every year. Let me say briefly that this conference report enhances oversight. The reason, in my opinion, authorization bills didn't come to the floor in the last Congress is because oversight was not, as I said, as important. I've been disappointed with the oversight that's been exercised not only by this committee, but by others. 
   This conference report comes to the floor to enhance oversight and effective management of the intelligence community and expects and requires accountability. It enhances the management authority and flexibility of the Director of National Intelligence. Why? Because we want to have a more effective intelligence organization. And it authorizes new funding to improve the effectiveness of intelligence programs and activities. I would think all of us support those two efforts.  
   This legislation also includes an important provision, added in conference, that I want to talk about. It requires all American intelligence agencies and those under contract or subcontract with intelligence agencies to comply with the U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogations. Some find fault with that. I want to speak to that. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Member here believes that our Nation must take decisive action to detect, disrupt and, yes, eliminate terrorists who have no compunction about planning and participating in the mass killings of innocent men and women and children in an effort to advance their twisted aims. No one on this floor should gainsay that that is not the objective of every Member of this body. 
   We can and we will act to prevail in the war on terror. However, in the pursuit of those who seek to harm us, we must not sacrifice the very ideals that distinguish us from those who preach death and destruction. Yet, under the current administration, we have seen that line blurred between legitimate, sanctioned interrogation tactics and torture. And there is no doubt our international reputation has suffered and been stained as a result. Who said that? That's not a quote, but who said that essentially? Secretary Colin Powell, former four-star Army general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State in this administration. 
   The excesses at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo are well known, as are the administration's belief that the Geneva Convention against torture is ``quaint,'' and the Vice President's persistent effort to undermine the ban on torture championed by whom? Senator John McCain of Arizona, Republican candidate for President. 
   Just last week we learned that the Central Intelligence Agency destroyed, perhaps illegally, videotapes or interrogations conducted by American agents. These incidents unfortunately sully our great Nation's well-deserved good reputation. They raise questions about our commitment to human rights and the rule of law. And they allow our enemies to foment fear and stoke hatred. 
   This provision requires all intelligence agencies to comply with the Army Field Manual on interrogations. It is an attempt by this Congress to repair the damage that has already been done. 
   Furthermore, the techniques permitted by the Army Field Manual have been endorsed by a wide array of civilian and military officials as both effective and consistent with our international commitments, and very importantly, with the safety of our members of the Armed Forces. 
   At this time I will include a letter in the Record. The letter is signed by, and I will not take the time to read all of the generals, but there are four four-star generals. A four-star general is as high as you can go in the Armed Forces of the United States, except when we're in a world war, in which we accord a fifth-star.  
   December 12, 2007.  Hon. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC.  Hon. SILVESTRE REYES, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC.

   Mr. HOYER. One week longer than I had hoped. 
   I thank the gentleman. On Monday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business with any votes ordered postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. 
   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules, and most of those bills will be announced before the close of business tomorrow. 
   We will also expect further action on the following items: energy legislation, terrorism risk insurance, the fiscal 2008 appropriations package, the alternative minimum tax, the children's health insurance program. And there may be within the children's health program, depending on what the Senate does, dealing with the reimbursement of providers under Medicare, the docs. 
   I might also add to that, Members ought to know it is possible that depending upon the administrative work that can be accomplished over the next 4 or 5 days, it is possible that Monday night we might consider the omnibus appropriation bill. I mention that, but I want you to know that that is possible.

   Mr. HOYER. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Obey, has made it very clear that he wants to, although this is essentially an amendment, he wants to meet the 24-hour notice so that Members have 24 hours. So that would require Sunday night, we hope we can reach Sunday, for the posting of the bill on the Rules Committee Web site, which is usually how notice is given. And we are hopeful that will be done by Sunday night so that by Monday night it would be hopefully ready for consideration. 
   I want to say that the energy legislation will be considered, assuming we get the bill from the Senate, assuming we are ready to do that, considered done on Tuesday.

   Mr. HOYER. As you know, in our bill that we sent to the Senate, which the Senate did not pass, and it is still pending in the Senate, we made provision for the doctors reimbursement, which is going to be cut by 10 percent, as you know, on January 1. As a result of that, we are very concerned that there are some providers that may feel they no longer can afford to give services to those under Medicare. We think that is something that none of us want to have happen, so I wanted to put you on notice, so you knew that that was a possibility if their agreement could be reached on that issue. As you know, the Senate has not passed it. 
   But I am mentioning SCHIP, they may be combined, they may not be, I don't know, because that is a health care issue, and we have been talking about it as a combined. I wanted you to simply know that when I mentioned SCHIP that may well be subsumed in that or a separate item, if, in fact, agreement can be reached.

   Mr. HOYER. The Senate bill is still in the Senate, as I understand it. We have passed, as you know, a House bill with a different pay-for so that the deficit is not increased by our actions. As you know, on this side of the aisle we feel very strongly, I underline ``very,'' strongly that the alternative minimum tax, I think to a Member, agree was not intended to affect some of the people that it will affect if it is not modified. We want to modify it, but we don't want to modify it at the expense of our children and grandchildren having to fill the hole that will be left by the loss in revenues on which the administration has counted in its budgets for not this year but succeeding years for the next 9 years. If that money is not there and expenditures are not cut, or revenues are not raised, then we will  increase the budget deficit by a very substantial amount, billions and billions of dollars, at least $100 billion just by this one action. So we have passed a bill. The Senate has passed a bill. The Senate still has its bill. It has not passed over here.

   Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the gentleman's observation about the 1997. I don't believe that was paid for either. I am not absolutely positive on that, but that is why I believe the veto occurred. But we all agree we ought to eliminate the AMT. But there is no doubt there is a very significant philosophical and policy difference between the President and your side and our side in terms of whether or not, when you eliminate and you make the patch, there is no money to do the patch. So when you take that money away, you have to fill it either with borrowing, as we have done over the last number of years, or you fill it with additional revenues. If you fill it with additional revenues, future generations are not paying the bill. If you fill it with borrowing or just leaving the emergency spending hole, future generations have to pay for it. 
   Now, I know we disagree on that, but it is, I think, a very honest philosophical and policy difference, and the bills reflect that.

   Unfortunately, in the Senate, the majority does not rule. The Senate has decided that they will let the minority rule. They did that when we were in the majority, and it was done when your party was in the majority. We have both discussed the problems that causes a body that can, in fact, allow the majority to rule. Having said that, we are working towards trying to do what the gentleman suggested, getting our work done. To the extent that we can cooperate with one another, that will facilitate that objective.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend of some 45 years for his observations. There are a lot of my very dear friends for a long time in this chamber. 
   Israel is America's friend for a very long time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting today that Members of both sides of the aisle, almost in unanimity, join to recognize the founding of our Nation's steadfast friend and ally, the State of Israel, to reconfirm the special bond that exists between our two Nations, and to reiterate that the support for Israel in this Congress is bipartisan, overwhelming, stronger than ever, and continuing to grow. 
   On May 14, 1948, the day on which the British mandate for Palestine expired, the people of Israel proclaimed the sovereign and independent State of Israel. And 11 minutes later the United States, at the direction of President Harry S. Truman, recognized the establishment of this new state.  
   President Truman observed, at that time, and I quote, ``I had faith in Israel before it was established, I have faith in it now. I believe that it has a glorious future before it, not just another sovereign nation, but an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.'' 
   So said President Harry Truman, May 14, 1948, 11 minutes after the declaration of sovereignty of the State of Israel. An embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization. I believe that to be the fact, and because I believe that to be the fact, I believe it is absolutely essential that those who uphold those ideals pledge their support and defense of Israel against those who would undermine, not only the nation, but the idea of the civilization that Truman said it represents. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the ensuing 6 decades, it has become increasingly clear that Israel's success is not only a strategic imperative for the United States, but a moral imperative as well. Ours is a relationship of principle and conscience, of shared values and common aspirations, of peace and opportunity and a mutual commitment to freedom and democracy. 
   The United States and Israel are nations of immigrants. We are safe havens for the oppressed. The Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp beside the golden door, ``Send these, the poor, the homeless, tempest tossed to me,'' it says. That is what Israel has said to millions of Jews, and others as well, black and white. 
   We are partners with Israel for peace, and we are united in fighting against terrorism. Few people on Earth have been subjected to more bigotry, violence and discrimination than have the Jewish people, and no people are more in need, in my view, of a sovereign, secure homeland to provide safe haven and to protect identity. 
   That is why the Balfour Resolution was passed in 1918. That is why, in 1948, the world looked on the creation of Israel as an imperative. 
   David Ben-Gurion once remarked: ``The security of Israel is,'' he said, and I quote, ``a question of the survival, not only of the people of Israel, but of the Jewish people the world over.'' 
   History has taught us that is true. Throughout the last 60 years, Israel has been an island of freedom in a sea of despair and an absence of democracy. It has been vilified, threatened and attacked. My colleagues have set forth those facts. 
   And yet, it has prevailed, indeed, prospered, just as it will prevail and prosper today and tomorrow and every day thereafter. 
   When we talk of Israel, we inevitably acknowledge her courage in the face of those who seek her destruction. But let us also acknowledge that over the last 60 years, the Israeli people have established a vibrant, pluralistic, democratic political system that includes freedom of speech, association, religion, a vigorous free press, free, fair and open elections, the rule of law, and an independent judiciary. 
   Furthermore, Israel has developed an advanced entrepreneurial economy, and is among the world's leaders in the high tech industry. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Berman observed, over the last 5 years I've had the opportunity to take a tenth of the Congress, actually more than a tenth of the Congress to Israel, congressional delegations, which have gone to see where we invest our money and where we have committed our security pledge. And what the Members saw was a reflection, really, in many respects, of America and themselves, people who love their country, people who want to live in peace and freedom, and people who want their children to have even greater opportunities and safety. 
   As our allies in Israel celebrate their 60th anniversary in just a few weeks, let us honor their determination to fulfill the vision of Zionism's founding father, Theodore Herzl. Through courage and will, Israel was born and the dream of generations was made real, and it will endure. It will endure with our support, with our encouragement, and with our commitment. 
   I want to congratulate the citizens of Israel and the entire Jewish community, not only in the United States, but throughout the world, who have enabled Israel to survive. Congratulations. Happy birthday. 
   We remain a loyal, steadfast and unswerving ally in your quest for a better life, not just for your people, but, as Truman observed, for civilization as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (FOOD ALLERGY AND ANAPHYLAXIS MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I rise in very strong support of this legislation, and I thank the gentlelady from New York for her leadership on this issue. I thank Mr. Deal for his leadership, as well, on this very, very important issue. 
   Madam Speaker, today this House is considering seven very important but largely noncontroversial public health bills. This week, of course, is National Public Health Week, a time to reflect on the importance of the quality of public health programs and a time to reiterate our commitment to addressing the critical problems that afflict America's health care system, such as exploding costs and the rising number of uninsured. 
   Today, however, I want to address one of the seven health bills that we are considering. The one under consideration right now is H.R. 2063, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act, introduced by my good friend, Nita Lowey, of New York, the chairwoman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, with whom I had the great privilege of serving for many years. She is a longtime member of the Health and Human Services and Education Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. On that committee, she has focused on health care for Americans, but health care particularly for children, as she has focused on education for our children. 
   In short, Madam Speaker, this legislation will provide schools across the  country with uniform guidance on how to create appropriate management and emergency plans for children with food allergies. It will direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a voluntary policy for schools to implement measures to prevent exposure to food allergens and to ensure a prompt response if a child suffers a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction. 
   Madam Speaker, deadly food allergies are not some arcane, rare occurrence. Frankly, even if they were, they would require our attention. But the reality is that as many as 2 million school-age children suffer from food allergies. One of those children is my granddaughter, Alexa. 
   No cure currently exists. Avoiding any and all products with allergy-causing ingredients is the only way to prevent potentially life-threatening reactions, reactions including severe anaphylaxis, which often occur at school and which can kill within minutes, unless epinephrine is administered. 
   Alexa, Madam Speaker, is 5 years of age. When she is at my house, as she was this past weekend, when she is in a restaurant, she is acutely aware, extraordinarily aware, for a 5-year-old, of what she can and cannot eat. And her mother, my daughter, asked the restaurant, what do you cook your french fries in? What do you use on your foods? It is an extraordinarily anxious time when my granddaughter eats. Just last week, for example, members of my family, including Alexa, visited my office, and we had sandwiches put out for a number of the family members. We had to make sure that all peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were removed from our conference room before Alexa entered to protect her. 
   To tell you how extraordinarily sensitive she is, she was in Disney World in Florida. She was walking with her mother and father down the pathway there from one exhibit to the other, and all of a sudden she started to wheeze heavily. Anne, who had seen this happen before, could not understand it because she didn't have anything to eat. They retraced their steps, and about 100 feet before this started, 100 feet, they saw some popcorn being popped in peanut oil. And it was simply the wind wafting that peanut odor. And whatever it was in the air she then breathed in, and that immediately started to give her a problem. 
   The importance of managing life-threatening food allergies in the school setting has been recognized by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Nurses and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. One of the extraordinary nurses of America is our colleague, Lois Capps. And I want to thank Congresswoman Capps for her leadership on this issue, as well. As a health professional, she knows firsthand of the consequences of allowing this to go unchecked and unprepared for. 
   Unfortunately, no consistent, standardized guidelines currently exist to help schools safely manage students with potentially deadly food allergies. As a matter of fact, my daughter, and parents similarly situated, meet with their child's teacher, Alexa is in kindergarten, and teaches them how to use the EpiPen, and it is ever present. My daughter goes nowhere without her EpiPen for use on Alexa should she have an attack. 
   That is why it is critical that we pass H.R. 2063 to ensure the safety of not only Alexa, but the millions of other school-age children afflicted with food allergies across the country. 
   I recently went to an event in New York. And after the event, I went to dinner, and there were eight of us at the table. Three of us were grandfathers. Eight people, in New York, not anything dealing with this issue, all three grandfathers were telling one another about the fact that they have grandchildren with food allergies. That is why it is critical that we pass this bill to ensure the safety not only of Alexa, but as I said, of the millions of other school-age children. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to support this important, life-saving legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we will not take, certainly, the hour that is allotted; but I first of all want to say something about the two individuals who have just resigned their appointments as Clerk and as Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to serve from 1987 to 2000 on the House Administration Committee and worked with my friend, Mr. Ehlers, Mr. Thomas, and others. I was a member of the House Administration Committee on which Vic Fazio, our former colleague from California, was the ranking member. He and Mr. Thomas came together and selected Jay Eagen to be the Chief Administrative Officer. 
   I think it would be inappropriate if I did not rise and congratulate Mr. Eagen on the job that he has done. I believe that Jay Eagen has brought a degree of professional management to this House of Representatives, which has been a credit to the institution and a credit to all of the Members, and a credit, I might say, to my colleagues on the Republican side, to the Republican leadership on this issue, and I congratulate them for that. 
   Mr. Eagen is someone who has worked on this Hill for many years. He will be leaving the Hill and leaving this city and moving his family to the west, and we wish him the very, very best. 
   Mr. Speaker, Karen Haas, who has been the Clerk and who submitted her resignation is, as well, someone who has worked for this institution, cares deeply about the House, and has comported herself, although for a relatively short period of time as the Clerk of our House, in a way that brought honor to the Office of Clerk and brought credit to the House of Representatives. 
   I know from my perspective personally and from Speaker Pelosi, and I both want to, on behalf of our caucus, extend to them our deepest thanks and gratitude for the service that they have rendered to the House of Representatives and to our country. Both of them, I know, have very exciting things to come. They are both young, they both have much to offer, and we wish them the very best. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will reserve the balance of my comments on Ms. Miller and Mr. Beard and would certainly yield now to Mr. Ehlers, who may also want to say something.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the comments. I appreciated my comments when I made them. I still want you to know that I appreciate them, and I think that is a good practice. 
   I had the opportunity of sitting down with Mr. Beard just a few days ago, essentially, almost verbatim, in terms of how I believe he ought to operate his office in the sense that this is a business office, this is not a partisan office. Hopefully, he will respond to doing what is in the best business management practice, best practices as well as his own judgment without respect to party or partisanship. I would hope that that would happen. I expect it to happen. 
   But I appreciate the comments that have been made. 
   I want to say that, also, I am strongly in support of Lorraine Miller. This is a historic appointment, first African American to serve as an officer of the House, not just as Clerk of the House but as an officer of the House. 
   Lorraine Miller has served for three Speakers now. She served President Clinton in the White House. She is president of the NAACP in Washington, D.C. She is an extraordinarily knowledgeable, able individual; and she will be a tremendous asset to this institution and I think will send a very strong and powerful message to all of America about inclusion, as the election of our Speaker did. 
   Mr. Beard, as some of you know, has more than three decades of experience in policy and executive management, including senior positions in the House of Representatives, the United States Senate, the White House and the Interior Department, as well as the Library of Congress. Obviously, he has a long, distinguished career in management and, as such, is a professional appointment. 
   Again, I appreciate the comments that have been made. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the nomination of both, because I believe both will serve this institution in a professional manner that brings credit on their offices and on this institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Clyburn be able to manage the balance of time available to me.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether the gentleman who just spoke understands the pain that he inflicts, understands the lack of respect that he shows, understands the denial of democracy that he reflects. 
   I tell the gentleman that my friend who sits behind you, four aisles back, represents seven times as many people as you and I represent, seven times as many people, who, if they move from the island of Puerto Rico to the State of Maryland, the State of Pennsylvania, have full voting rights. But he inflicts on the gentleman from American Samoa and those Samoans who have fought for this country and died and are serving today who have no vote. And for you on your side to represent that this is a power grab, in my opinion, is absolutely unconscionable, in your words, because it is so inaccurate. 
   Why did the court of appeals rule this to be constitutional? Because it does not diminish any one of the 435 Members in this body. Why? Because this is symbolism. This is symbolic. The Delegates know it. The Delegates know that this is not full voting rights for them or for the people they represent.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, and we are running out of time, I want to say that when I yielded, I was talking about symbolism. All of us believe that symbolism is very important. Our flag is a great symbol. Samoans have died for that flag. Residents of the District of Columbia have died for that flag. Residents of the Virgin Islands have died for that flag. Residents of Guam have died for that flag. And many, many residents of Puerto Rico have died for that flag. 
   Yes, this is symbolic, which is why the courts said it was appropriate, because it does not constitutionally diminish the vote of any one of the 435 Members of this body one iota. Why? Because if their votes make a difference, we automatically have a vote of the 435 of us. That is why the courts said this is absolutely constitutional. 
   It is not enough, what we do today. But it would be tragic if we do not do at least this basic step to recognize the inclusion of those who serve with us, who can speak with us, who can vote in committee across the street or in this building, but who have had their vote in the Committee of the Whole taken away from them when the Republicans took power in 1995.     
   Let us restore that vote today. Vote for this rule, which is a fair rule. And I say to my friend who quoted my comments, you were accorded a right to a substitute. You chose not to take it. You were accorded the right to an amendment. You now want to withdraw that. I will tell you that, on our side, if you want to withdraw that amendment by unanimous consent, we will not object. But my understanding is you don't want to make that request.

   On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 o'clock. We will consider a long-term continuing resolution. I want Members to hear that because on Wednesday we will consider the long-term continuing resolution. We have a continuing resolution which expires on February 15. The long-term will cover approximately nine appropriation bills that failed to pass in the last Congress and will fund most of government, other than the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department. 
   The House will not meet on Thursday and Friday next week in order to accommodate the Democratic Members issues conference. I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There are some problems that are raised because bills failed to pass, military construction being one, the veterans being another, which have put us in a position where if there is not additional language and funding in the bill, and they are, of course, both as a result of the earmarks not being funded and as a result of the caps not being met that was in the Republican budget that passed but did not pass the Congress, and the level of funding in the 2007 bills that did not pass, there need to be some things in there that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Obey are both aware of. As I understand, they are working together in a bipartisan fashion. The staffs are working together. 
   So I will tell my friend, although I cannot tell you specifically because they are still working on it, as you know from your past experience that these are works in progress, that my expectation is there will be additional funding for programs that will be very adversely affected if they were required to go forward at 2006 levels or the lower of the House- or Senate-passed bills.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The answer to that question is we are working closely with the Senate. The CR expires, as you know, on February 15. The Senate has a very difficult challenge. I know that Mr. Reid is trying to work with Mr. McConnell to figure out how they can do it. 
   What we are really trying to do is trying to see if we can have a Senate and House agreement so that we can meet that February 15 deadline with this CR, which would not necessitate going back to a subsequent CR; in other words, making this a CR through September 30 of this year and take care of the 2007 funding cycle. 
   As Mr. Obey has indicated, the reason for that is we are now proceeding on the 2008 cycle, and until we put the 2007 cycle behind us, it is difficult to focus on that. 
   So I frankly don't have the answer to that question at this point in time because those discussions are going on between the House and the Senate. 
   Mr. Lewis and Mr. Obey are involved in what we are doing here, and we are, after all, talking about nine bills, numerous departments and agencies and objects, and frankly, if that bill is open to amendment, CRs, as you know, generally come with closed rules, and they are clean CRs usually, but even some nonclean CRs, and that is for the public's sake, things that have additional items other than simply funding levels at a given level, have been closed rules. 
   Obviously to try to get through nine different bills on the House floor between now and February 25, much less February 15, if the bill is open to amendment, as appropriation bills generally are, as you know, would be something probably we would not be able to do. So that is being discussed, trying to figure it out. 
   I don't have a definitive answer for you here on Wednesday, but I want to tell you candidly that I believe there will not be a full opportunity in the sense that there has been, and I am not sure that I can represent to the gentleman that there will be an open rule.

   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, if my friend would yield before he asks another question, as my friend knows well, having not passed appropriations bills, and, frankly, leaving in December without passing appropriations bills was, of course, the other body's judgment, we passed the bills through here except for the Labor-Health bill, we are placed in an extraordinarily difficult position. We labored long and hard, and I was then a member of the Appropriations Committee, on our bills. We considered them here on the floor. There was debate. There were amendments offered. They passed. 
   Frankly, the ideal, as you well know, would have been to have them pass, go to conference and pass them through both Houses. But we are now confronted with a lot of work product over a year on all of these bills out of the Appropriations Committee now sitting, frankly, in limbo with a deadline of February 15 to have a short-term CR, which we are not for. We want to complete this business. 
   So we have a challenge that I think is relatively unique, given all of this work product, of just not having a simple CR which says we do '06 levels, because all that work product would be, A, down the drain, and B, was responding to needs that the administration wants, that our military wants, that our veterans want, that others need. So that is the challenge confronting Mr. Obey and Mr. Lewis. 
   I know you appreciate that. The failure was not on this side of the Capitol, but the fact of the matter is, wherever the failure was, we are now confronted with trying to solve the problem. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I certainly reassure you we are moving in that direction, and I would hope that would be the case. I hope the gentleman will take this as a very friendly observation that in this case, the gentleman wouldn't take apparently yes for an answer. We were going to give him an amendment. 
   As you know, the day before we had been bitterly criticized for not giving amendments. I was not there and I did not participate in this decision, but the committee was confronted with wanting to be in a position to give an amendment. Then when they were told the gentleman didn't want the amendment, they in effect took yes for an answer. The gentleman did not. 
   I understand that. We want to accommodate that. You are absolutely right. If a Member doesn't want to offer the amendment, he didn't have to offer the amendment, he did not offer the amendment. Nobody has been forced to offer an amendment. He was given the opportunity to do so. 
   But we do understand that Members make decisions that maybe that is not what I want to do, and I would like to withdraw it. Certainly I hope we will accommodate Members in the future.

   Mr. HOYER. I want to say, Mr. Leader, we also wanted to give you a substitute, but you didn't want that either, and we didn't give you that substitute, then, I guess. 
   In any event, your point is well taken, and I don't want to be jocular about the fact. We really do want to make sure that you can come to this floor and think you are being treated fairly and openly and have an opportunity to make your legislative case. That is the way this body ought to work. 
   I know the first 2 1/2 weeks now we have been moving on an agenda, rules changes and others, that we wanted to get done. As you know, some of these have involved rules changes, as this particular bill did. 
   As you know, although Mr. Dreier talked about having hearings on this, rarely does either side have hearings on the rules it presents. The rules package is put together by the majority party and there aren't hearings on it. It is offered on the floor and it is voted up or down. In this case we offered your rules, as you know, as they were in being in the 109th Congress. There were some additions we wanted to make. 
   But your point is well taken. I share your view that we want to make sure, whether we disagree, that you feel you got the opportunity on your side of the aisle to make your case.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I am proud to be joined by House Democratic Whip Clyburn, House Democratic Caucus Chair Emanuel, Vice Chair Larson, and of course the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee in sponsoring House Resolution 78. 
   This measure will restore voting rights in the Committee of the Whole for the four House Delegates and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. 
   In fact, this measure is identical in substance to the rule that operated successfully--and constitutionally--from 1993 to 1995. 
   The purpose of this resolution is simple: 
   To honor democracy in every corner of the United States of America; 
   To provide that all people who are subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the United States have a voice in their national legislature; and 
   To give to the elected representatives of the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa and Puerto Rico--constituent parts of this country--the ability to register their views and take a stance on issues that are considered in the most important and representative committee of the house: the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union. 
   During the 103rd Congress, House Delegates, as well as the Resident Commissioner, were granted the privilege to cast a vote in the Committee of the Whole, a body comprised of all House Members whose function is to expedite consideration of bills and amendments on the House floor while ensuring that debate is fair to both sides of the aisle. 
   This right is a logical extension of the Delegates' right to serve on and vote in the House committees--a right, I must stress, that was granted in the 1970s and to which no Member of this body whom I know has ever objected. 
   The measure that we will vote on today is identical to the rule that existed in the 103rd Congress, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held in 1994 was constitutional. 
   To ensure that the provision complies with article I of the United States Constitution, in the event that a matter before the Committee of the Whole is decided by the margin of the Delegates' votes, the measure provides for an automatic re-vote in the full House, where Delegates and the Resident Commissioner may not participate. 
   Now, I want to address some of the misinformation that has been directed at this measure by opponents whose desire to defeat this resolution is more intense than their fealty to the facts. 
   I have heard opponents contend that this measure confers ``representation without taxation.'' 
   That is false. 
   The residents who will benefit from this measure do indeed pay taxes in the form of Medicare and Social Security. 
   At a time when the President's own economic advisors predict that these two programs will go bust if changes are not made in the next few years, I for one believe residents of the five territories should have a voice in shaping a bipartisan consensus that shores up the financial health of these vital programs. 
   I have heard opponents contend that the average congressional district is 630,000 and that American Samoa, with a population of roughly 70,000 is too small to deserve even a symbolic vote. 
   However, opponents making this argument omit the inconvenient case of Puerto Rico, whose population of almost 4 million would entitle it to as many as six seats if it had full representation. 
   They also omit Wyoming, whose population of only 515,000 puts it well below the average congressional district. 
   I have heard opponents contend that the five votes will slow down the legislative process and distort outcomes. 
   According to a 1994 article in the Congressional Quarterly Almanac, ``Of the 404 times that delegates were eligible to vote during the 103rd Congress, only three times--all in 1994--did their vote prove decisive, triggering an automatic revote.'' Twice the outcome was reversed, proving that the rule worked. 
   My friends, I would submit to each and every one of you that something magical happens when 435 Representatives from the 50 States come to this floor to vote on behalf of their constituents. 
   Simply put, the genius of deliberative democracy achieves its fullest expression. 
   We hear each other out on issues of the day. 
   We get to know one another as something more than Members. 
   We come to understand the needs and aspirations of one another's districts, whatever our political leanings. 
   And through this process of personal interaction, we enact laws that, when we are at our best, make our country better. 
   By granting a limited but important vote to five of our colleagues, we will be honoring the deliberative democratic process. 
   In doing so, we will improve the legislative process and the degree to which the House of Representatives accurately reflects the views of the 300 million Americans who are subject to laws it passes. 
   In that sense, every American, as well as our democratic system of government as a whole, stands to benefit from House Resolution 78. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.

   As you have read, we are discussing how to process the supplemental. As I indicated to you, it is my intention that we will pass the supplemental prior to Memorial Day. By that, I mean in sufficient time so the Senate can do so as well so we can pass it finally. 
   That is my hope and my intention. We are still working on the components of the supplemental, and very frankly, it has not yet been finally decided as to how that might be processed. Obviously, at times in the past it has been added to other legislation. In other times, it has been passed as a free-standing bill. Committee consideration, obviously, is part of the regular order, if we go that way, but there are other ways to go. We want to facilitate the passage of it as quickly as possible.

We have over 30,000 severely injured. Obviously, the GI bill for those who came home from World War II and Korea had very good benefits that were helpful to them. Unfortunately, particularly with respect to our Guard and Reserve, that is not the case.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think the good news is that certainly on the farm bill, Mr. Peterson indicates that progress is being made. As you know, we extended it to May 2 to give the conference committee a little more time. 
   They have been working at it very diligently. It's difficult. There were substantial differences, not so much partisan differences, but substantial differences between the two Houses. The Democrats and Republicans, frankly, on both sides of the issues. 
   We believe that progress is being made. I am hopeful that we can, in the next week, have a conference report on the farm bill on the floor. I am hopeful. I am not predicting that, but I am hopeful. 
   As to the budget, I think progress is being made there as well. There are some thorny issues. We are very committed to PAYGO. You mentioned PAYGO as it relates to the GI bill. We are committed to PAYGO. I was very pleased to hear that some of your members want to make sure that the veterans bill is paid for. The war costs, which we believe the veterans benefit are a part of, are not paid for, as you know, in the President's proposal. 
   But with respect to the third conference, the higher education bill, let me see if I have a note here. We are also making progress, it says, on the higher education conference. But it is likely, according to the chairman, that we will need a short-term extension next week because apparently they are not sure that they will get it finished by next week. So we may need an extension. If so, we will bring one to the floor. I presume that will be in agreement with both the ranking member and the chairman.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (TRIBUTE TO TECHNICAL SERGEANT ANTHONY CAPRA -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I quote: ``Somehow or other their faces seemed different from those of ordinary men.'' 
   Winston Churchill wrote those words about volunteers who risked their lives defusing bombs in wartime. I imagine that he saw in their faces the constant strain of knowing that their smallest movements over the bomb could mean the difference between life and death. I imagine that he saw in the lines and creases the evidence of the burden they carried for their comrades; and, deeper still, some indefinable quality that made them willing to take that burden on again and again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I never met Technical Sergeant Tony Capra. But underneath all the marks of strain and stress, I am sure I could have seen there his love for his family: His wife, Angie; his five children, Mark, Victoria, Jared, Shawn, and Adrianna; his 11 brothers and sisters; his mother and his father. 
   Last week I had the opportunity to talk to his father about the loss of his son in Iraq as he disabled an IED and it exploded. Obviously, he saved scores of others, and paid the ultimate price. His dad, as one would imagine, was extraordinarily sad, but also exceptionally proud of the duty his son had performed. 
   I am sure I could have seen in his devotion to our Armed Forces an absolute commitment to their mission, to his duty, to his country. 
   Sergeant Tony Capra, 31 years of age, died on April 9th in Iraq. He was an Air Force Ordnance Technician based in Indian Head City, Maryland, in my district, an expert diffuser of improvised explosive devices. Quoting from the report about him, his ``keen eye for details, astounding memory, and courage without measure,'' in the words of his commanding officer, as I have said, saved countless lives. 
   But in the middle of an Iraqi road, not far from Balad Air Force Base, an explosion took his life. Sergeant Capra was on his fourth tour in Iraq. When he could have rested at home, he volunteered to return to work, to work  against explosive devices designed to maim and kill his fellow soldiers, as well as innocent Iraqi men and women, and, yes, too many children. He placed his body in harm's way. He laid his life down for others. He died in our country's service and was posthumously awarded a second Bronze Star. 
   But this great Nation owes him a debt far beyond its power to repay. It is because of the bravery and sacrifice of American patriots like Tony Capra that a dangerous dictator no longer menaces his own people and the world, and that 25 million human beings who were oppressed for a quarter of a century are currently struggling to establish a democratic government that answers to its own people, that stands for freedom, and respects the rule of law. That was Tony Capra's vision. That is why he served his country so well. 
   I hope, in time, that Tony's unwavering patriotism and courage gives some comfort to his family. I know it does. But, today, there is so little we can say to soften this blow. As his young brother James said shortly after his death, ``It's like a puzzle. Our family is not complete without all the pieces together.'' 
   Memories of Tony are all that can be put in his place, and I know how insufficient they must seem right now. But my sincere hope for you, the family and friends of Sergeant Capra, is that those memories will turn in time from a source of grief to a well of comfort; that you will be consoled by the loving and devoted way he lived, and the fearless way he died in the service of others. 
   Let me end with this thought. We often speak in abstractions in this Chamber. We use words like ``supplemental,'' ``counterinsurgency,'' ``redeployment.'' But behind each of these words is a young life like Sergeant Capra's. More than 4,000 Americans, like Tony Capra, have paid the ultimate price, have given the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation in Iraq and Afghanistan. They bear the burden of the decisions we make here almost every day. And we have a responsibility, indeed, we have a moral obligation, to never forget the Tony Capras and the 4,000 others whom we have lost. 
   Mr. Speaker, may God bless Tony Capra, a man of courage, patriotism, valor and commitment, and may He console and strengthen those who grieve his loss.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is no mere coincidence that this legislation, which will implement the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, is designated as House Resolution No. 1 in this new Congress. Our first and highest responsibility as Members of this Congress is to protect the American people, to defend our homeland, and to strengthen our national security. The fact is, our Nation today, 5 1/2 years after the attacks of September 11th, is still not as safe as it should and must be. 
   As Tom Kean, the former Republican Governor of New Jersey and cochair of the 9/11 Commission observed just a few months ago, ``We're not protecting our own people in this country. The government is not doing its job.'' That is the former Republican Governor of New Jersey, the cochair of the Commission. 
   Today, however, through this important legislation, this House will take a vital step forward in protecting our people and our Nation. We have taken steps, there is no doubt about that. We have taken steps together in a bipartisan way, but we have not taken all the steps we could take. And that is the point of the gentleman from Mississippi, and I support his contention. 
   This legislation among other things will substantially improve our homeland security by doing the following: 
   Significantly increasing the share of state homeland security grants provided on the basis of risk. I know that my good friend, the former chairman of the committee, agrees with that proposition. In fact, we passed it through this House; unfortunately, the Senate did not. 
   Creating a stand-alone grant program for interoperable communications for first responders. Curt Weldon and I have chaired for a long time the Fire Service Caucus. Interoperability is a critical issue for our country and for our security. 
   Phasing in the requirement of 100 percent inspection of air cargo over the next 3 years and 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound shipping containers over the next 5 years. How can we have security in America if literally thousands of tons of cargo is being shipped in either by air or ship that we don't know its content? 
   Accelerating the installation of explosive detection systems for checked baggage. A critical step. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 1 will help us prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. It will strengthen the cooperative threat reduction or Nunn-Lugar programs; create a coordinator for the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism; and strengthen efforts to eliminate a nuclear black market network. I would think all of us would want to see those objectives accomplished. 
   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 seeks to reduce extremism by enhancing the International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund and establishing a Middle East foundation that will promote economic opportunities, education reform, human rights and democracy in the Middle East, all of which was proposed by Governor Kean, Mr. Hamilton and unanimously the 9/11 Commission. 
   It also bears noting, Mr. Speaker, that this bill will strengthen the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board, removing the board from the executive office of the President and making it an independent agency and granting the board subpoena power. 
   I mention these provisions because I believe they demonstrate that we can improve our security without compromising the democratic principles upon which this great Nation was founded. 
   Let no one, however, be mistaken: This legislation alone, nor perhaps any legislation, can immunize our Nation from attack. However, it represents an important step forward for our national security. That is why we wanted to accomplish it in the first 100 hours of our deliberation. 
   As former Congressman Lee Hamilton, the other cochair of the 9/11 Commission noted, Mr. Speaker, just yesterday, ``The bottom line is, if this bill, H.R. 1, is enacted, funded and implemented, then the American people will be safer.'' 
   That is our objective. I am confident that is the objective of every Member of this House, Democrat or Republican. That is our responsibility. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, to support this critically important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my very distinguished friend for yielding and thank him for his leadership in this Congress, in the great city that he represents and his State of Illinois. He does a wonderful job. 
   I am pleased to join the sponsor of this resolution, my good friend, VERN  EHLERS. VERN EHLERS represents the district, as some of you have already been told, I am sure, I just got to the floor, but I am sure you have been told he represents the district that Gerald Ford represented for a quarter of a century. 
   Jerry Ford was my friend. President Ford was someone who I got to know after he was President of the United States. As Mr. Davis observed, I was not in the Congress and did not serve with President Ford. He was, however, a distinguished leader of this body. 
   I would like to say just a few words, Mr. Speaker, about the contributions of a great American leader, a man who personified integrity, openness, civility and a sense of responsibility, and a man who helped restore public confidence in our institutions of government during a time of national crisis and grave doubt about our government, and that doubt existed here in this country and abroad. 
   President Jerry Ford, our Nation's 38th President, took office during a period of American history when deep skepticism was the norm and uncertainty ruled the day. The challenges he faced were not the product of his actions, but he effectively confronted them and helped our proud Nation rise above its ``long national nightmare,'' as he referred to it, and to begin dreaming again about the promise that has been ours since our founding. 
   President Ford, of course, never asked to be our Commander in Chief. The responsibilities and burdens of that office were thrust upon him when he chose to answer our Nation's highest calling. That calling came because of the respect that was accorded to him in this House, in the United States Senate and in our country. 
   He never put partisanship or ambition ahead of the needs of the American people, seeking instead to heal our national wounds. Where he saw division, he built bridges, and where he saw doubt, he nurtured trust. 
   I am proud to be able tonight to serve in the same Chamber where Gerald R. Ford served our Nation for such a long time. I have now served one year longer than Gerald Ford served in this House. He served for 25 years. I am in my 26th year. But no one brought more luster to their service, no one brought more integrity to this House, no one was a better example of what all of us ought to be as Members of this great institution, the People's House, than was Gerald R. Ford of Michigan. 
   He offered his talents for seeking compromise and building consensus. I would hope all of us would take a lesson from Gerald Ford as we move ahead over the next 2 years. Too often, the cycle that we enter is a cycle of confrontation rather than consensus creation. We need consensus. America wants consensus. America wants progress. America wants a Congress focused on its need, not a Congress focused on how we can make the other guy look bad. 
   Gerald Ford can be an example and should be an example for all of us to emulate. I am honored to have this opportunity to carry on President Ford's steadfast commitment to God, to country, to, obviously, his family, his beloved wife Betty and to the People's House. 
   It goes without saying that the thoughts and prayers of an indebted Nation are with the Ford family in their time of sorrow. I want to congratulate the Ford family, who conducted themselves with such great dignity and returned the caring of literally tens of thousands of people who came through our Rotunda to honor President Ford and his service and to thank him for that which he has done for our country. Jack and Susan in particular stood for hours greeting people and thanking them for being there, and the other children as well. 
   On December 26, 2006, we lost a great American, a great leader and a great friend. I was a member of the Appropriations Committee and had the honor of chairing the Treasury-Postal Committee. The Treasury-Postal Committee had under its aegis the retirement funds for our former Presidents, and in that capacity, I had an opportunity to talk to him from time to time, not about his own personal interests, which we did talk about, but that is not why we talked. 
   He talked about the institution. He talked about what we were doing to make this House run better. I can remember we were at a forum at Georgetown together over two decades ago at which we both spoke, and he spoke of the need for having more contested elections, as opposed to districts that were automatic for one party or the other. He said that would be good for democracy, good for discussion of issues and good for the creation of consensus. 
   Gerald Ford's indomitable spirit will live in these halls of power and service for generations to come, halls that will forever bear the mark of his influence and dedication to the people of the United States of America. 
   I want to extend my deepest sympathy to President Ford's beloved wife, Betty, his children and his family and loved ones, and in closing thank him; thank him for being an example to which all of us could repair for service in this body; thank him for being an example for the American people to look to for what a Member of Congress can and ought to be, a man of principle, a man of generosity, a man who cared about his country and its people. 
   Gerald Ford, we thank you for your service, and we miss you.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for yielding. I thank Mr. Dingell for his indefatigable advocacy on behalf of children and on behalf of the health of all Americans. I thank my Republican colleagues, as well, for a large number of them supported this legislation when it passed the House. 
   In fact, over 60 percent of this House voted for this legislation. Over 66 percent of the Senate voted for this legislation. We are just a percentage point short of overriding the President's veto. We are not going to override that veto today. That is unfortunate. It is not unfortunate for me. It is not unfortunate for the 434 of us who have a health insurance program, and we have the most accessible health care perhaps of any American. But it is very unfortunate for those parents who woke up this morning and prayed that their children didn't get sick and prayed  that they didn't get sick because they don't have health insurance, and they are not sure that without health insurance they will have access. They will have access perhaps if their child gets very sick, gets very badly injured, because then they will take them to the emergency room and the emergency room will see them. 
   There is not one of us, not a person in this Chamber, who would want their children, their grandchildren, or in my case, my great-granddaughter, in that predicament. Not one of us. The gentleman from Georgia who previously spoke talked about politics, and Mr. Barton I think has mentioned, I haven't heard all of the debate, but mentioned this was about politics. Well, I would agree; it is about politics. Everything we do on this floor is about politics, not necessarily partisan politics, but about public policy and the politics to achieve public policy and the philosophy underlying the achievement of that policy. 
   You've heard me quote it before. You are probably tired of hearing me quote it. But I am going to quote it again. The President of the United States was seeking reelection in 2004. In the summer, late summer of 2004, he stood on the floor of the Republican Convention and said to all America, ``If I am reelected in a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' 
   He was reelected. And in 2005, there was no aggressive effort to enroll millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance. And the Republicans were in charge of this House and of this Senate. There was no aggressive effort here, either. And in 2006, when the same leadership maintained, there was no aggressive effort to add millions of children consistent with the President's promise of 2004. 
   But when we were elected and when we took over the leadership of this House and when Mr. Dingell took over leadership of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Rangel took over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Mr. Stark took over the chairmanship of the Health Subcommittee, lo and behold, we pursued the President's objective. Now, that may be political. But it was certainly the politics promoted by the President. It was the objective that the President said was an important one. It was a promise he made to America's children and America's families. And so we passed a bill through this House with 45 Republicans, 43 on this particular bill, and in the Senate, two-thirds of the Senate, 18 Republican United States Senators, almost half of the Senate delegation on the Republican side of the aisle voted for this bill. 
   And indeed, two of the senior Members, including the former chairman, Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, now the ranking member of the Finance Committee, and Senator Hatch, one of the senior Members of the United States Senate, both conservative Republicans, urged this President to sign this bill. Why? Because the facts that you are hearing on this side of the aisle are wrong, Mr. President. That's what Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley said. Actually, they didn't say the facts on this side of the aisle that are being cited, but the facts that the President was saying was the reason for his veto, said they were wrong. 
   So, yes, we have another opportunity. And I want to tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, as the majority leader who schedules business for this floor, this won't be your last opportunity this year to address this issue. Is that politics? Maybe. And if it is bad politics, the people will not support it. But you and I both know that nigh onto 70 percent of the American public believes this bill ought to be passed, notwithstanding the veto of the President of the United States. Why did they think that? Because they know that their neighbors, maybe themselves, are challenged by their children not being covered. They are working. They are trying to make it. But as the economy tanks, hopefully we can stem that fall. They're worried. 
   Yes, this is about politics with a small ``p,'' about making public policy that helps our Americans who are working hard to make America a great country and expect their government to hear their cries for help. 
   We spent some 24 meetings trying to address some of the questions that Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite raised. Mr. Barton was in a couple of those meetings. We didn't get there. We regret that we didn't get there. Frankly, I want to tell you that I have talked to some of the people in that room who wanted to get there and were disappointed that we didn't get there. You've talked to them, too, Mr. Barton, on your side of the aisle. 
   We have an opportunity to stand up for the 4 million additional children who will be helped by this legislation if we override the President's veto. Let's give those children the health care they need, they want, and a great Nation ought to ensure.

   Mr. HOYER. Well, as you know, he may do that. As you know, Leader Reid asked for unanimous consent yesterday for a 30-day extension of the present act which expires on the 1st of the month. Mr. McConnell, the minority leader, objected to that extension. 
   Furthermore, obviously, the Senate has not completed its work so that we are unable to go to conference at this point in time on the bill that we passed now some months ago, or over a month ago. 
   When the present Protect America Act, which we passed in August, time frame comes to an end the 1st of the month, of course the intelligence community will not go dark. The authorizations issued under the Protect America Act are in effect for up to, as you well know, a full year, so that those matters that have been approved for interception will not terminate. Those authorizations do not terminate on the 1st of February; so that hopefully the administration has requested authorization for any and all targets that it believes are important for us to be intercepting at this point in time. And certainly, if they know of any, they ought to be requesting such authorization in contemplation of the possibility. If the Senate doesn't act, we won't have a bill to pass. 
   I want to tell my friend that, according to a New York Times story today, Kenneth Wainstein, who's the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, he said that if PAA, the Protect America Act, were allowed to expire, intelligence officials would still be able to continue intercepting, he said eavesdropping, on already approved targets for another 12 months. That is what I was asserting, and that's the basis on which I make that assertion. 
   The Protect America Act only requires that the AG adopt guidelines for surveillance, as you know, rather than the individualized warrants to get 1-year authorization. These authorizations do not require the NSA to specify the name, number or location of the people they want to listen to, so that the situation we will find ourselves in, should the Senate not act or be able to act on Thursday either passing legislation or sending it to us, would be simply that the NSA and the administration would be relying on the authorizations they already have. 
   I would hope that if the Senate cannot act and that we could not go to conference, that we could agree on this side to a 30-day extension and send that over to the Senate. They failed to do that on unanimous consent, so it would give us time to go to conference, because, as my friend knows, there is obviously substantial controversy in the other body with reference to how the immunity issue is addressed. There is substantial controversy in this House about how that question should be addressed. And very frankly, I was hopeful that the Senate would act long before this, I know you've been in a similar situation, and that we would be in conference and try to resolve those differences. We haven't been able to do that. 
   Under no circumstances do we think, however, that the fact that February 1 comes and goes without the passing of either an extension or new legislation will undermine the ability of the NSA and the administration to continue to eavesdrop on those targets that it believes are important to focus on for the protection of our people and our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I understand his concern. 
   Obviously what concerns me is the proposition, as the gentleman puts forward, that we make sure we have the authorization to intercept those communications which may pose a danger to the United States and to our people. 
   I would hope and urge this administration if they know of any such targets, that they immediately request authorization under that, and they have another week essentially to do so. We believe those could be approved within, as some previous Justice Department official said, hours of application.  
   So in the first instance, I would hope that they would make efforts to preclude the possibility that we would have targets that aren't authorized. 
   Secondly, my concern is that the other body likes to put us in a position where it's take it or leave it; in other words, without discussion in terms of the very substantive important discussion on how we protect ourselves against terrorists and protect the Constitution. We think those are very important questions on both sides, not that they're either side, but we believe they can be consistent with one another, but we think we need the time to do so. 
   That is why I pressed so hard, as the gentleman knows, to pass a FISA bill through this House. We passed a FISA bill through this House over a month ago. It was in November, so with clearly enough time to give the other body which had also considered a bill. And when we passed our bill, we already had bills out of the Intelligence Committee; and the Judiciary Committee bill, I'm not sure whether it was out of committee or not, but it had been considered in committee. 
   So I think it's unfortunate that we've been put in this time frame, but I frankly, without deciding the question today on the floor, am very interested in pursuing this in the regular order to discuss between the two Houses whether or not we can reach a resolution on this immunity issue which I think is an important one, as well as reaching a resolution on what I think is a much improved process that the House passed and, very frankly, which I think the Senate bill also has made some improvements on in the Judiciary Committee. 
   There are differences on that, whether the Senate Intelligence Committee is a preferable item, Senate Judiciary or some blend of those two, but they have not reached a resolution on that. 
   So I hope I have conveyed to the gentleman that while I understand the concern, which I share, of getting this done, I was not happy in August. I voted against the bill in August as the gentleman knows. An overwhelming majority of this caucus voted against that legislation. However, many people voted for it, justifiably in the sense that we needed to get something done for the interim and set a time limit on it so that we would not be vulnerable if, in fact, we were. But we think the FISA court needs to be involved in these issues. 
   So, again, what I'm trying to convey to you is these are very serious questions, and they need to be thoughtfully addressed, and I, for one, am very unenthusiastic about addressing these issues on the horn of hours to go before a bill expires. 
   I urge the Senate not to do that to us, and we are about to find ourselves in that position. I'm not happy about it.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   In that context, can I ask the distinguished Republican whip whether or not, if we find ourselves in that position, whether you believe your side of the aisle would be prepared to support a 30-day extension so that we would not get into that position that you're concerned about, that if something came to light that the administration and/or NSA and the intelligence community felt ought to warrant action, that they would then be able to request such action during that additional 30 days while we see if both bodies can act?

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I think you raise an important concern. I think we all agree on the concern. I think also there are concerns about what the Congress did in creating the FISA court, the purpose of the FISA court. The concern with respect to executive action on intercepting communications, certainly domestically, should be overseen by the court, and to the extent that there may be spillover from foreign interceptions to domestic interceptions, that ought to be of concern to us as well. 
   You are correct, these are very serious matters, and I would hope that they would be addressed as such from all perspectives. 
   What the 30-day extension does is, if the Senate, and I would suggest the Senate has not acted in a timely manner. You're going on your retreat. I'd like to get a better word than ``retreat,'' but in any event, you're going on your retreat this week. We're doing the same next week. So essentially we have two legislative days left, and one of those, of course, is a 6:30 day, and the Senate says they're going to take this bill up Thursday. Let's assume they pass it on Thursday, which I don't assume. That gives us 1 day. The Senate knows our schedule. That is not fair to the Members of this House. It's not fair to the country. It's not fair to the Constitution. 
   And so I would hope that if we find ourselves in that position, as I think we do, that we could agree to preclude the fear that you have and give another 30 days for the process to work, for us to go to conference if the Senate has passed a bill, to go to conference, and hopefully the Senate will go to conference. The Senate hasn't been very inclined to go to conference. We're not pleased with that. I don't think you're pleased with that.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. I thank him for his leadership as well. I thank Mr. Conyers for his leadership, and I thank Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Smith for their participation. 
   This is a serious issue that confronts us. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, the RESTORE Act, is nothing less than the fundamental reiteration of the most basic concepts of our Constitution, our constitutional form of government that we, indeed, are a Nation of laws and that our Founders deliberately designed our three branches of government to serve as a check and balance on each other. 
   One of my colleagues, my friend, I believe, from Arizona, stood and said it was not the job of judges to conduct intelligence. He was correct. It is not the job of judges to conduct intelligence. But it is the constitutional duty given by our Founding Fathers, who understood that King George too often abused his sovereign power and who said to all that they would have adopt this Constitution that we will protect you from the abuse of power of government, and we will do it by having it reviewed by independent judges, not by the legislature. 
   We can be told by judges that we are not acting constitutionally, and that is a protection for our people against congressional abuse of power. And the executive department can be told by judges you are abusing your constitutional power. No power, no protection was felt to be more necessary and important by our Founding Fathers than their right to personal privacy and a lack of intrusion by King George just because he wanted to do it. And they said King George had to have probable cause, in this case, the Government of the United States. So that's why they established the courts. And we, in our wisdom, in my view, established the FISA Court to do just that. 
   Every single one of us here recognizes that our highest duty is to protect the American people. Indeed, we must detect, disrupt, and eliminate terrorists who have no compunction about planning and participating in the mass killing of innocent people. We saw that tragically on 9/11. We also, each one of us, come to this well or stand at our seats and raise our hand and swear an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, to protect its laws and to honor the values and principles that are contained therein. That is our oath. That is what we do here this night, including the fourth amendment right that Americans are secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. That's not an assertion on any individual or any government or even the  legislature. It was an assertion by our Founding Fathers that they had seen too often abuses by the executive agencies of government. 
   Our basic duties as Members of this Congress, protecting the American people and protecting the values that define us as Americans, are not mutually exclusive. We can protect our country and protect our Constitution. That is our duty. 
   And that is precisely what this historic act, introduced by Chairman Reyes and Chairman Conyers, has done. This legislation gives our intelligence community the tools it needs to listen in on those who seek to harm us while addressing concerns that the bill passed in August could authorize warrantless surveillance of Americans. That is our concern. That is our focus. 
   Among other things, this legislation modernizes the technologically outdated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 by restoring a checks and balances rule for the FISA Court and addressing the intelligence gap asserted by the Director of National Intelligence.     
   We heard Director McConnell. We want to help Director McConnell. Let us be clear. This legislation does not require a warrant for listening in on suspected and known terrorists, period. An assertion to the contrary is not accurate. In fact, it clarifies that no court order is required for surveillance of conversations where both parties are foreign citizens. It does not extend constitutional rights to suspected or known terrorists, assertions to the contrary notwithstanding. Nor does it delay the collection of intelligence information. 
   Furthermore, it grants the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence authority, authority to apply to the FISA Court for a block order, not an individual order, not a discrete order, but a block order saying that you can pursue this gathering of information to protect America, but you cannot do it simply because you want to do it. You've got to do it consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the laws thereof. You cannot conduct freelance surveillance without some authority of law. 
   The FISA Court can give a block order to conduct surveillance on large groups of foreign targets for up to a year, and that can be renewed, ensuring that only foreigners are targeted and Americans' rights are preserved. That was the whole reason in a bipartisan way we adopted FISA, to make sure that was the case. 
   Why do you fear a FISA Court reviewing that basic principle that was its intent at its adoption? 
   Finally, the legislation is silent on the issue of retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that possibly violated privacy laws in turning over consumer information to the government. We don't make that judgment today. We need to review information to know what was done before we immunize conduct which we do not know. Simply stated, it would be grossly irresponsible for Congress to grant a blanket immunity for companies without even knowing whether their conduct was legal, appropriate, reasonable or not. Don't you think the American public, each one of our constituents, expects that of us? 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me quote The Washington Post, which stated in October, the measure produced by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees would alleviate the burden of obtaining individualized warrants for foreign targets while still maintaining a critical oversight for the FISA Court. In other words, we are relieving the administration from the burden of discrete approval. But we are providing for the protections that Americans expect under our Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must give our Commander in Chief, the President of the United States and the intelligence community the resources, the authority, and flexibility that is necessary to protect our people and defend our Nation. I believe each of us in this Congress support that objective. But we must also honor the values and principles that make us Americans. This legislation allows us to do both. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, facilitate the interception of information and terrorist communication dangerous to our people and our country. And at the same time, redeem that oath of protecting and defending our Constitution.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We believe the TRIA bill is a very, very important bill. Chairman Frank has been very involved in this, as have bipartisan Members of the Financial Services Committee been involved in this. The gentleman is correct. As a result of what has happened for next week, we determined that both the FHA bill and the TRIA bill, which were both scheduled for the beginning of next week, would be moved until hopefully the following week.     
   We believe for TRIA and FHA, in light of the subprime issues, that Chairman Frank is working with the administration. I know he has talked to Secretary Paulson with respect to their proposals and ours on ways to respond to the subprime crisis, the mortgage foreclosure crisis. 
   So we want to put those bills back on as soon as we can. 
   The TRIA bill, as you observed, has raised an issue of PAYGO, as to whether or not there is a financial consequence of the legislation. The CBO has made an estimate. Clearly, however, there is no payout if a terrorist attack doesn't happen, so there is a contingency it would have to happen. We are trying to address that, which we did not anticipate, frankly. As a result, however, we are trying to look at this to see whether or not we can both move the legislation as quickly as possible as well as accommodate the issue of PAYGO.

   And in discussions with the chairman, I know the chairman has been focused. As you know, he visited Peru and Panama. I am not sure he visited Panama, I just talked with the Panamanians. Surely those two groups are the focus of the committee at this point, on Colombia, focused, as well as South Korea. 
   As I discussed with my friend earlier in the day, I am hopeful that the chairman, the chairman believes that Peru will be the first of those to move. We are hopeful that those, that that agreement will move, and then we will have to see the scheduling for the other three. But I do expect Peru to move, hopefully, within the next 30 days, or about, somewhere probably early next month.

   Mr. HOYER. The House, as the gentleman knows, has passed all 12 appropriation bills. I might say we did so, for the most part, with bipartisan votes, significant bipartisan votes, not necessarily a majority on each side, but significant bipartisan votes. 
   The Senate, as you point out, has passed two, although I understand that we just read across the desk, the military construction bill was just reported with a request to go to conference. We are hopeful that the Senate will pass other bills within the near term. 
   It's my understanding that the Senate does expect to be moving a number  of the appropriation bills in the next 2 weeks. 
   The fiscal year ends, of course, September 30. If we have not passed those appropriation bills, we will have to make an accommodation to keep the government running. We usually do that in the form of a continuing resolution, a CR, as we call it, which simply provides for the continuation of funding of government at present levels until such time as we can complete the appropriation process. 
   We are hopeful that we will complete the appropriation process in the near term. I won't define the near term, but we are hopeful that it will be nearer rather than further apart; but we are looking at all the alternatives that will be necessary to keep government operating as the American public expect and as we expect it.

   As you know, initially Mr. Boehner, my predecessor as the majority leader, had projected October 3 or thereabouts, 4th or 5th. When I became the majority leader, it was my responsibility to address the schedule. 
   I thought we would need at least another 3 weeks, so I added on to, I believe, the 26th of October, which is a Friday. 
   Since that time, of course, the leader of the Senate has announced the schedule that you just observed, with a week off at Columbus Day. We do not have that, of course. We have Columbus Day, returning Tuesday at 6:30. That has not been modified at this point in time and, frankly, I don't expect to modify it. 
   It doesn't mean it won't be, but I have no plans to modify that expectation at this point in time. Frankly, I would like to see us do as much work as we possibly can by the October 26 date that we have projected as our date. We will see where the Senate is at that point in time. 
   But in answer to your question about the fall schedule, sometime in the next 2 weeks, probably not this coming week, because we are not going to be here most of the time, but the following week, in discussions with the Senate, we intend to have some discussions with the Senate leadership with Mr. Reid, the majority leader, next week, to determine more precisely what he anticipates being able to do, and, therefore, what our responsibilities will be to be here to respond to what the Senate does. 
   As I say, we put all the appropriations bills on their plate, if you will. We need to pass those, or, in some form, pass funding for the various agencies. 
   So the answer to your question, Mr. Whip, is that we expect to have some more precise formulation for the fall and hopefully not winter schedule by the, not next week, but the following week. 
   We are aware of the fact, and I used to hear from everybody, now I am hearing from everybody on both sides of the aisle, they understandably want some certainty in the scheduling so they can schedule their work in their districts. 
   I understand that. We are going to try to accommodate that.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman. 
   What an ironic argument my friend from Wisconsin makes. We said we were going to have a PAYGO rule. We have voted consistently for PAYGO. 
   We have paid for that which we have bought with 80 percent cuts and 20 percent increases in revenues. 
   What an ironic argument he makes that somehow now we are not following that because nobody on this floor believes that 19 or 23 million, take your pick, Americans are going to get a tax cut on which President Bush has relied in every budget he has sent to us except the year of that particular budget. But the revenues have always been relied upon in his budget numbers. You didn't change it. You were in charge for 6 years. 
   Ironic, because the only reason we have to do this tonight in this fashion and not ask the wealthiest in America, I don't mean people making $10 million, I don't mean people making $100 million a year, but people making $500 million a year, don't have to pay their fair share. That is what this is about. That is what we have been forced to on this day on this floor and in the other body. Because what is happening is what traditionally happens, the wealthiest and most powerful in America are protected on this floor from paying their fair share. 
   This is not about class warfare. This is about once again saying to the middle class, We are not here to protect you. We are here to protect the wealthiest in America from paying their fair share, which is what PAYGO is all about. 
   My young friend says that the economy is in trouble. The Democrats have not been able to pass one thing in the last 7 years to impact this economy. Not one. It is all on your watch, I say to my friends; all your watch. 
   And you told us in 2001 and 2003 if we passed your economic program and continue to follow that the economy would grow and expand, and now you say it is contracting and in trouble. I agree, it is. Why? Because your economic program is a failed program that took us from $5.6 trillion of surplus, four budget surplus years in a row, and has taken us deeply into debt and deficit. And yes, facing recession in the eye because your economic program is a failed policy. 
   And I am angry about it. Why am I angry about it? Because I have a great granddaughter who is 13 months old. I have a granddaughter who is 5 years of age, just starting kindergarten. And I have another granddaughter who is 21. She has a daughter, and I am worried about continuing to pursue this path of debt piled on debt, piled on debt, piled on debt. 
   The only reason this bill is not paid for is because Republicans, in lockstep almost, in both bodies, have precluded us from paying for this, which everybody wants to do, and that is to relieve the tax burden on those who are confronted with a tax that everybody agrees was not meant for them. It was meant for the wealthy. 
   So who is being protected by this? The wealthy, whom this tax was intended to hit. 
   So when you get up here and tell me nobody intended the tax to hit, that is correct. But the people you are protecting are the people it was specifically intended to impact, to pay their fair share, not to run offshore and avoid taxes, not to have their taxes computed at 15 percent while all of us pay 35 percent. That's what this is about. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of this House, what we do tonight I will not support if we do it. I have a lot of people who live in my district who will be confronted with the alternative minimum tax. I don't want them confronted by the alternative minimum tax. But if we are going to continue to buy, if we are going to do what we will do later tonight, part of the $196.4 billion that you're spending of the legacy of those children that I just mentioned of mine, which you are not going to pay for, and you said this enterprise will cost $60 billion. 
   This administration has been a failed administration economically and a failed administration fiscally. But you continue to pursue these policies, and we are forced today to recognize that  we don't have the votes to pursue the pay-as-you-go principle that we adopted in a bipartisan fashion in 1990, we reaffirmed with many of you voting for it in 2007, and which you abandoned in 2001. And deep deficits and now economic recession facing us is the result. 
   I don't urge my colleagues to vote for this bill as I usually do when we bring something to the floor. This is on suspension not because we believe, in my opinion, many of us, that this is good policy, but because we are faced with two stark alternatives: A President who will veto paying for things that we buy, a President who will veto this bill if it is paid for, responsible fiscal policy; and a Senate that will not vote with us and, frankly, House Republicans who won't vote for this. But we can pass it here, as we did twice. Twice we have passed this fix, and we have paid for it. 
   This is a sad day for America. It is a sad day for my three grandchildren and my great granddaughter, 13 months of age, on whom we will pile an additional $80 billion of debt with this vote tonight if it passes. So $50-some-odd billion and then the interest to follow, she will have to pay that. 
   We ought to pay our bills. We talk about personal responsibility. We ought to have the personal responsibility in this generation to pay for what we buy. I regret this day and this bill.  
   Madam Speaker, I believe that every single Member of this body--on both sides of the aisle--agrees that we must protect middle-income Americans from the Alternative Minimum Tax, the parallel tax system enacted in 1969 to ensure that wealthy Americans pay their fair share. 
   The question that divides us is this: 
   Will we enact a fiscally responsible 1-year patch to the AMT that prevents 23 million Americans from paying more in Federal income taxes under the AMT than they otherwise would pay under our standard tax system? 
   Or, will we take the easy route, the politically expedient route, the fiscally irresponsible route, and enact an unpaid-for, 1-year patch that tacks another $50 billion--yes, $50 billion--onto the deficit and debt, and immorally forces our children and grandchildren to pay our bills? 
   For months, Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill have fought to do the right thing--to enact a fiscally responsible AMT patch that is paid for by, among other things, closing a tax loophole that permits many of the wealthiest people in our Nation from denominating their income as ``capital gains,'' and thereby allowing them to pay the 15-percent capital gains tax rate rather than the higher marginal income tax rate. 
   Time after time after time, House and Senate Republicans rejected our ``pay-fors,'' and demanded that we take the fiscally irresponsible route--and enact an AMT patch that adds $50 billion to the national debt. 
   Madam Speaker, there is no small irony in the fact that the President and his Republican allies in Congress have fought all year long to prevent Democrats from adding $23 billion in funding for domestic priorities while they have no compunction about voting to add $50 billion to the deficit and debt. 
   No small irony. Only gross irresponsibility. 
   Let no one be mistaken: The Republican position on the AMT is part and parcel of an almost theological belief in supply-side economics that is demonstrably false. 
   The Minority Leader, Mr. Boehner, recently stated: ``Tax relief pays for itself.'' 
   And, the President himself has stated: ``You cut taxes, and the tax revenues increase.'' 
   The facts, however, show otherwise: 
   In the last 7 years, the Republican party's economic policies have erased a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion, instigated record budget deficits, and added more than $3.4 trillion to the national debt. 
   As my good friend, Congressman TANNER of Tennessee, recently pointed out: Since President Bush took office, the gross national debt has increased by $1.37 billion per day; $57 million per hour; and $948,907 per minute. 
   This, of course, is the record of a President and Republicans in Congress who pretend that they are ``fiscally responsible.'' 
   And today, they don't bat an eye at adding another $50 billion to the debt. 
   Madam Speaker, our Nation is on a perilous course. 
   Just listen to our non-partisan Comptroller General, David Walker, who stated last year: ``Continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national security.'' 
   Democrats recognize the danger of continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path--and in one of our first acts back in the majority, we reinstated the Pay-As-You-Go budget rules that Republicans formerly supported and which are credited with restoring fiscal discipline in the 1990s. 
   Today, we will protect 23 million middle-income Americans from bearing the brunt of the dreaded AMT--a tax they should not pay, a tax that must be permanently reformed. 
   And we should also be passing a fiscally responsible AMT patch that is revenue-neutral--a position supported by the President in his budgets. 
   However, it is regrettable and, yes, shameful that we will not be doing so because the President and his allies in Congress have insisted on political expedience and fiscal irresponsibility.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   It is Thursday, 3:15 p.m., and we have finished our business. A lot of people have talked to me about that, and I just thought I would note it. 
   On Monday next, the House will not be in session in observance of the Columbus Day holiday. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. next Tuesday. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow. 
   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider H.R. 2895, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act; H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act; and H.R. 3056, Tax Collection Responsibility Act. 
   On Friday, there will be no votes in the House. 
   That is a change in the schedule so everybody will want to note that. That means we expect to have no votes on any Friday for the balance of the month.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman will continue to yield, I thank my friend for asking that question. 
   The expectation for November is that we will be in until November 16. I don't mean straight through, but we will come in usually Monday nights and we will see about the Fridays because we don't know what the Senate is doing. Obviously we need to do the appropriations process and fund government. The CR runs through the 16th of November. 
   I want to tell all Members and the distinguished whip, my friend, that the Speaker and I would both like to conclude the business of the first session of this Congress by November 16. I don't want to represent that I think that is probable at this point in time, but that would be our desire and that is what over the next 5 weeks we are going to try to work towards. 
   We will not be in session either of the last 2 weeks of November, which would mean that Thanksgiving week, which is the week following the 16th, the week of the 19th, and the week following that, we would not be in session. Obviously, it would be my hope we would have concluded our business and would not, therefore, need to come back in December. I don't want to make that representation, however. The gentleman is well familiar with the fact it is too far out and the appropriations process is still not as sure as I would like it to be at this point in time. But the last 2 weeks of November we will not be here.

We passed all 12 of our bills, of course. It is our desire to go to conference on these.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We obviously want to have all 12 of the appropriation bills signed. They all passed with an average of 285 votes in this House. There has not been less than 81 votes for any one of the Senate-passed appropriation bills to date. These bills have enjoyed broad bipartisan support. 
   Very frankly, the MILCON Quality of Life bill is $4 billion over what the President requested. We believe, and obviously the vote reflected, that it is at an appropriate level to ensure that our veterans and our active-duty military have the medical care that was promised to them. So we were pleased that that passed overwhelmingly, notwithstanding the fact that is over what the President has asked for, and he indicated he was going to veto bills if it was over what he asked for. What he really meant, apparently, was if they were over what he wanted. 
   These bills passed very substantially in both Houses. We would hope the President would come to the table. Mr. Obey and Mr. Nussle have had some discussions. I will tell you, those discussions have not indicated any movement at this point in time. They hope that will not be the case. 
   We want to see the MILCON bill signed. Frankly, we want to see the Labor-Health bill signed, which provides for a billion dollars more in basic biomedical health research on cancer, heart, lung, blood, diabetes and other diseases that inflict our citizens, and Pell Grant increases. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's observation regarding the MILCON bill, and I share his view. But I hope he also shares our view. Not all of the bills have passed with as big a margin, but an average of 285, indicating pretty good bipartisan support on all of these bills. And the case has been in the Senate, the ones that they have passed, that the President would discuss with us how we can get this process completed at levels that we can agree on and not be told to do.

   Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the observation and I appreciate the gentleman's assertion that the veto will be sustained in this House. In the other body, as you know, they have more than sufficient votes to override the veto. There are senior leaders in the Senate, very senior leaders in the Senate in the gentleman's party who believe that the President has based his veto on incorrect information and incorrect premises. Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley, both of whom are conservative Republicans, leaders in your party, who believe this bill does, in fact, accomplish what the President said that he wanted to do, at your convention in 2004, that he wanted to add millions of children. 
   We are hopeful that we can convince some of your ranks not to vote as Republicans or Democrats but to vote in a way that does reflect, I think, what all of our priorities are on the health care of our children. So we understand what your representation is and your confidence level is, but in this case, we hope you are in error.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   With respect to your latter question, sustaining our troops in the field, under the continuing resolution, we think that the authority to do that exists, and we've been advised that. 
   With respect to if we pass the Defense appropriations bill, it's our advice as we understand it from the Pentagon that they will have sufficient funds through the beginning of next year to fund their needs. Mr. Obey, I'm sure, will be discussing with us and others on the status of the supplemental. 
   I note that he's left now, but the chairman of the Appropriations Committee was on the floor. He has indicated he thinks that they will have sufficient funds if the Defense appropriations bill passes and is signed by the President. That passed, as you know, in an overwhelming vote here as well. We hope to see that bill get to the President. I don't know exactly what's going to happen to it in the Senate, we'll have to see that, but I hope that will pass. 
   With respect to the first question, there's no intention of bringing a surcharge to this floor. What Mr. Obey was saying is that this war was projected to cost $60 billion by the White House when it started. We're going to be at $1 trillion before too long. That bill is going to be paid by somebody. We talked about our children and grandchildren will be paying this bill. And what Mr. Obey's point was is that the people who are being asked to sacrifice are those going into Iraq, those families who send people to Iraq, and that the rest of us really aren't paying much of a price, but our grandchildren and children will pay that price. I think that was his point. 
   But in answer to the gentleman's question, we have no intention of bringing such a bill to the floor.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the House of what I perceive to be the schedule for the coming balance of the week. 
   It is our intention to go until 1 o'clock tonight on debate only. We will roll votes. There will be no further votes. I've talked to the leadership on the other side. There will be no votes for the balance of the evening. 
   It is my expectation, barring some unforeseen action in conferences, that we will conclude this bill tomorrow, hopefully, with the consideration of all Members, relatively early, in the late afternoon. And that would conclude the week's business if we don't have any conference reports. 
   Now, I want to make it clear, should the unforeseen happen in the conference, there are a couple of conferences pending, if they move, that would change. I don't expect that to be the case, but I want everybody to understand that we do have some conferences that may go forward. I doubt that they would be in shape to come here, but if they did, that would change. 
   But presently, Mr. Speaker, I believe the schedule would be we go until 1 o'clock, debate amendments, offer amendments. Those amendments that called for votes would be rolled until tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. We would vote on those. And then we would complete the bill and be complete for the week and take leave for the July work period at that point in time.

The minority whip came to me indicating that there were things he thought the Members ought to have knowledge of that he was of the opinion could not be divulged in public debate. There is a provision under our rules to accomplish that objective. After discussion with him and limitation on the time so that we could, in fact, get to a vote on what we believe is very important legislation, we have agreed to this arrangement. Again, it's limited, but we did not want to be nor are we in the position of saying to the minority whip if he has such information that we want to preclude that from being offered, because we want no indication that any information is being withheld. That is appropriate, obviously. There are going to be restrictions, obviously, even in the context of the session.

   Mr. HOYER. I think the answer is that, within the framework of the unanimous consent, I've requested there is not such a limitation. I think the gentleman is correct on that. However, as I said, my expectation and my discussions with the whip ares that the purpose of the session is to offer information that might not otherwise be appropriate to disclose in public session. 
   My expectation is there is going to be a fulsome debate, as there has been, tomorrow on the legislation itself. So my expectation, given the shortness of the time that we are talking about, 30 minutes per side, we will have the Intelligence Committee here and the Judiciary Committee here to comment, obviously it is going to be a little difficult, because if there is information brought up that there may be comment on that information, and very frankly, the parameters of the debate tomorrow may, although not disclosing that information, may obviously be perceived by many of us as relating to whatever is discussed. It is very difficult to know specifically because I do not know the specific information that that request was made for.

   Mr. HOYER. I think that's a very good question. Let me tell you that we have asked. Mr. Blunt and I have discussed that. And we have asked the appropriate officials, bipartisan officials, of this House, under the rules, to give us the answer to that question and to have on paper the specific advice to every Member of the House so that we cannot have Members go out of here, put themselves at risk of violation of the rules, have clear advice and counsel as to what that is. 
   Now, it is my belief, this is not an opinion given to me, but it is my belief that every Member of this House that receives information from sources unrelated to this hour are certainly free, as they are right now, to discuss that information. And the fact that it is discussed in the session would not adversely affect that right. I would be shocked and not in agreement with this unanimous consent if the case were otherwise.

   Mr. HOYER. If I could continue, there are some in this body who have, because of their membership on particular committees, been able to see information in secret which other Members of this body have not seen. 
   As the distinguished gentleman from California observed, there are still limitations notwithstanding this secret session. 
   We have a room that allows people to receive information in secret. They are not necessarily transacting business; although, the Intelligence Committee obviously on both Houses does, in fact, conduct its business in secret in that they vote in secret on some legislation. 
   All this contemplates is the offering and receiving of information that the minority has represented they believe they want to give to the Members that they ought not to give in open session. The matter that we are considering obviously is a very important, critical matter. There are substantial, as you know, differences. You and I agree on most of those. We perhaps disagree with others. It was the Speaker's and my view after discussing with Mr. Conyers and Mr. Reyes that to deny that would give Members the impression that somehow we did not believe they ought to have that information. 
   Now, I don't know what the information is, as I have said. But having said that, we certainly do not contemplate any business being done. Now, the fact that a Member may say something that is not secret, I would presume things are going to be said in there that are not secret. The gentleman from Ohio raised some excellent points. I share the concern of the gentleman from Texas and the concerns. 
   But I also understand this is a serious matter. We believe in public we will debate tomorrow a serious proposal as to how to serve our intelligence interests and our constitutional responsibilities. So I am hopeful that we will not object to this, although I think the concerns raised are absolutely legitimate, very serious, worthwhile concerns, and as the gentleman from Texas observes, which is why this is done so very infrequently. I have only been a participant in the 1983 session. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding. But that is my take on what is going to transpire.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my good friend for yielding. What I think the whip is saying, the Whip came to me earlier today, said he wanted to discuss information which the Intelligence Committee has, which the broad reach of the Members do not have, but he did not want to, he did not feel he could discuss that in open session. 
   The rules provide for the whip to make a motion to do that. That will then be a relatively lengthy process. The whip and I discussed this on his representation that he had information that he felt, in good conscience, he could not divulge, not because it's not in the bosom of the Intelligence Committees or, frankly, maybe the Judiciary Committee, which has been cleared, but because he felt it was information that was not releasable. 
   What we have done is reached an agreement that makes it very clear that there are very short parameters for this discussion and debate. 
   I want to say that I, generally, have not been here as long as Mr. Obey, but my experience on these kinds of sessions, whether they are briefings, has been the same as his. I have rarely learned something that I couldn't read in U.S. News & World Report or Time the day before or the day after. 
   But having said that, we have tried to reach an agreement with the minority that would facilitate the receiving of information which many Members, not the Intelligence members or the Judiciary members, but many Members have not had available to them and could not be discussed in open session. 
   I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   For my part, I believe I will be fully engaged on this piece of legislation, on its merits, what it does to facilitate the interception of communications which may prove dangerous to our country and at the same time protect our Constitution. 
   I don't think I am going to be constrained in any way. 
   Now, what I will be constrained on saying is that, obviously, I have had the opportunity and taken the opportunity to go to the committee to review information in the bosom of the committee and to make conclusions on that. I will not discuss that specific information, but there is, most of the information that I have, having done that, is from the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, other news magazines, from articles that I have read. I frankly think that no Member is going to have to be confused about debating the merits or the demerits of the issue that will be before us tomorrow based upon this secret session. 
   Now, the gentleman, as I say, has made a request that he has information that he wants to discuss which he believes ought not to be discussed in public. I think everybody, not in public in the sense of depriving the American people from the information, but information that we need to hold close so that it is not used by those who would cause us harm, without speculating as to what that information may be. I frankly think that every Member will be able to make that judgment. 
   But, more than that, we have discussed this, and we hope to have, and I forget who it was who was mentioned, very appropriately, we hope being prepared now is directive from a nonpartisan source of security people. This is, after all, a rule of the House that is being pursued. It could be pursued by motion, but it's being pursued by unanimous consent. Doing so, we believe, sets the parameters more appropriately.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't want to go further than I am absolutely confident on the response to this. However, let me say that I believe that all the information that Members need to debate this bill tomorrow is currently in their possession and will be elicited in public debate. 
   The minority whip does not believe that. He believes there is additional information. 
   I think Members, I would not want to leave the impression with any of our Members that somebody had information that they believed was very important to the security of our country that they were precluded from giving to Members. That is why we pursued this objective. 
   As I say, the rules provide for that. But in terms of the debate, my suggestion is, I think, particularly the gentlewoman who serves so ably on the Judiciary Committee has all the information, and she has some information she knows she can't speak of because she has received briefings as a member of the Judiciary Committee.     
   But I believe there will be no constraints. 
   However, the constraint I think is you would not say, out of a secret session, and none of us should say out of a secret session, that X, Y and Z was said in a secret session, or that I got this information from a secret session. And if you did not have that information but for being in that session, my advice would be not to tell that information. But my view has been this has been a very wide, public debate; and I don't have any problems debating this vigorously tomorrow, as I intend to do because I think the bill is a good bill and protects both our intelligence ability and our Constitution. So I will not feel constrained at all. But I will not say I will not tell information that I received in this secret session because I don't think I am going to need to at all.

   Mr. HOYER. There are a lot of hypotheticals, a, I believe the gentleman is correct, there is a high bar. I will tell you that as everybody in this House knows, Mr. Blunt and I are friends. I have great respect for Mr. Blunt. Mr. Blunt came to me, without denigrating any other Member, he is a leader of his party and I accord him the respect of making the judgment that in fact he is going to meet that high bar. 
   I have not interrogated him any more than I would want him to interrogate me on that issue. I take him at his word as a Member. Now, the consequence of not meeting that high bar is only that Members will say that a request was made that was not justified. I think that is the consequence. There is certainly no consequence in the rules. And, first of all, we would, I suppose, as a body have to judge, a, what the bar was and whether you met it. 
   In any event, I think the gentleman understands the answer to my question. I respect him as the leader of his party. He has made this request, and we are trying to honor it, I might say, in a way that most fashions it so that it will be as focused and as helpful as can be.

   Mr. HOYER. The reason I stand is because again I want to explain. The information, I don't know the information, but the information that Mr. Blunt has clearly is within the bosom of the Intelligence Committee, and I don't know, but I presume the Judiciary Committee has had access to it under the President's order. What has not been done is that information has not been shared with the Members. It's not a question of the sharing with the Intelligence Committee. I understand the gentleman's concern. What Mr. Blunt is simply saying is he wants to share with the Members. He cannot share it in open session. I don't know what the information is, but, again, as I expressed to my friend, and I would hope that we would understand that at some point in time, we need to accord to one another the credibility. Particularly I would hope that he would accord to me, as the leader, credibility, and as I accord to him credibility on his assertion that this is something he wants to share with the Members, some of whom would not have had access. They may have had access to it, but they haven't heard it. That is all I think he's saying. And in that context, we have come to this agreement which we think, as I say, focuses and serves the concerns that you have legitimately raised and focuses our efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I'm always interested to listen to some of the representations made on this floor. I have been here some time, as all of you know. 
   Ronald Reagan said ``trust but verify.'' For 27 years, all but 8 of those with Republican Presidents, I have heard representations from the floor by Republicans about what their deficits were going to do. 
   For every one of those 27 years that Republicans were President of the United States, every one without exception, we ran huge deficits. And this year will be no different. The Republicans have had monopoly on policy-making in this town for essentially 7 years. This past year, we had some authority because the American people wanted change. But clearly, the President of the United States would not agree with us, and we had to do what the President would agree to so that, essentially, without restraint, the Republicans have had, for the last 7 years, the authority to do whatever they wanted to do. 
   The first 8 years I was here, Ronald Reagan was President. He ran $1 trillion in deficits. Then George Bush became President, a little over $1 trillion. This President, a little over $1.6  trillion. President Clinton was President for 8 years, only 8 years that we have had the Presidency, and America ran a net surplus. 
   So when you hear the protestations of the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee and the gentleman who just spoke from Texas, listen to them, but verify. Look at the record of Republican fiscal irresponsibility undiminished in the 27 years I have been here. 
   Mr. Ryan, for whom I have a great deal of respect, and I have very substantial differences on how you get from here to there, is he correct that we need to look at our entitlement system? He is absolutely correct. As a matter of fact, as he knows, I went to the Senate and testified on behalf of a resolution that does that. There is a resolution here that does that, as well. We have to do that. There is no alternative. 
   Have they done that over the last 7 years of this Presidency? They did not. Did we do it in 1983 with Ronald Reagan as President, Tip O'Neill as Speaker of the House? We did. And we made Social Security secure for the next 60 years. But when we were running up those deficits that Ronald Reagan said we were not going to run up, the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid crisis that confronts us was decades away. 
   Today, the gentleman from Wisconsin is correct. It is years away. However, the solution is not to cut medical services for senior citizens and to cut education for our college students. The solution is not to put the car in reverse. The solution, as Ross Perot said, is to lift up the hood and fix it. And that is what the Spratt budget is doing. The Spratt budget is saying to all the Members of this House and to this Congress, we must act responsibly. Responsibly is not only acting fiscally responsibly, but also investing responsibly in the future of our country. 
   I would urge my colleagues to reject this tired, tired, tired shibboleth about ``the biggest tax increase in history.'' Frankly, the biggest per capita real tax increase in my tenure was under Bob Dole and Ronald Reagan in 1982. And then, of course, George Bush was defeated, presumably because he tried to help balance the budget. And in fact, George Bush made a significant contribution because it was the George Bush agreement on pay-as-you-go, the 1997 Newt Gingrich-Bill Clinton agreement on pay-as-you-go that got us those 4 years of surplus of which I have spoken.

   The tears, the crocodile tears that flow from the eyes of the ranking member of the Budget Committee about this awful thing that we called ``congressional investments.''

   Mr. HOYER. You have gone much longer than your caucus wanted to go. I understand that. But the conference wanted to go for 6 months. 
   I thought it was such an interesting proposal because it meant ``we will go just long enough until we really do appropriations and when it really means something.'' Too often, ``hypocrisy, thy name is ourselves.'' I say it on both sides of the aisle. 
   Now, I'm for, as everybody knows, congressional initiatives. But I am for paying for them. When we quadrupled them, we borrowed for them from the Chinese, from the Germans, and from the Saudis. As a matter of fact, this President, as my friend knows, has borrowed more money from foreign governments than all of the other Presidents combined. Trust but verify. 
   Every year that I have been here, ranking members have risen, one of whom is now the chairman of the OMB, and told me what a bright future it would be if their budgets were adopted. Now, the problem is that sometimes they can't get agreement between Senate Republicans and House Republicans on what that beautiful budget ought to be. We passed a budget last year. We lived within that budget last year. We need to do so this year. And we are trying to pay for things. We had a stimulus we didn't pay for. Some of us were concerned about that, but you can't stimulate and depress at the same time. 
   So my colleagues in the House, Republicans and Democrats, vote for our children and future generations today. Vote for the John Spratt Democratic budget. Reject this budget that pretends it's going to bring you balance but has never done so once, not once in the 27 years that I have been here. Vote for the Spratt budget. It is good for our country. It is good for our people. It is good for our future.  
   Let me first thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, John Spratt of South Carolina, for all of his hard work, patience and intelligence in producing this Democratic budget resolution--which is nothing less than a blueprint of our values and priorities. 
   Let me also thank my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus and Progressive Caucus for offering their important budget alternatives--alternatives that reflect our shared commitment to the American people and a stronger America. 
   Now, before I discuss what I believe to be the vastly superior and realistic Democratic budget, let me briefly address the Republican budget substitute that we are now debating. 
   I both like and respect the gentleman from Wisconsin, the ranking member on the Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan. He is a thoughtful, diligent Member. 
   And, I believe that were it up to him, he might actually try to implement the provisions in the Republican budget substitute. 
   But the problem, of course, is that he would be fighting a lonely, losing, untenable battle. 
   This we know: many, many Republicans would not support the deep, draconian cuts to domestic programs called for in their own budget. 
   The fact is, this Republican budget only reaches balance in 2012 by slashing funding for mandatory programs by $412 billion. 
   This Republican budget would cut Medicare and safety-net programs; cut Medicaid, thereby jeopardizing health care for more than 50 million children, parents, seniors and disabled Americans; cut--and possibly eliminate--the recently enacted increase in Pell Grants; and cut funding for military retirement and health care. 
   Furthermore, the Republican budget implies very deep cuts in discretionary programs, devastating public health, education, safety net and infrastructure programs. 
   This Republican budget fails to reflect the values and priorities of the American people. 
   In contrast, the Democratic budget continues to move our Nation in a new direction and to clean up the fiscal train wreck caused by failed Republican economic policies over the last 7 years. 
   Remember, in just 86 months, Republicans have turned projected budget surpluses into  record deficits--including a projected $386 billion this year and another $340 billion next year--and added more than $3 trillion to the national debt, which today stands at $9 trillion. 
   Our Democratic budget restores fiscal responsibility, adhering to pay-as-you-go budget rules and bringing the Federal budget back to balance by 2012. 
   It rejects the drastic funding cuts in the Republican substitute and the President's budget, which includes cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, State and local law enforcement programs, and environmental protection. 
   It strengthens our economy, providing crucial funding for our innovation agenda, efficient and renewable energy programs, education, and infrastructure. 
   It provides tax relief for hard-working Americans, including a reconciliation instruction that provides offsets for a new one-year patch of the alternative minimum tax. 
   And, our Democratic budget makes America safer, providing for a robust defense, boosting homeland security funding, and rejecting the President's cuts to first responder programs. 
   This is a budget that we can be proud of. And, it stands in stark contrast to the irresponsible fiscal policies of the current administration and former Republican majorities in Congress. 
   I urge all of my colleagues: 
   Vote for fiscal responsibility, and a bright future for our children. 
   Vote for the budget that reflects our values--and meets the needs of the American people. 
   Vote for this Democratic budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman Peterson for working tirelessly over the past year and a half to craft this farm bill--legislation that may not be perfect, but which takes our Nation in a new direction in agriculture policy. 
   This farm bill makes important reforms in the commodity title, while continuing to provide a safety net for our small- and mid-sized farmers--farmers like those I represent in southern Maryland. 
   The bill tightens payment limits, eliminates loopholes that have been exploited to get around those limits, and makes payments transparent by requiring direct attribution to a single individual. 
   I am proud that this bill takes important steps to ensure that our children and those in need will have the resources they need to live healthy lives. 
   Its nutrition title includes more than $10 billion to better stock food banks and pantries, provide healthy snacks to schoolchildren, and reform the food stamp program by tying it to inflation. 
   It is important to note that this bill also makes record investments in conservation, renewable energy, and rural development, which will enable our producers to better protect our environment and bolster economic development in our rural communities. 
   I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes $438 million in direct assistance over the next 10 years to help our farmers in their ongoing efforts to be good stewards of the Chesapeake Bay. 
   While we have been able to make some strides in our efforts to restore this magnificent estuary, it is clear that there is much work to be done. 
   Recently, the University of Maryland Center for Environment Science issued a report card which rated the bay's health a C-minus. 
   Ironically, this slight improvement over the previous year was largely due to drought conditions that limited nutrient and sediment runoff into the bay. 
   The funds included in this farm bill will help farmers throughout the watershed control erosion and reduce sediment and nutrient levels. Their efforts will help enhance, restore, and conserve this ecologically significant habitat. 
   The legislation also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to give special consideration to producers in specific, targeted river watersheds, including those of the Potomac and the Patuxent. 
   Our concerted effort to restore these significant tributaries will go a long way to bolstering the health of the great body of water into which they all empty--the Chesapeake Bay. 
   Finally, I want to express my support for the Enhanced Use Lease Authority Pilot Program. This program seeks to create a national model at the National Agricultural Library and our Nation's flagship agricultural research facility--the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. This program will enable them to partner on-site with public and private facilities to enhance the mission of USDA-ARS and address much needed facilities upgrades in a timely and efficient fashion. 
   Again, I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson on this bill--a farm bill that will be noted for putting America's agricultural policy on the right track and laying the foundation for more far reaching reforms in the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Chair, I thank my friend, one of the Deans of this House, who has for so very long ensured that this country has a democracy of which our people can be proud and which is accessible to all of our people, as our Constitution promises. I am so pleased to join him, and I thank the ranking member as well for his leadership on so many issues. 
   Madam Chair, I intend to support this important bill before us, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which addresses the relationship between Members of Congress and those who seek to influence legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation as well. 
   This bill, like the one we just considered, is not perfect. Few bills are. However, these measures call for a greater transparency, and provide specific guidance to Members and lobbyists on the propriety of certain actions. 
   Without question, the recent scandals involving former lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the guilty pleas of former Representatives Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham and Bob Ney have raised serious questions in the public's mind about the integrity of our process and the Members who serve here. That is unfortunate, but nevertheless true. 
   The legislation introduced by Chairman Conyers is an important step in addressing such concerns and thereby will help ensure public confidence in our legislative process and in this institution, the people's House. 
   Among other things, this legislation will outlaw the so-called K Street Project in which Members influenced employment decisions of private entities for partisan gain. In fact, violators of this proposition will be fined or imprisoned for up to 15 years, an appropriate penalty.  
   This legislation expands and strengthens lobbying disclosure requirements, mandating quarterly disclosure of lobbying reports and increasing penalties for violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. 
   This legislation requires Members to disclose job negotiations for post-congressional employment. The public wants to know that their representatives are acting on their behalf, not on the behalf of the special interest. 
   And this legislation retains the 1-year ban on lobbying imposed on Members and senior staff. But in addition to that, it importantly requires Members and such staff to recuse themselves from working on legislation in which a prospective employer has a vested interest, a substantial step forward. 
   This bill alone, of course, cannot guarantee honest, ethical conduct any more than the law against burglary will necessarily deter every burglar.     
   However, when coupled with the most sweeping ethics changes since Watergate, which the Democratic majority enacted on the very first day of this Congress, the legislation will help reassure the public that we appreciate the legitimate concerns raised by the Abramoff case and others and are committed to taking action to address them. 
   I understand that some believe that this bill and the one we just considered do not go far enough. I know that some sincerely believe that our current system in which lobbyists or any other American legally contribute to a political campaign is inevitably questionable. The public financing obviously would be the alternative. The public does not support that. We know that. 
   Let me say, however, without equivocation, I strongly disagree with the view that because there are private contributions that our system is broken. 
   The implication of this position is not only inaccurate but also an unwarranted smear on the integrity of the overwhelming majority of the Members of both sides of the aisle who diligently abide by ethical rules and our campaign finance laws and who otherwise conduct themselves with high integrity. 
   Do not misunderstand me. Our system can and should and must be continually improved to ensure public confidence in the integrity of our legislative process. However, as long as there is private financing of political campaigns, and as long as men and women exercise their right to petition their government, the relationship between private giving and public action will be recurring issues that require close examination by us and by the public. 
   That is precisely what this bill before us today represents: important reform that ensures greater transparency and specifically addresses some of the most egregious recent transgressions. 
   Finally, as important as this legislation and the ethics changes made in January are, they alone will not ensure the integrity of our process and this institution. Rather, the Members of this House will ensure the integrity of this House when we conduct ourselves openly and honestly and hold accountable those who fail to abide by the rules and the highest ethical standards. 
   Thus, we have an obligation to ensure that the Ethics Committee does the job that it was constituted to perform. The implementation of rules, while critical, must be followed by effective, real enforcement and accountability. 
   I urge my colleagues, Madam Chairman, to vote for this legislation and let us provide greater transparency of our legislative process and ensure public confidence in this institution in which all of us are so proud to serve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding. 
   No matter how the Members vote on the two amendments before the House on this measure, I know that every one of us is absolutely committed to our men and women in harm's way and prays for their safe return home. 
   I also know that the Members on our side of the aisle, regardless of how we vote on these amendments, are united in our collective judgment that the President's policy is failing; and that after 4 years of repeated misjudgments in Iraq by this administration, it is long past time to insist that the administration and the Iraqi Government be held accountable for making progress; and, that we must change direction in Iraq. 
   In fact, the American public strongly support the Democratic position on the war. Just today, the latest New York Times/CBS poll found that 76 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, say that the troop surge has either had no impact or made the situation worse. Meanwhile, 63 percent said the United States should set a date for withdrawing troops sometime in 2008. That, of course, is what the bill that we passed and sent to the President did. He vetoed it. That position was adopted by the majority of this House and the majority of the Senate in the last supplemental bill. 
   And 69 percent say Congress should appropriate money for the war on the condition that we set benchmarks for progress. I am pleased, of course, that the Warner language is in there, but it is not enough. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is deeply disappointing that the President continues to defy the will of the American people. But today, with this amendment which includes 18 strong new benchmarks on political, security, and economic progress, and other reporting requirements, I believe this Congress has moved the ball forward and begun to hold the administration accountable. 
   Is it as far as we are going to go? It is not. Should we go further? We must. Make no mistake, this amendment does not provide everything that we had hoped for, but I do not believe that it provides a blank check or that this Congress is rubber-stamping the President's request. The President did not want the Warner amendment attached. He doesn't want any constraints. 
   In addition to benchmarks, this requires the President to report on progress in July and September, and ties all economic support for Iraq to progress on the benchmarks, although a waiver is required. Why? Because the President said he would veto the bill if it was not. 
   The fact is, this is simply the best bill we could put together and that would be signed. It is a political reality. It is not what we want to pass. 
   It imposes truly for the first time ever a level of accountability that did not exist, however, previously. For the first time ever, we are also calling for the Iraqi Security Forces to step up and do the job assigned to them so our soldiers can step down by providing funding for an outside review of the Iraq Security Forces' current capacity and their reliance on our Armed Forces. 
   We have moved the ball forward. Far enough? No. Do we need to move further? Yes. But we have advanced toward a new direction and a new policy  in Iraq. And in the months ahead, we will continue to fight for a new direction in Iraq in the fiscal year 2008 defense appropriations bill and other measures to be considered. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me say that I am very pleased that the second amendment being considered will provide for the first time in a decade a long overdue increase in the Federal minimum wage, as well as additional funding for defense and veterans health care, and homeland security, drought relief, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and gulf coast recovery. The Katrina provision is a critical one. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will vote for both of these amendments, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his question. As he and I have discussed and as he knows, I am disappointed that we are not in conference on the FISA bill. The Senate has not yet passed its version of the FISA bill. As you know, we passed the FISA bill in December. I think it was early December, as a matter of fact. And we understand that the legislation we passed last August has an expiration date of February 1 and that, therefore, we will either be acting under the old law, an extended law, or a revision that we might pass. 
   The leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, has talked about perhaps a 30-day extension. I have not talked to him about that personally, but I know that they are considering that. I also know that it is the Senate's intention to address this issue upon their return next week. As you know, they will be in most of the week next week, I think, so we will have to see probably the end of next week where the other body is so that we might better judge where we need to be.

   Mr. HOYER. First of all, I share the gentleman's view, and my expectation is that the authorization bill we passed yesterday will be passed by the Senate as was passed here. Because, as you  know, the only thing we did was modify, consistent with an agreement with the administration and the Senate, the provision that the administration vetoed the bill on. So my expectation is it will pass whole. 
   Now, as the gentleman observes, there is an interest I think perhaps on both sides of the aisle in considering the provision that was modified and essentially a part of it taken out of the bill. There is interest in considering that bill. That has been discussed with Mr. Skelton, and Mr. Skelton and the committee are looking at that. 
   I believe, and I don't have confirmation of that, that there were Members who have talked to me who are in fact introducing a bill to speak to that particular point. I say ``I believe'' because, again, I don't have confirmation that that bill has been introduced, but I know that there were Members very focused on that, very concerned. As you know, this provision dealt with the ability of some of our former soldiers, in particular marines, injured by, tortured by the Saddam Hussein regime and being compensated for that to which they had been subjected. I know there is a lot of concern about making sure that litigants who have gotten judgments have an opportunity to execute on those judgments. The President was concerned about that. 
   So I think the short answer to your question is it either has been introduced, or going to be introduced maybe next week. Mr. Skelton has indicated that he will look at that.

There was bipartisan agreement that if we were going to pass that bill with all those important provisions in it, that it was necessary to consider the matter that the President was opposed to separately and apart, and take it out, which was done.     
   But certainly all of the Members on my side did not believe that the President's veto was appropriate. So I don't want to mislead anybody that there was a bipartisan agreement that his veto was appropriate in that sense and that there was a consensus on that. There was disagreement on that.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   On Monday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning business and noon for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. In addition to several bills under suspension of the rules, and a list of these bills, of course, will be announced by the end of the week, we expect to begin consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill. 
   Let me reiterate that because that will require a vote on the rule, there will be a substantive, and perhaps more substantive, votes on Monday. So Members cannot be assured that there will not be controversies on the floor on Monday night. Usually we do only suspension bills. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour business and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. In addition to completing consideration of the Transportation-HUD bill, we have one additional fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill, the Commerce-Justice-Science, as well as the farm program reauthorization.

   This motion will be defeated because it kills the bill. If the gentleman from Nevada were serious about this motion, he would have asked that it be forthwith. That would have passed his amendment. This is not a serious amendment, I tell my friend. This is, unfortunately, however, why the American public is so upset with the Congress of the United States: because what they see, they say that Congress is not getting its work done, and they are right. And they are right because obstructionism is occurring on this floor and on the floor across the hall. And if it were in the name of serious legislating, perhaps they would understand. But this is not serious legislating, A, because the money can be spent for that now; and, B, because it kills a bill that is for the education and the health care of our people.

   As you also know, 2 days ago, we had a vote on ensuring the extension of the existing statute, not because we believed that was necessary but for an abundance of caution, and as the gentleman knows, every one of your Members voted against that extension on the demand that we do what you wanted us to do now. But in the protection that was available to you to extend for 21 days the protections you say are now going to be absent, every one of you voted ``no.'' I'm sorry that that happened.

   Mr. HOYER. I disagree with Mr. McConnell, Admiral McConnell, whose op-ed I read this morning. And as the gentleman knows, I would reiterate, had we extended by 21 days the Protect America Act, which all of your Members voted against, had we done that, the immunity which was provided in that would have continued. As the gentleman also knows, that the only issue here is whether or not the administration has to go to the trouble to go to the FISA Court, which it has done so over 16,000 times, not this administration but the previous administration, and only had its request rejected five times; 99.9 percent of the time the FISA Court has approved. And once it approves, the telecoms, the telecommunication companies, acting in response to that court order are not liable for their actions. Therefore, we regret that we have not extended that, but, as I said, I am meeting today, we will be meeting through the next days, to try to come to an agreement. 
   Because the Senate delayed its action for 3 months after we passed our bill, it presented us with a bill that you wanted us to take as a fait accompli, without going to conference, without having the opportunity to discuss it. We think that was unreasonable and we didn't agree. So we're going to pursue this process and we are all in agreement that we ought to get this done.

   Mr. HOYER. Ninety percent of our party voted for that. All we needed was just a few from your side, and you all, each and every one without exception, voted against extending the present law which you now say if it lapses will put the country at risk. We do not agree with that, but that is your contention, not our contention. And it is somewhat, I think, contradictory for you on the one hand to say we're putting our country at risk and on the other hand voting to a person to not extend the law which you say protects our country.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is an important issue which is therefore why I think it's worthy of making sure that everybody understands. The gentleman from California makes the point that he believes that we are at risk. I again reiterate, all of your Members voted against the extension. The gentleman from Georgia says we had a lot of time. Very frankly Senator Reid has given the opinion, it is  my opinion, respected as a parliamentarian apparently or knowledge of parliamentary procedure, that the reason it was delayed in coming to this body was because, as the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, you made the comment, which I think is absolutely accurate, all of you on your side of the aisle thought that we would take whatever the Senate gave us because we would be fearful; we would be fearful of not pursuing substantive legislative process to discuss this very important issue. I agree with you. Every one of your Members thought, in your words, we would blink. The question is not blinking. The question is substantively getting to a result that furthers the protection of our country and the protection of our Constitution. That is our perception. That is our belief. And I will tell my friend from California that it's not my opinion alone but it's the opinion of a number of people, including the former adviser to this administration on terrorism as well as the previous administration on terrorism, Richard Clarke, that the opinion I have expressed is an accurate opinion. 
   The gentleman also knows in terms, and I want to say, also, I don't think it's the appropriate place nor do I intend to get into my perception of Admiral McConnell's position. That's not the purpose of this debate. I have some views, but I'm not going to get into those. What I am going to get into and simply respond to these observations is that we believe the country is protected. We believe that in terms of all of those al Qaeda objects that you make reference to, I hope and presume, I do not know, I have no secret information that I'm disclosing, but I would be shocked and dismayed and deeply disappointed if at this point in time the administration did not have in place orders that covered at least from now until August of this year, which is when we last authorized this bill, the Protect America Act, and under which the administration could have gotten authority which would have lasted for a full year. So those orders are still in place, they will not lapse, and it will be no impediment to further interception of those communications.

   Mr. PRICE or Georgia. I appreciate that, because I was about to make that point. The objection to the extension comes from both the left and the right. It's not that we thought you would blink. We could not believe that the majority would not live up to its primary responsibility, which we perceive as making certain that this Nation is protected. That's what we believed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday night I said this was going to be an unhappy week for all of us. I did not expect what happened last night, however; and I regret what happened last night. Mr. McNulty is going to speak as well. 
   The vote was called. During the course of that vote, eight Members changed their votes after the vote was called 214-214, but the board, as everybody knows, at that point in time had reflected one of the Members who had changed their vote. There were at all times 428 Members voting. The vote went from 214-214, and then 215-213, and then 212-216. Obviously, the 214-214 would have had the motion fail. The 215-213 would have had it to prevail. And then the 212-216 would have had the motion fail. The minority, having been in that place, was understandably angry. I won't use the word ``upset'', understandably angry. If that happened to us, we would have been angry; I would have been angry. 
   At that point in time, I clearly believe that what had happened gave the impression that clearly, correctly would have been my impression that this was unfair; and, as a result, as the Members will recall, I asked to vacate the vote. That was objected to. So I then moved to reconsider the vote by which the motion to recommit offered by Mr. Lewis had failed. 
   I thought it appropriate that that vote be retaken because of the confusion that occurred during the course of that vote and having three separate tallies indicated. I thought that was appropriate. In fact, that motion prevailed. We did reconsider that vote, and the vote passed, at that point in time, by voice vote, and then final passage of the bill. And the bill passed, the Agriculture appropriation bill. 
   But, clearly, people were angry. Words were said on this floor, unfortunately, that were not, I think, designed, as I said on Tuesday night, to maintain civility. But I don't blame the minority for being angry at what clearly appeared to them, which would have been the impression that I would have had, that they were being treated in a way that they thought was not fair. 
   It does no good to this discussion to repeat what has happened over the last 12 years, where we felt aggrieved. But when you feel aggrieved, it is justifiable aggrievement. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, in the interest of having this matter reviewed by the Ethics Committee to ensure that nothing was done that should not have been done, this motion simply refers this matter to the Ethics Committee. 
   This is no aspersion, I want to say, on the presiding officer. When he called the vote, that was the vote on the board, but it changed almost instantaneously at that time and clearly would have been something that correctly was interpreted as what's going on here. 
   We need to know what's going on here. My view is, because eight people change their votes, during the course of that, three Republicans changed their vote, five Democrats changed their vote. There have been a lot of questions about changing votes in the past, so we think it is appropriate that this matter be reviewed. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 minute to my friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. McNulty), someone who has served in this body long and honorably and whose integrity, I think, is unquestioned by Members who have served with him on the Ways and Means Committee and in this House.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (IMPROVING FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE TO DEFEND THE NATION AND THE CONSTITUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As has been stated on this floor, this is an extraordinary and important development and even more important issue. 
   I want to comment first on the involvement of Mr. Reyes, Mr. Conyers, myself, the Speaker, and others. I have met on at least three occasions with my friend, Mr. Blunt. Every time we made a draft, I took it to him and discussed it with him. This was not something that I thought ought to be done on a partisan basis. 
   I talked to the Director of National Intelligence on at least five different occasions individually and then in a conference call with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Levin, Mr. Reyes, Mr. Reid, the Speaker and myself. We talked over a number of hours. The conversation did not last hours. From time to time, we hung up and the DNI went to contact people. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have spent a substantial amount of time trying to reach what our Founding Fathers wanted us to reach, and that was a balance of power, a balance of making sure that our country was secure and making sure that our individuals were secure. That's what our Founding Fathers were all about. They didn't want King George knocking on the door and coming in just because he wanted to come in. They thought that King George needed to be restrained. So  they set up a separation of powers, they set up a judiciary and they set up a Constitution, and 10 amendments thereafter. 
   Mr. Speaker, our highest duty, as Members of this body, is to defend our Nation, protect our people and uphold the Constitution of the United States, as we've talked about. And one has to be thoughtful in doing that because, at times, it would appear that those three duties may be in conflict with one another. It is our job to harmonize those to accomplish all three objectives. That is, we have a duty to keep this Nation safe from those who seek to harm us. 
   And let there be no doubt, there are terrorists who seek to harm us. They have harmed us. They are people that we need to stop. They are people that we need to identify. They are people whom we need to act against. And, yes, a duty to ensure that our government abides by the principles upon which it was founded. 
   In 1978, as has been said, this Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in an effort to balance these critical interests. It is with these principles in mind that we bring this bill to the floor to immediately fill the intelligence gap described to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence. 
   Among other things, this legislation clarifies that no court order is required, as has been said over and over and over again, to intercept and conduct surveillance on foreign-to-foreign communications that pass through the United States. That's a new technological reality, because that switch is here and so we needed to accommodate that. 
   The Director of National Intelligence discussed that with us. We made a change in the legislation that was proposed to accommodate that, and he was positive with respect to that change. I do not say he supported that change; I say he was positive. 
   It reiterates that individual warrants based on probable cause are required when surveillance is directed at people within the United States, not incidental contacts but directed at people in the United States. 
   It provides for an initial 15-day emergency authority so that international surveillance may begin immediately, so that we can empower the DNI to act now, and it allows for up to two 15-day extensions while the court considers the approval of surveillance procedures.     
   No one should be surprised that this majority is concerned about the actions of the administration after the last 4 years. The courts have been concerned. And the courts have acted because they did not believe that the administration was acting consistently with the duty to uphold and protect the laws and Constitution of this country. 
   That ought to be a serious concern. Frankly, it ought to be a very serious concern for those who label themselves conservatives, who have historically been the most outspoken in their fear of Government exercise of power and their concern for the constraint on the use of that power. 
   Our legislation also compels the cooperation of communications carriers during emergency periods, while it extends liability protection to those who assist in this intelligence-gathering effort. This was a very important provision. We understood that. It is controversial. But we thought it was important. 
   The legislation also requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to conduct an audit every 60 days of communications involving Americans that are intercepted under ``basket warrants,'' because we know those basket warrants are going to be just that, broad-reaching, because we wanted to give the DNI the authority to reach broadly and not be slowed down bureaucratically by individual requests. But we also thought that we needed to protect those individuals with an aftercheck, if you will, by the Inspector General. We think that is fair. We think conservatives ought to be for that. We think liberals ought to be for that. We think the American people are for that. 
   Finally, the legislation provides that these provisions sunset in 120 days, because it is imperative that we consider issues of this magnitude in a thoughtful manner. 
   We have been working hard. I said how often I have talked to the DNI, how often I have been in meetings, and how recently I was in meetings with the DNI. It is imperative that we consider these issues consistent with the magnitude that they present, not only for the safety of our people, but for the integrity of our Constitution and laws. 
   Now, some will say this bill doesn't go far enough. That may be so. And we ought to thoughtfully consider that in the months ahead as the committee, the ranking member, Republicans and Democrats, consider the permanent laws that may be put in place. 
   Many of them support the administration's proposal, which would permanently authorize warrantless surveillance and searches of American's telephone calls, e-mails, homes, offices and personal records for at least 3 months and for however long an appeal to the Court of Review in the Supreme Court takes, as long as the search is, and I quote, ``concerning a person abroad.'' 
   In fact, the administration's proposal practically eliminates the role of the FISA court. That, of course, is the administration's intent. We understand that. The administration, in fact, undertook the TSP program, the Terrorist Surveillance Program, outside the ambit of the check and balance that we contemplated when we adopted the legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, we have spent hours with the Director of National Intelligence and worked hard to give him the tools that were requested. The DNI asked that we expand the language in the bill from ``relating to terrorism'' to the much broader ``relating to all foreign intelligence.'' I support that change. I want to make sure that the DNI has a broad reach and view. So that is in this bill. 
   The DNI asked that we eliminate the requirement that the FISA court adjudicate how recurring communications into the United States from foreign targets would be handled, and we agreed to that change. 
   Madam Speaker, in closing, let me tell the Members that yesterday in that conference call I asked the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, this question: Does this legislation improve or not the situation you find yourself in? I quote you his answer to me just about 24 hours ago. This legislation, which has been so harshly analyzed, I quote the Director of National Intelligence: ``It significantly enhances America's security.'' 
   That is a quote. It is a direct quote. I do not imply that he said he supported it. And we have a very harsh statement from him that we just got a few hours ago. I will tell you, it doesn't sound like the Admiral McConnell with whom I have talked over the past few weeks. 
   Madam Speaker, the administration truly seeks a temporary fix to the FISA statute. This legislation provides one. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this important legislation. There are some on my side who believe it goes too far. There are some on your side that believe it goes not far enough. But it is, I suggest to you, a compromise that we can make that, as in the words of the Director of National Intelligence, significantly enhances our national security. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge the support of this legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, we have not yet had a meeting of the Rules Committee. I expect the Rules Committee will be meeting as soon as we leave here. I am not sure the exact time that it is scheduled. But we will be providing for rules. We intend to do a number of pieces of legislation. The gentleman has mentioned the Department of Defense bill. 
   Rules is not yet scheduled, but I presume it will be scheduled shortly. 
   The Department of Defense appropriation bill is a critical bill. We intend to consider that today. We also intend to consider Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation to enhance the ability of the Director of National Intelligence and those with whom he works to pursue those who might harm our country. 
   We also intend, Mr. Leader, to have on the floor a bill which is an emergency bill to respond to the bridge falling in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We also intend to consider an energy bill. 
   As I said on Tuesday, if we can complete that legislation today, we will do so. If not, we will complete it tomorrow. If we cannot complete it tomorrow, we will complete it on Monday. That is the order of business that we have contemplated.

   I have no problem with doing that vote, frankly. But I think it would raise in the minds of every Member here, is that the accurate count? I think in light of that, I would prefer not to do that. So I am trying to accommodate the confidence of the Members by vacating this vote.

   Mr. HOYER. In consultation with the technical people that we have, who are responsible for ensuring the proper operations of our computer system, which advises all of us on time and computes the votes, that they have to take the system down for approximately a half an hour, maybe slightly longer, for the purpose of fixing the machine. I think the machine needs to be fixed. 
   So in order to accommodate that objective, I am suggesting that we vacate this vote, allow them to do that, come back and then revote this particular vote and then move on to wherever we are going to move on.

   Mr. HOYER. The order we will consider those is we will consider Minnesota first. We believe that is the least contentious of the items, and we think, therefore, it would be good to get the least contentious item out of the way first. 
   Everybody in this body has great empathy for the State of Minnesota, but, more particularly, the people who lost their lives in that tragic collapse of the bridge. We will go to that first. 
   Of course, we have the rules to complete, but we will then, in terms of business, go to FISA, as we have expressed.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, we had a conversation on the floor of the House today with reference to this matter. I introduced a resolution to investigate this matter. The minority leader asked me to withdraw that resolution. I withdrew it. 
   The minority leader then asked me to have a meeting with himself and Mr. Blunt, and Mr. Clyburn attended that meeting. We discussed the incident of last night, we discussed proceeding to do the people's business, and what would be the conduct today. 
   The minority leader suggested that I have a member of my staff contact a member of his staff to discuss the creation of this select committee. That was just a few hours ago. Those discussions have not begun obviously and may not begin. 
   The minority leader talks about patterns. I think this is a pattern. I'm deeply disappointed, not by the resolution itself; although, we think the facts that are stated in the resolution are incorrect. I want to tell every Member of this House that I do not believe that there was any wrongdoing by any party yesterday. I do believe that there was a mistake made. I said that this morning. I repeat that this afternoon, and I regret it. I regret it because that mistake, understandably, angered those who perceived themselves disadvantaged by that mistake. I have a disagreement with the conclusion in here that has been again stated by the minority leader that I think would be disproved by any investigation that occurs. 
   There was never a call of the vote prevailing at 215-213 with a Republican motion to recommit prevailing. There was never a call by the Chair of that vote, period. 
   I observed, to the minority leader, that for 2 hours and 45 minutes I sat on this floor, actually, I'm not good at sitting on this floor. I walked around and talked to a lot of Members. For 2 hours and 45 minutes, my side was prevailing; not for 5 minutes, not for 2 minutes, not for 1 minute, as was the case last night. For 2 hours and 45 minutes, my side was prevailing, and the vote lasted another 10 minutes. It was referred to on ``60 Minutes'' last Sunday. 
   Now, historically, in the last 12 years, let me tell you what my friends' actions would have been on this motion. Immediately you would have moved to table. I do not do that. I do not accept the premises in your resolution, but I welcome the investigation. I applaud coming to the bottom of what happened because I know what happened. 
   Now, I wasn't looking behind me; I was looking at the Chair. But I've been informed of what happened, and what happened is eight people changed their votes. Three were Republicans, five were Democrats. There were 428 people who voted last night during that series of three votes. Every time the vote was called, 428 people voted. And the Chair called the vote at 214-214, which as all of you know adds up to 428. So every Member of the House had voted. No one was excluded. But some changed their vote on your side, and then some changed their vote on my side. And so the vote ended up and was finally called at 212-216, and we prevailed. 
   Now, as I said this morning, I understand the anger that existed and the sense of unfairness that was felt because, on the board electronically, when one of the changes came forward switching from one of the 214 to one of the 215 and reducing the 214 to 213, that was immediately reflected on the electronic board as the Speaker was announcing the vote, and so you were angry. I don't blame you. For 2 hours and 45 minutes as we sat on the prevailing side, the winning side, having more votes than your side, the vote was not closed. So I empathize with the sense of anger and frustration that you have. 
   And so what did I do? I didn't do what one of your former leaders did, just shrugged my shoulders and said, well, that's the way it goes, folks. I went to that rostrum, and I said we ought to vacate this vote and we ought to give everybody a fair shot at making sure the result is what those 428 votes want to do, because I understood that you had a sense of being wronged, and I wanted, to the extent I could, to try to right that wrong. 
   So I asked unanimous consent that that vote be vacated. There were many objections on your side of the aisle. I'm not sure why. You thought the vote was improperly cast. I know my friend, and everybody knows he's my friend, but we have a deep disagreement on this conclusion. Mr. Blunt believes that you won 215-213. We were ahead for 2 hours and 45 minutes. We didn't prevail. Why? Because the Speaker did not call the vote, and the Speaker didn't call the vote at the 215-213 margin. He called it at 214-214; you're absolutely right. But then he said, no, I was premature because there were changing votes, and so that vote was not finalized. You're absolutely right. The vote that was finalized was the accurate vote, 212 for your resolution and 216 against your resolution. 
   Now, one of those 216, of course, was the minority leader. He switched so he could make the motion, I presume, to reconsider, but it was not necessary for him to do that. I wanted, as I said, to try to make this right because, as I said on Tuesday night, and I repeated this morning, I want to try to have a civil relationship.     
   I work with a lot of you in this House on that side of the aisle. I like a lot of you on that side of the aisle. Some of you I do not know as well as I know others. More importantly than that, this is about my 40th year in legislative office, and I believe that it is important that we say hi to one another, respect one another and have trust in one another. 
   After you objected to the vacation of the vote, I moved to reconsider the vote, by which we prevailed on your motion to recommit. 
   I don't know why you didn't vote on that. It passed. We all voted for it on this side. All the Members on this side  voted for it to give you a second chance because you felt the first go-around wasn't fair. 
   I think it was fair but not appearing so because of the 215-213. Now, this investigation will look into that. As I said, we welcome it. We will not move, therefore, to table. 
   I have been asked to ask for a unanimous consent to drop all the ``whereas'' clauses but accept the result. I am not going to do that. Let me tell you why I am not going to do it. 
   I do not accept those ``whereases.'' I think they are factually inaccurate. They were not reviewed by me, and there has been no meeting of our staffs, I say to my friend, the minority leader, which we discussed at approximately 11:30 this morning. 
   I withdrew my resolution. My expectation was that the minority leader and I would sit down and our staffs would sit down and discuss this matter and determine how best to investigate this. That's what we discussed. There was no discussion about this resolution coming forward. There was no notice to me that this discussion was going forward; and there was a request to me, which I honored, to withdraw my own resolution offered this morning. I am disappointed. 
   I am not going to oppose this resolution, and we will have an investigation. We will appoint three on our side, and we will appoint three on your side. We will appoint three fair-minded Members who care about this institution. I hope you will do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we believe that the issue of the President's policy, which was announced some weeks ago, is an extraordinarily serious question confronting the country and the Congress. We expect the resolution to be very straightforward and very simple. 
   We expect the resolution to deal only with the proposal the President has made for escalation. We believe we should present that to the House of Representatives as an issue on which they can make their advice to the President of the United States and to the Executive Department. 
   So the answer to the gentleman's question is that we do not believe, as you have not in the past on similar resolutions, I remember your so-called Murtha resolution, we believe that there will be a direct question propounded to the House which every Member can speak to for 3 to 4 days, and then give their advice on.

   Mr. HOYER. We are grappling with this, I will tell my friend. We believe the American public, the American people, have the right to know where their representatives stand on the central and sole issue that the resolution will raise. 
   There may be other issues that you might want to raise at some point in time. And there are going to be at least three pieces of legislation, as you know, that will be coming down the pike on this issue: the supplemental, the authorization bill, and the appropriation bill for 2008. 
   We expect all of those bills to be relatively broad in their treatment of various different aspects. But I will tell the gentleman, frankly, because we feel this is such a critically important question and that the clarity of the question and the clarity of the response is so important that we are trying to carefully consider how we can assure that there is no confusion as to the answer that this House gives.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   The gentleman is correct. On February 15, of course, the existing CR expires in terms of authorization for the funding of the departments that were unfunded in the budget cycle, in the appropriation cycle, so that we need to take action to keep the government operating for all agencies other than Homeland Security and the Defense Department. 
   We are trying to plan on the contingencies. Obviously, one of the alternatives you mentioned is one that we would hope might be followed, and that is the adoption of the House-passed CR, which we think is one that obviously a broad number of this House supported in a bipartisan fashion. We would hope that the other body would. 
   But if they do not move ahead, we are discussing the possibility of some short-term CR. But those discussions have not moved beyond the contemplation that they may be necessary. They have not come to any decision as to how long it would be. 
   Clearly, one of the problems, as the gentleman knows, is we are leaving for a week for the Presidents' Day District Work Period, so that we would not be here at least for the following week. One of the reasons obviously Friday may be a very long day will be because the CR will have expired if we don't pass something, and we may have to deal with it that day, as well as ending the debate that we referred to previously.

   Mr. HOYER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, you heard me ask the question of Mr. Hoekstra. Wouldn't it be true that if he would use ``forthwith,'' what he wants to do could be accomplished right now? We would all support it. It is a worthy objective. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Hoekstra, in the same motion where he says I want to do something says but I don't want to do it now; I am not sure when I want to do it. 
   I asked for unanimous consent, and I didn't get to do exactly what I think everybody in this House thinks is a good thing to do, and I will tell my friend we're going to do this. It's a good idea. But the advice you're getting is not good advice. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, ladies and gentlemen on my side of the aisle, this continues to be a political game. If you want to take my words down on that, you can do it. This is not accomplishing the objective. 
   This continues to be a pattern, and the American voters are pretty smart, and they understand when somebody says I want to do something, but by the way, I want to kill the vehicle at least temporarily that accomplishes my objective, at the same time, they think to themselves something is not right. 
   So, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you. We're hopefully going to reject this motion, which sidetracks this important intelligence authorization bill, which everybody has said is an important bill, but I will tell you further, we're going to accomplish the objective of Mr. Hoekstra next week because it's a good objective. 
   But the fact of the matter is we could accomplish it right now if you didn't want to try to make some political point out of it on this intelligence bill, and you can say ``oh'' all you want. You can say ``oh'' all you want, but that is the truth and you know it. You know it in your heart, and you know it in your mind. 
   I urge my colleagues: reject this killing motion.

   Mr. HOYER. It is tough to be in the minority, isn't it? I feel your pain. I want you to know that. 
   Of course, that perfect bill of which all of you speak could have been passed in 1995 or 1996 or even 1997 or 1998 or 1999 or 2000, or even 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and, yes, 2006 when you were in charge, and we had no say as to what you passed or what you didn't pass. But you didn't pass this bill. You passed this bill through the House; it is not law. It is not law. And you had the President, you had the Senate, and you had the House. 
   There is now a claim that we have heard now for 2 weeks: The energy bill could have been better. Yes, but many of you voted for it. You indicated, many of you, that the minimum wage bill could have been perhaps better by adding some things on, but 82 of you voted for it. 
   This bill could be better, but it is timely. It is timely to do the right thing. 
   Mr. Kirk has a number of suggestions. I think they are pretty good suggestions. I don't mind them. He asked about income tax. Now, we all pay income taxes. All Americans pay income taxes, or some have preference items they avoid, assuming they are doing it legally. But that is not part of our duties as a Member of Congress; it is part of our duties as a citizen. 
   What this bill seeks to say is when you raise your right hand and swear that you will serve your constituents faithfully and honestly, that you do that; that you don't do it for some outside lobbyist or interest group. And that if you do, we are not going to pay your pension. That is all this bill says. 
   It is late in coming, but it is never too late to do the right thing, and I  would hope that every Member of this House when the roll is called on this bill will say to their constituents that I am going to take pensions away from those who abuse their power and responsibility given to them by the American people as Members of this House and undermine the faith and trust that the American people have in Members and in this House.     
   I agree with Mr. Terry, it could be better. We could add things to it. Perhaps we will. As a matter of fact, we just added something, as you have pointed out, because we thought that not only is lying bad, but asking people to lie is bad. It is called a fancy word, subornation of perjury. But what it is, is asking your staffer to say, don't tell the grand jury I did that. That is essentially what that says. So you can't tell your staff to go to the grand jury, when the grand jury says, does Member A, B or C take money or lie or do something or take money to vote on something, if you ask them to do that, and, after all, they work for you, you have control of their salary, you are also going to be subject to loss of pension. 
   So I agree with those that say this bill is not perfect. They are right, but a lot of the bills that we have passed, as a matter of fact probably no bill that we have passed has been perfect, but this is a good bill. As my friend, the former Congressman from Kentucky would say, ``And I tell you that frankly.'' 
   My expectation is we are going to have almost every Member, I would hope 100 percent of the House say to the American people we will not allow Members who misuse and fail your trust to get your taxpayers' dollars paid to them in pensions. Vote for this bill. It is a good bill. 
   I want to congratulate NANCY BOYDA for her leadership in bringing this bill to the floor, and I urge Members on both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan way, vote to say to the American people, we won't take your pensions if we do wrong by you, and we won't let others do as well.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we could dissipate, first of all, any implication that anybody was disingenuous. There are obviously disagreements on issues. I know that the gentlelady, the Chair of the committee, and Mr. Shadegg have spoken. I think that is a good thing. 
   I wanted to say to Mr. Shadegg, I certainly did not believe he was anything but stating his opinion, and I think that is certainly appropriate to do. I want to make that very, very clear, that we do not and I do not nor did the chairwoman intend to put anybody's motivation in question. We should not do that. Hopefully, we will all try not to do that. 
   Secondly, let me say that in terms of notice, I had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Boehner on Friday. This bill was scheduled, as you know, for consideration on Friday.     
   There was concern that perhaps people hadn't seen it for sufficient time, although this bill, in substance, has, in fact, been passed by the House before with your leadership. So Mr. Boehner and I have discussed it. Mr. Blunt and I had a colloquy, in which time I said that this would be on suspension tonight. 
   The bill was amended, the gentleman is correct, within the last few hours. The date was changed at the request of Mr. Boehner. I happen to agree with Mr. Boehner that the date of 2009, which was in the bill, and I know Mrs. Boyda, I talked to Mrs. Boyda about it, she agreed with the change as well. The change was made because it was Mr. Boehner's feeling, and I think the minority's feeling, that the bill ought to go into effect immediately. 
   The reason the date was put in as 2009 because that is what the Senate bill does under the constitutional provision of the 27th amendment, where compensation of a Member may not be changed during the course of their term. So it was made effective at the next term. 
   But my observation, and I think Mr. Boehner's, I don't know whether he is on the floor, were the same; that if that question would be raised, let a defendant who is convicted of falling short of his duties and responsibilities, or hers, to their constituents and to this institution, let them raise that. I agreed with that. So that change was made mutually. 
   There was an additional subornation of perjury which we think is appropriate. But I want to say to Members on both sides, I am an institutionalist. I believe in this institution, I believe in the Members, and I believe the Members need to have careful and thoughtful consideration. 
   This bill is straightforward and, as I say, for all intents and purposes has been passed. I want to tell everybody, I think we are going to roll the vote on this bill because we don't want anybody to miss it. There are 11 Members on each side absent because of planes that have not flown on schedule because of weather. And it is an equal number on each side, so we are going to wait. 
   But I hope when this bill comes to a vote that all of us vote for it, notwithstanding our differences on process, which ought to be better. We are going to strive to make it better. 
   I want you to know that I feel strongly. When I said I feel your pain, I do. I don't think it is disingenuous pain. I think you are accurate on that. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we could conclude the debate on this. I think we are all going to agree on this. 
   I see my friend Mr. Boehner coming to the podium. But I would hope that we could move this bill and give to the American public the understanding that we believe this is a very serious matter, and we are going to address it, and we are going to address it soon. 
   I will be glad to yield to my friend.

I don't think it is an unreasonable position. I think our perception is that this is a bill that has passed.

I try to make these events every time you come, because as Speaker Pelosi, and what an historic event you have just participated in. You are the first group of former Members in over 200 years of our Republic that has been greeted by a woman Speaker. The President was so gracious the first time that Nancy and I went down and had lunch with the Speaker. It was just 2 days after the election. President Bush could not have been more gracious and more generous in his comments about the historical aspect and his congratulations for NANCY's accomplishment. It is an extraordinary accomplishment. 
   As you have noticed, she is as strong and focused and competent a Speaker as I have served with. And I know there is a wonderful friend here, who I also want to greet, and that is my friend Tom Foley. When I came to the Congress of the United States, Tom was the whip. I had the great honor of being the whip at one point in time, as you know. 
   I am now in the office that Tom Foley peopled. He was ensconced in the first floor of the Capitol, we had many whip meetings there, and he taught me how to be a Member of Congress. And I could have had no better teacher than Tom Foley, no more principled, decent person than Tom Foley. 
   I will tell you this, and you have heard me say it before. I would not have chosen to be in the minority. And in 1994 with this hostile takeover as I refer to it of the institution of which I was a Member, I became a minority stockholder in, one of the sadnesses, I think, of the 1994 transfer of authority was not so much it was a transfer of authority, that's what happens in democracies, but that an extraordinary American did not become the Speaker of the House, somebody that I love and respect and honor who I think is one of the most decent people with whom I have served in 40 years in a legislative body and that is, of course, the very distinguished, wonderful American first as well as, of course, a distinguished Republican leader, my friend Bob Michel. Bob, thank you for what you have done. 
   When the American people think of what they would like to see in the Congress of the United States and the kind of collegiality and respect for one another and civility that they would like to see, they think of Bob Michel and Tom Foley in my opinion. They may not think of them by name, but they think of who they are and what they represent. 
   I am also pleased to see Arlen Specter who was masquerading as a former Member sitting with the Speaker. As a matter of fact, Ray LaHood traveled with me overseas. We went to Darfur, we were in Sudan, and we were in Egypt. In Egypt, we had a cocktail party, a reception at the Ambassador's residence and I introduced Ray LaHood as the former staffer of the Speaker. Kathy, his wife, came up to me and said, ``Bob Michel was never Speaker.'' I said, ``I know, but in my mind he should have been.'' 
   Jack Kemp is here, also my friend. We had the opportunity to serve on the Appropriations Committee as well. Jack, of course, a distinguished Vice Presidential candidate, now who continues as so many of you do in your own public lives to be so involved in trying to make our country better. Jack, thank you for all you have done. 
   I could mention each and every one of you, but Speaker Rhodes would say you're pressing on that 1 minute a little much. But let me say that those of you who are former Members, some, of course, are former Members by choice. Some, as you reflect upon a democracy that sometimes makes mistakes, are former Members by mistake of your constituencies. But in any event it occurs to me that all of you are financially far better off than us poor people you left behind, and I congratulate you for that. 
   I want to congratulate Mr. Slattery, who's our leader on the Democratic side, and Jay Rhodes. I saw Jay in the hallway just the other day. I had the opportunity of serving briefly with his dad and then with him and both reflect the decency of which I have spoken earlier. 
   Let me also say that I am now the majority leader, and thwarting the will of the majority is something that we criticize very severely and properly so. In a democracy, you do not want to thwart the will of the majority. But as majority leader, I want you to know that I work very hard at thwarting the will of the minority. Sometimes they get upset by it. I don't understand that, Bob, but it happens. 
   Let me thank all of you. Let me thank all of you for holding high the institutional values that the Founding Fathers and Americans want to establish, a body that brings together the various differences within our society, the various interest groups within our society, and tries to synthesize those differences into rational consensus for progress for our country. If we continue to do that, we will continue to merit the respect of our fellow citizens. If we do not, then they will properly have us all become former Members. 
   God bless what you have done, are doing and continue to do on behalf of our country and on behalf of the House of Representatives. Thank you very much.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' CARE, KATRINA RECOVERY, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States had a chance to fully fund the troops just a few weeks ago, he chose not to take it, I tell my friend, Mr. Tiahrt, from Kansas. We fully funded the troops. In fact, we gave more money for the fight against terrorism. We want to see success. 
   Mr. Speaker, let every Member here and all those watching this debate at home be perfectly clear, this legislation fully funds our troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan, ensuring that they have the resources they need to conduct their missions. Not only that, this bill includes additional funding, as the last bill did, not requested by the President, to fight the war on terror, to improve America's military readiness and to meet our veterans' unmet health needs. 
   However, while this legislation funds our troops, it insists, as we tried to last time, for the first time in more than 4 years that the Bush Administration and the Iraqi government be accountable. The American public expects accountability. 
   Plain and simple, this legislation responds to the will of the people, who are dismayed by the failed implementation of American foreign policy, perhaps more failed than in any in the generation. 
   On Tuesday, a CNN poll found that two-thirds of Americans oppose the war, and 61 percent support benchmarks like the ones in this bill that would measure Iraqi progress.     
   Let me say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, Vice President Cheney was deployed by this administration. What for? To tell the Iraqis they had to perform, that they had to meet benchmarks; that the American public was running thin on its support, and in fact is not supporting this war. 
   But, frankly, the Congress has taken the position that we won't say that, and the President vetoes a bill that said that, a bill that required performance so that the millions that the American public, the billions that the American public, the $500 billion-plus that the American public has dug from their pockets, will be responsibly met by the Iraqi Government. 
   Thus, Mr. Speaker, this legislation holds the President and the Iraqi Government accountable by fencing off 52-plus of the $95.5 billion provided to the Defense Department until released by subsequent legislation. 
   What is there to fear from this Congress as we oversee whether or not there is a turn from an unsuccessful implementation of a policy to a successful policy? Perhaps that fear is that that corner will not be turned, and therefore this vote may be at risk. 
   Before this additional funding is released, however, the President must report to Congress by July 13 regarding the success of the Iraqi Government in meeting security and political benchmarks. General Petraeus has said there is no solution but a political solution, and the only people who can accomplish a political solution are the Iraqis themselves. 
   What do we ask for? Disarming militias who are killing our men and women, enacting legislation to equitably share oil revenues. There will be no resolution without that. Reforming the debaathification process, which says to literally tens of thousands of people, we know you were Baath members, but you really weren't in politics, so you can come back and do the work to build this society. Without that, we will not succeed and our men and women will pay the price, as they are paying the price every day. 
   Lastly, providing for provisional elections. We are fighting for democracy. We are investing in democracy. That is what we are told. But we haven't amended the constitution and we are not providing for the provincial elections that were promised. If that is the case, the Iraqi people are not going to think democracy is on its way. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States himself has stated that our commitment in Iraq is not open-ended. That is what this legislation says. If you think it is open-ended, if you think there should be no benchmarks, if you think the American taxpayers' money ought to be spent without seeing results and without the carnage to our troops decreasing, then vote against this. 
   To this we say, no more. No more blank checks. Not after more than 3,370 Americans have lost their lives in Iraq and more than 25,000 have been injured. Ten percent of those lives have been lost in the last 4 months. Not after the American taxpayer spent nearly half a trillion dollars. And not after 4 years of egregious misjudgments by this administration, from ``mission accomplished,'' to ``the insurgency is in its last throes,'' to ``Iraq will fund its own reconstruction.'' 
   Every Member in this body, every Member, hopes and prays that the current troop escalation succeeds, that the Iraqis stabilize and secure their country and that our troops can return home safely. Why should you fear waiting 60 days and making another judgment as to whether that is occurring? That is our responsibility. 
   We swore an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States which says that we are the policymakers. But there is little reason for optimism when the violence in Iraq continues unabated and progress on the ground is somewhere between illusive and nonexistent. 
   The two-step funding approach in this legislation effected by Mr. Obey and Mr. Murtha is not only appropriate, it is imperative. Even the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has stated, ``I think the time to look at where we are is late summer.'' This is a few days before that, and we will continue consideration into that late summer that Senator McConnell talks about. 
   We cannot want to succeed more than the Iraqis. They must take the lead in restoring stability and securing their nation. And the Iraqi Parliament must not go on vacation while American men and women are fighting and dying for them. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, support this bill. Let us forge a new direction in Iraq and implement a policy and design to succeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a critical step in support of democracy. This legislation is important legislation. The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act is designed to do one thing, to address and rectify the unjustified disenfranchisement of more than 500,000 citizens of our country, whose only distinction between any of us who sit on this floor, other than the distinguished representative of the District of Columbia, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, is that they live in a few square miles designated by their country, gifted by the State of Maryland, as our Nation's capital. 
   Since 1801, when Washington, D.C., became this Nation's capital, the citizens of the District of Columbia have not had representation in the Congress. Let me speak briefly of that, because although I have not heard all of the debate, I am sure the Constitution has been referenced that Representatives shall represent citizens of the several States. 
   Let there be no mistake, every resident of the District of Columbia is a successor to citizens of the several States in 1800. I don't mean that every one of them is a direct descendant, obviously, but politically they were part of the several States, unlike all four others of the representatives who cannot vote. They are distinguished and discrete in that regard. That, I suggest to you, is wrong. 
   It is wrong as a matter of principle because District citizens pay Federal taxes, sit on juries, serve in our Armed Forces and give their lives for their country, as do other Americans who enjoy full representation in this body. It is wrong politically because District citizens since 1801 have effectively been a ward of Congress. Very frankly, I don't think the citizens of Maryland intended that or the citizens of any other State of the Union when they acquired the District of Columbia. 
   And it is wrong morally, because the United States of America, which has the freest, truest form of representative government perhaps in human history, deprives only one portion of its citizens, a small portion, 500,000 out of 300 million, deprives a small portion of its citizens of its very own capital a voice in the national legislature. 
   Let me add, the United States of America is the only representative democracy that does not afford the citizens of its capital voting representation. Thus, this is not only a national disgrace, but an international embarrassment, and the American people and Members here on both sides of the aisle recognize this injustice and want to remedy it. That is what this legislation is about. 
   In fact, 82 percent of respondents in a recent national poll indicated that residents of the District of Columbia should have representatives that can vote in the Congress. And I should note that legislation virtually identical to this bill was reported out of the Republican-controlled Government Reform Committee in the last Congress when the committee was chaired by Mr. Davis of Virginia, who is a cosponsor of this legislation. Mr. Jack Kemp, a former colleague of ours, a leader in this Congress, a vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party, has strongly urged the passage of this piece of legislation. 
   The truth is, the absence of representation in Congress for District citizens underscores the failure of the Congress to use the authority vested in it by the Constitution of the United States to correct this injustice. The authority I refer to, of course, is article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the so-called seat of government clause, under which, and I quote, ``The Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District of Columbia.'' 
   Now, I asked my friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) who talked about needing to do this through a constitutional amendment, I said, would you support a constitutional amendment? He said ``no''; his view was, only if the District of Columbia were given back to Maryland and the District of Columbia residents were told, you are no longer residents of the District of Columbia, you are residents of Maryland. 
   I suggest if you ask the residents of Virginia or Delaware or Pennsylvania, which are contiguous States to our beloved State of Maryland, they would say, thank you, but no thanks. We like being Pennsylvanians or Delawarians or Virginians. 
   The District of Columbia residents are proud of their jurisdiction. They are proud of being citizens of the District of Columbia. What they want to have is full democratic representation. 
   Plain and simple, this sweeping language gives Congress extraordinary and plenary power over our Nation's capital city, including the authority to adopt legislation to enfranchise the District's 550,000 residents with a full vote in the House of Representatives. 
   I am not alone in my view of this article. Twenty-five legal scholars from law schools, and I am sure this has already been discussed by our distinguished chairman and the extraordinarily able Representative and outstanding lawyer and law professor who represents the District of Columbia, my good friend ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, have already pointed this out. 
   Even Kenneth Starr, a distinguished lawyer, I have disagreed with him pretty strongly on some things, but the former conservative jurist and current dean of Pepperdine Law School, has concluded that Congress has the authority under article I, section 8, to do this. 
   Now, do I delude myself that this is not going to be brought before a district court or a circuit court or the Supreme Court? No, I do not. That is appropriate. That is available to residents. They can do that, and the court will ultimately have to rule. However, this is an opportunity for us on this floor to make a stand for democracy, to extend to these 550,000 people the civility and respect we would expect for ourselves. 
   That Congress has for two centuries failed to use its authority to correct an injustice is no reason to persist in that failure today. It is always timely to do the right thing. 
   This institution exists, after all, to eliminate injustice and to make our Nation ``a more perfect Union.'' How much more perfect can we make the Union than to include all of our people as full citizens within that Union? 
   We, the Members of this House, must never, never be seduced into thinking there is no such thing as a settled injustice within our authority but beyond our duty to correct. For an injustice planted two centuries ago is just as harmful to what America aspires to be today as one planted last year or last week. 
   Mr. Chairman, as Frederick Douglass, who spent his final years just a few blocks from where I stand today, said, ``Man's greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his powers to things needed to be done.'' 
   We need to make the citizens of this Nation's capital full citizens of the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Let me first of all say at the outset that I agree with Mr. Murtha. We're not fighting this war. There's nobody in the Congress of the United States that's paying more taxes to pay for this war. There's nobody who's saving on metal to fight this war. There's nobody who's saving on rubber to fight this war. There's nobody whose gasoline is being rationed to fight this war. Our troops are fighting this war, their families are fighting this war, but this Nation is not at war. 
   There is nobody in this Congress, not one of the 435 Members of this Congress, who wants to lose this war. There is nobody in this House who does not want to defeat al Qaeda. Nobody. Everybody wants to protect this country. Nobody wants to lose another American. Everybody understands that the fight against terrorism will require risks. But, Mr. Speaker, this House deserves more than this game playing of offering motions that we are then going to vote against. In effect, this is a motion to reconsider the vote by which the previous bill was adopted. It couldn't be made now, but that is effectively what it is. And those who voted against that bill will vote against this motion. The public needs to understand that a serious motion could have been made here to change the policy, but that is not what was done. This is an attempt to try to politically get people in a vote that is going to be characterized as surrender. 
   Let me call my colleagues' attention to June 24, 1997. Our troops were deployed in Bosnia stopping genocide, seeing a dictator arrested and sent to The Hague and tried for genocide. He died before the trial was over. But let me call your attention to that vote, because that vote was about setting timelines. It was offered by Mr. Buyer, who is now the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mr. Buyer offered that motion and we debated it. I was opposed to it. We hadn't lost a single troop in Bosnia, not one. We had spent a pittance compared to what we have spent here. We have lost  10 percent of the troops we have lost in the last 120 days. 
   Bob Gates said this policy was failing. He's our Secretary of Defense. Or let me put it this way: he didn't say that; he said we were not winning. That's a different way of saying it more accurately. I'm sorry. 
   But on June 24, 1997, that came to a vote about setting timelines on an effort that was extraordinarily successful, brought peace to the Balkans, or at least a lack of genocide, a lack of ethnic cleansing. But Mr. Buyer said we need to come home. We weren't losing troops, it wasn't costing us that much money, and we certainly were not losing. 
   On that timeline, Mr. Boehner voted ``yes,'' after 18 months in Bosnia. Not 4 years, 4 years and 1 month. After 18 months, you wanted to set a timeline. Mr. Boehner, your leader, voted ``yes.''     
   Mr. Blunt, your whip, voted ``yes.'' Mr. Hastert, your former Speaker, voted ``yes.'' Mr. Hunter, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, setting timelines, voted ``yes.'' Mr. Hyde, who was then chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, voted ``yes.'' Mr. Hoekstra, who spoke earlier tonight, voted ``yes'' on setting timelines. 
   And yes, let me remind Mr. Lewis, you voted ``yes.'' You voted ``yes'' on a timeline where we had lost no troops, where we had stopped genocide in its tracks, where we were not threatened with loss of life. All we were threatened with was coming home and not keeping the peace, keeping the stability, trying to make sure that we were successful. 
   I urge every one of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this Republican motion. They don't mean it, but to reiterate to the American public that we were serious, that we want to make sure, as Bob Gates has said and been quoted by Mr. Obey and others, this was a useful effort for us to make. 
   Why? Because what we want to do is make sure the Iraqis at least are fighting this war, making sure that the Iraqis meet the criteria and benchmarks set by whom? By President Bush, not by us. President George Bush, the Commander in Chief, said they need to meet these benchmarks. But if the message we send them is, we're there forever, why meet the benchmarks? Why put their people at risk? If we're all prepared to simply have our men and women at risk in lieu of Iraqi soldiers and police at risk? Why indeed? 
   We need to expect accountability and participation by those whose country it is. We deposed their dictator and declared some few months later that our mission was accomplished. Unfortunately, because of the flawed policies that were pursued, we have not yet succeeded. 
   I voted to give the President authority and I disagreed with the gentleman from Pennsylvania when he said in November of 2005, let's get out, not immediately, but consistent with the safety of our troops. But I agree with the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Obey and the overwhelming majority of the American public, some 70 percent, who say it is time to let the Iraqis know that it is their fight, that we have supported them, we will train them, we will protect our troops on the ground, we will protect our diplomatic missions, and we will give them assistance in arms, but this is their fight now. We are there to help them, but it is their fight. 
   That's what this says, and it says 15 months from now, not tomorrow. To characterize this as any kind of a surrender is not honest debate, I suggest to you. Because if it is, then your June 24, 1997, which almost all of you voted for, was a cry for surrender. I didn't believe it then, don't believe it now. You had a difference of view as to what would best resolve the situation in Bosnia. Now the issue is Iraq. 
   My colleagues on my side of the aisle, we took a position with which the overwhelming majority of the American public agree. They are ahead of us on this. Let us once again sustain that position. Nobody on this side of the aisle was not being serious. Nobody on this side of the aisle did not give this very serious, thoughtful, prayerful consideration. And when you voted, you voted for America. When you voted, you voted for our troops. When you voted, you voted for success in our foreign policy and in our fight against terrorism. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have offered a motion which they are not for. They could have offered, I suggest, some serious alternatives. They did not. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote ``yes,'' reaffirm the policy statement that we need a new direction in Iraq. Staying the course has not worked. Let's make a change. Vote ``yes.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his question. It is an important question. And the answer to that question is, absolutely. And I am glad that we have this opportunity to clear up any confusion. I want to assure the gentleman, and all Members of the House, that the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act will not violate PAYGO, period. The House just voted to approve the D.C. Voting Rights Act of 2007. We have now proceeded to consideration of H.R. 1906, which amends provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding estimated taxes to pay for all costs attendant within the D.C. House Voting Rights Act.     
   While those costs are de minimis, essentially about $1.6 million out of $27 trillion if there is no escalation in government revenues, notwithstanding that, we wanted to adhere to the PAYGO rule, as the gentleman from Indiana has stated and for which he has fought so hard and been a leader on. The rule provides that the text of H.R. 1906 will be incorporated into the D.C. Voting Rights Act when H.R. 1906 is passed; in other words, every Member who voted for the rule voted to honor PAYGO. 
   The Congressional Budget Office and the Budget Committee have certified that when the text of H.R. 1906 is incorporated into the bill and the bill is engrossed, the bill will comply with the PAYGO rule. The rule further provides that if either bill fails to pass, both bills will be tabled. In other words, if the bill providing the offset to ensure compliance with PAYGO is not added to the bill, the D.C. bill would be rejected. 
   This process guarantees that two important things will happen, first, that an unmitigated injustice, the denial of voting for the citizens of the District of Columbia, is considered on its merits and remedied; and secondly, that we abide by our commitment to PAYGO. 
   Again I state, the gentleman from Indiana has been an extraordinarily consistent and strong leader on behalf of that premise. 
   The House, in conclusion, will not send a bill that does not comply with the PAYGO rule as a result of the rule. And I commend those who voted for the rule to be consistent with our PAYGO pledge. 
   I thank the gentleman for his question.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE TOM LANTOS, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. This is a sad day not only for this institution, for those of us who were Tom's friends, clearly for his family, but it is a sad day for our country. Tom Lantos had a backbone of steel and a heart of commitment, compassion, and courage. 
   David Dreier just mentioned my service on the Helsinki Commission. As chairman of that body for the House, with my friend Chris Smith, we shared responsibility for focusing on the human rights of people, particularly within the European theater and particularly in the Soviet Union, and we worked very hard at that. But no Member of this body has been a stronger voice, a more compelling voice for the rights of individuals, whatever their background, wherever they lived, and whatever the excuse was for acting against them or undermining their rights. When Tom spoke, especially on matters dealing with human rights, America's role in the world, the importance of confronting and defeating dictatorial regimes, both the left and right, his words contained a moral clarity and intellectual gravity that was seldom matched. 
   Those of us who had an opportunity to be with Tom when we met with people from around the world knew that Tom Lantos would be candid, diplomatic, but certain in his message. Tom, quite simply, was a man of great substance, an immigrant to America, like so many immigrants before him and after, but few matching his contribution to our great country. 
   Speaker Pelosi indicated that Tom referred to himself as an American by choice. He was a great humanitarian. His remarkable life serves as an inspiration to all of us, to his family, and to his country. He was an indomitable spirit. His life story of course is well known, and I will not repeat it here. Others will talk more specifically. 
   Last month, Tom was unable to attend the United Nations Annual Commemoration of the Holocaust. However, his daughter Katrina, married to one of our colleagues, Dick Swett, delivered his remarks, which called on the international community to, and I quote, ``dedicate ourselves to stopping current tragedies such as the genocide in Darfur, and to preventing such inhuman cruelty in the future.'' 
   Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions around this globe have lost an extraordinary voice for them, individually and collectively. 
   Tom went on to note that the ``veneer of civilization is paper thin.'' That is a lesson for all of us. We know that the mob can be uncaring of human rights, of individuals. Tom Lantos focused on that issue when he said that that veneer is very thin. John Lewis, another great humanitarian and champion of individual rights and civil liberties. He went on to say, ``We are its guardians, and we can never rest.'' Not only did he say that, but he lived his life without rest for those he saw beleaguered. 
   Until his last day on this Earth, Tom Lantos never rested because of what he had seen and experienced. He was an indefatigable advocate for human  rights and human decency. And now with his passing it falls to us to honor his enduring legacy, not just by speaking on this floor of what he did, but committing ourselves to continue his advocacy for liberty and human rights. 
   There is no more fitting tribute to this wonderful man who lived a wonderful life marked by hardship, tragedy, and also triumph, and who now is at rest in God's hands. 
   Madam Speaker, I especially want to speak of Annette. You cannot speak of Tom Lantos without speaking of Annette. I don't know of any couple that I have ever met that was in fact, as well as in marriage-ceremony verbiage, two people who became one, kindred spirits born of equal experience, equally committed with a passion and a courage and an untiring commitment on behalf of those who needed a voice. Annette is with us still and, therefore, Tom is with us still. May we honor him, remember him, and hold high the torch that he held so high, so successfully for so long. 
   God bless you, Tom Lantos.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of chairing a subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee many years ago, and Rob Nabors was my staff director, so I had an opportunity to work with him firsthand. And I want to echo the comments of Mr. Obey and, I know, the comments that Mr. Lewis will make. 
   Mr. Nabors is an individual of great intellect, great integrity, and great insight. And I want to frankly express on behalf of the House our appreciation to the President-elect for having the wisdom to choose somebody who knows the House so well and I think we will be able to work with very closely, although my impression is that his relationship with Mr. Obey may be modified just slightly. 
   Rob, congratulations to you.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. In this time of economic crisis--as America is challenged, as economists tell us that we are facing the worst recession since the Great Depression--I want to say to Barney Frank, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, that nobody has worked harder over the last 12 months with Secretary Paulson, Ben Bernanke, Chris Dodd, Spencer Bachus, and with others in the Senate and in the House to try to address this issue in a responsible, effective way.     
   There is nobody in this body, Republican or Democrat, who wants to see this economy go down further. There is nobody in this body, Republican or Democrat, who wants to see people losing jobs. There is nobody in this body who wants to see the 401(k) plans of our senior citizens who are relying on those plans for their retirement to have it eroded by further reduction in its value. 
   Lyndon Johnson once said, ``It's not difficult to do the right thing. It's difficult to know what the right thing is.'' And that is, of course, what this debate is about, what is the right thing. 
   I think it would be a fair statement that there will be really nobody who votes on this bill who will say this is absolutely right or this is absolutely wrong. There will be many of us who will vote, however, in a belief that this is a further effort to try to staunch the extraordinarily rapid fall that this economy has seen over the last 12 months. 
   This bill is designed to give the automakers the time and space they need to become a competitive job-creating industry once again. Why? Because we need them. We need their industrial capacity; we need them, frankly, psychologically; and we need them in terms of the employment they give, the profits they make, and the quality of product they provide. 
   It is designed, this bill, to do so while protecting taxpayer dollars. Does it do so absolutely? No, it does not. But it has made very substantial efforts to put us in the best position possible. Reconciling the goals of saving these companies for the welfare of our country and protecting our taxpayers has taken long negotiations and compromise on both sides, but I'm convinced we've come to a sound solution. 
   These rescue loans are necessary--not to reward bad decision making in Detroit, but to protect 3 million American jobs, 3 million livelihoods, 3 million families who depend on the automakers; not only their direct employees, but the workers, their suppliers, the small businesses--as the gentleman from Texas referenced--that serve those workers and entire communities. 
   Are we really willing to put those workers at risk in this deep recession? 533,000 jobs lost this year last month, 533,000 last month. Let me give you a comparison. During the last year of the last administration in 2000, we gained over 1 1/2 million jobs. This year, we've lost over 1 1/2 million jobs. That's a 3 million job turnaround in the two 8-year interfacing periods. 
   That's why people in America are hurting. We cannot take the risk of  having a million-month lost jobs. We're not willing to put those workers at risk in this deep recession. 
   As John Judis put it recently in the New Republic, without public loans, ``the industry will disappear the way the American television manufacturing industry disappeared. American workers and engineers will lose their ability to compete in a major durable goods industry.'' We cannot afford to have that happen. 
   The gentleman from Texas said that we don't want that to happen. The gentleman from Massachusetts says we don't want that to happen. We are trying to figure out how we ensure the objective that both of those gentlemen believe is appropriate. 
   That is the motive behind the $15 billion in emergency bridge loans for the car companies. But it is equally important to ensure that those loans lead to real reform to ensure that we do not find ourselves right back in this same emergency in just a few months' time. All 435 agree that that is not an objective or a result we want to see. 
   Congress has insisted that the automakers develop detailed plans for long-term viability. I'm pleased that we were able to work with the administration. It has been criticized, but the administration and the President, others in the administration with whom I have talked, believe that making sure that this industry has the ability to continue is critical to the welfare of this Nation--not just to this industry but of this Nation. 
   The viability plans that we are requiring were presented to Congress on December 2, and we've examined them in detail. Now, this bill will hold the automakers to their promises. They will be accountable to Congress and the administration as well as an administration-appointed ``car czar'' who will oversee the efforts of the industry and its stakeholders to cut costs, restructure debt, and renegotiate labor contracts. They will not be running the car companies, as they should not be, but they will be overseeing and ensuring that the car companies carry out the promises that they have made to us and to the taxpayers. 
   Just like any other lender, the Federal Government is insisting that the recipients of its loans be on a plausible path to profitability. If the automakers stick to their plans for viability, more assistance, of course, may be possible. But if the administration-appointed official finds that they have not made adequate progress on restructuring by March 31, the loans will be called, and the automakers will be a step closer to bankruptcy. 
   The automakers and most of the people with whom I've talked, liberal economists, conservative economists, Republicans and Democrats, believe that bankruptcy is not the option. There are some who believe that's the option, but most I have talked to do not. 
   This bill, of course, also includes safeguards for the taxpayers, as I said. It lets the American people profit if and when the value of the car companies recovers, as surely all of us hope it will. And it guarantees that taxpayer money will not fund lavish executive bonuses or golden parachutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we act today, we can seize the chance for an American auto industry that is leaner, greener, and once more competitive. 
   But ladies and gentlemen of this House, if we do nothing, we face the risk that sometime soon there will be no American auto industry. That will not be good for our national security, it will not be good for our economic security, it will not be good for the psychology of our country. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I urge us, as I urged before when we acted to try to free up credit to prop up the financial industries--so critical to the success of every industry, of every consumer, of every household--to act not as Democrats, not as Republicans. I believe this will be a bipartisan bill. There will be Republicans who vote for this bill and Democrats who will vote for this bill. 
   The administration has worked hard with us. We've worked hard with them to come to agreement. There may be some items that are still not in agreement. But the overwhelming objective of this bill and the result of this bill is agreed to between the administration and ourselves. 
   This bill has the power to protect innumerable American jobs, and its strong safeguards will ensure that we are authorizing anything but a bridge loan to nowhere. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of this legislation, and in closing, again thank BARNEY FRANK, SPENCER BACHUS, and all of the others in the House on both sides, proponents and opponents, who have worked on this bill conscientiously to try to respond to a crisis that confronts our country and that the American public is asking us to help them solve to make their lives better, to bring our country back.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this debate must be somewhat confusing for the American public. First of all, almost every one of us stands and says that we want the alternative minimum tax fixed. We want it fixed because of the presumption of the alternative minimum tax, which I support and which I will not vote to repeal unless we pay for it. I want you to know that I speak as the father of three daughters, as the grandfather of three grandchildren, and as the great-grandfather of one great-granddaughter. I have listened to this debate. I am going to speak about this debate, and I am going to refer to history. My friend Mr. Ryan knows what I am going to say because I have said it before, but I believe the American people need to know this. 
   Let me place it in context. I have served in this body for 26 years. During that time, Republican Presidents have served for 18 of those years. A Democratic President, President Clinton, served for 8 of those years. During the Presidencies of President Reagan, President George Bush and the present President Bush, we have accumulated deficits in America of $4.1 trillion of deficit spending. 
   Now, there is only one person in America who can stop spending in its tracks. Just one. Not me, not anybody on this floor. We need 217 other people to do that with us. But one person can stop spending in its tracks. And in the 26 years that I have been in the Congress of the United States, no President has had a veto of a spending bill  that spent too much overridden. Not one. 
   This President has vetoed no spending bills under Republican Congresses. Not one. No matter how much they spent. And, by the way, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they spent at twice the rate of growth that the Democrats under President Clinton spent. 
   Now, Republicans were in charge of Congress, but they were in charge of everything during the first 6 years of this century. Everything. House, Senate, Presidency. 
   My friend made the observation that neither side had done too well. I would suggest my side has done a lot better. Because under my side in those 8 years of the Clinton administration, we had a $62.9 billion net surplus after 8 years, and we didn't have to raise the national debt one time in the last 4 years after we got the deficits created under the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration down, from a $292 billion operating deficit when we took over to surpluses during the last 4 years, and a straight line of reduction every one of the first 4 years of the Clinton administration. 
   Why? Because we Democrats believe in spend and pay. You simply believe in spend and borrow. You believe that it is a politically wise policy to pursue that ``don't tax the voters, tax the children.'' Tax the children. Delay the ramifications of spending until tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, when the children will have to pay the bill, because, after all, they are not voting. 
   I have heard a lot of wringing of hands about PAYGO. I know you are all waiting to hear me read a quote, so I will read it to you. ``With the other body unable to pass even a budget this year,'' that was referring to a Republican Senate, by the way, ``we were obviously unable to reach an agreement on legislation to extend PAYGO and other budget rules. It is my hope that this can be done next year as part of a normal budget process. I would close by reminding our colleagues and Members that the PAYGO rule contributed to taming of deficits over the past seven years, and it is my hope that a successor to PAYGO can be developed and coupled with caps on discretionary appropriations.'' That quote, of course, comes from Jim Nussle. 
   As a matter of fact, President Bush's administration also said that they were for PAYGO, until they found out that PAYGO applied to cutting revenues. And because they didn't want to stop buying, I say to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, and you knew that you would be constrained in buying if PAYGO applied to your tax cuts, which I supported for the middle-class but not for the skewing of taxes that I saw in your proposals, that you would have to stop spending, because you couldn't pay for it. So you jettisoned PAYGO, a premise that was overwhelmingly adopted by Republicans and I voted for in the 1997 Budget Act, because I believe in balancing our budget. 
   I have served in legislative bodies for almost 40 years, and I have found people who like to vote for spending but don't like to vote for paying. It takes no courage whatsoever, I tell my friends, to take my credit card out of my pocket and put it in there, sign the little slip and think I will never have to pay for it, because, by the way, I will be dead and gone by then and my children will have to pay the debt. That has been referred to by Mr. Portman as an immoral policy, Rob Portman, the former Director of the OMB, a former member of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very, very strong support in favor of this tax cut for millions of Americans. Will there be an offset? There will be. And, as I said, I will not vote to fix the AMT unless we pay for it. Because if we fix the AMT without paying for it, what we will say to people like STENY HOYER and every Member of this House, maybe we have a conflict of interest, because every Member of this House is going to be affected by this if we don't repeal the AMT, for those of us at this income level. 
   So maybe we have a conflict of interest. Maybe we want to save ourselves a little money, but we don't want to pay for it, because raising revenues takes political courage. There is no courage whatsoever in plunging our country into debt, spending and not paying. It is, as Rob Portman said, an immoral policy, lacking in courage and lacking in fiscal responsibility. 
   My friends, we need to pass this bill and give millions of Americans a tax cut and ensure that millions of Americans will not get a tax increase. PAYGO is a policy that demands responsibility. 
   Many of you voted for the bankruptcy bill, as I did. I was criticized by some because we thought that individuals ought to exercise fiscal responsibility in the managing of their finances. I think corporately as a government we ought to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, let no one be mistaken. This is precisely what this legislation offered by Chairman Rangel was designed to do, give a tax cut to millions of Americans and preclude millions of Americans from paying more, and asking other Americans to pay their fair share so those at the bottom of the rung don't have to pay more to defend our country, to educate our children, to keep our families healthy. 
   Mr. Speaker, this tax cut will provide 30 million homeowners with property tax relief. It will help 12 million children by expanding the child tax credit. It will help 4.5 million families better afford college with tuition deductions. It will save 3.4 million teachers money with deductions for classroom expenses. 
   My wife was a teacher. She died 10 1/2 years ago. She was one of the best people that I have ever met in my life, if not the best. Every year, we would spend a couple of hundred dollars, and we could afford it, maybe even a little more than that, to make sure that her kids in her classroom had things that they needed but were not provided. We are going to give teachers a tax cut to do that. Our children will be served and our teachers will be served. 
   In short, this bill will extend tax credits and deductions that will benefit a wide array of Americans and the American economy. And, yes, this legislation helps to restore tax fairness and once again demonstrates that this Democratic majority is committed to fiscal responsibility. 
   Let me restate that figure: 18 years of Republican Presidents, $4.1 trillion of deficit spending. Under Bill Clinton, 8 years, $62.9 billion net surplus. No indebtedness. No indebtedness in the last 4 years. 
   We are now over $9 trillion in debt. This administration has gone from $5.7 trillion to over $9 trillion. Republicans were in control of everything, and spending escalated at twice the rate it did when Bill Clinton was President. 
   My friends, this bill is a fair bill. This bill is responsible. This bill gives tax cuts to millions of Americans and asks some few Americans to pay their fair share. Vote for this bill. It is good for America, it is good for our people, it is the right, and as Rob Portman said, the moral thing to do.

   Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will not be in session so that we can observe Veterans Day in honor of those who have sacrificed for our country, served our country so ably and well, and to remember those who have paid the ultimate price for our freedoms that we enjoy today. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business.

   Under rules, we expect to consider H.R. 3915, Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, and the conference report on H.R. 1429, Improving Head Start Act. 
   In addition, we hope to be able to consider additional conference reports as they become available. And in light of the fact it's our last week before the Thanksgiving break, if there are other items that come to our attention, we will try to move those forward as well. But we don't have notice of those at this point in time.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for that question on the trade bills. We did have a bipartisan vote on the Peru Trade Agreement which incorporated, as we had urged, both worker protections and environmental protections. And with respect to the other three agreements which have been negotiated, Panama, Colombia and South Korea, frankly, we don't yet know. As the gentleman knows, with respect to the agreement with Panama, the complication really doesn't regard the trade agreement as much as it regards the concern that many people have on both sides of the aisle that the Speaker or President of the Panamanian Parliament is under indictment in the United States with an extradition request for the murder of an American soldier. That, obviously, has complicated the consideration of that agreement. 
   With respect to Colombia, frankly, I want to tell the gentleman, I don't expect Colombia to come up until next year or South Korea to come up before next year. We obviously have, after  next week, we hope, a short time left to go, maybe six, seven legislative days. So it would be unrealistic to expect us to be able to move these agreements within that time frame. But if we could resolve, I think, the issue regarding Panama, that might be possible.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his question. I did say that. He's correct. However, the principal proponents of that resolution, obviously, the relationship with Turkey is a very important one for the United States. It is a critical time in the Middle East. Turkey has been, obviously, a great help in some respects, sometimes. And so the principal sponsors of that resolution have written a letter to the Speaker and myself and asked us not to move forward with that resolution at this time. But it is obviously still a matter of great concern to the Speaker, to myself and, frankly, the majority of this House who are sponsors of this resolution. 
   But in answer to the gentleman's question, I do not expect it to move forward any time soon.

So I want to say to my friend it's possible, to facilitate the work. We're going to be talking about that later on today, and maybe even over the weekend, where we are.

I also want to thank you for not only working on this particular piece of legislation with me and with others, but also for the spirit that you bring to trying to work together if that's possible within the context of reaching a compromise, again, if that is possible. So I thank you very much. 
   Also I want to say that while you and I worked very hard together, I think both of us would say that Mariah Sixkiller and Brian Diffell probably worked more together and longer and harder than we did. And I want to thank Brian on your staff for the work that he did, and of course, Mariah Sixkiller on my staff for the work they did, as we worked with all of the individuals and committees who are involved in the jurisdictional matters here. 
   So I thank you for your kind words and I thank you for your efforts. I think that the product that we produced is a product that will be good for the country. And I'm hopeful, as you are, that the Senate will pass it next week and send it to the President for his signature.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman will yield. 
   The committee is working on that now. As the gentleman knows, we discuss this problem all the time. Of course, we had passed a Medicare physicians' reimbursement bill which precluded the 10 percent cut from going into effect, and it provided for a modest increase in the reimbursement rates to physicians. We passed that, of course, as you know, approximately, maybe, a little over a year ago. The Senate did not include it in the SCHIP bill, of which the SCHIP was a part of the CHAMP bill. The only thing they passed was SCHIP, and they indicated to us at that point in time that they would certainly pass the Medicare reimbursement. That has not yet happened. 
   Unfortunately, the failure of that to happen has now put us in a position where we are facing the June 30 expiration date of the authorization and, therefore, the 10 percent reduction. 
   Late yesterday, it was apparent that the Senate would not be able to reach a compromise or at least it had not with Chairman Rangel and Chairman Dingell after discussions--and I don't know how long those discussions took--yesterday with Chairman Bachus, and I don't know whether Senator Grassley was involved in those conversations. 
   In any event, they determined that they needed to come up with legislation for the House to vote on to provide for reimbursement. They're working on that now. I expect it to be filed today, if possible.

Obviously, we passed a bill that had pay-fors in it, which is what you're talking about, some of which were unacceptable to many on your side and to some on our side. 
   Whatever we offer is going to be paid for. Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel, in particular, and his committee are working on that as we speak to see what they can fashion, and we hope that the two-thirds majority necessary to pass a suspension bill will be there--we'll see--but we'll be working on this next week.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I thank the Speaker. I thank the Speaker not only for giving me the responsibility for trying to work with some extraordinarily talented people but also for having the courage to lead and the courage to express her convictions. 
   And I want, at the outset, to share her view that every Member who has spoken on this floor has spoken out of a sense of conviction and out of a sense of responsibility to the Constitution of the United States and to the protection of our great Nation and our great people. 
   Mr. Reyes, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Hoekstra, Mr. Smith have all worked to come together, realizing that there were significant differences. Those four have been assisted by some extraordinary people, and at the outset, I want to mention them. 
   First of all, I want to mention my own staff without whom I think we would not be at this day. She sits on the floor. She worked for my colleague and dear friend Senator Paul Sarbanes for a number of years. One of the benefits of Senator Sarbanes retiring was that she came to my staff. Mariah Sixkiller has expended too much time, perhaps, but with great talent and great ability to reach this day. Thank you, Mariah Sixkiller. 
   I want to thank Chairman Conyers because Chairman Conyers, as you've heard on the floor, has been conflicted but he has been focused on the necessity to respond to issues that are real and also to help us move forward so that we did not, in the minds of many of us, have a bill pass that we thought was unacceptable, a bill passed by the Senate with 68 of 100 votes. We would not be here, in my opinion, without Chairman Conyers' leadership, not because he supports this alternative, but because he saw the ability to work together. 
   I want to thank his staff, Lou DeBaca, Perry Apelbaum. And Lou DeBaca, in particular, who sat for hours and hours and hours in a room trying to reach agreement as we made compromises. Mr. Reyes' staff, Mike Delaney, the staff director. Jeremy Bash. Jeremy Bash did extraordinary work. Jeremy Bash was hired by the former Chair of the Intelligence Committee, Jane Harman. 
   Jane Harman is probably as knowledgeable as almost anybody on this floor, other than perhaps the Speaker who served on the Intelligence Committee longer than anybody in this House. Jane Harman's leadership, concern, focus on constitutional rights, focus on the security of our country, was outstanding. She played a significant role in trying to get us to this day.     
   Eric Greenwald of Mr. Reyes' staff also played a significant role. 
   Without Mike Sheehy and Joe Onek of the Speaker's staff, we would not be here today. We would not have reached the good compromises that we reached. Joe Onek and Mike Sheehy, if they were writing this bill, would have written a different bill, much closer to what we passed on our side of the aisle and sent to the Senate, which they rejected. Mike Sheehy has served the House and the Speaker for a very long time in the intelligence field. 
   I want to thank Senator Rockefeller. We would not be here today on this floor if it were not for Senator Rockefeller. Senator Rockefeller very early on had discussions with me about what could they do to try to move towards the bill that we passed. He made some suggestions. Those suggestions are in this bill today. He facilitated our actions. Andy Johnson, Mike Davidson, Alissa Starzak of his staff were very, very helpful. 
   Senator Bond, Senator Bond and I did not see necessarily eye-to-eye on these issues as we began, but at the end, we came to an agreement. Louis Tucker and Jack Livinston of his staff were very helpful. 
   Chairman Hoekstra, or former Chairman Hoekstra, now Ranking Member Hoekstra, I want to thank Chairman Hoekstra, but particularly, I want to thank Chris Donessa who was very helpful, gave us great assistance and advice. 
   Lamar Smith and Caroline Lynch of his staff, thank you very much for your efforts as you sat in that room, as we all sat around, every one of the committees sat around the table, as we came to the final agreement. 
   Then I want to thank, of course, Jen Stewart and the minority leader, without whom we could not have gotten to this day. 
   Lastly, I want to thank my friend. There's an article going to be written. It's going to speculate whether or not he and I hurt one another by saying the other is his friend. I don't think that's the case. I said that Roy Blunt and I often disagree on substantive issues, but what we agree on very strongly is that this House needs to sit down and talk to one another and try to reach resolution on difficult issues, not hard-to-reach compromise on easy issues. It's on the difficult issues. 
   Roy Blunt is a man of this House, who cares about this House, who cares about this country. And he cares about drafting legislation that can be agreed upon by a broad section of this House and the American people. He has an extraordinary staff of Brian Diffell, who I want to thank for his efforts, but in particular, I want to thank Roy Blunt for his friendship, for his integrity, and for his willingness to take risks to reach compromise. Thank you, Roy. 
   Madam Speaker, today we conclude one step in a long, continuing process. Just under a year ago, the House came under great pressure from the administration and the Senate to pass the Protect America Act, a bill I could not support and spoke out against for its lack of civil liberties protections. 
   Since then, there have been other attempts to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: first, the RESTORE Act passed by the House last November with my strong support, with Mr. Conyers' strong support, Mr. Reyes' strong support, and the support of this House; that was followed by the Senate bill which passed, as I said earlier, with 68 votes in February; and most recently, the FISA Amendments Act, passed by the House last March. I supported that bill as well. I think it was a better bill. It would be my alternative. It was our alternative on this side of the aisle, but it was not the consensus alternative, and we needed to reach consensus to move forward. 
   I was proud to support the two House bills, which I believe struck the right balance between giving our intelligence community the tools to go after those who seek to harm and protecting the constitutional rights of American citizens. 
   Today, I stand in support of a different kind of bill, a compromise. To be clear, this is not the bill that I would have written or that perhaps anybody individually on this floor would have written. However, in our legislative process, no one gets everything he or she wants. Different parties, often with deeply competing interests, come together here to produce a consensus product, where each side gives and takes. I don't believe we've given on the ultimate principles on either side. 
   Over the past few months, I've been involved in almost daily discussions with the stakeholders on this important issue, Members in both Chambers, in both parties, as well as outside organizations and experts. I want to thank all of the outside organizations, whether they agree with our product or do not. Their contribution has been an important one. I particularly want to thank those who take very unpopular  positions to protect the rights of perhaps just one of us among the 300 million, who in the land of the free and the home of the brave deserve to have that one individual right protected, and I appreciate their efforts to ensure that that country remains that kind of country. 
   Together, we have worked to develop a bill that strikes a sound balance. This measure provides the intelligence community with the strong authority to surveil foreign terrorists who seek to harm this country and our people. As the Speaker said, that is our responsibility, and we intend to meet it. 
   It provides for enhanced civil liberties protections for Americans and insists on meaningful judicial scrutiny. 
   It includes critical new oversight and accountability requirements that both address the President's warrantless surveillance program and ensures that any surveillance going forward comports with the fourth amendment and will be closely monitored by the Congress. 
   Of vital importance, my colleagues, this legislation makes clear that FISA is the exclusive means by which the government may conduct surveillance, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Contrary to the administration's previous actions, in which it did not comply with the FISA statute, this statute makes it very clear, this and this alone is the process through which we will intercept communications, an issue of great importance to the Speaker, as she has said. 
   Notably, this bill does not address or excuse any actions by the government or government officials related to the President's warrantless surveillance program, nor does it include any statement by the Congress or conclusion on the legality of that program. 
   Indeed, it mandates for the first time ever a robust accounting by the Inspectors General of the warrantless surveillance program, which Congress will receive and act on. 
   Madam Speaker, in closing, let me say again, this bill is a compromise, but in my opinion, it is a compromise worth supporting. And the conclusions drawn by editorials in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post over the last 2 days reflect this compromise. 
   Today, for example, the Washington Post recognized that this is a reasonable effort to strike a compromise, stating: ``Striking the balance between liberties and security is never easy, and the new FISA bill is not perfect. But it is a vast improvement over the original law and over the earlier, rushed attempts to revise that law.'' 
   As I said at the beginning, this bill is one step in a long, continuing process of updating this critical legislation, ensuring that our national security and our civil liberties are both protected. 
   This legislation sunsets at the end of 2012, and it's imperative that we scrutinize its implementation in the future and make any necessary changes. I believe we have the best bill before us that we could possibly get in the current environment. It is a significant improvement over the Senate-passed bill and, I suggest, existing law. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the years ahead to ensure that both our national security and our civil liberties are protected. That is our responsibility. That is our pledge to our constituents. I urge passage of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to the chairman of the committee. He is an extraordinary individual whom I have known for four decades. He will do an excellent job. We lament the loss, however, of the two individuals for whom this bill is named. 
   I want to congratulate my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well for her leadership, and I want to associate myself generally with the remarks of the previous speaker. And I think it is emblematic of the partnership that we have, not only with the administration, but on both sides of the aisle as it relates to this moral, as well as health, issue, and I thank the gentleman for his comments. 
   Madam Chairman, 5 years ago, the United States made an unprecedented commitment to the people of the world who suffer from HIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases. We pledged $15 billion, and with that funding, we have provided life-saving drugs to almost a million and a half people. We facilitated care for over 2 million orphans and vulnerable children and provided mother-to-child transmission prevention services during more than 6 million pregnancies. 
   We have played a very real role in helping to transform HIV from a death sentence to a manageable disease. 
   And, Madam Chairman, as I said 5 years ago when we first passed this legislation, we must recognize that our Nation and each one of us has a moral obligation and a national security interest, as has been spoken of, in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as malaria and tuberculosis. 
   Today, with this legislation, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act, we build on and increase our commitment to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
   Through this legislation, we make a $50 billion contribution to the fight to eradicate HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In addition to expanding our prior efforts, this carefully negotiated legislation will strengthen HIV-related healthcare delivery systems and increase health workforce capacities; foster stronger relationships between HIV/AIDS initiatives and other support programs, including those that promote better nutrition and education; allow HIV/AIDS testing and counseling to be provided in the United States bilateral family planning programs, and it finances prevention and treatment programs targeting women and girls. 
   This bill, Madam Chairman, also eliminates an ineffective requirement: that one-third of PEPFAR prevention funds be spent on abstinence. Instead, we have directed the administration to create a balanced approach requiring behavioral change programs to receive 50 percent of the funds devoted to the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV, and in addition, we require the administration to report to Congress if programs in nations where the epidemic has become generalized do not adhere to this balanced approach. This legislation represents both commitment and compromise. 
   It will not make everyone happy, but it does signal to the international community that the United States recognizes and accepts our moral obligation to act. 
   Last year alone, 2.5 million people contracted HIV, roughly 6,800 people per day. Last year alone, 2.1 million people died of HIV. Global AIDS is a problem too large to fall prey to political sport. 
   My very good friend, the late Chairman Lantos, noted 5 years ago that this health care crisis ruins families, communities, and indeed, whole nations, fueling violence and bloodshed across borders. And thus, it is a global challenge that demands a global humanitarian response with the United States in the lead. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a very good bill. It builds on proven outcomes, and it deserves the support of the Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   And again, I congratulate Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen on their leadership on this effort.

   Mr. HOYER. We passed the Military Construction bill here handily through the House. It has passed the Senate. We want to get a conference finished. We know the staff is working on that. We hope to go to conference very soon. We certainly want to pass that bill in the near term, and other appropriations bills are being preconferenced as well as getting ready to go to conference. 
   I say to the gentleman, as you know, we passed bills here in a relatively timely fashion, all by August, and I want to see those bills moved and sent to the President. We hope to do that as soon as we can. We are working on it.

   Mr. HOYER. We want to pass that bill. The bill that passed out of the House is the best bill that's passed out of the House for veterans since 77 years ago when the Veterans' Administration was formed. We are very proud of that bill. It had overwhelming bipartisan support. We think it is an excellent bill. We want to see it signed by the President. 
   I will observe, though, Mr. Blunt, that I can't remember a time that I have served here over the last 26 years where a President said, if you are not exactly at my number, I will veto all of your bills. That has put a real crimp in the appropriations process of trying to figure out how to get this process done on bills that, for the most part, have been very strongly supported. 
   In the Senate, there hasn't been under, I think, 71 votes or 72 votes for any of the appropriations bills they have passed. We have had an average of 285 votes for the bills we have passed, some less, some more, so that the Congress has passed its bills and with relative ease that it's considered on the floor, but the President continues to say he is going to veto bills if we go anything over what he has told us to do. 
   Very frankly, we think under article I of the Constitution, it's our prerogative to fund the priorities that we believe are important for our country. We have done that, and we are hopeful. I have had discussions with the White House about the possibility of compromise. Mr. Obey has had conversations, and we do not have compromise yet on that position. So I tell my friend that that has made it somewhat more difficult for us to do. 
   If it's unprecedented that we haven't passed one before October, I tell the gentleman, without having checked the records, I can't remember a President, certainly not this President, ever saying that to previous Congresses, which, by the way, as you know, for at least 4 years cut defense spending below what the President asked for and increased domestic spending above what he asked for. We have not done that. As a matter of fact, we have enhanced the President's request on the Defense appropriation bill, as you know, for MRAPs and for Afghanistan and for other items that we thought were necessary. So we are over the President's number.     
   But we're working on it. We hope to get those to the President as soon as possible, and we're certainly hopeful that he will sign the bills that we send him. 
   Thank you for yielding.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't know the paper to which you refer. However, I know what I've told the chairmen so I would be glad to relate it to our Members for their planning purposes. 
   The Senate decided to be out the last 2 weeks of November, obviously the last week being Thanksgiving or I guess it's the next to last week being Thanksgiving, and we will be out that week because the Senate won't be in. And frankly, after the 16th, what I've told the committee chairmen is that the only business that I will schedule time for will be the finishing of business that we've already initiated and that we are getting back from the Senate, whether it's appropriations bills or other conference reports on authorization bills, Energy being one. We might be able to do that prior to the 16th. But if not, Energy would certainly be one of those bills. There would be others that would fall in that category, but there would be no initiated legislation out of the House after the 16th of November. 
   I have then told Members, as you refer to, and the chairman has referred to, that it will be my intention in December to schedule us the first Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, that's the 4th, 5th and 6th of December. And then, if necessary, Members ought to keep their calendars flexible for the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the next week. 
   Now, the Speaker and I both have talked to the leader in the Senate, hopeful that by the 6th of December we can finish our business. But, as you well know, and I'm more empathetic with your pain every day that you experienced, we need to make plans for contingencies because we meet contingencies on a regular basis. So that's the second week. 
   But the point, for planning, is that I do not intend to schedule Mondays or Fridays in December.

   Mr. HOYER. The gentleman is correct. Obviously, there are contingencies on which, particularly I think a Friday, not so much on a Monday, on a Friday. We have not yet decided when, for instance, if we need a CR, as is quite likely, when that CR will end. And, obviously, we're not going to, we have no intention, and I know I talked to the President, the President has no intention of shutting down the government. So we need some flexibility for those days for that contingency. We have no intention of being certainly at home and having the government shut down. We need to reach accommodation on that. 
   But, generally speaking, those would be the six days that I want to have us try to be available. The first three I'm sure we're going to be here. The second three I hope we're not here, but I don't want Members to schedule themselves. 
   I might make one additional announcement that might be helpful to Members. We have decided that we will be coming back after the Christmas/New Year's break on the 15th of January; that's a Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. on the 15th.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, it is Thursday and it is a getaway day. I know everybody is concerned, because you talk to me from both sides of the aisle all the time about it, so I am well aware that people want to get out. 
   I will be asking, and that is why I want to say this now, I will be asking the presiding officers to keep our votes to no more than 2 minutes after the votes are to close, whether it is a 15-minute vote or a 5-minute vote. I think that will facilitate, hopefully, getting our work done. 
   The reason I say it now, I want everybody to be on notice that we intend to do that so we don't catch you. What the pattern has been increasingly is that when we get to ``zero,'' there are almost invariably 175 Members who have not voted. I do it and I am sure everybody else does it. You look at the screen and you see 170 Members haven't voted, and you have plenty of time. I understand that. I understand it because that is what I do. 
   The only way for us to overcome that is that 2 minutes after the vote, 17 minutes, we will close the vote. That will mean some of you may miss the votes and you will be angry with me. I want you to know ahead of time that I understand you will be angry with me, but at least I am telling you that is what our intention is to do.

   Mr. HOYER. Scheduling the House, as my good friend, ROY BLUNT, and I have discussed, is very difficult. It is very difficult because we have 435 Members. Obviously, all of us have responsibilities. We have families and we have issues that happen within our districts that require us from time to time to be in our districts. 
   All of the California Members who talked to me, and some on the Republican side talked to me and some on the Democratic side talked to me, I urged them to be in California. That's where I would be. If I had a wildfire, a flood or a tornado in my district, I would be in my district. 
   Today's vote on SCHIP, which is the only vote we will have when we get to it, is not in my opinion in doubt and would not be affected by the absences we may have. 
   On this vote there were 55 people not voting. Obviously, there are not 55 people in California. We have a number of the Californians here. There are representations on your side of the aisle that there are five or six Californians who might be there, and there are some on our side from Southern California who will also be there. Now, on the average day, we have 10 Members who are not here, give or take. Some for illness reasons and others for good reasons where they have determined they need to be someplace else. It is obvious we cannot cancel votes on those days. 
   I will tell my friend that everybody knows we are not here tomorrow, and we are going to be hopefully through relatively early today. I don't know that there is something happening today that won't be true tomorrow. I do know that there is concern about proceeding on the SCHIP bill. I have made it clear, in August I made it clear that we have an agenda to accomplish. If we were meeting Friday, that might be a different story, but we are not meeting Friday. So tomorrow is available, Saturday is available, Sunday, Monday is available. I believe that Members ought to be with their constituents.     
   I don't believe they're going out there to fight the fire. They're going out to be with their constituents. That is appropriate. My point I think is clear. My point is clear. 
   The objectives of the Members who are not here are understandable and appropriate, but what is not appropriate is for me to be put in the position or anybody who schedules on either side of the aisle to be put in the position of having our legislative process stopped when we essentially have only a few hours left to go and important legislation to consider.

   Mr. HOYER. I want everybody to know that we're coming back on Monday. I don't want anybody to be confused that we're coming back on Monday at 6:30; and we will not be here, I will be announcing later today, the next Friday, a week from tomorrow. 
   Let me say to my friend that, as I said, I discussed with your leadership the difficulty of scheduling, not this particular item, although this was discussed, and the request was made. 
   Every Member of this body knows that 435 people, as I said, everybody has very important things they have to do from time to time and that are appropriate to do on behalf of their constituents on behalf of fulfilling their duties. We missed unavoidably 2 legislative days as a result of the tragic deaths of two of our Members, which was inevitable, and we obviously appropriately canceled sessions on those days. 
   This bill that we are considering is a very important bill. It needs to pass the House. It needs to pass the Senate. It needs to go to the President, and it needs to come back here. We have 3 weeks left to go between now and the 16th of November, to which the gentleman referred. 
   The gentleman is well aware, I know my Republican colleagues in leadership are well aware, of how long it takes to get things through the Senate, for reasons that we all understand in terms of their necessity to get the appropriate votes. 
   As a result, the time left to us is very short, and to not proceed today and to push this off till next week then pushes off to the week following when the Senate can consider this legislation, which then pushes it off to the last week that we'll be here for Presidential action. All of that is a constraint on the flexibility of scheduling. 
   And again I will say that I understand absolutely the desire of the Californians to be where they are. I think it's appropriate to be where they are. My only point is that we're not meeting all week. There is some flexibility. They chose to go today. I do not criticize that decision on either side of the aisle. I simply say that it was not in consideration of, obviously, the business that we have to get done. 
   And again I reiterate, in a collegial body, if I thought that the absence of your Members or our Members would make a difference on the outcome, but this bill had an overwhelming vote when it initially passed, an overwhelming vote, not the two-thirds, but an overwhelming vote. So I do not believe the absences of either party's Members will impact on the outcome of this vote. So I don't think we're prejudicing the outcome of the vote in any way. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Washington State.

Reclaiming my time, there are 13 Californians as I understand it who are not here, and that's a significant number, so I do not diminish the number; but I don't want anybody to belabor the 55 to which I referred who did not vote. I don't know where the other 35 Members were or are. I know there's a very important hearing going on, I haven't looked at the list expansively, a very important hearing going on that people don't want to have go on. I understand that. 
   But if we delay the vote, then we might as well delay the bill because we will not get it moving towards the Senate and allow the Senate to act in a timely fashion. That's the problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   This is a good day. This is a good day because we have another opportunity to extend to children, 4 million of whom are not covered by health insurance, coverage. 
   I don't know how many families that is, but it's obviously millions of families who will have the confidence that if their child gets sick, they will have insurance. They can access health care. They can try to make their children well. 
   I want to refer briefly to my friend Mr. Boehner's comments because I agree with him that the American public expected us to come here and work together. But let us review this legislative process. 
   First of all, we had committee hearings. I want to tell my friend from Texas, those committee hearings were difficult. We didn't really get to the committee hearings and committee markups that we wanted to have. I think that's unfortunate. That was not our fault, I suggest to you. 
   Secondly, let me say that we passed a major bill through this House, approximately $90 billion. It dealt with a number of subjects, including doctor reimbursements so that they would continue to serve those who are poor under Medicaid and, indeed, under Medicare, so the reimbursement levels under Medicare would be appropriate. 
   We dealt with rural hospitals so that they would be reimbursed at levels that allowed them to continue to serve our rural communities. We dealt with some other issues. And, yes, we dealt with children's health insurance. 
   That bill went to the Senate. And there were a lot of Members of your party who didn't like the expansive bill. But before it got there, you offered a motion to recommit on our bill. You cut our spending cuts, you did not agree with those, but you adopted the revenues from the tax increase in cigarettes in your motion to recommit. Most of you, perhaps not all, but most of you voted for that motion to recommit. So this funding source is one that we have agreed to and everybody has voted for. 
   When it got to the Senate, we made a tremendous compromise. And we went from a $90 billion bill covering rural hospitals and doctors' reimbursement and poor people who would have been marginalized, perhaps, by the cuts to Medicare Advantage. And we made a compromise, mainly with Republicans in the Senate who felt that they wanted a more restricted bill. So that bill that is confronting us now is now a $35 billion bill, a very substantial compromise, I will suggest to you. 
   That bill then passed the Senate, went to the President, he vetoed it, it came back here, and you made a determination, some of you, not to vote to override the President's veto. So those 4 million children don't yet have a health insurance bill. 
   Then 38 of you wrote to the Speaker and said that you wanted to see certain changes. We addressed that. We addressed it very substantively, we addressed it very carefully, and we addressed it in a bipartisan way. And because this bill has to go through the Senate, we then engaged Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley so that it would not be simply Democrats saying, well, we'll take this and not that. And it was a very considered judgment applied, and almost all of the points raised in that letter were addressed. 
   Now, I had the opportunity this morning to meet with, not all 38, but the majority of those 38. Obviously they were correct that there was not more time to discuss this. I think that was a fair analysis. But the fact of the matter is that careful attention and compromise was taken. 
   Mr. Boehner is correct, I met with Mr. Boehner and Mr. Blunt. We have a good relationship; we have the ability to talk. But I will tell you that one of the indications I had was that those changes would not affect at least one of those votes because, philosophically, that leader is not for this bill. I understand that, that's a fair position to take. We're for this bill. We want to see this bill go forward. 
   But I will say to my friends on this side of the aisle, on the Republican side of the aisle, I want to continue to work with those who really want to see, as that letter of 38 said, reauthorization effected because that's what we want to see. And we will continue to work  with you. This bill will go to the Senate; it will be considered there in the Senate. 
   We have significant, concrete changes to the legislation vetoed by President Bush, changes that are designed to address the concerns expressed by the President and by a number of Republican Members. We listened carefully to the criticisms of the vetoed bill. We reviewed the letter, as I've said, that the 38 Republicans sent to the President, as well as other letters that were distributed. I misspoke, I said it was sent to the Speaker. I observe only that apparently you wanted to negotiate with the President. 
   We also worked closely with Senators Grassley and Hatch, who met extensively with House Republicans. The bottom line is this: we have taken a bipartisan compromise that was strongly supported by the American people and by the overwhelming Members of both Houses of the Congress of the United States and worked to make it an even stronger bipartisan compromise. 
   Specifically, this legislation clarifies that it targets low-income children. That was one of the concerns. The compromises we have reached in the legislative language appended to the legislation today do, in fact, accomplish that objective. Prohibiting CHIP coverage above 300 percent of the Federal poverty level that the President talked a lot about, talked about the 83,000, we have prevented that. We said that is not going to happen.     
   It clarifies that illegal immigrants are not eligible for coverage under CHIP. I have not reviewed the prescription drug bill that you passed, but the legislation, I think, in this bill is stronger on that issue. 
   It clarifies that this bill is focused on children. That was a legitimate objection raised on your side of the aisle. We took that into consideration because we believed it was something we should respond to because that was our intent, to focus on children. As a result, we have phased out coverage for childless adults over 1 year, not 2. Some said that this is just tweaking. To have the time of phaseout, it seems to me, is a very significant change. 
   And, it clarifies that this bill seeks to minimize the number of children moving from private insurance to CHIP, ``crowd-out,'' requiring all States to develop plans and implement recommended best practices for minimizing so-called ``crowd-out.'' 
   We think we tried to respond, and we did respond, we believe, to the concerns you raised. These are significant, concrete changes, changes that neither affect nor undermine our principal objective and commitment: to ensure that 10 million American children from low-income working families who are eligible for coverage under CHIP guidelines today can participate in this successful program. 
   I, again, remind my colleagues that this indeed was the stated objective of the President of the United States, when, at the Republican National Convention in 2004, he promised, in seeking reelection by the American public, he promised this: ``In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions,'' with an S, ``millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs.'' He went on to say this: ``We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' 
   Unfortunately, what stands between the children and the health care they need is the President's veto. We continue to try to achieve the President's expressed objective. I urge my colleagues, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Boehner is correct. This is not a partisan issue. There is not a Member on your side of the aisle that doesn't care about our children. There is not a Member on our side of the aisle that doesn't care about our children. We have an opportunity to add 4 million children to the health coverage of our country, just as the President said he wanted to do. 
   I urge you to stand with the bipartisan majorities in Congress, including 45 House Republicans and 18 Senate Republicans who voted for the first CHIP bill. This bill, in some ways, in my opinion, is a better bill for the suggestions made from your side of the aisle. 
   Stand with the States' Governors, the American Medical Association, the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the pharmaceutical companies, nurses, children's advocates and others who support this bill. Stand with the American people, 81 percent of whom support this legislation. Stand with the 10 million American children who will receive the health coverage they need and deserve under this legislation. 
   This bipartisan compromise addresses your concerns. 
   Let us give ``yes'' for an answer to America's children. Vote for this bill. It is good for America. It is good for our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR THE GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX DERBY -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, today I rise as a proud sponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 311, legislation which will allow the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold the 67th Annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby on the grounds of the United States Capitol on June 22nd. 
   Soap Box Derby racing in our Nation's Capital has a long and rich tradition. In 1938, Norman Rocca beat out 223 other racers to win the Inaugural Greater Washington Soap Box Derby, which was held on New Hampshire Avenue. Over the years, thousands of the region's young people have participated in this great race. 
   Although the location has moved from the original site on New Hampshire Avenue to Capitol Hill, with stops on Massachusetts Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and Eastern Avenue along the way, the essence of the race has remained the same; homemade, gravity-powered cars, the spirit of competition, and the pure joy of racing. Community groups, police departments, fire departments and other sponsors sponsor children each year, children who may not otherwise be able to participate. 
   The Soap Box Derby is not simply a race, Madam Speaker; it is an enriching way to reach out to our youth and teach them the importance of community, responsibility, hard work and innovation. 
   The Soap Box Derby consists of dozens of drivers, both boys and girls, ranging in age from 8 to 17. These racers are divided into three divisions; stock, super stock and masters. The local winners of each division will automatically qualify to compete with racers from around the world in the 71st All-American Soap Box Derby in Akron, Ohio, on July 26th. 
   Madam Speaker, this event has been called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world.'' It is an excellent opportunity for contestants from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia to learn basic building skills while gaining a real sense of accomplishment. 
   Further, I hope that this year's winner from the Greater Washington area will have the same success as one of last year's participants, Ms. Kacie Rader. Kacie's win in Washington was only the beginning. Not only is Kacie a constituent and a neighbor, she also is the 2007 All-American Soap Box Derby Masters Division champion. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to join with me and the other original cosponsors, Representatives Frank Wolf, Jim Moran, Eleanor Holmes Norton and Chris Van Hollen, in supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the moment of truth has arrived. And now, our Republican friends have a very clear choice that they must make. They can stand with 10 million American kids who need, deserve and currently are eligible for health insurance under the CHIP program. 
   They can stand with the bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate who supported compromise legislation to reauthorize CHIP, including 18 Republican Senators and 45 House Republicans. 
   They can stand with the States' Governors, the American Medical Association, the Association of Health Insurance Plans, pharmaceutical companies, nurses, children's advocates. And most important, they can stand with the American people, 81 percent of whom support expanding the CHIP program to cover more low-income children, according to a just-released CBS News poll. 
   This poll, of course, was taken long after the American people knew exactly what the terms of this bill are all about. Eighty-one percent, including a large, over two-thirds majority of independents and including over 60 percent of the Republicans polled, believe that we ought to move forward on this bill. 
   Or, Madam Speaker, House Republicans can choose today to stand with President Bush, who earlier this month broke his own campaign promise to extend insurance coverage under CHIP to millions of additional low-income American children, low-income American children. 
   They can choose to stand with President Bush, who continues to make inaccurate and misleading claims about the bipartisan bill that he has vetoed; claims that have been repudiated by Senators HATCH, GRASSLEY, ROBERTS and many other Republicans. 
   Let me remind my Republican colleagues, who I believe want to help children, as the gentleman who preceded me said, here is what President Bush told the American people 3 years ago when he was seeking their votes for re-election at the Republican National Convention, the President of the United States, 2004, seeking re-election, promising what he would do: ``In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of children who are eligible but not signed up for government health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention or information to stand between these children and the health care they need.'' 
   That is what President Bush said in 2004 when he was seeking the votes of the American people for re-election. Yet, the President's own proposal that he has made this year would force nearly 1 million children from low-income families who are participating in CHIP to be dropped from the present CHIP program. So his proposal not only does not add the millions that he promised to add in 2004, but it drops over 830,000 children. 
   In sharp contrast, Madam Speaker, through this bipartisan compromise this Congress has done exactly what the President said he would do if re-elected. 
   The American people have heard both sides of this issue, and they have disagreed with the President. They stand with America's children, and so must this Congress. 
   I urge my Republican colleagues, and the reason I say I urge my Republican colleagues, because we believe that there are very few, if any, Democrats who will not vote with the children this day.  
   Look at the facts. Look into your hearts. Look beyond partisanship and politics. Look at the pictures of your loved ones back in your office and ask, what if they were the ones today who needed health insurance? 
   Luckily, our children are covered. Our children are covered.     
   But think of the millions of children to whom President Bush referred to in 2004 that he promised to add to this critical program. 
   This, I suggest to all of us, is a defining moment for the Congress of the United States. Will we, as the Founding Fathers contemplated, exercise the policymaking authority, or will we once again crumble, complicit in the President's failure to respond to the views of the American public and to our children? 
   My friends on both sides of the aisle, let us come together. Let us come together and do the right thing for our children and for our Nation. Let's override the President's unjustified veto of this compromise, bipartisan legislation. Let us ensure that 10 million low-income children have the health care coverage they need and deserve. This will not be a partisan victory if we override this veto. It will be a victory for our children and for the President's promise. 
   Vote to override this veto. Vote for our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman, and I congratulate him for the great work that he is doing. This is a critical bill that we consider today. And, as he has pointed out, we have had a number of bills dealing with homeland security on the floor. 
   I also want to thank the ranking member for his leadership both in this Congress and in the past Congress on this issue. I think the American people are advantaged by having two people of real substance who care about this issue working together, even though from time to time, as the gentleman has pointed out, there are disagreements. He had the same problems that the chairman is having, and we are trying to work through those problems. And I certainly am going to support the manager's amendment as he tries to work this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Thompson, for all his hard work on this very, very important authorization bill. 
   The highest duty of our government is to protect the American people, to secure our homeland and to defend our national security. Unfortunately, since the horrific terrorist attacks on our Nation on September 11 opened our eyes and exposed our vulnerabilities, we have not done enough to protect our homeland. As Tom Kean, the former Republican Governor of New Jersey and cochair of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission stated last August, ``We are not protecting our own people in this country. The government is not doing its job.'' 
   Yesterday's arrest of six men who apparently were plotting to attack and kill soldiers in Fort Dix in New Jersey is a stark reminder that we cannot, we must not let down our guard; that we must remain vigilant. 
   This legislation, which I believe will receive strong bipartisan support, is a critical step in the right direction. Among other things, this bill authorizes $39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008, which is $2.1 billion in addition for our homeland security that was asked for by the President. It restores the President's 52 percent cut to the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which helps first responders to prevent, prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism. It restores the President's 55 percent cut in firefighter assistance grants. It restores the elimination of the local law enforcement terrorism prevention program and restores the elimination of the SAFER, which is the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response program. I want to thank the chairman for doing that and congratulate him on his leadership because, as the ranking member pointed out, this bill was reported out unanimously. It was a joint effort and a very important one at that. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, this legislation contains strong accountability measures aimed at strengthening and streamlining management of the Department of Homeland Security, which has struggled with its management challenges; and it includes provisions to improve information sharing, to enhance bioterrorism preparedness and to eliminate the Department's authority to establish its own personnel management system. 
   Mr. Chairman, ever since the Department of Homeland Security was created, an effort which I opposed because I thought that would create a Department too large and too diverse to manage well, frankly, I think my concerns have been evidenced. It is the challenge of this committee, now that we have created the Department, to ensure that in fact it does act in an efficient manner to protect our homeland. But I have been concerned about the efficacy of consolidating 22 agencies and 170,000 people into one Department. However, since the Congress chose to create this new Department, it is our duty, as I said, to ensure that it has the resources it needs to do its job as effectively as possible and to ensure that the Department is well managed. 
   This legislation, Mr. Chairman, by focusing on oversight and management is a critical response to the issues and problems that have been encountered at the Department since its creation. 
   I want to again congratulate Mr. Thompson, who is doing such an excellent job of leading this committee, and Mr. King, who brings a focus for the country as opposed to a partisan focus to this work with Mr. Thompson. I want to congratulate them both.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   On Monday, Mr. Speaker, the House will not be in session so that Members can join with their communities in observance of the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour debate and at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. You will be getting notice of those, hopefully, by the end of the day. We will consider several bills under suspension. There will be no votes before 6:30 p.m., as has been our practice. 
   On Wednesday and the balance of the week, the House will meet at 10 a.m., although let me say to my friend that I may well be requesting again, as I did for today, unanimous consent that we meet at 9 on Friday. It has historically been the practice to wait until about May, the middle of May, when we get into heavy legislative business, to meet at 10 on Fridays if we were in on Fridays. My view is, however, and I want to say to all the Members, that it will be my intent to make every effort possible to have us adjourn on Fridays prior to or no later than 2 p.m. in consideration of Members' need to get back to their districts where they have events that are going on where they need to be. I want to tell my friend that we will, therefore, quite possibly ask for unanimous consent to come in at 9 rather than 10 next Friday. 
   In addition to other Suspension Calendar business, and all suspension bills, as I said, will be announced later today, the House will consider H.R. 5, a bill to cut in half the interest rates on student loans; and H.R. 6, a renewable energy bill. 
   In addition to that, I want to give notice to the House, and I have discussed this with Mr. Blunt and have discussed it with the leader, Mr. Boehner, that Nancy Boyda of Kansas is introducing a bill which will provide that Members who commit felonies while Members of Congress and in the course of their duties will be precluded from receiving pensions.     
   If they are receiving pensions, they will have those pensions discontinued. 
   That is obviously legislation which I think is appropriate. We have passed similar legislation that the majority proposed in the past. I believe this will pass with bipartisan support. 
   Mr. Boehner and I and Mr. Blunt all agree we need to look at this carefully, even though it has already passed, and so we have talked to Ms. Slaughter from the Rules Committee, and we will speak to Mr. Dreier and give him notice. I have not personally spoken with Mr. Dreier. But they will be considering this legislation on Wednesday, and we expect to have this bill on the floor next Friday. 
   In addition, it is quite possible again the House Administration Committee, and I am perhaps anticipating Mr. Blunt's question, has jurisdiction over the Page Board, we will also have, we hope, on the floor on Friday legislation that will deal with the Page Board, oversight of the page system, and the various procedures we can put in place to make sure that our pages are protected and treated with the respect and care that they deserve and that their parents expect. 
   I tell my friend, that is the anticipated schedule for next week. As I said, we will make every effort and it will be my very strong commitment to the Members that every effort will be made to adjourn on Friday no later than 2 p.m.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman would yield, it is an important issue; you are correct. I believe a number of committees have already considered this legislation carefully. The issue is not new. What we want to ensure, Mr. Whip, is that the legislation is properly drawn and drafted because obviously it is an important piece of legislation with serious consequences, and we want to make sure that it is done properly. 
   The Rules Committee, in answer to your second question, we do believe that the Rules Committee can consider this and will consider the work that has been done by other committees because again this subject matter is something we have already considered. We believe it is important to move this matter early in the session so the public has confidence that there are consequences. There are not only consequences in terms of criminal convictions which we have seen, but also consequences in terms of the pensions that are earned during the performance of your duties, and that the American taxpayer is not happy with pensions being paid to those who have abused their oath of office and their responsibilities to the American public. 
   But the gentleman is correct, we have just given notice; but we do have Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Wednesday we will consider that, and then you will have another 48 hours or thereabouts before it comes to the floor. 
   I am hopeful that we will work together on this. I think we share the view that this is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about making sure that Members comport themselves properly; and if they do not, that there are consequences. And I think then we can assure the taxpayer that they will not be subsidizing, through pensions, wrongdoers who fail to meet their duties under the Constitution.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman would yield, let me say with respect to the specific question on American Samoa, as the gentleman undoubtedly knows, the minimum wage in American Samoa, unlike the Marianas or Guam, is set by the Department of Labor and Industry Committee so that it 
   is determined in a different way than the others, including our States. 
   So it was not an oversight to that extent; it has historically been not treated. Having said that, I can tell the gentleman, I have talked to Mr. Miller, the chairman of the committee that dealt with the minimum wage bill, and he is going to look at that to make sure that American Samoa is consistent with, and that does not mean exactly the same wage scale, but consistent with our concerns that were incorporated in the minimum wage bill, which received, as you know, 82 votes on your side and all of the votes on our side; a very bipartisan bill. 
   But American Samoa has been treated in a way different in the past. So it was not an oversight. But the question has been raised by people on your side and our side, and so Mr. Miller and the people on his committee will be looking at that. So the answer to your question is, yes.

   I would like to comment on the second part of your question. I want you to know that although we believe that the two bills that I have discussed that may well be on the floor on Friday, I want Members to have notice of that, are dealing with ethics and the safety of our pages, both issues are of substantial concern, and I would suggest immediacy. While they will be considered, I want you to know on both sides of the aisle, there is a desire for and a commitment to regular order. The points the gentleman makes with respect to considered judgment being given are well taken, and I agree with him, and we hope to proceed in that manner.

   Let me say that none of the bills that we adopted this week violated the PAYGO rule, as I think the gentleman is aware. The 9/11 bill was an authorization subject to appropriation. Those programs will be paid for within the budget, we believe. We are committed to doing that. 
   The student loan bill will comply with the PAYGO rule. And the energy bill will raise revenues. That clearly complies with the PAYGO rule. 
   But the gentleman's point that they did not go to committee is accurate. When we adopted the rule, that was debated fully. The rule was adopted. We had a commitment as you know on our side to do those. We had a commitment to do those in the first 100 hours. That is what we are doing. We believe that they are overwhelmingly supported by the American public, and we are very pleased there was substantial bipartisan support for these bills as well.

   I am constrained to say with all the charity in my heart that, of course, you didn't violate the PAYGO rule, you eliminated the PAYGO rule. So it was not an issue on your side. 
   We have reinstated the PAYGO rule, which was adopted, as the gentleman knows, in a bipartisan way, and supported again in 1997, overwhelmingly adopted by the bipartisan Republicans and Democrats in this House and in the Senate. We hope that the PAYGO rule will lead us back from the abyss of what we believe to be a fiscally dire situation to a point that we were in 2001, where we had the President of the United States, President Bush, projecting a $5.6 trillion surplus. We are now, for various reasons, in part because we did not comply with and didn't have a PAYGO rule, confronted by a deficit in excess of $3 trillion. 
   So I say to my friend, I share his view that we need to comply with the PAYGO rule. We adopted a PAYGO rule, we intend to comply with it, and we intend to move towards restoring the fiscal discipline that we had. I think, working together, we can do that.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say to my friend, we don't have to say you did it perfectly, and that is what we are talking about, making it better. That is what this is about, improving. We can argue in debate about what is, but what we cannot argue about, I think, is it is not perfect, and we can make it better. We are going to have a bipartisan vote on this. We are going to have a lot of people on your side of the aisle say, yes, we can make it better. That is what this is about, making it better. 
   By the way, I will tell my friend, 92 percent of the American public responds in polls they think this is what we ought to do. That is not pounding on the table; it is pounding on democracy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to, before I further discuss this particular bill, discuss the legislation H.R. 4. I would like to take a moment to congratulate the Members of the people's House, all of us, on the very productive week we have had. This week we worked to make America safer, passing bipartisan legislation that implements the 9/11 Commission recommendations. 
   We worked to make our economy fairer, passing bipartisan legislation that raises the Federal minimum wage, and we worked to improve the health care for all Americans, passing bipartisan legislation that promotes embryonic stem cell research. We are keeping our pledge to the American people to lead, govern effectively, and get results. 
   Today we consider H.R. 4, the Medicare prescription drug price negotiation act. Bipartisan legislation aimed at cutting prescription drug prices for millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities. 
   I can't believe there is anybody opposed to that objective. Yes, there is an issue of how do you do it best. 
   Many believe that this is one way to do it, not the only way to do it. This legislation repeals, in my opinion, a misguided provision in current law that explicitly prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from entering into negotiations with drug companies to lower the cost of prescription drugs for the 43 million beneficiaries of Medicare. 
   I tell my friend in the private sector that if the drug manufacturers believe there is an alternative, that will go into the price structure, I guarantee it. By that, I mean, even if it is not exercised, we require it to be exercised, but even if it were not, if that alternative were present, it is going to affect the psychology of pricing. 
   H.R. 4 requires the Secretary to conduct such negotiation but gives the Secretary broad discretion in how to most effectively implement negotiating authority to achieve the greatest discounts. We want him to take steps to be effective in accomplishing the objective of bringing drug prices down for seniors. 
   The bill also permits Medicare part D drug plans to obtain discounts or lower prices below those negotiated by the Secretary. 
   As The New York Times observes today in an editorial, the bill is, and I quote, sufficiently flexible to allow older Americans to benefit from the best efforts of both government and private drug plans.     
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has the overwhelming support of the American people, many of whom have experienced firsthand the rising costs of prescription drugs. In fact, as I just quoted, a recent Newsweek poll indicated that 92 percent, more than nine of every ten Americans, believe this is a policy that ought to be supported. 
   The people's House is going to reflect that sentiment today. In my view, this legislation is a commonsense effort to do right by the 43 million Americans enrolled in Medicare. It removes an unnecessary prohibition on prescription drug negotiations that should not have been enacted in the first place and allows the Secretary to do what he was hired to do, to put the interests of the American people first. 
   As Chairman Dingell and Chairman Rangel have observed, this bill is a very important first step in making prescription drugs more affordable. In this 110th Congress, we also must commit ourselves to addressing the affordability of an accessibility of health care generally. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this very important, bipartisanship, commonsense step forward in bringing the prices of drugs down for all of our seniors and our people. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, today--in a bipartisan vote--this House will pass critical legislation designed to expand college access and to make higher education more affordable for millions of American students. 
   This legislation, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, builds on the College Cost Reduction Act--legislation enacted last year that, among other things, increased the maximum Pell Grant to $5,400 over five years and cut interest rates in half on subsidized student loans, saving the average student $4,400 over the life of the loan. 
   There is a direct connection between our Nation's future prosperity and our ability to compete and succeed in a global marketplace that now relies more on brains than brawn. An educated workforce is absolutely indispensable in this information age--and this legislation represents an important step in expanding college access to more Americans. 
   In particular, I want to thank Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon and the members of the Education and Labor Committee for their hard work on this bill, which was reported out of committee on a 45 to 0 vote. 
   This legislation reauthorizes the Higher Education Act through fiscal year 2012, and, among other things, it will encourage colleges to rein in price increases, providing incentives--such as additional need-based aid--to colleges to hold down price increases. It also will require the Department of Education to create ``higher education price increase watch lists'' that report the full price of tuition and fees, as well as the cost of room and board for students living on campus. And, it seeks to restore integrity and accountability to the student loan program, requiring institutions and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct, and providing students with full and fair information about their borrowing options. 
   Furthermore, this bill will make textbook costs more manageable by providing students with advance information on textbook pricing so that they can plan for expenses and by ensuring that colleges and faculty have full textbook pricing information when making purchasing decisions. 
   Just today, the Washington Post noded in an editorial: ``Textbook prices have been rising rapidly in recent decades, increasing at more than 2 1/2 times the rate of inflation from 1986 to 2004, according to a Government Accountability Office report.'' The Post continued: ``At the University of Maryland at College Park, the average student spends more than $1,000 a year on textbooks--equal to 20 percent of tuition.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, it not only is imperative to expand college access, but also to do what we can to ensure that our students do not graduate with crushing debt that haunts them for decades. 
   In addition, this important bill will make college more affordable for low-income and non-traditional students by allowing students to receive Pell Grant scholarship aid for the entire year. The bill also creates a new scholarship program for active duty military personnel and family members, including children and spouses of active duty military service members and veterans. 
   Finally, let me say that I am pleased that this legislation includes provisions that Congressman Berman and I worked on that require institutions to disclose to students and employees their policies related to copyright infringement and a description of actions that institutions take to prevent and detect illegal file sharing. 
   Mr. Chairman, this a good, thoughtful piece of legislation. And, I urge members on both sides on the aisle to vote for it.

   Mr. HOYER. I appreciate the gentleman's confidence that the Senate is going to send us a bill, short-term, medium-term or long-term duration. We have been waiting for that for some time, obviously. 
   It is my understanding the Senate is going to address this bill on Tuesday. Now, if they send it to us on Tuesday, we will see what they have in the bill. There obviously will be little, if any,  time for a conference. My expectation is there will be a difference between the House bill which passed here 2 1/2 months ago and the Senate bill. 
   As I said on the floor, when we passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill on November 15 or 16, I said at that time I was hopeful that we would pass it, that the Senate would pass it, and that we could have a conference in which the very important specifics of the bill might be discussed and differences ironed out. That has not yet occurred, unfortunately. 
   In addition, as I told my friend last week, we had still not gotten access to the documents that we had asked to see to indicate what, in fact, immunity was being asked for. Those documents, my friend and I had an opportunity to discuss that, I don't know whether he had any role in that, but they will now be made available as of today. As a matter of fact, I intend to take the opportunity tomorrow, much of the morning, perhaps even into the afternoon, to review those documents. Some few Members have had that opportunity already, but very few. So we have been very late and compressed in the schedule of dealing fully with what is the thorniest issue on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill, and that is the granting of immunity. 
   I will tell my friend that, as I said, when we extended it for 15 days, when we had an agreement to do that, to give the Senate time to act, I was hopeful they could act within that time. The problem we now find ourselves in, if they act on Tuesday, and they send the bill to us on Wednesday or late Tuesday night, I don't know how long their consideration is going to take. 
   As you know, there is substantial controversy, as is evident by the difficulty they have had in passing it, so I don't know exactly how quickly they will be able to pass that bill. But as I have said on numerous occasions, we believe, I believe, there are serious issues on which there are obviously honest differences of opinion. 
   I agree with my friend, we would like to resolve this. We would like to have it resolved so that we don't visit it monthly or every 3 months or every 6 months. We believe, as I said before, that the current bill, the current FISA law, if it is reverted to, will provide for all of the intelligence surveillance that is needed by the administration. 
   It would require, of course, getting FISA approval, the court's approval, which was, of course, contemplated in 1978 when it was adopted so that with or without an extension or new legislation, we believe the administration can pursue, as all of us want to, there is nobody on this floor who doesn't want to make sure that we facilitate the protection of the American public and America through the interception of communications which may be by terrorists planning to attack us. 
   But having said that, I am sure my friend appreciates, as I have said all along, this is a serious issue, a difficult issue for many. I think we are all agreeing on the enforcement and interception part. It is the immunity issue that gives many concerns, and they want to look at that carefully, and I think that's fair to do. Whether or not we will be able to do that next week, frankly, I tell my friend, I am not sure.

   Mr. HOYER. I agree with my friend, and that is correct, and I think that is why all of us want to facilitate and ensure that the work of the NSA and others can go forward. I don't know whether the gentleman had an opportunity to either see or hear this; but I just wanted to bring to your attention, because we do share that concern, that in testimony this morning before the Intelligence Committee, the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, whom we work with, said that all current surveillance activity under the Protect America Act would continue even after the law expires. 
   He went on to say, after being asked about the backlog of surveillance, because, as you recall when we were back in August or July of last year, there was a concern about the backlog and therefore it couldn't get approval as quickly as might be needed. Director McConnell informed the House Intelligence Committee that the backlog that existed has been eliminated, saying we are caught up on everything at this point in time. 
   I think we can have a confidence level. I agree with you, we want to get this done as quickly as possible. Because I am concerned that we not have a gap, we are trying to assure ourselves, and believe we are assured that there will not be a down time for our intelligence service should we not be able to reach agreement either with the Senate or with ourselves in the time frame of next Friday. 
   I am hopeful that we can do that, and we will work toward that end.

   Mr. HOYER. I appreciate your bringing to my attention, and we discussed the second sentence, which you just read regarding the more restrictive. When he refers to the more restrictive, he simply refers to the fact that they would have to go to the FISA Court for approval of such intercept as they want, and that would be within the, of course, authority within 72 hours to act and then get approval after the fact, which is why I indicated that Admiral McConnell had said that the backlog had been eliminated. 
   You recall previous testimony, or comments, that one of the officials who dealt with these in the administration indicated that, and the court could, frankly, within minutes, give approval  in many situations, and now that the backlog has been eliminated, it is correct, it would be more restrictive, it would have to go to the court, but that, of course, is what was contemplated in 1978. We do not believe that that would in any substantial way slow down the process and, therefore, not in any way put us at risk. 
   Having said all of that, we still agree with you that if we can get this done in a timely fashion that would be good. 
   I want to tell my friend, though, very candidly, I think there is some sentiment that if we don't get it done that that is going to put this side of the aisle that wants to look at this bill, after the Senate passes it back to us, with whatever provisions they include in it, carefully, we understand that we are going to be portrayed as somehow undermining the security of America. We think that argument is bogus, but we do think it may well be made.

   Mr. HOYER. I do want to make the point that I don't think we have much difference on that issue because we agree that technology has changed. As we all know, there is a switch here in the United States now that the 1978 law did not anticipate. Frankly, I don't think there is a great deal of contention. I think in a bipartisan fashion we believe that needs to be addressed. We addressed it in our bill and the Senate addressed it in their bill. Frankly, I don't think that is one of the items in contention. 
   In fact, I would suggest to my friend we could deal with the immunity issue, which looks back not at present capacity nor future capacity, and resolve that issue in a separate bill if that was the concern about going forward. I think that could be done relatively quickly. 
   My only point to the gentleman is I agree with you, technology has changed. I think there is bipartisan agreement we need to address that and facilitate the foreign-to-foreign intercept with a blanket approval simply related to process, and I think we could do that relatively easily because I don't think that is particularly contentious between us.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   We have no more serious matter to debate than war and peace. I thank the gentleman for his extraordinary leadership and for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   I must remark that how different I think the debate would be if not one of the facts were changed but one: that if it were Bill Clinton in the Presidency and all the other facts were the same, I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle what would their comments reflect. 
   I have said it before many times on this House floor and I will say it again today. Every Member of this great body who swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, is committed to fighting and defeating terrorism. We must not lose sight in this debate that terrorism is a real threat to our people and to our country. We do not lose sight of that on this side of the aisle. We are committed to defeating terrorists and protecting America. Any suggestion otherwise demeans our discourse and is beneath, frankly, the dignity of the Members of this institution and the American people. 
   After nearly 4 1/2 years in Iraq, a war that has been, I think, superbly peopled by our men and women in uniform but they have been trying to pursue an incompetently planned policy, this is what our Nation has to show for its efforts: 
   More than 3,600 brave American servicemen and women have been killed in action. More than 26,000 others have been maimed and injured. The American taxpayer has spent $450 billion on this war, with a pending request by the administration for an additional $147 billion. 
   And yet the President's policy in Iraq is not succeeding. Just today the administration released the ``assessment report'' on Iraq demanded by this Democratic Congress. The bottom line is the Iraq Government has failed to meet a single one of the security, political, and economic milestones for success. Perhaps most jarring, the administration rates as ``unsatisfactory'' the number of Iraqi security units capable of operating independently. That is over 50 months later. 
   The report states: ``There has been a slight reduction in units assessed as capable of independent operations since January, 2007.'' In other words, the administration says we are going backwards in terms of the capability of the Iraqi forces. 
   While the administration and congressional Republicans try to put a positive spin on the so-called ``progress'' in Iraq, other respected voices are not so optimistic. Yesterday, Thomas Fingar, the Deputy Director for Analysis at the National Intelligence Council, told the House Armed Services Committee that there have been ``few appreciable gains'' in Iraqi political progress. Even General David Petraeus, our top commander in Iraq, a gentleman that all of us respect as a military leader, told the New York Times that ``while some measures of violence showed a downward trend, it was too early to suggest that there has been a lasting turnaround in the war.'' That is over 50 months later. 
   Mr. Speaker, last January in an address to the Nation, President Bush stated: ``America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' We have not done so. We said we would do that, but we have not done so. Today the President shows no intention of changing course even as the Iraqis fail to meet those benchmarks. 
   Our fight against terrorism must and will be tough, but it also must be smart. And it is long past time that we recognize the following: The President's stay-the-course strategy is not working. The Iraqis must take responsibility for their own country. This war has severely diminished our military readiness and diverted our attention in the war on terror. If that were not the case, Osama bin Laden would still not be at large and al Qaeda would not be reported as being back at the strength that it had on September 11 of 2001. 
   After $450 billion and precious blood being spilled by American troops and others, we must change course by voting for this legislation, which calls for a responsible redeployment of American forces in Iraq and a comprehensive plan in U.S. policy in Iraq and the broader region. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must have a specific strategy for missions our remaining forces would undertake as well as plans to engage Iraq's neighboring states and to locate and eliminate al Qaeda and allied terrorist networks, which seek to destabilize and destroy the United States and other democracies. Jonathan Alter at Newsweek just a week ago referred to this as a ``pull and strike'' strategy. Redeploy so that our forces are able to focus on the terrorists, not on the civil war in which they find themselves embroiled. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people and an increasing number of our friends on the other side of the aisle have lost confidence in the President's Iraq strategy because we have yet to see demonstrable, sustainable progress in that effort. Our troops have done everything we have asked them. 
   I'll tell you that we are so proud of those of you who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States. I was so proud of PATRICK MURPHY's statement that he gave here today, so proud of all of those who have served not only in Iraq but in every theater of conflict to which Americans have responded. 
   But as Senator Domenici told the Baltimore Sun yesterday, one of the senior Members of the United States Senate and a leader in the Republican Party, he said this: ``There is no reason to wait ..... I am trying to tell the President that he must change his ways because there is nothing positive happening.''     
   That is not a Democratic Member of the Senate speaking, that is a senior Republican leader saying there is no reason to wait. 
   This bill is on this floor this day because there is no reason to wait. Hopefully this body will overwhelmingly respond to the will and focus of the American people, which are pleading for a change in strategy, a new direction, a policy of success against terrorists, and ensuring the safety of our Nation and its people. Let's change our strategy and demand that the Iraqis step up and be responsible for their country. 
   Our presence there, General Casey observed, has been undermining their taking responsibility, not enhancing it. Let's be responsibly redeploying our troops. And let's focus our resources and efforts on disrupting and destroying the terrorist networks that threaten our national security. This legislation allows us to accomplish that mission. 
   I urge my colleagues, for this body, for their constituents, for this country, and for our troops, pass this legislation.

   Number two, the American people feel it is a critically important issue. Not only does it have their attention, but they think it's critically important. 
   And my friend will remember, I think, returning here, I received a call Saturday afternoon that we were going to have a session on Sunday. Many of our Members were overseas. But the issue was perceived as so important by the majority leader that he reconvened us, with the Speaker's participation, as you recall, on the following Sunday afternoon.     
   We voted on a bill that many felt was a very important bill that hadn't gone through a committee late that Sunday evening. 
   Many people in this country and on this side of the aisle and I think on your side of the aisle feel that Iraq is a critical issue. So I say with all respect, we do intend to continue to address this issue, and we hope the votes do change. If they don't change, they don't change. There is nothing we can do about that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate both Mr. King of New York and the chairman of the committee, who I know worked very hard together in a bipartisan fashion to get us to a place where we all want to be. Where we all want to be is a safer America, a safer homeland, and safer Americans living here at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a critically important day for this Congress and indeed for our Nation. We have no higher duty than to protect the American people, defend our homeland and to strengthen our national security. We know, nearly 6 years after the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, that Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda terrorist network continue to present a real, serious threat to the American homeland. 
   In fact, the most recent National Intelligence Estimate released just this month states: ``The group, al Qaeda, has been able to restore key capabilities it would need to launch an attack on U.S. soil: a safe haven in Pakistan tribal areas, operational lieutenants, and senior leaders.'' That is cause for concern for every one of us that represents the 300 million Americans in this country. 
   Thus, today, with this conference report implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, we will be taking an enormous step forward in hardening our Nation's defense and combating and eliminating the terrorists who seek to harm us. 
   Let me say my friend, the gentleman from California, the former Attorney General of California, is correct. Steps have been taken, and these are taking additional steps. Unfortunately, as the gentleman knows, when we were assessed by the 9/11 Commission itself, it gave five Fs and 12 Ds to our performance up until last year. That does not mean we didn't do some things. We did some very good things, and we did them in a bipartisan fashion. He is right, we got 9 Cs and two incompletes for failing to implement fully the 9/11 Commission. 
   Today, we make this top national security priority, the first major bill that we considered in this Congress, H.R. 1, a reality, and I believe we will adopt the conference report which passed the Senate 85-8 with strong bipartisan support, as has been expressed on this floor. 
   This legislation, among other things, will substantially improve our homeland security by doing the following. I know it has been referenced, but we ought to repeat it, so the American public and all of our colleagues know what we are doing: 
   Significantly increasing the share of State homeland security grants provided on the basis of risk. Where are we most vulnerable? The gentleman, of course, from the New York area knows that very well. I know it as well, representing the Washington metropolitan area. 
   Requiring scanning of 100 percent of maritime cargo containers by 2012. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, has been working on this issue every day since 9/11, and I congratulate him for the efforts he has put in and the efforts that others have put in on this issue. 
   Requiring screening 100 percent of air cargo within 3 years. If the Transportation Security Administration cannot meet this goal, it must provide classified briefings to Congress on its process. 
   Withholding assistance to Pakistan for fiscal year 2008 until the President certifies that the Pakistani Government is cracking down on the Taliban. We still have a sanctuary for the Taliban. We still have a sanctuary for al Qaeda. We still have a staging area for al Qaeda. That is not acceptable because it continues to cause us great risk and danger. 
   Significantly strengthening the Cooperative Threat Reduction, Nunn-Lugar Program, and creating a new National Bio-Surveillance Integration Center which would support Federal efforts to rapidly identify and track biological threats. 
   Additionally, Mr. Thompson and Mr. King have included in this conference report, it seeks to reduce extremism by enhancing the International Arab and Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund and establishing a Middle East Foundation that will promote economic opportunities, education reform, human rights and democracy in the Middle East. 
   Let no one, however, be mistaken: this legislation alone cannot immunize our Nation from attack. However, it does represent a very important step forward for our national security. 
   As former Congressman Lee Hamilton, the cochair of the 9/11 Commission, has noted, and again I quote: ``The bottom line is that when this legislation is enacted and implemented, the American people will be safer.'' 
   That is their expectation of us; that is our duty to them and to the Constitution we have sworn an oath to defend. That must be our objective every day, and it is surely our responsibility. 
   I congratulate, again, Mr. Thompson, who has led this committee; Mr. King, who has fought so ably over the years to make our country safer; and I urge the support on both sides of the aisle for this very critically important legislation.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank my distinguished friend, Mr. Etheridge, chairman of one of our subcommittees on the Ag Committee. 
   I rise to congratulate Mr. Peterson; indeed, I rise to congratulate Mr. Goodlatte as well, who did work together. In fact, as late as Monday, we were together coming back from New York and talked about this bill. He indicated he thought it was a good bill. He did express then, quite honestly, he wanted to look at the pay-fors. That was obviously fair. He has decided that because of them, he cannot support the bill. I regret that. 
   I want to thank the chairman of the committee, Congressman Peterson of Minnesota, for his hard work on this important legislation and his efforts in crafting a bipartisan reform bill. I think he has a bipartisan reform bill. I understand the pay-fors may preclude some, hopefully not all, from voting for this. 
   I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you were very good at spending money and not very good at paying for things. You are consistent to that extent today. You went from a $5.6 trillion surplus to a $3 trillion deficit because we did not pay for what we bought. This bill does that. 
   It is a testament to the hard work of Mr. Peterson and others on the committee that this farm bill reauthorization passed out of the Agriculture Committee on a voice vote, that is, with unanimous bipartisan support. 
   I also appreciate the work of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) who cares deeply and thoughtfully about agriculture and our rural communities. His effort, with respect to this bill, was a very positive one. He has made important contributions on this issue, and I congratulate Mr. Kind, one of the finest Members of this body. 
   I believe that this farm bill deserves to pass today with strong bipartisan support. And I note that the ranking member of the committee, as I have said, even expressed on the House floor  yesterday, Mr. Goodlatte said he would support this bill were it not for the inclusion of a pay-for. 
   About that provision, let us be clear. At literally the 11th hour, as this farm bill was about to be considered on this floor, the White House issued a veto threat and amazingly complained that we are actually trying to pay for this legislation, in part, by closing a corporate tax loophole. Now, when you close a loophole, does it mean that somebody is paying taxes that they otherwise would not pay? That's the definition of a loophole. Not just any corporate tax loophole, mind you, but a corporate tax loophole that the Bush administration itself recommended closing in 2002 and which Bill Thomas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, agreed with. 
   Let me quote Ken Dam, then-Deputy Treasury Secretary, and I quote, ``Opportunities for earning stripping through artificial deductions and income shifting may exploit the network of tax treaties the United States maintains around the world.'' That's what we're dealing with. That's what Assistant Secretary Dam was talking about. 
   In 2002, the Treasury Department concluded, 2002, Republican Treasury Department concluded, ``The prevalent use of foreign related-party debt in inversion transactions is evidence that these rules should be revisited.'' That is what we're doing. 
   So we're asking those who make good money in America to pay their fair share of the taxes in America. I believe the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with that proposition. Yes, Democrats would make it harder for overseas companies to use tax havens to avoid taxes on U.S. profits from hardworking Americans who buy their products and expect them to pay a fair share, a position formerly held, as I said, by the Bush administration, and even Bill Thomas. 
   The provision is not only good tax policy, but also a clear manifestation of this new Democratic majority's commitment to abide by the new pay-as-you-go budget rules that will help us restore fiscal discipline. 
   Those rules were adopted in a bipartisan fashion in 1990, reiterated in 1997 in an agreement which I voted for, President Clinton supported, and it was not until 2002 that those were abandoned by the Republicans because you could not pay for your tax cuts. That's why you abandoned PAYGO. And that's why the $3 trillion debt occurred from a $5.6 trillion surplus. 
   Now, as to the substance of this farm bill, Chairman Peterson has written a bill that focuses on getting vital benefits to family farmers, investing in America's producer, stimulating rural economies, and securing renewable energy sources. 
   I, too, want to join in congratulating Stephanie Herseth Sandlin on the role that she has played in terms of the rural focus of this bill. 
   This bill imposes real payment limitations that will begin to reduce subsidies, moving in a new and right direction. It makes historic investments in programs to support food and vegetable producers, an important element for not only California and the northeast, the middle Atlantic, but other areas as well. 
   It improves funding and access to conservation programs. It imposes payment limits that prevent millionaires from receiving farm subsidy benefits and makes payments transparent. Could we go lower? We could. Should we in the future? Yes. But we have made, in my opinion, a very significant start. 
   It invests in nutrition programs that help families in need. In the richest country on the face of the Earth, we ought to make sure that no child in America goes to sleep at night or wakes up in the morning hungry. We're trying to move towards that. I see the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca) who has been very involved in these programs as well. 
   And it encourages the expansion of renewable fuel production, providing loan guarantees for the development of refineries that produce renewable fuels. Energy independence is a critical objective, and this bill moves us towards that objective. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes more than $175 million in direct assistance to help our farmers in their ongoing efforts to be good stewards of the Chesapeake Bay. We have made some strides to restore this magnificent estuary, but much more work needs to be done. 
   I want to thank my friend Tim Holden from Pennsylvania and Nona Darrell, his chief staffer, who helped work on this effort. 
   To move us forward in this regard, the bill will implement an innovative strategy targeting individual river watersheds, including the Patuxent and the Potomac, to help our producers prevent shoreline erosion, control sediments, reduce nitrogen loads, and establish a long-term monitoring program. 
   Again, my colleagues, I want to congratulate Chairman Peterson on this bill. I also want to congratulate Mr. Goodlatte. I wish he was supporting this bill at this point in time, but I know that he worked to get much of the bill, which but for the pay-fors it's my understanding he would support. But the pay-fors are critical if America is going to pay its bills and not simply pass them along to future generations, whether they be farm children, suburban children, or rural children. 
   This bill is a responsible, important step forward in farm policy and energy policy and nutritional policy and in conservation policy. I congratulate the members of the committee on their product, and I urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support this product.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT AND HELP END THE WORSENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, today, the House is considering-three critically important resolutions related to the world's worst ongoing humanitarian disaster--the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. 
   The first is H. Res. 573, which recognizes and commends the efforts of U.S. advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening crisis in Darfur. These groups remind us daily, through their media campaigns and grassroots efforts, that the international community has a responsibility to unite and stop crimes against humanity--and that we must learn from past failures to do so--in Rwanda, Bosnia, and elsewhere. 
   The second is H. Res. 740, which condemns the brutal attack on African Union peacekeepers that occurred in Haskanita, Darfur, 1 month ago today. This violent act, carried out by rebels, took the lives of 10 peacekeepers--seven Nigerians and three other soldiers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana. It reminds us that there are many guilty parties in the violence in Darfur, and that we must reinforce our support for the courageous African Union soldiers--who indeed fight not for their own countries, but for humanity. 
   Finally, the House will vote today on H. Res. 726, a resolution calling on the President and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against the most innocent of Darfur's victims--young girls and women. I was asked to cosponsor this important resolution by my friend and colleague Brad Miller, who traveled with me to Darfur in April. There we saw things we will never forget--children orphaned by genocide and women who had experienced unspeakable personal traumas. We learned that the heartbreaking reality of life in Darfur today means women risk being raped when doing things as simple as collecting firewood. This resolution addresses this horrific reality by authorizing grants to help the women and girls of Darfur and calling for prosecution of those who have carried out such hideously inhumane acts. 
   I am proud that the U.S. House of Representatives is putting itself on record with these resolutions--as an institution that will not stand idly by while the world's worst humanitarian disaster continues to unfold. While these resolutions are not a panacea to the heart-rending conflict in Darfur, we know from experience that continual pressure on those who take part in such violent, inhumane actions brings us closer to a solution. 
   That solution must be multi-faceted. It includes not only full and speedy implementation of the United Nations/African Union hybrid peacekeeping force, but also international support for a single, unified peacemaking process. I am extremely disappointed to learn that multiple rebel leaders have chosen violence over peace and declined to participate in the current talks in Libya, but I am hopeful that the representatives that are there--including the representatives of the Government of Sudan--will make progress toward a ceasefire and a viable political solution for this ravaged land. Finally, and equally important, a solution in Darfur must include a sustained and secure role for the courageous humanitarian workers, who risk their lives daily because they are so committed to alleviating the suffering of their fellow human beings. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these three resolutions.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   Frequently I rise in support of a bill and congratulate the chairman. It is always warranted to do that; but in this case, it is particularly warranted. No Member has worked harder or longer in a more complex context than has Chairman Frank, working with Secretary Paulson of the administration, with Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bachus, and Mr. Shelby. While I know there may not be full agreement, I know there has been the opportunity to work together. I want to congratulate Mr. Frank who has been lionized in the press, properly so, for his expertise on the subject matter and for his political skill in bringing this matter to the floor today in a fashion that will see its passage.     
   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to economics, none of us, none of us is an island. Our prosperity is always, and always will be, bound up with the prosperity of our neighbors. And nothing has proved that more than the mortgage crisis that is rocking our economy today. 
   Yes, it has reached to the heights of Wall Street to threaten huge banks and the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   But the crisis began close to home. It began with millions of families who have seen their subprime mortgage rates jump out of reach, sometimes because they didn't understand the repercussions but often because they were misled by unscrupulous, unregulated lenders. The consequences will be felt close to home. 
   Home prices are set to decline for the second year running, the first time that has happened since the Great Depression. And communities are facing a vicious cycle of foreclosures, falling property values, declining property tax collections, cutbacks in city services, rising crime, and more foreclosures. The American public rightfully expects us to act. So the bill that we debate today isn't simply about helping hundreds of thousands of Americans keep their homes, as vital as that objective is. It's about stabilizing an entire economy. 
   We have talked about a stimulus bill. This is a very important component of the stimulus of our economy. As Fed Chairman Bernanke put it: ``Doing what we can to avoid preventable foreclosures is not just in the interest of lenders and borrowers. It's in everybody's interest.'' It's in our economy's interest. 
   I couldn't agree with him more. And that's why I'm proud to stand in support of this Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act. 
   This legislation will enable at least 400,000 homeowners, that's 400,000 families, to refinance their homes, switching from risky subprime mortgages to safer loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration. 
   Now, it's not about a bailout. Lenders will have to take losses, and borrowers must agree to share with the government any profit from the resale of a refinanced home. That's right, it's appropriate, and this bill contains it. 
   The bill also helps stabilize communities that are reeling from foreclosures and declining property values by helping States and cities buy up foreclosed properties. Not just will the homes in question be bought up. Entire neighborhoods will be protected. 
   Furthermore, this bill creates a strong, independent regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I have observed often that one of the problems in our economy has been that over the last 7 1/2 years, we have taken the referee off the field. This bill reinstates a vigorous referee. 
   It also gives the Treasury Department temporary authority to extend credit to the GSEs, should they require it. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that there is ``probably better than a 50 percent chance,'' and I quoted that, that this authority will not be used. But even if it is not, this bill will go a long way toward shoring up confidence in our financial markets. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is barely a Member in this body whose constituents have not felt the pain of the housing crisis, whether the personal crisis of losing a home or the ripple effect set off by each foreclosure. The needs of our constituents outweigh the demands of ideology. That's always true, of course, but at moments like this, we feel that truth more acutely than usual. 
   So I hope that my colleagues will put partisanship aside and do the right thing for our economy, for our neighbors, and for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me read the Statement of Administration Policy. One of the things I want to congratulate Mr. Frank and Secretary Paulson on is the bipartisan way in which they have worked on a daily basis. I know they have talked daily. I have talked to Secretary Paulson, I think, weekly. But on a daily basis to make sure that we had a bipartisan administration-Congress response to the crisis that confronts us. I read from the Statement of Administration Policy, which is dated July 23, at 12:25, just a few hours ago. I know all my colleagues will want to listen intently to what the administration says we ought to be doing: 
   `` ..... the temporary Treasury authorities and GSE reform provisions are too important to the stability of our Nation's housing market, financial system, and the broader economy not to be enacted immediately. For these reasons the administration supports passage of H.R. 3221, as amended.'' 
   America will be pleased when, in a bipartisan way, the administration and Congress act together to face a crisis confronting our citizens and our country. I urge my colleagues to vote for this critically important piece of legislation.

   Mr. HOYER. If the gentleman would yield, I would agree with the observation on our side. I say that, and it is obviously not humorous except to me. 
   The fact of the matter is I believe that what was said on this side of the aisle and what the Speaker has indicated was that this was sent down we believed contrary to normal practice not with agreement of the leadership and the administration on how this would be considered. The Speaker believed, and obviously the House did as well, that additional time was needed. This was not, the Speaker has indicated that, an attempt to kill this agreement. It still could come up. There still is going to be discussion between the administration and ourselves. We want to resolve some outstanding issues and discuss what we might reach agreement on with the President and the administration. 
   As you know, we began those conversations yesterday. You and I were down there at the White House together. We hope to continue and hope for positive movement. Regarding other agreements that are pending, we have not discussed nor ruled out the possibility that future trade agreements may be considered by this Congress.

   Mr. HOYER. I don't think this was intended necessarily to be precedent-setting. The precedent, of course, has  been that administrations, Republican and Democratic, have discussed with Republican and Democratic Congresses the timing and conditions under which these would be sent forward. We did not believe that had been accomplished this time. The administration's perspective was that there had not been response to their attempts to do so. Whatever the reasons, the answer to your question is we do not believe at this point in time that this is precedent for the two pending agreements. 
   But I don't want to by that response represent, if we were confronted with the same set of conditions, that is, that we did not reach agreement on how those agreements were moving forward, that this might not be again something that might be considered. But it is not precedent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First, let me say that last week, and I would reiterate the comment, I don't think I spoke to when the committee would move on it. What I did say was that hopefully the supplemental would be on the floor either the last week in April or the first week in May. I don't think that I referenced the committee consideration of that. I still believe that is the case. 
   With respect to your second question as to what might be on the supplemental, obviously it has not been marked up in committee. There are discussions, as have been reported in the public press, with respect to either language that might be appended to that by the committee or by the House itself. I would not want to preclude that effort. 
   I want to say that it is my understanding that the President has made a comment today again that what I sent you and the dollar I sent you, not a penny more will I sign. 
   I will tell my friend, I don't think that is particularly useful. It continues to say from the President of the United States to the Congress of the United States, which is, after all, the policymaking body of this country under the Constitution, ``What I propose you take, or we'll leave it. We'll not do anything other.'' 
   I would hope to have discussions on this. As you know, the economy is in crisis. It is very nice to give money to Iraq. As you know, I support funding our troops. Having said that, we have people in crisis in housing, we have people in crisis in jobs, we have people in crisis without health care, and we have people in crisis with their educational expenses. We have a lot of people in this country who are in trouble. 
   We think that they need to know that the Congress of the United States is responding to their issues as well as to the issues that the President brings up with respect to Iraq. 
   So I don't want to commit us to simply doing exactly what the President asks, or apparently thinks he can tell us to do. We don't think that is the process.

   Mr. HOYER. Well, of course, as you know, we have passed legislation that's still pending in the Senate. In addition to that, as you know, gas prices in January 2001 were $1.46, on average, in this country. They're now, on average, $3.30, so they've more than doubled during the last 87 months of this administration. We're concerned about that, as I know you are as well. The public would like to have $1.46 gas, I'm sure, back. And we are concerned about that. 
   We're concerned about energy independence. We all know that it's going to be very tough in the short term on both sides, it's recognized in the short term, to do something on gas prices, given where we are today from that $1.46 where we were in January of 2001. 
   Having said that, this bill that was on the floor today was an important bill. It was an important bill to a Member on your side of the aisle, and you and I had the opportunity to talk to him about it. It was a bipartisan bill. It's a bill that we thought had merit. And, as a matter of fact, my expectation is that overwhelming numbers of the House are going to vote for it when it comes up for final passage. 
   But, clearly, gasoline prices, gasoline, energy independence, which is a critical component of why we are in the position of having to pay such high prices, because we don't have great alternatives, getting more efficient automobiles, using alternative energy sources, providing for renewable fuels, as you know, I think you and I, I know you and I were both down when we presented the President with a bill that was signed by him at the Energy Department. We in a bipartisan way moved towards that last year on bills that we passed in a bipartisan way.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOYER. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I was in my office, as I have been over the days recently, where I see the distinguished minority leader rise, I see other Members on that side of the aisle rise, beat their chests about drilling. My side of the aisle is for drilling. We just had a press conference on drilling. But as I sit there, I think to myself, you know, the American people gave the opportunity to the Republican Party, the minority party now in the House of Representatives, to lead this country; and they gave them all of the power in Washington. They gave them the Presidency, the House of Representatives, and the United States Senate. They did that in the year 2000. They had already given them the House, and two oil men were elected President and Vice President. 
   In January, the Vice President decided to have, and he had over the coming months in 2001, he convened a meeting, a secret meeting of those involved in the energy industry to adopt energy policies. 
   Now that meeting--the minority leader is now leaving, but we will see him later--that meeting perhaps resulted in success, I don't know. I don't know what the meeting was about. 
   But during the course of the Presidency of Bill Clinton, oil went from $1.06 to $1.46. A nickel a year, 5 cents per year was the increase in the cost of gasoline at the pump for Americans.     
   And then, President Bush, Vice President Cheney, the Republicans came to town, all of town, and gas went from $1.46 in January 20, 2001, to over $4.10 on average throughout this country. Pretty stark. It now goes up from time to time 5 cents a day, where under Bill Clinton 5 cents a year. 
   And then the Republicans, 5 years later, adopted a bill, 2005, their energy policy. They were in control of the House, control of the Senate, and they had the Presidency. They passed that bill. Gas was then about $2.20. And they said we've adopted an energy policy--said it on the floor, said it when they signed the bill--we have done a bill now that's going to stabilize prices, going to make sure that Americans have energy supply. That's what they said. That's not what we said. 
   Now, ladies and gentlemen who are listening to this debate on this floor, I tell you that there are 68 million acres right now, right now available for leasing. You wring your hands and say, well, open up places for drilling. We've done that, friends. Look at the statistics, 68 million acres in the lower 48 and another 20 million acres, give or take a million, in Alaska. 
   They talk about a wildlife refuge that they want to drill in, but they don't talk about the 20 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve area in Alaska currently available. The administration could be pursuing leases on it. We may well have legislation to say, Administration, start moving, start drilling, start bringing product to the market so we'll bring prices down. 
   Now, of course, one of the aspects of bringing prices down, my friends, will be that the oil companies will make less profits. I know everybody in America believes that the oil companies want to get more products so they can bring prices down and make less profit. I know all Americans believe that's the way the system works. 
   The Republicans keep harping on drilling. We want to drill. We want to produce more American product. And by the way, we're going to bring legislation to the floor that's going to say when you drill, sell it here in the United States of America, keep our resources here in the United States of America. 
   I want to tell my friends, there are 88 million acres. And now, let me tell you something, 88 million acre, that's Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, and most of Maryland. Now, I know my friend from Texas thinks that's not much of an area of space, but I will bet everybody listening to this debate thinks that is a pretty large piece of property on which you can drill in America today. Why? Because we want to produce energy. 
   But I will tell you, one of the reasons we're in this pickle is because for a quarter of a century, for a quarter of a century that I've served in the Congress, a little more than that, the Republican Party has taken the position, no, we don't want to invest in alternatives, we don't want to see alternative energy sources developed. 
   And you can say it's not true as much as you want, I tell my friend, but the record reflects that has not been the priority. The priority has been, let's get more oil. We want to get more oil. 
   But I will tell you a country, as Boone Pickens said--I don't know whether you read Boone Pickens. He's one of the people who thinks that some of the policies you have been pursuing aren't too bad. He's not a Democrat. Here is what Boone Pickens said. The problem, of course, is our growing dependence on foreign oil. It's extreme, it's dangerous, and threatens future generations. And he says in this article in The Wall Street Journal, you are not going to drill yourself out of this hole that we've dug. He says, rightfully, that we need to see investments in alternatives. 
   Now, happily, last year when we took office, took control of the House and  the Senate, we adopted a bill, the President signed that bill, which looks to alternatives to complement the relatively small supply. America demands 25 percent of the energy resources in this world, and we have 3 percent of the petroleum supply. My friend the minority leader said he wasn't much of a mathematician, but you don't have to be much of a mathematician to know that if you're relying on that 3 percent, it's not going to be there very long. 
   So, yes, my friends, we need to find more domestic product. We need to drill where we now have authorized drilling to occur, and if that doesn't produce the resources that experts tell us are on that property, then I tell you this. Then we ought to look at other alternatives, and perhaps we ought to look at other alternatives now. 
   But for you to have a blind eye and pretend to the American people that somehow we're not allowing people to pursue drilling on our soil here in America and on the Outer Continental Shelf, I want you to know, that is currently authorized where drilling is not occurring, then you are misleading the American people. The American people ought to know: The Democrats want to make sure that we have more domestic product. 
   The Speaker has written a letter to the President just the other day saying, Mr. President, we have 773 million barrels of oil that are in our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Mr. President, use some of those, as your father did, as Bill Clinton did, at a time of economic crisis to help our people, help our people get to work, help them get their kids to school, help them afford their other expenses. 
   So I tell my friends that we need to deal with this issue. We're going to deal with this issue. We're concerned about this issue, all 435 of us, but to hear day after day after day that somehow we, who came to office just 18 months ago, after an energy policy was conjured up by the Vice President and the White House and an energy bill was passed in 2005, that somehow, somehow what's happening now is our fault, the American public aren't buying that. Polls show that. 
   But I will tell you, that we can work together because we need to be energy independent. It's a national security objective, an economic security objective, and we also need to keep our environment from choking our children and generations to come. 
   We're committed to both of those objectives, and we will join with all those who want to do the same.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There is an extensive letter to all of our colleagues from Congressmen Frank, McGovern, Kennedy, Langevin, and Lynch. 
   I don't want to read the whole letter; but responding to the points in question, I am looking at the letter to see whether or not--one of the points they make is that notwithstanding this bill there are several barriers to this proposal going forward, that is the LNG plant. Killing the bill that would provide environmental benefits to people of our districts would in no way save the LNG plant from the rejection it has already received. The point being, and I have not read the entire letter, but that there are other impediments apparently to moving forward on that LNG plant. As I say, it is a long letter, I haven't read it fully, but I do know that each one of the points that was raised in the article today have been responded to and therefore will be the subject of debate once the bill is considered.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Yes. As you know, we have been talking about, on both sides of the aisle, developing greater domestic supply from that which we have control over here in this country. I think both sides agree that that is an objective that ought to be pursued. The differences have been I think where that should be done at least in the short term, maybe not in the long term. 
   In the short term, it is our belief that there is very substantial areas available for further exploration and development of energy resources from our own country. As the gentleman may have heard me say on the floor earlier today, there is about 88 million acres that we believe is currently available for leasing that experts indicate are prime opportunities for finding, drilling, and producing energy for our country. We may well consider legislation which will try to accelerate, particularly in Alaska, where there is 23 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve area designated and approved by the Congress for drilling, where approximately 1 million acres of that has been currently let for lease but there are substantial millions of acres still available. So we may well have legislation which will direct the administration to accelerate the leases for that area and speed the development. 
   In addition, we may well include in that legislation the Use It Or Lose It bill, we had disagreements on whether that was appropriate, which essentially says to companies: Don't inventory large segments. If you are not going to use it, let's get it back and give it to some who may well use it at this point in time. Again, an opportunity to accelerate the exploration and securing of oil within our control here in this country. 
   In addition, that legislation I think will include a requirement that any oil petroleum products that are produced as a result of this legislation or as a result of these leaseholds being extended, that petroleum would need to be used  in the United States of America, not exported to Japan or to other nations. 
   You had in a piece of legislation that you had in 2005 a similar provision. I can't recall the phrase right now, but essentially requiring due diligent requirement as they proceeded with the leases to develop the energy. So we think our Use Or Lose It is, while not exactly what you include in your 2005 bill, certainly a similar objective of saying: You get the leases, let's develop the oil. 
   We will also be calling I think in that legislation, Mr. Whip, on the President to pursue finishing construction of the natural gas and the oil pipelines from Alaska as soon as possible. If that requires resources, for the administration to ask for those resources. 
   We share again a view that it is prudent for us to develop all of the lands that we currently have available. And pretty significant, again, I don't know whether you were there, but the 88 million acres essentially covers Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Delaware, New Jersey, and most of Maryland. So a pretty large area that is available now. 
   So we want to pursue that, but clearly want to see further exploration, further drilling, and further utilization of our own resources here in this country, all with the view of bringing prices down. 
   Now, we don't know specifically why prices have spiked so rapidly, but we are very concerned about it. As you have heard me say before, prices during the last 8 years of the nineties went from $1.06 to $1.46, about one nickel a year. Prices during the last 7 1/2 years have spiked from that $1.46 to now $4.15 or so. All the energy policies that have been adopted have obviously been adopted in the last 7 1/2 years with President Bush's signature. There is no energy bill that is passed without his signature. So that we believe that we have not been successful over the last 7 1/2 years of getting an energy policy in place which has given us independence and provided for stable prices.     
   Both the President and proponents of the 2005 legislation, which I voted for, by the way, because I think we need to seek energy independence, but the proponents of that bill indicated 3 years ago that it would keep prices down and make sure that we had supply. That hasn't been the case. Obviously, that was not the intent of anybody who was for the bill that that wouldn't happen, but that is the legislation that we currently are looking at. We are developing that now and trying to write the language essentially with the objective of utilizing the 88 million acres that we currently have authorized on which to drill because we think that is the quickest way to proceed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. You mentioned H.R. 6. First of all, as you heard in my list, we are not contemplating adding that into this legislation that we might be considering. However, let me say this, very honestly. You and I both, I think every Member in this body very much supports the free market system. We have found it provides the greatest good for the greatest number throughout the world. 
   In 2005, you put incentives in the bill, $14 billion worth of tax breaks for oil companies. Oil was then, as you point out, about half of what it is bringing today at the pump. The free market system, in my view, is if you are getting a high price for your product, you try to produce more of it and you try to find more of it. The oil companies are earning the highest price that they have ever received in the history of the sale of oil. That ought to be the incentive, not taxpayers who are paying the highest price at the pump they have ever paid, also having to pay higher taxes because the oil companies are getting an incentive of $14 billion of tax cuts to incentivize what ought to be incentivized by the price that they are getting for their product. 
   I want to say further that the information I have, and I think you will find this interesting, is that Exxon made $40 billion in profits last year. I am informed $32 billion of that profit was spent to buy back stock. Not to do additional research, not to drill in America or any place else, but $32 billion to buy back their stock. Obviously that did have a very good effect on those stockholders who remained because their equity clearly went up. I do not criticize that, but I point it out because it was not spent either to produce more oil product, petroleum product, or to pursue alternative energy sources which we think is important which is what we will use the $14 billion in H.R. 6, whether it was hybrid cars, ethanol research, water, wind, hydroelectric, or from my perspective, nuclear. 
   Let me also say that I understand what you are saying, but when we talk about this 68 million or 88 million acres, let me give you this point. The oil and gas companies hold leases on these 68 million now, land and water.  They are not producing on these acreage, and 81 percent, according to experts, of the estimated oil and gas resources on Federal lands and the OCS are currently available for development in these reserves, and they are equal to 107 billion barrels of oil and 658 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. 
   So what we are saying and what we will say in this legislation is that you have about 14 years supply here for America if you would develop this 107 billion barrels of oil or 658 trillion feet of natural gas on the land or offshore that you currently have leases on. 
   So I think this is a good debate to have, and ultimately hopefully at some point in time we will get through the politics of this issue on both sides and we will get to a point where frankly we develop this. 
   But I will also tell my friend that if we focus only on petroleum, we will not serve your young son or my grandchildren--you are much younger than I am--or my grandchildren very well because I will tell you, and as you know, I have a great granddaughter. She is 18 months of age. When she is my age, petroleum will not be her major source of energy. We know that. Petroleum is a wasting resource. By that I mean it is a resource that is going to go away. We don't know how much is left. Experts don't know how much Saudi Arabia still has. But we need to pursue vigorously alternatives while at the same time, as you and I would agree, developing that 107 billion barrels that we have here in this country that are currently available for lease. 
   Frankly, if the companies tell us that they really can't produce from that, then maybe we ought to look at other sites as well. But certainly it seems to us, you ought to use what you have first; and if that doesn't work, we ought to go on to a second or third or fourth site. 
   I thank the gentleman for his tolerance in my taking that time.

   Mr. HOYER. I just want to say that I understand what you have just said. But, of course, they never did have that until the 2005 bill, or one of the tax bills that was passed around that time. Prior to that time, the manufacturers had that, as you observed, that's correct, but the oil companies were never included in it originally or for long periods of time. They were added just in the last 2005 or 2006 or 2004, I am not sure exactly which bill added it. So it is not as if that had been in place when the tax to which you refer, the incentive to which you refer, was originally included in the code.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I cannot confirm, because I haven't seen the report on that, nor has the chairman told me that he made such an announcement. I did read an article in which he indicated that he thought that might be the case. 
   As you know, he tried to move the Labor-Health bill through to markup  through the full committee, and as you know, the ranking member moved to substitute the Interior bill rather than do the Labor-Health bill. 
   The chairman believed he was pursuing the regular order. I have never seen, in the 23 years that I served on the Appropriations Committee, one of the appropriations bills substituted for another one of the appropriations bills in the appropriations process. 
   So a lot of unusual things are happening, unfortunately. And we haven't been pursuing regular order. I lament that, personally. I think that we ought to do that. 
   I will say that last year, as you know, we passed every appropriations bill through the House of Representatives by the August break. We had some difficulty at the end doing that, but we got them all passed. And we passed them all in the year, in the calendar year that we were supposed to pass them, not in the fiscal year, in December. As you know in a number of years we didn't do that until the following year: nine one year, eight the other passed in January, the end of January or the middle of February, as I recall, 2 years. I forget whether it was 2004 and 2005 or 2005 and 2006. 
   So I share the gentlemen's concern. I think both sides share the concern that the appropriations process is not proceeding in the regular order. But I want to say to the gentleman that from my perspective, I have not concluded that we're not going to consider any appropriations bills on the floor.

   Mr. HOYER. Thank you. 
   Senator Reid in the other body has made it pretty clear that he does not believe, again, given the failure to pursue regular order in the Senate, that he will be able to get any bills passed, the Senate appropriations bills. 
   So one of the factors under consideration by Mr. Obey is that if the Senate is not going to consider any bills, that because they cannot get the bills through the House and to the President--of course, the President sent down a number, said, If you go over that number, I'm going to veto all of the bills anyway. And we had real difficulty last year, as you know, with that happening. That's not happened in my career before. I don't mean that a President hasn't indicated he would veto, but there was always room to work on that. 
   But that is one of the complicating factors or two of the complicating factors: the President's position and the Senate's position as well. 
   But I think the major problem is that the regular order Mr. Obey did not feel was being pursued in the committee.

   Mr. HOYER. I would not agree with the gentleman. After all, we did pass the Iraq funding, we passed a very substantive supplemental, we passed a GI bill, we passed an unemployment insurance extension. We passed an energy bill last year signed by the President. I think much of what we passed in our '06 that was passed, that got through the Senate, was signed by the President and supported by a significant number of Republicans. 
   Furthermore, let me just remind you, and I'm sure you recall this, that we took 50 hours longer to do the appropriations bills last year than we did in 2006 when your side was in charge. And we had extensive debate. We had 10 open bills, open rules, and we had two rules at the end, because it was clear that we were having great difficulty getting our bills done in a time cramp. Even under those bills, we spent hours debating them. We spent 17 hours on the Homeland Security bill, for instance, and 12 hours on the Labor-Health bill on the floor.

   Mr. HOYER. But very frankly, it was not a process that we thought was very substantive last year, and every indication that we have received this year, it is not going to be very substantive this year when we consider appropriation bills. 
   Now, having said that, we didn't pursue the regular order on the Labor-Health bill. The gentleman is correct there are five bills which have passed, and I would reiterate that I have not yet, from my standpoint, concluded that we're not going to consider appropriation bills on the floor this year. 
   So I want to make it clear. I'm not sure exactly what Mr. Obey announced. There was an article that said I was supporting Mr. Obey's position. I went a little further. What I supported of Mr. Obey's position was that regular order was not being followed in the appropriations committee, not the representation that you say he made with reference to no bills coming to the floor. 
   I think he's correct that regular order is not being pursued, and very frankly--and I'm going to talk to you about that, talk to my friend about this, because I think it is unfortunate that we have come to this place where the consideration of these bills last year became very politicized, and this year the announcement clearly was very early on out of your conference or your retreat and subsequently that it wasn't going to be a very happy process this year. I don't mean an agreement process. No reason why there should be an agreement. But Mr. Obey has concerns that it would simply be impossible for him to get the bills through.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOYER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee for yielding. 
   I rise obviously in very strong support of this continuing resolution and the three full bills that are attached to it and the other nine of course that will be funded at last year's level with certain exceptions that are necessary to act responsibly. Obviously, passing a CR is never an ideal step. 
   I want to say that as someone who served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, actually 25 years, I guess, I hold that committee in very high regard. And I am pleased that I am following the Representative from Kentucky, the ranking member of this committee, as he spoke not only about the substance of the bill that he has been most intimately involved in, but as well of the respect that he and the chairman have for one another and the ability they have to work together. I think it has been one of the hallmarks of the Appropriations Committee that has been possible. 
   Regrettably, however, very frankly from my perspective, forces outside of the context of the Appropriations Committee, for whatever reasons, whether they are from the administration or from each of our caucuses, has undermined that ability of the committee to work the way it has worked and wants to work. 
   No one in this body is more attuned to the needs of this body, loves this institution more, is more a student of this institution, and very frankly is a better legislator than the chairman of this committee, my friend, David Obey. I want to congratulate him for the extraordinary patience, and he is not known as a patient man, which makes his patience even more extraordinary, that he has been working on a bill that has been so frustrating for him, as well as the committee and the Congress. 
   The CR does contain a number of important funding provisions: an increase  in the Home Energy Assistance Program which the chairman has been involved in all of his congressional career, which spans some 3 1/2 , almost 4 decades. It helps families heat their houses during a winter of high fuel costs. 
   It includes funding for Pell Grants to ensure that college aid is not cut in the middle of the school year so that our students will have access to college; and nutrition funding for women and children struggling with the economic downturn and food prices that confront them. 
   Nevertheless, we are debating, frankly, a CR today because we did not complete the appropriations process. I think that is regrettable. I hope we do not repeat that next year. I see Mr. Wamp shaking his head as a ranking member. I think everybody on the Appropriations Committee wants to make sure that we can complete our process next year. And I think we can. 
   Very frankly, we were confronted, the chairman was confronted with an administration who wanted to limit funding, frankly, far below what was possible in order to meet the responsibilities that we have to this Nation and to our people. 
   Today's outcome was a direct result, in my opinion, of the White House's unwillingness to come to the table to discuss funding levels for priorities, to determine what those priorities are, whether they be the National Institutes of Health, whether they be vocational education programs, whether they be protecting our environment; or, very frankly, whether they be overseeing in a regulatory way the financial community, the failure of which has led us to a very critical time in our country's history. 
   There were 20 programs eliminated. Congress did not agree with all of those. The administration would have slashed funds for crumbling infrastructure, law enforcement, for energy research. Those are items which could have been debated and should have been debated and brought to this floor, but because there was no flexibility, that did not occur. 
   Simply saying, We'll adopt your priorities, Mr. President, is inconsistent with article I of the Constitution which gives to the 435 of us that have been elected by the people of this country to come and to set priorities for our country. We do so in a representative way. The President, very frankly, is elected to make a determination on our product, not to tell us what our product is, but to make a judgment once our product is passed whether or not he will agree. If he does not agree, he vetoes that bill and then we have a determination to make by two-thirds vote that we disagree with his judgment. That is the way that the process should work, not be told that your product is going to be unacceptable unless it is as I tell you. 
   With his veto threat hovering over the entire appropriations process, stifling debate and compromises, that process simply could not continue. 
   I want to again congratulate Mr. Obey. If we do not pass this CR, of course, the government runs out of funding authority on the 30th of this month. October 1 is the beginning of our fiscal year. We really don't have an alternative. The only responsible vote, in my opinion, is to pass this bill. 
   I want to congratulate Mr. Murtha and Mr. Lewis and Mr. Young. I want to thank Mr. Young for the extraordinary leadership he brings to this House. Mr. Young is not of my party, but he is, I think, one of those who has the highest character and care for the people of America. His willingness to work together has been, I think, in large part responsible for us getting a defense product with Mr. Murtha that this House will overwhelmingly support, in my opinion. 
   I want to thank Mr. Lewis as well for helping to bring this bill to the floor. I want to congratulate those with the Homeland Security and the Military Construction and VA parts of this bill.     
   They are bills which have been considered, and I think are going to be overwhelmingly supported. 
   I would urge all of my colleagues, meet our responsibilities, fund our government, come back here in an atmosphere in which open debate as to the priorities of our country is welcomed by all sides, and have a full appropriation process next year. 
   In closing, let me again congratulate and thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his leadership, without which we would not have been able to get this bill as far as it has gotten to its passage and to fund our government in the coming months.

   Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, Chairman IKE SKELTON and the Armed Services Committee have worked tirelessly to put this bill together, and I want to begin by recognizing that hard work. Chairman SKELTON is among this House's most dedicated advocates for our men and women in uniform. And he and his committee have put together a good authorization bill that deserves our support. 
   The bill authorizes a total of $601.4 billion, including $531.4B in budget authority for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy's national security programs. It also includes significant commitments to new shipbuilding, advanced aircraft, and efforts to protect our troops in the field from improvised explosive devices. 
   This bill goes a long way to rebuild our military, which is still battered from years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. It provides for an increase of 7,000 active-duty Army personnel, 5,000 more Marine Corps personnel, and 1,023 more Navy sailors. It dedicates significant amounts for the reset of worn-down armed forces equipment: $8.6 billion for Army and $1.8 billion for Marine Corps. $800 million is also authorized for the Reserve and National Guard, which have borne a heavy share of the fighting. 
   But just as importantly, this bill looks out for the needs of our troops at a time when our country has asked so much from them. They deserve all the support we have to give. That's why this bill gives them a much-needed raise of 3.9%, more than the President's request, blocks increases in their healthcare payments, and authorizes $3.2 billion to expand quality family housing. 
   In sum, this is a bill that strikes a sound balance between the needs of our national defense and the needs of our troops and their families. The road back to full military readiness will be long and hard--but this bill is a big step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation--vital for our troops and vital for our Nation's security.

   Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and I congratulate her for the work she has done. 
   First of all, this bill is $700 million below what the Republican President asked us to spend. All of this stuff about how we're the big spenders, when this bill is $700 million less than President Bush asked us to spend. Number one. 
   I have been in this House for 26 years. Eighteen of those years we have had Republican Presidents. During those 18 years, we have run up $4.5 trillion of deficit spending. One person in America can stop spending: a President. During those 26 years, a veto of a President that was vetoed because we spent too much money has never been overridden. Not once. $4.5 trillion of deficit spending under Ronald Reagan, George Bush I, and 6 years of George Bush II. 
   Now, Bill Clinton was President for 8 years during those 26 years that I have served. And we ended up with a $62.5 billion surplus in those 8 years. And perhaps if you come to this floor and say it enough, the big lie said over and over and over and over again, just like Frank Luntz wrote it for you, maybe the American public will believe it. Isn't it a shame, however, that Frank Luntz can't fix the figures in your budget document. 
   You have been in control, of course, for the last 6 years of everything. And guess what happened? We doubled the rate of spending from the Clinton administration to the last 6 years. Doubled it. And we, I can't know what the geometric figure is in terms of escalating the debt and going from a $5.6 trillion surplus which George Bush, President of the United States, said Bill Clinton left him, and you turned that into a $3 trillion deficit in 72 months. I daresay nobody in the history of the world has done that. Nobody in the history of the world has been that fiscally irresponsible. And for the large part you did it without a single Democratic vote. And you didn't need us to vote, because you were in control of everything. 
   And I sit there and listen to this, and I won't characterize it as my chairman characterized it, although I can't say that I come here and disagree with my chairman, but I won't characterize it. But honesty at some point in time has a virtue. You ought to try it. Just for a little bit.

   Mr. HOYER. My remarks are always addressed to the Chair, in case you need interpretation. Just assume that I am addressing the Chair. 
   Now, if any of my friends when they hear about me talking about irresponsibility would take that personally, understand that it is meant simply to be addressed to the Chair. 
   But if the shoe fits, put it on. 
   My friends, you have been a part for the last 6 years of the most fiscally irresponsible leadership in our history. The facts speak to that. Your budget book speaks to that. And what did you do, this family budget leadership group that we hear talking about? They jettisoned, they abandoned, they eliminated PAYGO provision which, by the way, was adopted in a bipartisan fashion in 1997 after we adopted it in 1990 in a bipartisan fashion. But you said, no, we can't live within PAYGO. That's too tight for us. Families might have to live in that, but we can't live in it. 
   So what did you do? You simply eliminated PAYGO. Well, we've reinstituted PAYGO, and our budget reaches balance. And we don't raise taxes. You like to say we raise taxes because, after all, Frank Luntz told you, Just say they're raising taxes. Doesn't matter whether it's true. The American public will believe it. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this debate is designed to mislead the American public, because they don't read the budgets and the fine print. They perhaps do not remember that in 18 years, Republicans ran up $4.5 trillion of deficit spending while under Bill Clinton's administration we created a $62.5 billion net surplus with 4 years of surplus, the first time that has happened in the lifetime of anybody in this Chamber. 
   So I say to my friends that we can debate the substance of this bill, which is $700 million less than your President asked us to spend. The gentlewoman from New York has brought a responsible bill to this floor. The problem with these across-the-board cuts and what Mr. Obey really meant, Mr. Chairman, is that it is simple to say cut across the board, because you don't have to make any decisions. You don't have to defend any premise. You just have to say cut 1 percent. And as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Israel, does that mean 1 percent in defense spending? Does that mean 1 percent in military financing? Where they purchase, by the way, weapons from the United States of America. Does it mean a 1 percent cut in salaries or administration of critical programs that might be small programs? You don't have to decide. It's so simple. One percent. Won't hurt anybody. Fine. Then say where you want to cut. 
   I was an appropriator for 25 years and I don't like the across-the-board cuts because they are simplistic, imprecise, and cut the good with the bad. May there be bad in this bill? There may be. Offer an amendment to cut the bad and let's debate that, whether it's good or bad. 
   So, my friends, don't talk to me about fiscal responsibility. I've been here too long and I know too many of the facts. You cannot fool me. You can fool some of the people some of the time. You didn't fool them last November. And I don't think you're going to fool them in the future. 
   This is a responsible bill. If you don't like some portions of it, we've had 50-plus amendments for you to strike certain portions of it. But don't come to the floor and pontificate on fiscal responsibility. And, by the way, my friend, the government today is larger than the government when you inherited it.
