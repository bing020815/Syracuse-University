<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to also add my thanks to Mr. Abercrombie and Mr. English and Mr. Castle, Ms. Schwartz, and particularly to  you, Mr. Chairman. The point of this is that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, guardsmen, marines, are not dying in the name of the Republican Conference or the Democratic Caucus. They're dying in the name of the United States of America. We owe them a unified Congress to help them. This bill is a unifying factor here that starts us on the road to behaving as Americans first and political partisans second. Their sacrifice demands nothing less than that. 
   I have a sense of urgency about this that I'm afraid did not come through in the hearing, particularly from Ambassador Crocker. Not that I'm criticizing him. I think he's doing a fine job. And I have no higher regard for anybody in uniform, past, present or future, than General Petraeus. But the sense of urgency I have is to bring us together so that we can move in a meaningful, constructive way, as Congress, to play a role in the civilian leadership aspects and management of this conflict. 
   As has been noted previously, it requires the Pentagon to, in some way, bring Congress in in a meaningful way really on the strategy of the war for the first time. 
   As I said earlier today, the strategy of waiting for the Shia and Sunni in Iraq to try to work, sit down and work something out in a central government in Baghdad is a less than viable option when our men and young men and women are patrolling the streets of Baghdad dying every day and we're asking the taxpayers of this country to spend $3 billion a week for people who half the time boycott their sessions. And to say that we're going to do this until maybe they can get together is not, in my judgment, something that we can endorse. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, the original authorization, which provided basically two things, one is to remove the threat posed by the then-Government of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, who has been captured, tried, convicted and executed, and to enforce the U.S. resolutions with respect to the weapons of mass destruction having been accomplished, it's not the war that we haven't won; it's the peace that we're having trouble with. And I want us to get together as a Congress to move forward to win the peace. That's what our mission is now. 
   And the strategic mission that the administration had been following, the civilian leadership is not working out too well; 4 1/2 years later, one can't leave the Green Zone without getting one's head shot off. I think we need the Congress to engage in a constructive, meaningful way. I think this vehicle will allow that to happen. And therefore, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you and all of those people who had anything whatsoever to do with it. A big bipartisan vote today, I think, will begin this unification process we so desperately need in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, I think I speak for a lot of us when we say that we welcome an intellectually honest debate on the issues that we are charged with confronting on behalf of the American people. And a discussion about the pros and cons of the provisions of the bill, I think, is in order. This is the place to do that. 
   When one talks about, though, ancillary matters, like whether or not this  violates PAYGO, that's why I come down here today. 
   Let me tell you something. Neither party is always right and neither party is always wrong. But we don't need to embarrass ourselves by trying to belittle those of us who are trying to pay the bills. 
   The fact is, during the first six years of this decade, the people who are criticizing the Blue Dogs and the Democratic Caucus for a PAYGO rule, sat here and helped this President borrow more money from foreign sources than all 42 before him combined. You don't have to believe that. That's not an argument. You can go to the U.S. Treasury Web site and look at it and see for yourself. 
   So if we want to talk about the relative merits of the legislation, we welcome that, and we want to talk about that. And we won't always vote alike. We won't always vote with the Democratic Caucus, some of us that are Democrats, because neither party's always right or always wrong. 
   But to come here and criticize us for somehow saying we're violating PAYGO; first of all, there's an unemployment tax that employers pay for this very purpose, and it will fill up the coffers again in time. 
   But don't come here with that, because I think that is not only demeaning and misleading, but embarrassing to some people.

   Robin Beard was a friend of all of ours from Tennessee, and many of you, both professionally and personally. I actually got to know him when he served two stints as Assistant Secretary General in NATO parliamentary, or the NATO organization in Brussels.

   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, when these people say they're going to provide the resources for the war and for the veterans but they're not going to pay for it, what they're really saying is China is going to provide the resources to our veterans; China is going to finance this war because that's what has been going on. They have borrowed more money from foreign sources since George W. Bush took office than all 42 Presidents of the United States before him put together, and they still want to keep borrowing. 
   And talk about working families, we are asking people who make over $1 million a year to increase their taxes $500 for these veterans to go to college so the veterans will not be subject to future deficits and future matters that may be beyond our control where the program has to be cut. 
   This is dedicated funding, and it comes from those in this country who have the most to give to the people who gave the most with no arms and no legs. I have seen them and you have seen them at Walter Reed and Bethesda.

   If we can send more, we can damned sure help them get through college when they get home with one arm and one leg.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act, which sends the message to the Iraqis that we will not commit open-endedly our blood and tax dollars if they are not willing to step up and take control of their own country. 
   We have lost more than 3,200 of our best men and women over the last 4 years and 4 days we have been in Iraq, and more than 24,000 others have come home wounded. We are spending about $200,000 a minute in Iraq. The Iraqi people need to know that we will not continue to do all the work if they are unable or unwilling to put aside their religious differences and come together to build a civil society. 
   Mr. Speaker, I feel that this legislation has been mischaracterized as a timeline on our troops. The true intention of this measure, as I see it, is to put a timeline on the Iraqi people to meet the benchmarks that have already been established by the President. The bill we will vote on today will not withhold a single dollar from our men and women on the ground in Iraq, and it will not tie our commanders' hands but simply holds the Iraqis accountable for taking command of their own country. 
   As chairman of the U.S. delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I have talked at length with our allies who are helping us fight the war on terror in Afghanistan, where we are in a very critical year, with the Taliban planning a new series of attacks on U.S. and NATO troops there. I fear we are threatening our work on that very important effort if we continue to focus most of our resources to a deteriorating sectarian conflict that General Petraeus has said cannot be won with military might alone if there is not timely political and diplomatic progress. 
   I served 4 years in the United States Navy and 26 years in the Tennessee Army National Guard. During that time, it was my duty to carry out the orders handed me by the civilian leadership. Now that you and our colleagues and I are part of that civilian leadership, it is our responsibility to help shape military policy and hold the civilian leadership at the Pentagon and elsewhere accountable for the way they have managed--or mismanaged--operations in Iraq. 
   To that end, Mr. Speaker, I am not willing to keep asking our military families and the American taxpayers to commit their lives and tax dollars forever. The only alternative to this bill is an open-ended bleeding of our blood and tax dollars with no end in sight and no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the changes necessary.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with the other Democratic Members who are veterans to talk about this resolution. 
   I want to start off by saying what Allen Boyd said. I was on active duty during the Vietnam years. The problem here is not the troops; the problem is the competency of the civilian leadership that has gotten us into this mess. 
   This resolution supports our troops and calls for a different strategy by our civilian leadership with respect to Iraq. 
   When I was on active duty when I was in the military, I followed orders. That was my job. My role here in Congress as I see it is to try to help formulate some sort of competent civilian leadership and strategy so the troops can be successful. We have not seen that in 4 years. The war began in Iraq in March of 2003. Since then, we have lost 3,124 people dead and over 23,000 wounded, and it is not a bit better today than it was the day we started. 
   The war has cost Americans almost $400 billion, with another request for $285 billion more, with no end in sight. Competent civilian leadership for our men and women in uniform on the diplomatic and political fronts must be demanded by Congress and the American people if we are to properly honor the sacrifice of the dead and the wounded and their families. 
   Instead, what do we have? We have unbelievable reports that the Pentagon can't identify 170,000 guns issued to the Iraqi forces in October of 2005; some of our soldiers buying their own body armor; up-armored Humvees sitting in Bosnia or Herzegovina while we needed them in Iraq. And David Walker, the Comptroller General, says he believes that almost 30 percent of the money spent over there has been wasted, stolen, or otherwise unaccounted for. 
   I think any patriotic American ought to come to this floor if he or she has the opportunity and ask questions about the incompetency of the Pentagon and civilian leadership thus far. 
   I believe any viable Iraqi strategy to be successful must contain clearly defined goals to hold the Iraqi leaders accountable for their own security. Mr. Boswell, a helicopter pilot in Vietnam, said as much earlier. 
   Our men and women in uniform have performed magnificently. They have completed every task assigned to them. But impressive military might alone is not enough if the Iraqi people cannot or will not make progress in securing their own country and establishing a civil democracy. 
   Western-style democracy works because we have a theory called separation of church and state. When people don't go to the same church, they nonetheless can get together Monday through Friday and build a civil society and get along with each other. If these folks are unwilling or unable to do that for philosophical or psychological reasons, then we can only try to force a square peg into a round hole for so long. It has been going on for 4 years, and they are seemingly incapable. And I say that what we need to do is rethink our strategy and that a pullback to the perimeter is preferable to prolonging a costly and deadly military strategy toward a political goal that is out of reach. 
   Whether or not this new strategy works, I am glad to see that General David Petraeus will be commanding our men and women on the ground. He has proved himself a strong military commander, and I wish him well. It is not his strategy that I question. 
   Here is why this resolution is important to me: not only do the majority of the Iraqis in every poll that has been taken over there say they will be better off if we leave or get out or pull back, or however one wants to talk about it, but what it is doing in Iraq to our effort in Afghanistan. I am going to be leading a delegation to Brussels next Saturday to talk about Afghanistan. We are losing our momentum in Afghanistan because of the Iraqi whirlwind that is sucking everything into it in terms of our military supplies, our military approach, and so forth. Almost everyone who has looked at this situation agrees, from the Baker-Hamilton Report to everybody else, that we need to radically change our strategy. 
   Listen to these words from the Council of Foreign Relations. They say: ``The United States' interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region can be more effectively advanced if the United States disengages from Iraq. Indeed, the sooner Washington grasps this, the sooner it can begin to repair the damage that has been done to America's international position.'' 
   Speaking of Afghanistan, they also say: ``Iraq is siphoning off so many resources that we could end up failing in Afghanistan as well.'' The report warns that Iraq is all consuming and makes it difficult for the United States to address other priorities. 
   That is exactly what we are talking about here, a different strategy for Iran, for our troops to be successful; an accountability from them as to their own security, so that we can concentrate with 26 other nations in NATO who are helping us fight the war in Afghanistan, a war that we can win, a war that we must win, and a war that is every bit as important if not more so in the war on terror than Iraq ever was.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, thank you very much, and I will be brief because we have a lot of Blue Dogs here tonight that are going to speak to this issue, and they will elaborate on what I have to say. 
   The PAYGO rule, as we have here now as Mr. Ross pointed out, is basically what all of us do in our private lives. We live within our means. We pay our bills, and we hope we have some left to invest in the future. This  government has done none of that. And some people around here have argued about the AMT situation that you alluded to, that we don't have to pay for that because it wasn't intended to affect these people; therefore, it doesn't exist. If I said that in Tennessee, they would say that fellow's been in Washington too long. Only in Washington would somebody even dare make a statement as ludicrous as that is. 
   We've also heard people here in this town say deficits don't matter. Well, if deficits don't matter, why don't we abolish the tax code and just borrow what we need? Of course deficits matter; they matter to all of us. 
   Some people around here think the laws of arithmetic stop at the steps of the Capitol and the front door of the White House. Well, they don't, and this is why. 
   As we are plunging this country into debt that's been done on a massive scale in the last 6 years, that no political leadership in the history of this country has gone there, we are transferring more and more of our assets to foreign-held powers. We transferred over $700 billion in the form of interest payments overseas just in the last 72 months. 
   They talk about, well, we don't have to pay for this because we didn't intend it. Somebody's going to pay for it. There's no free lunch. People have been looking for a free lunch since the dawn of civilization. It does not exist, and I would contend that if we are going to keep our moral authority to govern as stewards of this country, then the time and place where we are now, elected to public office, if we do not reverse this and start paying our bills, we will undermine, I believe, that and we'll also undermine this country. 
   I think this is a defining moment for us, and we're going to fight. Davy Crockett was from my district. We're going to make this an Alamo-type situation around this issue because this is a critical tool of this Congress and the American people in order to act financially and responsibly. 
   I can't thank the Blue Dogs enough for their devotion to this idea of we're going to leave this place better than when we found it, and that's what this is all about.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, trade is not a political issue; trade is an economic issue. The economics of this agreement are such that Peru, if you voted for the Andean trade preference, already has access to our markets without regard to tariffs and duty. This is the other side of the coin and will allow us to immediately export into Peru cotton, soybeans, soybean meal, crude soybean oil, beef, wheat, sorghum, peanuts. This is the other side of the Andean Trade Preference Act. So if you believe, as I do, that in this country we can grow more food than we can consume, we can make more stuff than we can buy and sell to each other, then it's not a political argument; it's an economic fact of capitalism that whoever is engaged in that excess production is going to lose their job because we cannot eat all the food we can grow and we can't buy and sell to each other all the stuff we make. 
   So how do we save jobs in this country? By exporting manufactured goods and agricultural products that we can grow and that we can make. This allows us to do better than current law. 
   Now, if you want to vote ``no,'' what do you get? You get status quo. I thought that's what we were trying to change. We don't like status quo. We want more jobs in America. How do you get more jobs? You get more jobs by allowing people who are engaged in excess production to sell it to somebody else out of this country. That's what it's about. 
   There is one more aspect that I would like to touch on briefly, the national security aspect. South America is going to go one way or the other. I was just in Colombia, South America this last weekend. Chavez and Venezuela is against this. Are you with Chavez or are you with America? That really is basically what I am trying to talk about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to join you in thanking Mr. McCrery for his work here. I have enjoyed working with you very much, Jim. 
   I want to speak about section 134 of the bill. But before I do, I've just got to say that some of us in this body are so thoroughly disgusted with the other body right now in the way this bill has been handled. We've found that it doesn't take a lot of political courage to spend somebody else's money that can't vote. And we had, from our committee, the extender package paid for or offset by people who didn't object to the offsets. And because of the Senate rules--or the other body's rules and the ability for some over there to object to a unanimous consent request--they sent it back over here on top of a must-pass bill that is unpaid for and one of the reasons we're in the shape we're in right now. And so I just had to express utter disgust and frustration with the way that it was handled in the other body. 
   Now, as it comes to the bill, when the Secretary came over here with the bill, it was a bailout; it was public risk and private gain. By the wisdom of the body here, we put section 134 of the recoupment clause in which now makes it private risk and public gain, which is the way it ought to be. It is now a situation where we're not talking about bailing out Wall Street or the high flyers. If, at the end of the day, there is a shortfall in the Treasury of the United States, then they will be assessed that shortfall and the Treasury will be made whole by section 134 of the recoupment clause. 
   What the bill does now is it attempts to protect all Americans who have an IRA, a 401(k), or part of a State or local government pension plan. That's why I'm going to vote ``yes'' even though I am so thoroughly disgusted with what the Senate put on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern with one of the proposals being used to fund this legislation. I agree that improving coverage of mental health services is a laudable goal, and long over due, I might add. However, the proposal to help fund this increased coverage through increasing the Medicaid drug rebate is troubling to me. Drug companies already provide deep discounts to Federal and State governments for the prescription drugs covered by the Medicaid program. This legislation calls for a 33 percent increase in that rebate. I hope that a substantial increase in the rebate will not have a chilling effect on research and development for the next generation of treatments for those very patients with mental health conditions we are trying to help today. 
   As everyone knows, I am a strong supporter of pay go provisions. So I want to commend our leadership for their efforts to continue to address these funding issues. The other funding provision being used for the improved coverage in this bill is designed to ensure that any potential conflict of interest created by physician ownership interests in specialty hospitals is limited. I think this provision goes a long way toward creating a more equitable situation for all hospitals. 
   I plan to support final passage of this legislation. However, I hope that we can work together as this process goes forward to negotiate a conference agreement that offers a more balanced approach.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Thank you very much, Ms. Kaptur. 
   I just felt compelled to come down here. And Mr. Regula, I thank you for taking this time. 
   I guess I've traveled more with Paul Gillmor than any other Member. We have traveled together on the NATO Parliamentary Assembly business for at least the last 9 or 10 years, and that's two or three trips a year to the parliamentary meetings of NATO. And during that time, not only have my wife, Betty Ann, and his wife, Karen, become close friends, but I don't have or didn't have a closer friend in Congress than Paul Gillmor. 
   He was not only an extraordinarily talented individual who made people comfortable around him, but he also had a leadership quality that I observed up close and personal many, many times in these NATO meetings. 
   It hasn't been all that easy the last few years. There has been unrest in the  alliance. And Paul was chairman of the Economics and Security Committee during part of that time, and I was a member and succeeded him as chairman. And it was an easy transition from the standpoint that Paul had gained so much respect from our European allies and colleagues that it was easy for us to run that committee in a way that I think was constructive. 
   He was extraordinarily dedicated to his family. He talked about them all the time. And beyond that, he was a man that had a well-grounded sense of himself. He was one who not only cared deeply for his family, his State and his country, but was willing to go out of his way and inconvenience himself time and time again to go the extra mile to try to make things better. I feel very privileged to just have known him and to be a friend of his, and more importantly, him being a friend of mine. 
   I'm going to miss him a lot. I know this House will miss him a lot. The country will miss him a lot. He is currently serving as North American Vice President of NATO PA, and I'm sure that that organization will miss him as well. 
   Thank you for allowing me this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. I thank the chairman for yielding. And I know if anybody has been keeping up with this weekend, I know that they realize and understand that this is not an ordinary time. I believe personally we are here because in this decade we have witnessed financial mismanagement and regulatory neglect which leads us to this morning. 
   Unfortunately, when the Secretary of the Treasury came over and we looked at the proposal, or the bare bones of the proposal, it appeared to some of us that it was all about private gain and public risk. And that was unacceptable for the taxpayers to take the risk to help those referred to as Wall Street. 
   So I have been asked to talk about this recoupment clause, section 134 of the bill, that was finally accepted in negotiations. It says the following: ``Upon the expiration of the 5-year period beginning upon the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, shall submit a report to the Congress on the net amount within the Troubled Asset Relief Program''--this bill. ``In any case there is a shortfall, the President shall submit a legislative proposal that recoups from the financial industry an amount equal to the shortfall in order to ensure that the Troubled Asset Relief Program does not add to the deficit or national debt.'' 
   What this means is we have taken away the private gain-public risk aspects of this act and made sure that the people who are eligible to participate in it will pay back to the Treasury any shortfall that may occur at the end of the program. 
   With this section 134, it is my opinion that this is no longer about Wall Street. This is about the IRAs, the 401(k)s, the pension plans that all American citizens have and that all State governments have at stake in their pension programs. This is no longer, then, about bailing out anyone. It is about trying to put together a plan that will do less harm than we would do otherwise by our inaction to every American citizen's financial security, IRA, 401(k) pension programs. 
   If we have, as Chairman Bernanke, Secretary Paulson, the President and others has said, a colossal or a catastrophic situation happen because of our inaction, it's not going to be Wall Street; it's going to be the 401(k)s, the IRAs and the pension plans that all of us share.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Cohen, I do appreciate this courtesy, and I thank the gentlelady from Oklahoma for allowing me to go ahead and speak. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the Federal response to the tornados that occurred in Tennessee. I left here early last week and went down to my district in west and middle Tennessee to view, with the Governor of our State and others, the tremendous damage that was done, the loss of life that occurred. And I want to say that the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of FEMA were there as I got there last Thursday morning. 
   And as we toured in Tennessee, most of the damage that we saw occurred near Jackson, Tennessee, where our daughter, our two grandchildren and son-in-law live, at a place called Union University. President David Dockery met us there that Thursday morning, and I can only describe the devastation to Union, the dorms and so on as horrendous; and also conclude that it was a miracle that there was no more bodily injury or loss of life than occurred at Union. 
   But the other thing, other than the Secretary and the Director of FEMA being there was, in the aftermath of these tragedies like we've seen, and this is the fourth tornado that has basically hit Jackson, Madison County, Tennessee since 1999, the outpouring of help from friends, neighbors and others there gives one a great sense of resolve and gives one the magnanimous feeling of the human spirit rising out of the ashes of these tremendous natural disasters. 
   Let me just make the observation that we appreciate the quick response of the Federal Government, the State government, all of the FEMA people there, but particularly to the friends, neighbors and my constituents, of those who were injured, who lost everything, their houses gone, it is truly a blessing to see people come together, even under tragic circumstances. 
   I want to commend Mr. Cohen for bringing this. It hit Memphis, also, as well as middle Tennessee and the other States. But let me just simply add my congratulations to those who brought this resolution, and my thanks to those for the recognition of so many who are doing so much at this time to help those who have suffered so much.

   Mr. TANNER. I thank the gentleman. 
   We're here tonight, not because we've asked for a vote but because the Supreme Court, in a recent decision, changed the law of the land or at least clarified what the law of the land is with respect to the second amendment. It could be about almost any subject. We routinely come here after the Supreme Court decides what the law of the land is on a justiciable issue, and we enact, implementing legislation whether its on people in Tennessee or in Mississippi or in Oregon or in Washington State or in the District of Columbia. That's done routinely over and over again. The subject happens to be the second amendment in this most recent Supreme Court decision. It could be about anything. 
   Nobody disputes the fact that the District of Columbia has every right to make its own laws. What we do dispute is that the District of Columbia does not have the right, nor does any other American citizen, to ignore the law of the land. The law of the land, as enunciated in a recent Supreme Court decision, whether one agrees or disagrees, grants to individual citizens the right to bear arms legally. The District has failed to implement that decision, and therefore, we are here tonight. 
   This Childers substitute does nothing more nor nothing less than implement the bare minimum that the Supreme Court said was the law of the land. Whether you like it or not, that is the law of the land when the Supreme Court decides a justiciable issue. 
   This legislation, the Childers substitute, does not in any way limit the authority of the District or the ability of independent authorities in the District to restrict firearm possession. It does not repeal the D.C. law banning a person from the possession of ammunition. It does not amend the D.C. definition of ``restricted pistol bullets.'' It does not repeal the D.C. law providing for strict liability for handgun manufacturers. 
   Quite frankly, many of us live in the District for most of the year now because of our job requirements. I don't want to impose on the District, but I do say this: 
   The District, just like people all over the rest of America, has to implement legislation when the Supreme Court speaks. That's why we're here, not because we asked for this. I, quite frankly, enjoy living in the District and enjoy having the District make the laws that we live under here, but like no other citizen, the District is no different in that they cannot ignore the law of the land even if they disagree with it as cannot the citizens of my State or of any other State.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6842, NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Rules Committee for allowing me this 2 minutes. 
   Those of us who support the Childers amendment are not here of our volition. We're here because the Supreme  Court of the United States, in a clarification ruling regarding, in this case, the second amendment to the Constitution, said that it's the law of the land and certain things must be done. 
   This Childers amendment does this and only this. It does not, for example, have any provisions that would limit the ability of the independent authorities of D.C., such as a public housing authority, from restricting firearms. It does not repeal the ammunition ban. It does not do anything in terms of strict liability for gun manufacturers, as the District law provides, provisions regarding exemptions.     
   All it does is what we would do routinely around here if it were any other group of American citizens in any State or territory. We would say, look, the Supreme Court changed the law of the land that Congress is going to enact enabling legislation to allow for that decision to be instrumental and put into place. And you will do the same whether you live in California, New York, Tennessee, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, wherever. This is done routinely. I don't understand how people can argue that since its the District, it ought to somehow be different than any other American citizen. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, this Childers amendment is very narrowly drawn to only enforce the Supreme Court decision as it relates to that decision; nothing more, nothing less. And whatever the District wants to do outside the parameters of that is perfectly all right with me.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (DEMOCRATIC BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, well, thank you very much. 
   I wanted to come tonight and join with my colleague, Mr. Ross. I heard what you have been saying and I wish this was not true, but all one has to do is go to the Web site of the U.S. Treasury and see for one's self how much money has been borrowed in the last 60 months from foreign sources, and I heard you address that point earlier. 
   I want to talk about a bill that we introduced last Congress that the Blue Dogs endorsed and that we hope to introduce in the next few days in this Congress; and hopefully we can pass it this time. 
   It has to do with the subject of, the theme of tonight's Special Order with regard to accountability. And this is not a Democrat or Republican bill. A lot of times these Special Orders are utilized by people who want to come and blast the Democrats, if they are Republicans, or Democrats who want to blast the Republicans on the other side, and that is not what this floor is for. Politics should end here. We all represent people in this country in a public office and, therefore, all of us represent not political parties in our jobs here but citizens of this country. 
   This accountability bill that I want to talk about for just a few minutes, if I may, has to do with demanding that those whom we appropriate money to, any administration, Democrat, Republican, does not matter, actually manage the money so that we at least know where it goes. We may disagree as to how it is spent, but we at least, as public officials, ought to have the responsibility for ourselves and those whom we represent to understand and appreciate what it is going for. 
   We have here in Washington, the Congress has, an organization called the GAO, General Accountability Office. The GAO is charged with the responsibility, as a nonpolitical branch of the government, to audit, among other things, other responsibilities, audit the various Federal agencies to see what they are doing with the money that we remove from people's pockets involuntarily. And I heard you mention tax day earlier. Today is tax day. We remove the money involuntarily from the taxpayers, the citizens of this country, and then we appropriate to an administration, any administration. 
   Well, the GAO does audits as part of their responsibility, and they have reported to us that 18 of 24 Federal agencies could not produce an acceptable  audit in fiscal year 2005, which is the latest figures that we have. 
   Now, there is no private enterprise in America that could withstand that kind of either sloppy bookkeeping on the one hand, to be charitable about it, sloppy bookkeeping, or out-and-out negligence, incompetence, fraud, whatever one wishes to call it. Eighteen of 24 could not do that. 
   So last year, we, the Blue Dogs, designed a bill that said when that happens, when the Inspector General of any department or the GAO identifies any element or any agency of the Federal Government that cannot tell us what they did with the money that we removed from people involuntarily in the form of taxation and appropriated to them, this bill would provide that within 60 days Congress must, by law, hold a hearing to determine why it is they cannot account for the money that was appropriated to them or, in the alternative, if they cannot account for it, then it is simple: They do not get it. 
   That makes eminent sense to me as a businessperson at home in Tennessee. I cannot imagine going to the comptroller or the treasurer of our business and saying, here is an expenditure of X amount of dollars, what did you do with it, and they would respond, I do not know, I cannot tell you what happened to that. That would not be acceptable in any private enterprise in this country, and it should not be acceptable here in the public domain because it is all of our moneys that we are talking about, 18 of 24. 
   The other aspect of this bill is, in government talk, when the GAO identifies a high-risk program, what they mean is the program is being mismanaged, number one; or two, it is not doing what Congress intended it to do when the law was passed. Pretty simple. It is either the program is not working or they cannot tell us what they did with the money. In either event, Congress ought to hold a public hearing so the people of this country know that this program is either not working or that it is being so badly mismanaged, by again any administration, that we need to stop the spending. 
   I hope as we move through this Congress that we will be able to actually enhance and improve on it; not only 
   that, but actually pass it into law. It needs to be done. It has everything to do with the trust that the American people have placed in us when they voted for us to come here to this arena to transact their business on their behalf. 
   One of the things I like so much about the Blue Dogs is that we have this quaint belief that the voting card that all of us possess as Members of Congress belongs not to either party leadership but to the people who hired us. That is, I believe, what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they created the People's House. 
   And so, therefore, when we have all this talk about partisan politics here, it really has nothing to do with the philosophy of the Blue Dogs in that we believe we ought to work for the people that hired us, and that is the people in our respective districts who have every right to expect that when we come here. We will not only be guardians of the country in terms of funding what is necessary for national defense, and we are very strong on that, as you know, but we also will try as best we can individually and collectively as a body to see that the moneys that are being spent are being spent in the best possible way. 
   I gave a talk at home over the Easter recess, and I told them, I said there are two things that are being witnessed here by this unbelievable not only spending spree, but borrowing spree that has gone on around here for the last 60 months. We have transferred so much of our Nation's treasure to interest, for which we get nothing, that we are degrading basically the tax base to the point where I am afraid in the future our country will not be able to make the two investments that I believe are necessary for our Nation's security. 
   One is in the area of infrastructure. One only need go to any country on the planet where there is no infrastructure, no highways, roads, bridges, water, sewer, all of the things that private enterprise in this country can build around to create the economic opportunity, the jobs, to create the commerce that will result in further tax receipts for more investment, whether it be for water and sewer and highways, airports, bridges, roads, tunnels, anything like that, to see that the government must make those investments so that private enterprise can prosper. 
   Nobody is prospering in these countries. We call them Third World countries, but they are nonetheless countries where there is no infrastructure. Nobody is doing any good because there is nothing to build around to create the economic activity, the commerce that must go on to make things happen. And so we are degrading our tax base by this interest that we are now paying, for which we get nothing. 
   The second thing is human capital. From my reading of history, there is no country in the history of civilization and mankind, or humankind, that has been able to maintain itself as a strong and free country with an unhealthy, uneducated population. We are beginning to see the budget being cut in areas where, number one, we have to have public education because all of us, as American citizens, are charged with the responsibility not only for ourselves and our families, but we are charged with making decisions for our cities, counties, State and country. Without public education for the literally millions of kids who may not get that in their homes, because of various economic factors and otherwise, we have to educate our citizens. Thomas Jefferson said it as well as anybody. 
   The other thing is health care. We are going to be taking up SCHIP, it is called, which is basically children's health insurance. We cannot afford in this country, in my view, to leave it better than when we found it with unhealthy, uneducated children, and so what we are trying to do is stop this ever-increasing encroachment on the tax base of interest so that we are rendered unable as citizens to do the things necessary to keep our country competitive in an increasingly globalized world. This is not just a hope. It is a necessity, in my view, that we be able to do that. 
   So, as we talk about fiscal responsibility, we talk about this unbelievable borrowing that is taking place, what we are really talking about is balancing the budget, not for the sake of balancing the budget, but for the sake of stopping an ever-increasing encroachment on the tax base for which we get nothing. 
   Last year, this country sent overseas $145 billion thereabouts. That is almost seven times as much as the so-called foreign aid bill. I do not particularly like the way we do that, but at least one can make some strategic decisions about money that is being appropriated in the foreign aid bill in terms of whether or not it will advance the interests of the United States in a given part of the world. Interest checks, on the other hand, just go to whoever bought our debt. That is a huge difference, and it is one I hope that people will relate to, understand, appreciate and hold dear when they make the decisions that they make with regard to who ought to be running our United States Congress. 
   Again, this bill basically does not address who controls the Congress or who controls the White House. It simply says that all of us who come here as public servants ought to have that kind of responsibility to oversee and to look after the moneys that are removed from people's pockets involuntarily in the form of taxation and appropriated to any administration.     
   I think, and I am glad that the Blue Dogs share that philosophy and share that opinion, because oftentimes, all you hear coming from these microphones is, well, the Republicans are worse than the Democrats, the Democrats are worse than the Republicans, and they did it to us, so we will do it to them. That is not getting us anywhere. 
   We have much more serious matters to discuss, and we ought to be talking about it in this Special Order. Tonight is one opportunity. I want to thank you again for allowing me this time to talk about these, I think, critical matters that affect us all. There is no Democrat or Republican; we are all Americans. 
   As Americans, we are not doing what we ought to do to do the things that I heard Allen Boyd talk about awhile  ago about what our parents taught us: one, live within your means; two, pay your debts; three, invest in the future. Unfortunately, we haven't been doing any of those, and it's going to catch up with us at some point if we don't reverse it. 
   We are trying, we need help doing it, but we are going to keep plugging away at it. 
   I am very proud of this Special Order that you put together. I am actually really proud of the work that the Blue Dogs are doing.

   Mr. TANNER. That is according to the GAO. There were six that were compliant with the Federal management, financial management law. Commerce, Labor, the EPA, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Social Security Administration. 
   The ones who were not were Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Interior, State, Transportation, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Agency for International Development, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Small Business Administration. 
   There may be valid reasons why they could not tell us what they did, but we ought to have a hearing and find out what those reasons are. If they need help to correct it, and legislation to do so, then we at least would know that; and we could begin to work on that to try to correct this problem. 
   But to ignore it is, in my judgment, an act of irresponsibility by the Congress and by the administration.

   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Lantos and my good friend, Representative Paul Gillmor from Ohio, for helping with this bill, and also the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   NATO is probably arguably one of the most important organizations now in this post-cold war period. NATO, our allies in Europe and Canada, have presently almost 17,000 troops on the ground in Kosovo and 35,000 in Afghanistan. The alliance is strong, and it is very important from the standpoint of being an international organization that can go anywhere and bring order to chaos and back it up with some military capability. That is unique and critical, in my judgment, in this post-Cold War world. 
   NATO itself symbolizes really the cooperative effort across the Atlantic to promote regional and area-wide stability and also to encourage fledgling democracies, particularly in Eastern Europe. This legislation before us recognizes the continuing efforts of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia and Ukraine to become members of NATO and encourages them to continue on that path. It is a statement from the Congress that we believe that what they are doing is important, and we believe that they are moving in the right direction. 
   Since 1989, 10 countries have joined NATO. We have seen Eastern European countries join NATO and make a remarkable contribution to the ongoing effort not only in Afghanistan and in the Balkans, but also as it relates to the furthering of democracy across some of those formerly Warsaw Pact countries. Every President has endorsed the efforts that are embodied in this bill in terms of the expansion of NATO, and this process is not yet complete.  
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Madam Chairman, we have seen, as Mr. Boyd pointed out, an unprecedented amount of borrowing take place since 2001. No political leadership in this country has borrowed as much money as quickly as we have seen over the last 80 months or so. That's just part of the story. Let me tell you the other part of the story. 
   This administration has borrowed more money from foreign sources than all 42 administrations before it put together. And apparently, some here on the floor want to keep doing what we've been doing. 
   This budget resolution is like an aircraft carrier. It takes seven miles to turn an aircraft carrier. This starts the turn back toward some degree of fiscal sanity. Let me tell you what the consequences of what we have witnessed are with this foreign borrowing.  
   Today, because of these practices, we are borrowing. Remember, now, we are in war in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are borrowing from foreign sources $505 million a day, $21 million an hour, which means we've borrowed probably close to $80 million since we started this debate, $351,000 a minute, $5,852 a second, for a total a year of $182 billion a year that everybody around the world is letting us have so that we can maintain, as some would suggest, our standard of living. 
   All of you know that when you degrade your financial base to the extent that we have and that we are continuing to do unless we begin to change courses, as this budget does, this country is going to wind up in the trash bin of history. No country can continue to do this. You would be interested to know that we owe China almost half a billion dollars. We owe Mexico $35 billion. We owe Taiwan $38 billion. Maybe Taiwan will give us a loan so we can defend them against China if that ever occurs. We owe Switzerland $39 billion, Japan over a half a trillion, the UK, Brazil, Caribbean Banking. We owe Luxembourg $70 billion, and it's going up every day to the tune of $500 million a year. 
   This budget starts to turn back toward some degree of fiscal sanity. Everybody in this country knows we can't continue to do what these people want to continue to do without bankrupting ourselves and our children.

   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Two hundred and thirty years ago, Americans threw off the yoke of the British monarch with much fanfare, as everyone knows. But, since then, the American people have celebrated the royals, and they have watched and observed the demeanor of the royal family of Great Britain throughout the years. As a matter of fact, we gave a coveted film award to a woman portraying the Queen just not long ago. 
   But, anyway, a few short weeks ago, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, were greeted by enormous crowds visiting the United States. This was the Queen's fourth State visit following previous visits in 1991, 1976 and first in 1957. 
   Her most recent trip was highlighted by her commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in the New World. When 108 London entrepreneurs set sail on orders from King James I to settle Virginia, that would set the stage for one of the most, if not the most, successful and lasting alliance in modern history. 
   The Queen praised such historic links and bonds of friendship between our two countries when she was here and referred to the fact that our relationship has been built on a shared commitment to democratic traditions and liberty. 
   During her visit, she also noted, as well, our shared future. Just as the settlers of 1607 set out to discover a new world, researchers on both sides of the Atlantic are now seeking to explore new frontiers in medicine and space. This collaboration between British and American scientists is invaluable. 
   The Queen has served tirelessly as an ambassador for the British people, and she has led her country through times of prosperity as well as times of turmoil. It is for these reasons and others that I am delighted to support this resolution.

   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Six days ago, the President imposed a new series of sanctions on the Sudanese government and its murderous leaders. The administration may have sent a stronger message a month ago, but did not. But new American sanctions, however belatedly imposed, are in place. Now the rest of the civilized world must respond. Strong sanctions represent a crucial bridge in efforts to force the regime in Khartoum to give  up its reprehensible program of genocide in Darfur. But it is now readily apparent that we can only cross that bridge with the help of China. 
   Time and again, we have witnessed national interests taking precedence over the destruction of people's lives, their society and their culture. China, purely for economic interests, in our opinion, has stood firmly in the way of a robust international response to the Darfur genocide. 
   It has been 3 years since this Congress declared that the unfolding atrocities in Darfur constitute genocide. Yet, since it began, China has acted as a shield for Sudan against international criticism and tough sanctions at the United Nations. 
   In spite of unimpeachable evidence of genocide and other atrocities, China has continued as Sudan's largest trading partner and the main foreign investor in its oil sector. 
   China's sales of arms and military equipment to Khartoum is even more disturbing. But China has taken it one step further by actually blocking efforts to send international forces into Darfur. 
   Several countries have been resistant. But among the states unwilling to support a robust civilian protection operation to stop the genocide, China assumes a unique culpability because of its influence, its permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, and its role in Sudan. 
   In 2004, China forced the Security Council to water down an oil sanctions resolution and threatened it would veto any future resolutions sanctioning Sudan. 
   China shielded Khartoum against international sanctions while the Sudanese military drove tens of thousands out of their communities and oil regions just to speed exploration. 
   In 2006, China explicitly argued to the Security Council against a peacekeeping deployment to Darfur, arguing that it could not support the resolution because Sudan's government was not yet ready to accept U.N. peacekeepers on its soil. 
   Not only did China oppose the deployment on behalf of Sudan, its Ambassador lobbied hard for the Russians to take the same position. Only under relentless international pressure, with the actress Mia Farrow and others raising the specter that the upcoming Beijing Olympics will become the ``Genocide Olympics,'' has China finally begun to take a few small, constructive steps in the right direction on Sudan. 
   If we are going to save lives in Darfur, it is imperative that we keep the pressure on China to force Sudan to end the atrocities, resume peace talks and bring resolution to the horror known as Darfur. 
   This very important resolution calls on China to condemn explicitly the atrocities in Darfur, to cease military arms sales, to suspend economic cooperation with Sudan and use its influence to urge President Bashir to comply with full and immediate deployment of the African Union peacekeeping force. 
   It also calls on all parties to the conflict to adhere to the ceasefire agreement and allow unfettered access by humanitarian workers to those in need. It's a clear signal to China and Sudan that their relationship cannot and will not withstand the glare of international scrutiny. 
   Unless it wants to permanently scar its reputation, China must act as a responsible world power and use its influence to stop this now. 
   I therefore urge passage and commend the author, my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for her tireless leadership on the Darfur issue. 
   Let me also thank our majority leader, Steny Hoyer, for his consistent and effective efforts to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO RELEASE DR. HALEH ESFANDIARI -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, just a few short months ago, a remarkably accomplished Iranian American woman, Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, made a decision that any of us would make under a similar circumstance. Her 93-year-old mother was failing and she needed to visit her in Tehran without delay. She boarded a flight to Iran, completely unsuspecting of what would unfold. 
   After a visit with her ailing mother, Dr. Esfandiari reached the Tehran airport. As one of the leading Middle East scholars in the United States at the highly respected Woodrow Wilson Institute, she had no reason to believe she was about to encounter trouble. But on  her way to the airport, she was attacked by plain-clothed, knife-wielding thugs and her passport was stolen. 
   This was only the beginning of her nightmare. Iranian authorities refused to grant her a new passport. She was interrogated and put under house arrest. She was told she would not return to the United States. And the ordeal grew worse. Dr. Esfandiari, a slender woman of 67 years, has been detained without just cause ever since, under the outlandish pretense of being an enemy of Iran. And, ominously, late last month she was formally charged with espionage. 
   She now sits in Iran's notorious Evin Prison. She has been allowed to make but a few painfully brief phone calls to her family. She has been interrogated at excruciating length. At the height of absurdity, she has been pressured to acknowledge participation in some kind of alleged coup against the Iranian government. This type of effort at forced confession is beyond absurd. It goes to the heart of the injustice of the Iranian regime. 
   Despite quiet initiatives of diplomacy undertaken by many countries, organizations, and individuals on Dr. Esfandiari's behalf and frustrated by her audacious commitment to the truth, the Iranian security services have done what they know best, and that is arrest without cause. 
   In discussing Dr. Esfandiari's case, news articles have also cited at least four other cases of dual Iranian American citizens deplorably being detained in Iran for no justifiable reason. It is particularly worrisome that two of these detainees, like Dr. Esfandiari, have now been charged with espionage.     
   Oddly enough, what all of these five seem to have in common is a commitment to U.S.-Iranian engagement. The government of Iran has unjustly detained five American citizens without due legal process. And Mr. Van Hollen's resolution today aptly expresses the serious concern we have on their behalf and our justifiable demand that they be released without delay. These outrageous arrests are indicative of the blatant excesses and obvious shortcomings of the Iranian political system, too much tyranny and too little rule of law. This is a matter of basic human rights, and we cannot allow the Iranian government to continue trampling on the fundamental liberties of our citizens in this manner. 
   Ten Iranian parliamentarians have recently formed a Parliamentarian American friendship group. I call on these parliamentarians and all Iranians of good will, all people of good will, to use whatever influence they have to help bring about the immediate release of all American citizens in Iran who are held so unjustly and against their will. 
   I commend my friend and colleague from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) for introducing this important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to strongly oppose a provision that was included in H.R. 2881, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   The underlying bill contains language that would unfairly target a single company located in my Sate and compel them to change the way they do business. There have been no hearings on this issue and I am concerned that there could be considerable unintended consequences if this provision is approved. 
   Inclusion of the language could also put this critical aviation safety bill at risk. I have been told that several Senators have made clear this provision is a non-starter that puts a speedy and successful Conference at risk. 
   At a time where air traffic is in gridlock, I think we have a duty to the American public to pass a bill that can quickly be conferenced with the Senate. Because I do think that we need to move forward on FAA reform, I will reluctantly vote for H.R. 2881. However, I believe that this bill is far too important to be used as a vehicle for targeting a single American company and am hopeful that this issue will be addressed in conference.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill, the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in part A of House Report 110-335, modified by the amendment printed in part B of the report, is adopted.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4351, AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, this rule embodies a fundamental principle of responsible stewardship of this country, and that is to live within our means and pay our bills. 
   There are some folks around here who apparently don't believe the laws of arithmetic apply past the steps of the Capitol or the front door of the White House. Well, they do. And there's some who've said deficits don't matter. Well, if that was true, we'd just borrow what we need to get along and forget about it, not have any Tax Code at all. Everybody knows that that is ludicrous. 
   What we have witnessed over the last 72 months is something that has not occurred in the history of this country since 1776, and that is the willful and knowing plunge into debt by our continued refusal to pay our bills. 
   When they say we can pass the AMT fix and we don't have to pay for it because it was never intended on these folks, and therefore, it doesn't exist, if I said that in Tennessee, they would say that fellow's been in Washington too long; we've got to get him home. That is absurd. 
   The arguments to justify borrowing more money right now for all future generations plus us, to me, are the worst of political rhetoric. 
   Somebody's going to pay this bill. We have asked the CBO, and they say if we don't pay for it, instead of $50 billion, with the interest carry, it will be $80 billion. And so it's not unlike a credit card, and we have a Nation's credit card here. 
   I think we are looking at warning signs all over the world. When people begin to talk about the dollar, when the dollar has fallen to where it is, to when people say maybe the euro is a better alternative for us right now than the dollar, these are warning signs that this country cannot and must not continue down this fiscal path. 
   All of us took an oath to uphold the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I think there's financial vulnerability that has been created and in a way that has never been done before. 
   Go to the U.S. Treasury Web site. This administration and this Congress over the last 6 years, before last year when we started trying to pay the bills, borrowed more money from foreign sources than all 42 administrations before it put together. That's not a political argument; that was the numbers. And the more we do, the more the interest is. We have transferred over $700 billion in interest payments to people around the world. This year we have removed, basically from the tax base that we had in the summer of 2001, $131 billion, by CBO's calculations, every year. 
   When we don't pay the bills when we pass these measures, when we don't pay for them, what we are basically doing is enacting a tax on the American people in the form of interest payments that cannot be repealed. That is wrong. It is, I think, a violation of our oath of office to continue to argue that we can pass bills without paying for them. 
   I thank Mr. Cardoza and the Rules Committee for bringing another bill here, and I hope our colleagues here in the House and the Senate will understand what we're trying to say.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007. My family has owned small businesses in Tennessee for generations, and I understand the unique challenges these family-operated businesses face in remaining successful and meeting the needs of their communities. We also understand their importance in helping fuel the local and national economies. I am proud of the work we are doing here to support small businesses as they continue to thrive and give them the assistance they need to help raise their workers' wages. 
   It is fitting that this is the first major tax package to adhere to the new PAYGO rules this House has re-implemented to curb deficit spending, because ``pay as you go'' is a basic principle that every small business owner we are helping here today already follows every day. I am glad that we are following their lead and operating under responsible business values such as PAYGO. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for the way they have worked together on this bill. I have been a part of the Ways and Means Committee for 10 years, and this is the first major tax bill I know of during that time that has been reported out of our committee by a unanimous, bipartisan vote. I am encouraged by that and hope the bipartisanship will continue as we look forward to the other legislative priorities facing us on the Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We have a choice, another choice tonight. The incentives in these extenders are important to all Americans, and they are critical to job creation. We can do this one of two ways. We can offset the cost of these extenders without adding to this massive debt. That is one of the reasons why we are in the shape we are in right now. All of these offsets that we have proposed to pay our way on these extenders have interestingly enough been approved by the Senate in one form or another. 
   The very people who we are asking to help us with the offsets don't agree with the bill. It is a simple choice. We can pass these tax incentives, fully paid for with noncontroversial offsets, approved by the business community and Senate Republicans, or we can pass them and do what we have been doing, and that is continue to borrow massive amounts from overseas that have put us, Americans, all of us, in a financially vulnerable position. 
   One of the offsets is included in the Senate bill that was sent over here, and the other has been unanimously approved by the Senate in times gone by. So any suggestion that there is something that is controversial or objectionable by the Senate as a reason for inaction in a responsible manner by the House simply doesn't hold water. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope as we start a new day here, and we have been working all weekend on a very important package for our country, that we can at least, on something this important and as noncontroversial as the offsets are, do the responsible thing around here for once.

   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, we have been following the gentleman's economic plan for this country since 2001. I tell you where the spending is, we are spending today this year somewhere, depending on the interest rate, between $85-90 billion more on interest. This is where the spending is. Interest is the second fastest growing part of the Federal budget. We are borrowing money and hocking this country to anybody on Earth who will let us have it. That is why spending is going up, all right. It is going up $85-90 billion a year since 2001 when they started this deal. 
   If you want to continue to do that, we will see how much spending can slow down because you have to pay interest.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (HONORING THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF THE 101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1080, a resolution honoring the extraordinary service and sacrifice of the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army and their families. I am proud to represent in this chamber a portion of Fort Campbell, where the Screaming Eagles are based. 
    This resolution is especially timely as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are currently deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. In April, Major General Jeffrey Schloesser, who commands the Screaming Eagles, took over as the senior U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Under General Schloesser, the 101st Airborne Division took over command of Regional Command East, an area comprised of 14 provinces in eastern Afghanistan. At the same time, three Brigade Combat Teams from the 101st Airborne Division are serving in Iraq. Many of the soldiers have been deployed multiple times in Afghanistan and Iraq, some of those deployments under the command of General David Petraeus, now the Commander of U.S. Central Command. 
    One need only look at the history of the Screaming Eagles to understand the legacy of the 101st Airborne Division. Originally activated during World War I, the Screaming Eagles would go on to serve in World War II, Vietnam, and Desert Storm, along with their most recent deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. 
    During World War II, the soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division would have the distinction of being the first Americans to land in France as part of the D-Day invasion. Nearly 60 years later, the Screaming Eagles became the first conventional unit to deploy in the Global War on Terror; participated in Operation Anaconda, a tough early battle in Afghanistan; and help lead the invasion into Iraq. 
    Mr. Speaker, thank you for joining us today to honor the 101st Airborne Division, the men and women who have earned their place in history. They and their families will be in our thoughts and prayers as they continue to serve with distinction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, as slow as I talk, I'll talk fast. 
   No political leadership in the history of this country has done what these people have done at the White House and here in the Congress in the last 6 years. When they say they oppose raising taxes, let me tell you, they have placed the largest adjustable rate mortgage on the American people in the history of humankind. 
   Just in the last 72 months this country has borrowed more money in a shorter period of time than ever in its history. We're presently borrowing from foreigners a little over $20 million an hour. 
   When in the name of all that is holy are you going to stop? We are trying to pay our bill and you won't let us. The Republicans in the Senate won't let us. 
   When you place a $50 billion debt on every man, woman and child in this country to protect less than 10,000 people who are exploiting a tax loophole, and this is exactly what's happening here, when in the name of all that's holy are you going to quit? When China forecloses us?

   Mr. TANNER. Madam Speaker, I could not improve on the eloquence of my friend, Jimmy Duncan from Knoxville, but I just wanted to join and thank you for bringing this resolution about the Lady Vols. It is a storied program. I went there some years ago now and played a little basketball myself, and I doubt, I told somebody today, I couldn't make the women's team now. 
   But Pat Summitt is really a legend, and she and my Chief of Staff, Vikki Walling were teammates at UT-Martin several years ago. 
   It is not only a sense of pride to those of us from Tennessee for the many accomplishments that the Lady Vols have made over the years, but the graduation rate of the players is something, I think, that is really indicative of the kind of quality program that Coach Summitt and her staff run. And so I want to thank you, again, for bringing this to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (GERRYMANDERING -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. I rarely take out a Special Order. I rarely speak about matters that have something other to do than the governance of our country, and tonight is no exception. I want to talk a little while tonight about something that affects every American, something we, unfortunately, pay little attention to because it is not something that we recognize when we see it or realize what's happening as it's happening, and that has to do with our system of government and the way that the redistricting process as to how we elect Members of the United States House of Representatives has evolved through the years. 
   Gerrymandering has always been a problem; named for the gentleman from Massachusetts some 200 years ago, when district lines were first conceived and drawn. But really, the modern-day gerrymandering that I am going to talk a bit a little while tonight began really in 1962 and, interestingly enough, it came to the Supreme Court from a case out of Tennessee, my home State. Let me give you a little summary, a history. 
   During the first half of the 20th century, Tennessee, along with many other traditionally rural States, experienced growth in urban areas, along with a decline in the rural population. In the late 1950s, Tennessee continued to use election district boundaries set over 60 years before to elect members of its State legislature. These district boundaries no longer reflected the true distribution of the State's population. 
   By retaining the outdated election district boundaries, rural citizens were allotted a greater proportional representation than their counterparts in urban areas. The continued use of the outdated district boundaries eased the reelection of incumbent legislators and diluted the voting power of ethnic minorities and others living in urban areas. For example, the number of Memphis voters electing one State representative was 10 times the number of voters electing a representative in some rural districts in our State. 
   After serving in World War II, a gentleman named Charles Baker returned to his hometown of Millington, Tennessee, in my congressional district, our congressional district, which is a suburb of Memphis. 
   Baker entered politics and, in 1954, was elected chairman of the Shelby County Quarterly Court, a fiscal and legislative body that ran the affairs of Shelby County, Tennessee, which included Memphis. 
   Baker became frustrated with the lack of State revenues and attention paid to Memphis. Due to the use of outdated election district boundaries, Memphis was represented by half the number of State legislators it rightfully deserved, based upon its population. 
   Baker brought a lawsuit against Joe Carr, Sr., who was then Tennessee's Secretary of State, requesting the State legislature redraw the election district boundaries to reflect the actual demographics of the State. In a 6-2 ruling in the case of Baker v. Carr, the United States Supreme Court held that Federal courts have the power to determine the constitutionality of a State's voting district. 
   In a decision delivered by Baker v. Carr, the court focused on the issues of whether the court could involve itself in an apportionment dispute, and in addressing this issue, the court held that apportionment was a Federal claim arising under the 14th amendment and therefore subject to judicial scrutiny by the courts. Additionally, the voters initiating this case had claimed that their votes were being arbitrarily impaired or debased. 
   The court's decision sidestepped the prior decision in Colegrove by distinguishing claims brought under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment from those claims brought under the guarantee clause of article 4 of the Constitution. 
   The court returned the case to the district court for further actions pursuant to their instructions. I quote, ``We conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable Constitution cause of action on which appellants are entitled a trial and decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the 14th amendment.'' 
   By holding that voters could challenge the constitutionality of electoral apportionment in Federal court, Baker v. Carr opened the doors of the Federal courts to a long line of apportionment cases. One year later, Justice Douglas extended the Baker ruling by establishing the so-called ``one man, one vote'' principle in Gray v. Sanders and, in 1964, in the case of Wesberry v. Sanders, extended that principle, further holding that, ``as nearly as practicable, one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the system that we have after 40-plus years of the court turning over electoral redistricting to the ``ins'' has resulted in a broken system, in the view of myself and Mr. Wamp, who couldn't be here tonight, from Chattanooga, and also on behalf of the Blue Dog Coalition, which has endorsed the legislation I am speaking about. 
   What we are concerned about is the rise of not only reapportionment based on party ideology and party lines, but it has given, with modern technology, the ability of the ``ins,'' be they Republican or Democrats, to select their voters rather than their voters selecting them. 
   If one looks at the electoral map, one can only wonder how in the world could this come about, with lines going  down highways and across bridges and every sort of conceivable spider web district, where the voters really have little input and almost no say in what districts they are in. 
   We have, by in essence turning over to the ``ins,'' given rise to this completely understandable phenomenon. As a Democrat, it behooves me to give my next-door neighbor all my Republicans and it behooves my next-door neighbor Republican to give me all of his or her Democrats, which means that both of us have a more secure seat and the voters are often completely left out of the mix. 
   There are many groups that are now looking at this and beginning to realize that the system is truly broken. And so let me just give you some statistics that may shock you about the lack of competitiveness in this Congress and in the Congresses to come if we don't fix it. 
   Increasingly, State legislators, for wholly understandable reasons and for their own political purposes and ours, are redrawing congressional lines even outside of the traditional 10-year cycle. If I live on Elm Street in any town in America and the ``ins'' redrew the seat, I could be put into a district that is 80 percent one party or the other and therefore my vote has been effectively removed from me. I can't help the 80 percent. The 20 percent don't need me. And so my vote in a congressional election really doesn't matter any more. 
   Competition in congressional races has declined dramatically over the last 40-plus years. In 1946, just over 85 percent of incumbents were reelected to the House of Representatives. In 2002 and 2004, close to 99 percent of incumbents were reelected. In 2004, only 22 contests in the entire country were decided by a margin of less than 10 percentage points. In 2002, 36 House contests were decided by a margin of less than 10 percentage points. Thirty-six. That is less than 10 percent of the House. 
   At the other end of the spectrum, 172 winning candidates in 2004 either had no major party opposition or had a margin of victory by at least 40 percentage points. According to Patrick Basham, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, today, a healthy, unindicted incumbent in the House of Representatives stands a 99 percent chance of being reelected. Something is wrong with a system where there is more turnover in the Soviet politburo than in this House. 
   Even looking at the 2006 midterm elections, which many have called a watershed, less than 10 percent of the seats in the House changed hands. Unfortunately, we know this: The less competitive the election, the less likely voters are to get involved. 
   The House of Representatives is a truly unique institution. It is the only political office that I know about where one cannot be appointed or one cannot accede to a seat in the case of a death or resignation. Every Member of the House of Representatives has to stand and be elected. That is why, when someone dies or resigns in the middle of a term, the seat stays vacant here until there is a special election. 
   One can be President without being elected. We know President Ford was. One can be a Governor, one can be a United States Senator. But only here does everyone have to be elected. 
   I believe political vulnerability is essential to the health of our House, and our current system does not do that. As I said, advanced map drawing techniques allow politicians to select their voters instead of the voter selecting their leaders. When Members come here from these districts that have been gerrymandered, they are good people, but they have little incentive really to work across party lines in order to reach solutions. As a matter of fact, they have a disincentive because if their district is skewed so heavily one way or the other, then the election is really in the party primaries, where barely more than a third of the people, in most instances, are the highly charged partisans, either Democrat or Republican. And so if one comes here wanting to work across the aisle, one has to, as we might say in Tennessee, watch one's back, because the highly charged partisans don't like that. 
   When you have a situation like we have in America, where there is and must be a middle for all of us to come together and reach solutions, when that middle shrinks to the point where we cannot do that, then in a multi, everything-society like ours, we are going to create polarization, and gridlock will then ensue. That, in part, is what is happening.     
   The other phenomenon is this drawing of congressional districts under a recent Supreme Court ruling any time one can get enough power in one State to do so. 
   Now, if one wants to conform to the one person-one vote rule based on a census, and then is allowed to draw lines based on that census 8 years later, all you have to go is go to an 8-year old phone book and try to call somebody. That, to me, makes no sense. But what happens here is a debasing of the voter influence and really a usurpation of the power of the people by politicians, of which I am one, and that is why I am trying to change it. 
   David Winston, who drew the House districts for the Republicans in this case after the 1990 United States census, said, ``As a map maker, I can have more of an impact on an election than a campaign or the candidate. When I as a map maker have more of an impact on an election than the voters, the system is out of whack.'' 
   Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich had this to say: ``Democrats get to rip off the public in the States where they control and protect their incumbents, and we get to rip off the public in the States we control and protect our incumbents. So the public gets ripped off in both circumstances. In the long-run, that is a downward spiral of isolation.'' That is former Speaker Gingrich. 
   David Broder, a well-respected columnist, said this about it: ``At the founding of this Republic, House Members were given the shortest terms, half the length of the Presidents, one-third that of the Senators, to ensure that they would be sensitive to any shifts in public opinion. Now they have more job security than the Queen of England, and as little need to seek their subjects' assent.'' 
   Some States, to their credit, have tried to reform their redistricting systems, and have failed. California and Ohio are two of the most recent examples. Thirteen States have some form of independent commission or process that has a part in the drawing of the congressional map, and nearly half the States ban mid-decade redistricting. However, much more, in my view, needs to be done, and it will take Federal action. 
   The House of Representatives is a Federal office and article I, section 4 of the Constitution gives the Congress the ability to set parameters for election to the House. In fact, it is only fair that Members come from districts that are derived from using a uniform process. 
   The Campaign Legal Center, the League of Women Voters, the Council For Excellence in Government and other advisory groups have joined together with assistance from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to form Americans for Redistricting Reform, which will hopefully raise awareness of the problem, promote solutions, and serve as a clearinghouse of information. 
   We have had a bill in, H.R. 543, that we have introduced that would mandate to the States that they must have in terms of the congressional seats, it doesn't matter, they can do anything with the State senate and State house seats that is constitutional, that they put in place an independent commission that will draw the congressional district lines once every 10 years after the census. 
   By the way, Mr. Speaker, I will include for the record Mr. Broader's article that was published in the Washington Post, and also an article by Gerald Hebert and David Vance on this subject. 
   I am not going to take the whole hour, but I wish people, our citizens, would realize what is happening to us. The Congress is acting, in my view, irrationally. We have not a parliamentary system, but a representative system, and yet, time and time again, we see votes in committee here in the House and on the board behind me, all the Democrats voting one way, all the Republicans vote another. 
   I am a Democrat from a southern rural district. It is not logical nor rational for me to vote every time with urban Members or urban Members to  vote with me just because we are Democrats. It also makes no sense for all the Republicans to vote together in every way all the time. 
   You see the Centrist Caucus, a centrist body here, continuing to shrink, and, as it does, the polarization, and as Speaker Gingrich said, the isolation here becomes more palatable and it makes it far more difficult for us to actually reach solutions to the myriad of problems that face our country. I don't know how to fix it, other than to start where it begins, and that is at the drawing of congressional districts process, because otherwise all of us here will be more sensitive to either the partisans on the left or the partisans on the right, rather than to the overall good of our country. 
   In this bill, Congressman Wamp and myself are asking people to give up an enormous amount of power. There are not many places where you can go and with your friends in the legislature sit down and draw a district that you can win without a whole lot of pushback really from anybody, but in collusion with the other party. When the Supreme Court turned it over to the ``ins,'' they set up a system that after 40-something years results in exactly what we see. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this bill is an attempt to bring some reason to the concept of congressional districts that have more of a community of interest than they do Democrat or Republican voters. I know I am speaking against myself, and I certainly don't mean for this to reflect on any Member here, because the Members are basically themselves victims of this system that has grown into being after 40-something years of congressional redistricting based on political considerations rather than community of interest and so forth. It makes no sense for someone on Elm Street at 301 to be in a different congressional district from someone on Elm Street that lives at 303. Most communities have legislative interests, not individuals, and that is what I am afraid we have become victimized by. 
   We will be talking some more about this in the future. I think you will see more and more articles written about it, because there is, in the view of many, a problem, a serious problem, that cannot be fixed until we address the core of it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the articles referred to earlier.  
   Redistricting Must Be Fixed Before Census  
   Partisan abuse of redistricting is one of Congress' dirtiest little Secrets. The outrage over partisan gerrymanders fades well before the next census rolls around, and this travesty of our democracy never gets addressed. 
   Backroom deals by both parties have produced bulletproof districts from Florida to California, fueling voter apathy and undermining our democracy. Elections are determined before the voters ever have the chance to go to the polls. 
   Tonight, Rep. John Tanner (D-Tenn.) and other Members will take to the House floor to draw attention to the abuses of the redistricting process. Last week, Tanner and Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) introduced H.Res. 1365, advocating the use of nonpartisan redistricting commissions to draw Congressional districts. This resolution, and an earlier bill to revamp the process, will not endear these Members to many of their colleagues sitting in completely safe districts, virtually assured of reelection after re-election. 
   With redistricting abuses on the rise, the public is becoming increasingly aware of the problem. Our organization, the Campaign Legal Center, along with the League of Women Voters, the Council for Excellence in Government and a diverse group of advisory organizations, have founded a new organization called Americans for Redistricting Reform. With financial assistance from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the goal of Americans for Redistricting Reform will be to raise awareness of the problem, promote solutions and serve as a clearinghouse of information and networking. More information can be found on americansforredistrictingreform.org. 
   Our organizations see the launch of this group as vitally important work, as our nation prepares for the upcoming 2010 Census and another round of redistricting, one that will surely be marked by gross partisan gerrymandering unless there is reform of the redistricting process. 
   Redistricting abuses may have evolved into more of an exact science, but the practice is nearly as old as districts themselves. The term ``gerrymandering'' dates back to 1812, when a partisan redistricting in Massachusetts resulted in a district that one newspaper editor observed looked like a salamander and dubbedita ``Gerrymander'' after the state's governor, Elbridge Gerry. Since that time, gerrymanders have taken different forms. Parties have used racial gerrymandering to dilute minority voting strength, partisan gerrymandering to solidify one-party control, and bipartisan gerrymandering to protect Representatives from both parties. 
   The post-2000 redistricting cycle saw unprecedented efforts to use redistricting for partisan purposes. Technological advances made it possible to calibrate districts using election data with even greater precision. The result was that the 2002 elections produced the fewest ousted incumbents ever--only four Members were voted out of office. Historically, post-redistricting elections have generally been more competitive because the drawing of new lines mitigates incumbents' advantage by introducing them to a new group of voters. The 2000 redistricting round had the opposite effect. 
   As redistricting has become ever more clinical, moderates from both parties have been driven from Congress in droves. In 2002, one of us saw our Representative voted out of office after 16 years as a result of a redistricting in Maryland designed for just that purpose. Rep. Connie Morella was a moderate Republican, popular with colleagues from both parties, who would cross the aisle and her party's leadership. in order to pass common-sense legislation for the good of her constituents and the Nation. As moderates like Morella have disappeared from the halls of Congress, the partisan gridlock has sunk deeper roots into Capitol Hill to the detriment of our democracy. 
   Even after the initial round of redistricting following the 2000 Census, partisans in some states used mid-decade redistricting, or re-redistricting, to further advance partisan goals. A handful of states attempted to redraw existing, valid district lines. Absent a court order invalidating a redistricting plan, there is unlikely any other purpose that motivates a mid-decade redistricting other than partisan gain. 
   Make no mistake, when politicians engage in extreme partisan gerrymandering, it is the voters who suffer. In the case of Texas' mid-decade redistricting, in which one of us represented most of the Congressional delegation's Democrats, the Republican Party gained seats in the short term but the state lost critical seniority when the Democrats regained the majority in the House. 
   Texas Democrats who lost their seats in the gerrymander led by then-Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) would likely have been holding vast power in Congress today, such as Martin Frost, who could be chairing the Rules Committee; Charlie Stenholm, Agriculture; Jim Turner, Homeland Security; and Max Sandlin, a Ways and Means Subcommittee. The junior Republicans from Texas who replaced those powerful incumbents have very little influence in the House. DeLay's scorched-earth policy on re-redistricting left citizens of the Lone Star State holding the bag. 
   Partisan abuse of redistricting is a shameful blot on our democracy. Politicians have absolutely no business choosing their voters. In a true democracy, voters must choose their politicians. In the 110th Congress, two bills, H.R. 543 and H.R. 2248, have been introduced to overhaul the Nation's redistricting process, but both have beat referred to a subcommittee where they have yet to see the light of day. At the very least, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) owe it to the Nation to see that hearings are held on these bills. The system must be changed, and hearings are the first step. 
   The 2010 Census is just around the corner with partisan gerrymanders close at its heels. If we don't move quickly, the train will have left the station yet again and Congress will feign dismay and continue to talk about the need to fix the system the next time around.   
   Voting's Neglected Scandal  
   When Barack Obama decided last week to throw off the constraints on campaign spending that go with the acceptance of public financing, he was rightly criticized for rigging the system in his favor. 
   That was a predictable response. For the better part of four decades, the media and public interest groups have focused on campaign spending as the most serious distorting force in our elections. 
   Meanwhile, they have paid much less attention to what may well be a larger problem: the way that district lines are drawn to create safe seats for one party or the other, in effect denying voters any choice of representation. 
   It is not a new problem. The original gerrymander was a creation of 18th-century Massachusetts, and since then, politicians have been using ever more sophisticated tools to rig the game. With computer technology, their ability to design districts that meet the legal requirement for equal population while guaranteeing their fellow partisans easy passage into office has never been greater. 
   In 2002 and 2006, the most recent off-year elections, about nine out of 10 congressional districts were won by more than 10 percentage points--a clear sign that the game had been rigged when the lines were drawn in the state legislatures. In the first of those years, only eight incumbents lost; in the second, only 21. 
   As scholars have pointed out, the scarcity of real competition in nearly all districts has many consequences--all of them bad. It makes legislators less responsive to public  opinion, since they are in effect safe from challenge in November. It shifts the competition from the general election to the primary, where candidates of more extreme views can hope to attract support from passionately ideological voters and exploit the low turnouts typical of those primaries. 
   Gerrymandered, one-party districts tend to send highly partisan representatives to the House or the legislature, contributing to the gridlock in government that is so distasteful to voters. 
   These are familiar complaints in academic and journalistic circles. And this week, another count was added to the indictment with a report from the Democratic Leadership Council titled ``Gerrymandering the Vote.'' 
   It makes the point that these rigged districts have the effect of suppressing the vote. 
   The numbers are startling. In both 2002 and 2006, voter turnout in districts where the winner received at least 80 percent of the votes struggled to reach 125,000. Turnout in the districts where the margin was 20 percent or less exceeded 200,000. 
   If there were some other device that was reducing voter turnout by almost 40 percent, you could be sure it would be the chief target for reformers. The ballot anomalies and the ``voter suppression'' tactics that marked the Florida election of 2000 affected far fewer people than that. 
   The study by the DLC's Marc Dunkelman found big variations among the states in the competitiveness of their House districts. The average margin in Massachusetts in 2006 was almost 75 percent. Next door in New Hampshire, it was under 5 percent. 
   Dunkelman calculated the potential turnout increase for individual states, if their district lines were redrawn to emphasize competitiveness. The gains ranged as high as 59 percent for Louisiana and 49 percent for New York. Other states that could experience much higher participation with redrawn districts include West Virginia, Virginia, California, North Carolina, Alabama, New Jersey, Mississippi, Georgia, Hawaii and New Mexico. 
   Dunkelman estimates that competitive districts might attract 3 million more voters in California and almost 2 million more in New York. Overall, 11 million more Americans might show up at the polls, decreasing our chronically low voting participation rates. 
   How to change the lines? Two states--Iowa and Washington--have instituted nonpartisan or bipartisan redistricting systems, and they have been rewarded with much more competitive House races. So it can be done. 
   But the politicians are unlikely to do it on their own. Only if the voters demand reform is there a chance it will come.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. 
   We all share the goal of adequate access and reasonable prices for prescription drugs for our nation's seniors. I believe that the Medicare prescription drug program can be improved and one improvement will be to allow the Secretary an opportunity to try to negotiate for lower prices. 
   While I do support this legislation, I want to make it clear that I do not support any government-imposed restrictions on patients' access to their medicines. Nor do I support government price controls on prescription drugs. Each patient must have access to their doctor prescribed medicines without a government bureaucrat blocking that access. I also do not support the imposition of government price controls that might restrict access to medicines and the development of new medicines needed by those with conditions like Alzheimers, ALS and cancer. 
   I believe that provisions in H.R. 4 that protect against government imposed formularies is the right policy. In supporting H.R. 4 today, I am saying Yes to negotiation, No to government-imposed restrictions on patient access to the drugs prescribed by their doctors and No to government price controls.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I understand this or any administration's defensive posture when it comes to criticism of policy. And I understand the members of his party feeling the need to defend it. This interim report, ordinarily, I would be one who would wait until September. But this interim report that shows an appalling lack of progress on the political front in Iraq leads me to this conclusion. 
   I was on active duty for 4 years during Vietnam, and I went down to Vietnam Wall the other night; 50-something thousand dead American names down there. We have now, 3,500-plus dead American names on the Iraq wall. 
   And what was true then, to me, is true now. And General Petraeus himself said it not long ago when he said, military action is necessary, but any student of history recognizes that no military solution to a problem like  Iraq is there. Military action may be necessary, but it is not sufficient. There needs to be a political aspect. 
   The political aspect, as reported in this interim report, shows this: Of the 275 members of the Iraqi parliament, over one-third are presently boycotting meetings. Over one-third of the ministers are boycotting the meetings. Two years after the Iraqi elections, the government there is dysfunctional. 
   Now just listen to General Petraeus's words. We have to have a political aspect. And this present strategy, whether the surge works or not, is beside the point. These people are unwilling or unable to come together, after 2 years of a government, to work together to build any kind of civil society that we can support. 
   I think that it is now time, with this interim report and the lack of political progress there, to send a message. Nobody's talking about precipitous withdrawal. What we are talking about is this Congress engaging with this administration to support the troops and help them from this morass.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) for his efforts in this regard and to say  a few words, so I will yield myself such time as I may consume before I recognize the gentleman from Virginia. 
   The genocide in Darfur has taken a horrific toll on that region. Well over 60 percent of the villages have been destroyed, 2 million people displaced, 400,000 killed, and 200,000 driven into refugee camps in neighboring Chad. 
   Thanks to the work of tens of thousands of Americans, the genocide has not been ignored. All over the country, local communities have been organizing and mobilizing with regard to this issue. 
   In response to the call for divestment from Sudan, 20 States have adopted divestment from Sudan policies and another 20 have it under consideration; 58 universities and colleges have adopted policies to divest pension funds from Sudan and another 47 are pursuing similar policies. 
   In addition, 10 cities, eight international and religious organizations and eight countries have either adopted policies or are in the process of so doing, while seven major international corporations have ceased doing business with the government in Sudan. 
   While this Congress, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and President Bush have described atrocities in Sudan as genocide and hold the Sudan overwhelmingly responsible, the international community has yet to come together to put an end to the genocide. 
   I want to commend the American people for not giving up on this issue. The U.N. is deploying peacekeepers. Foreign and civil society groups are also involved. 
   Muslim pop stars from around the world recently came together at a charity concert for Darfur. The head of the sponsoring organization, Islamic Relief, said, ``British Muslims must unite and raise their voices over the issue of Darfur.'' 
   We cannot allow our voices to remain silent. Therefore, I urge all of our citizens and activist organizations to continue speaking out on Darfur and to continue pressure for economic sanctions and real civilian protections. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   In the process of the Darfur genocide, women and girls have been targeted specifically. And I will let her speak more about this, but when women living in refugee camps, for example, were asked why they went to fetch water and risk rape rather than the men, they answered, If we let the men go, they will be killed. It is better for us to be raped than for our husbands to be killed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me thank Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE for introducing this resolution, which condemns the recent vicious and deadly assault on African Union forces. 
   On September 29, 2007, an estimated 1,000 members of a heavily armed group of Darfur rebels overran a small African Union base in Haskanita in Darfur. Ten peacekeepers were brutally killed, seven wounded, and 50 others are missing. Seven of those killed were Nigerian soldiers. The other three were unarmed military observers and civilian police officers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana. With consideration of this resolution today, the U.S. Congress sends its condolences to their respective governments and to their families who have made the ultimate sacrifice in a war far from their native soil. 
   While the nations of the world deplore the war in Darfur and have provided significant humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons, we still have not demonstrated the will to end this crisis. The United Nations is intensely lobbying countries to provide helicopters for a U.N. African Union peacekeeping force, one of many obstacles to starting the mission. According to recent reports, no country has made a credible offer to provide the 24 transport and attack helicopters needed for the 26,000-strong force.     
   This lack of helicopters, in part, accounts for the deadly attack on AU troops. 
   After Rwanda, the world said, never again, never again would we stand by and let another genocide take place; yet we continue to fail in Darfur. For over 4 years now, we have failed. 
   Today, our Congress calls upon our allies and friends to help put an end to this nightmare. We call on the Sudanese Government, its militia and rebel forces to take up seriously peace negotiations in that part of the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (RECOGNIZING THE RELIGIOUS AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FESTIVAL OF DIWALI -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Our colleague and my friend, Mr. Wilson of South Carolina, introduced this resolution that seeks to recognize the significance of the festival of Diwali. Diwali is celebrated as victory of good over evil for some, and as a remembrance of liberation for others. Ultimately, it is a day of joy celebrated annually by Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains throughout the world, particularly by Indians and Indian Americans. 
   With more than 2 million devotees of these faiths in our country, this resolution honors this holiday and those who cherish its message. 
   There are few religious holidays that are celebrated by a multitude of faiths, and it is a tribute to the diversity of India and to our country that we have such a rich religious heritage in our societies. By celebrating Diwali, we also are celebrating this diversity, a shared value that has brought the United States and India closer together through the years. 
   Much has been said about our two countries being natural partners in this world; and the importance of having multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and, indeed, multi-religious societies cannot be overemphasized. 
   For these reasons, I look forward to celebrating this festival and strongly support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TANNER. (CALLING ON CHINA TO RESPECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF REFUGEES FROM NORTH KOREA -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume in speaking on behalf and in support of this resolution. 
   I would first like to thank our colleague, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, ED ROYCE of California, for introducing this resolution. 
   North Korea is quite literally, as we know from satellite images, one of the darkest places on Earth. One can see that when these images are taken from space at night. It has an underdeveloped economy which cannot supply even the most basic utilities. People there live under this darkness. 
   It's well-known that the North Korean regime regularly uses imprisonment, forced labor, torture and execution to intimidate the people into submission. Therefore, many try to flee their country each year, thousands crossing into northeastern China. 
   Some are driven by starvation or desperate poverty. Some flee because they fear persecution for their thoughts and beliefs. 
   I would say that given this situation most North Koreans, given the choice, would leave. So the regime clamps down ruthlessly to stop this flow of refugees. 
   Yet, the sad fact is that those who successfully make it may face further human rights abuses by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Beijing is fearful of attracting too many refugees. So it tries to disincentivize the North Koreans. 
   The government sometimes imprisons these people who cross into China; and in an attempt to avoid its responsibilities under the United Nations Conventions and Protocols that govern the status of refugees, to which the PRC is a signatory, China falsely labels North Korean refugees as economic migrants. 
   This cynical excuse Beijing uses to thwart the legitimate needs of these refugees will not allow the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees access to northeastern China to assess the welfare of the North Koreans who are there. 
   The disturbing truth is that those in China go to great lengths to attract North Korean refugees through sex and labor trafficking. 
   H. Con. Res. 234 calls on Beijing to stop this awful charade and live up to its moral and legal obligations. It further demands that China stop repatriating North Korean refugees; that it honor the United Nations Conventions and honor the status of refugees; and that it provide unfettered access to the U.N. High Commissioner on this subject. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution.  
   North Korea is quite literally one of the darkest places on Earth. Satellite images show us that North Korea at night is covered in an eerie black, in sharp contrast to the bright lights emanating from the lively, modern cities that dot the rest of North East Asia. 
   This dramatic image is stark evidence of North Korea's backwards, underdeveloped economy, which cannot supply even the most basic utilities. 
   But it is also a cold reminder of the horrific conditions that the North Korean people, who live under the cover of this darkness, must endure. 
   It is well known that the North Korean regime regularly uses imprisonment, forced labor, torture, and execution to intimidate the people of North Korea into submission. 
   It is no wonder that so many North Koreans attempt to flee their country. Each year, thousands and thousands cross the border into Northeastern China. 
   Some are driven by starvation or desperate poverty. Some flee because they fear persecution for their thoughts, beliefs, or simply because a member of the regime has arbitrarily labeled them a risk. 
   Pyongyang knows that given the choice most North Koreans would leave, and so the regime clamps down ruthlessly to try and stop the flow, making an already dangerous trek even more perilous. 
   Yet, the sad fact is that those who successfully brave the hazards of the border crossing face further human rights abuses by the government of the People's Republic of China on the other side. 
   Beijing is fearful of attracting too many refugees, and so it brutally tries to create disincentives for North Korean refugees. 
   The government imprisons North Koreans who cross into China, subjecting them to terrible conditions and abuse, only to repatriate them to North Korea, where they face likely torture or execution. 
   In an attempt to avoid its responsibilities under the United Nations Conventions and Protocols that govern the status of refugees, to which the PRC is a signatory, China falsely labels North Korean refugees ``economic migrants.'' 
   Using this cynical excuse Beijing stubbornly refuses to provide for the legitimate needs of these refugees and will not allow the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees access to Northeastern China to assess the welfare of North Koreans there. 
   The disturbing truth is that there are those in China who go to great lengths to attract North Korean refugees, through sex and labor trafficking. 
   H. Con. Res. 234 calls on Beijing to stop this awful charade, and live up to its moral and legal obligations. It demands that China stop repatriating North Korean refugees, that it honor the United Nations Conventions that govern the status of refugees, and that it provide unfettered access to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees so that these people who have suffered so terribly can finally receive the protection and fair treatment they so richly need and deserve. 
   I strongly support this resolution and encourage my colleagues to do the same.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TANNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment that the Members of this body have been forced to make such a difficult decision with regard to the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. As you know, the Bush Administration sent this proposed agreement directly to Congress without the level of dialogue many of us would liked to have seen to ensure we can reach agreement on this matter. I fear that the poor and unprecedented decision by President Bush to place this matter before the House of Representatives without the consent of leadership will result in collateral damage to the Trade Promotion Authority protocol that is instrumental in our work to promote commerce with other countries. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I am constrained to voting ``present,'' with the hope that continued dialogue between Congress and the White House will lead to a positive resolution of this entire matter.
