   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, what we have just witnessed on the House floor is an example of why the American people are sick and tired of all of the partisan bickering that goes on up in Washington. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are 47 of us who are fiscally conservative Democrats who want to put an end to the partisan bickering. We are a group of conservative Democrats who quite frankly don't care if it is a Democratic idea or a Republican idea. We want to know if it is a commonsense idea and does it make sense for the people that send us here to be their voice. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are 47 Members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. As you walk the Halls of Congress, it is easy to identify which Members are members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition because you will see this poster as you walk the hallways of the Cannon House Office Building, the Longworth House Office Building and the Rayburn House Office Building. 
   This poster not only serves as a doormat to Blue Dog Coalition Members of Congress, but also as a daily reminder to Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and to the American people that our Nation is in debt. 
   Today, the U.S. national debt is $9,010,742,245,690. If you divide that enormous number and put it in perspective by every man, woman and child in America, every one of us, our share of the national debt is $29,735. It is what we have coined the phrase ``debt tax,'' and that is one tax that cannot be cut and that is one amount that is not going to fund America's priorities but rather is going to simply pay interest on the national debt and to pay down the national debt. 
   I had a constituent from back home in Arkansas in my office today. She said she was in my office a couple of years ago, and everybody's share of the national debt was some $27,000. Again, today it is $29,735. Under this Republican administration, we have seen the largest debt ever in our Nation's history. We have seen the largest deficit ever in our Nation's history. 
   Contrast that with the past administration, the Clinton administration. President Clinton was the first Democrat or Republican in 40 years to give us a balanced budget; and yet here we are 7 years later with the largest debt ever in our Nation's history, and as members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we want to restore fiscal discipline and commonsense to our Nation's government. 
   That is why there was a lot of talk about the first 100 hours on the House floor in this new Democratic majority, and we accomplished more in the first 100 hours I would dare say than the previous Congress did all together. In fact, I believe we have done more on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in the past 9 months than the previous Republican Congresses have done in 9 years. 
   Unfortunately, these bills are then sent to the Senate where too many of them remain. But I am proud of the work that we are doing in the House under this new majority. And, Mr. Speaker, we are doing it with fiscal discipline. We are passing these bills, a new vision for America, putting America's priorities where they ought to be, and that is putting our families and children first again. But we are doing it in a sensible and responsible way, a way in which we pay for it. 
   One of the first things to happen on the floor in this new Congress was to reinstitute the PAYGO rules. PAYGO is an acronym for ``pay as you go.'' It is what we do at the Ross home in Prescott, Arkansas. It is what most American families do. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the past 6 years, a Republican-led Congress and a Republican President gave us the largest debt ever in our Nation's history, the largest deficit year after year. To put it in perspective, to put it in perspective, this President has borrowed more money from foreigners in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   We are going to put an end to that, and we did so when we reinstituted the PAYGO rules on the floor of the House of Representatives. Every bill that comes to the floor of the House in this new Democratic Congress must be paid for. Now, some of the Republicans say, oh, that's a disguise to raise taxes. The Republicans now believe that the only  way to create new revenue, the only way to pay for a program is to raise taxes. Not so. As conservative Democrats, we know the way you pay for programs is to cut wasteful spending. There are a lot of examples of wasteful spending. 
   I have got 8,000 brand-new, fully furnished mobile homes sitting in a cow pasture in Hope, Arkansas, mobile homes purchased by FEMA destined for Hurricane Katrina victims that never quite found their way to the gulf coast. Now FEMA, our government, is spending a quarter of a million dollars a month to warehouse these mobile homes which have created another bureaucracy in and of itself back home in Hope, Arkansas. And they are not doing anyone any good. 
   You want to talk about accountability, I had a tornado a few months ago hit Dumas, Arkansas. They needed 30, that's right, 30 of these mobile homes, while 8,000 of them sat in a cow pasture 2 1/2 hours away in Hope, Arkansas. I called the director of FEMA. He came up with every excuse in the book why he couldn't help these 30 homeless people. He said it wasn't worthy of a declaration for a Federal disaster. 
   This tornado devastated this small delta town of 5,000 people. There were 150 homes destroyed or heavily damaged. Over 25 businesses were destroyed. The electrical grid system for the town was destroyed. They went 5 days without electricity. Lots of people were injured. Thank God no one died. And we needed 30 of those mobile homes sent 2 1/2 hours down the road to help these folks. And, instead, the response I got was they weren't worthy of a Federal disaster declaration. 
   It took me going on CNN, and, finally, 30 minutes after I was on ``NBC Evening News'' talking about this tragedy, FEMA had a change of heart and decided to let the people of Dumas have these 30 mobile homes to house the homeless who were victims of this tornado. 
   This is an example of wasteful spending and this is a symbol of why people are fed up with our government, and it is an example of why we need to restore accountability, accountability to our Nation's government. 
   So when I say we are going to pay for our programs in the future, it doesn't mean raise taxes. It means cut wasteful spending, eliminate the programs that do not work so we can fund the programs that do.     
   From 1789 to 2000, our national debt rose to $5.67 trillion, but by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. This is a doubling of the 211-year debt in just a decade, in just 10 years. 
   Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget, and again, the debt tax, D-E-B-T, is one that cannot be repealed, and every man, woman and child in America, your share, our share, my share, your share, Mr. Speaker, of the national debt is $29,735. 
   Current national debt, again $9,010,742,245,690 and some change. Some say why do deficits matter; can't y'all just print more money? It doesn't work that way, and besides deficits reduce economic growth. 
   Think of the economic good times we had in the 1990s when President Clinton gave us the first balanced budget in 40 years, and look at the economy today. We propped up the economy through much of the last few years through low interest rates and allowing folks to purchase homes that maybe couldn't quite afford it, and now that's coming back to haunt this administration. 
   Deficits reduce economic growth. It's time to restore fiscal discipline to our national government. It is time to reduce our debt and deficit so that we can create new jobs and economic opportunities for working families. 
   Why do deficits matter? I would argue they burden our children and grandchildren with these last liabilities. For the last 6 years, this Republican Congress and Republican administration has spent money like you wouldn't believe. They have spent money and haven't paid for their spending. They have left it for our children and for our grandchildren. That is simply wrong. 
   Growing up at Midway United Methodist Church outside of Prescott, Arkansas, I heard a lot of sermons about being a good steward, and the American people have elected us as Members of Congress to make the weekly trip to our Nation's Capital and be good stewards of their tax money. And that's why I'm proud to help lead and cochair the Blue Dog Coalition, because we're doing our best to demand accountability, to demand fiscal responsibility and to give this Congress a good dose of common sense. 
   Why do deficits matter? Because they increase our reliance on foreign lenders. Foreign lenders now own 40 percent of this debt. Much of the rest of it's been borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund, with absolutely no provision made on how or when it's going to be paid back. That's why, Mr. Speaker, the first bill I filed as a Member of Congress was a bill to tell the politicians in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security Trust Fund.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his commitment to our men and women in uniform. I especially appreciate it as the Arkansas 39th Brigade, our Arkansas National Guard, they have only been home for about 33 months from a year on the ground in Iraq. They have been called up and are now training at National Guard armories all across Arkansas. They will be doing that through the end of the year. They will be going to Mississippi in January and February and then sometime in March headed back to Iraq for another year of duty. 
   We owe it to them and their families to ensure that they are properly trained and to ensure that we are investing in them the very best equipment and technology to give them a  fighting chance, coming back, returning to their families safely. 
   If you have got any comments or concerns, you can e-mail us at BlueDog@mail.house.gov. If you have any comments, questions or concerns, you can e-mail us at BlueDog@mail.house.gov. 
   Again, the Blue Dog Coalition is a group of 47 fiscally conservative Democrats that, quite frankly, feel like we have been choked blue by the extremes of both parties, and we are just simply trying to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. We are in the middle, and that's what we believe America is. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his commitment to our troops, for his commitment to fiscal discipline and for sharing with us the piece that he recently submitted to a newspaper in his district. Thank you, Lincoln Davis. 
   I mentioned the Blue Dogs have three bills that we believe can go a long way toward fixing this mess, cleaning up the mess here in Washington. One of the bills to do that is the Fiscal Honesty and Accountability Act. It strengthens our commitment to fiscal responsibility and accountability, and reinstitutes statutory PAYGO rules. 
   It implements multiyear discretionary spending caps. It closes a loophole in the law that has been used to add billions of dollars in routine spending, and it requires the Congressional Budget Office, commonly referred to as the CBO, to estimate interest costs produced by spending in any bill. We will go over this and explain what all this means. 
   I am pleased to introduce and to yield to a fellow Blue Dog from the State of Indiana, who is the author of this commonsense piece of legislation that has been embraced by my fellow colleagues, conservative Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition, and that's Baron Hill.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Indiana's Ninth Congressional District, Mr. Hill, for his sponsorship and for authoring this very important legislation, the Fiscal Honesty and Accountability Act of 2007, one of three key pieces of legislation that we believe can go a long way toward restoring common sense, fiscal discipline and accountability to our national government. 
   Another one of those is a resolution strengthening the budget process.  We're going to talk more about that. I yield to the gentleman at this time, though, from Tennessee, Lincoln Davis.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for those thoughts, and he is absolutely correct. We must keep all the soldiers who have died in service to our country, those who have been injured in service to our country in our hearts and in our prayers. And on this evening I hope we'll especially remember Sergeant James Doster from Jefferson County, Arkansas, the latest casualty from Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District. 
   The gentleman from Tennessee mentioned those who've died in service to our country, and we've talked a little bit about the Iraq war. And I want to deviate for a moment and let you know, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Davis and I are part of a group outside of the Blue Dog Coalition, but a group of Democrats and Republicans that have come together, 14 Democrats, 14 Republicans that have created this bipartisan compact on Iraq debate because the fact is, Mr. Speaker, I voted three times to bring our troops home in a responsible and in a manner that would be responsible. But the reality is this: That the reason I voted three times is because we don't have a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives. And we can continue to have those votes, but the reality is the President will veto those actions and so we really, at the end of the day, haven't been successful in a new direction in Iraq. 
   Finally, you know, if there's one issue that shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican issue but should put us all in the context of being Americans first, it should be how we move forward on this Iraq debate. And there are 28 of us, 14 Democrats, 14 Republicans that have come together to create this bipartisan compact on Iraq debate. And I welcome, as I go through these points, I would welcome the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Davis), any comments or thoughts he might want to interject. But basically, here's the compact. 
   We agree, 14 Democrats, 14 Republicans, we agree that the U.S. Congress must end the political infighting over the conflict in Iraq and commit immediately to a truly bipartisan dialogue on the issues we are facing. 
   I would yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.

   Mr. ROSS. There are eight points that we make in this bipartisan compact on Iraq debate on how we move forward. The second one, we agree that efforts to eliminate funding for U.S. forces engaged in combat and in harm's way in Iraq would put at risk the safety and security of our servicemembers. In other words, as long as we've got troops in harm's way, we're going to support them. 
   We agree that there must be a clearly defined and measurable mission for our continued military involvement in Iraq. Again, stop redefining victory. Stop moving the goal post. This mission must be further and continually defined so that the military and the country are aware of the end goal of our mission in Iraq and what progress toward that goal is being achieved. 
   We agree that the Government of Iraq must now be responsible for Iraq's future course. The government must continue to make progress on the legislative benchmarks outlined in section 1314 of the recent Supplemental Appropriations Act, public law 110-28. Demand accountability from the Iraqis.

   Mr. ROSS. We agree that it is critical for members of the U.S. Armed Forces, including members of the reserve components, to have adequate rest and recuperation periods between deployments. 
   We agree that a safe and responsible redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces from Iraq, based on recommendations from our military and foreign policy leaders, is necessary to transition the combat mission over to the Iraqi forces. 
   We agree that the continued military mission of U.S. combat forces must lead to a timely transition to conducting counterterrorism operations, protecting the U.S. Armed Forces, supporting and equipping Iraqi forces to take full responsibility for their own security, assisting refugees, and preventing genocide.     
   We agree that U.S. diplomatic efforts should continue to be improved and that the U.S. State Department must engage in robust diplomacy with Iraq's neighbors in the Middle East to address the Iraq conflict. 
   We had a military surge, and we now know that didn't work. That is what President Bush wanted, and that's what he got. What we are saying here, among these eight components, and don't get me wrong, it is only one of the eight components, one of the eight components is it's time for a diplomatic surge in the Middle East. Fourteen Democrats and fourteen Republicans have signed on to this, and I believe it is time for a new direction in Iraq. It is time for a bipartisan direction. It is time for us to all come together as Americans first. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.

   Mr. ROSS. Again, these views on Iraq are not necessarily those of the Blue Dog Coalition. We require a two-thirds vote for an endorsed position. These are our views, those of us that believe we need a new direction and how we think we can get there in a bipartisan way. 
   Another one of the bills being put forth by the Blue Dogs, and this one was written by Heath Shuler from North Carolina, Charlie Melancon from Louisiana, and Charlie Wilson from Ohio, and it's called a Resolution Strengthening the Budget Process. It strengthens and increases transparency of the budget process. It ensures that Members have a sufficient amount of time to properly examine legislation and determine its actual cost. No more of being forced to vote on these 300- and 400-page bills after seeing them for 15 minutes and knowing the cost of what we are voting on. PAYGO rules now require that. 
   It requires that a full Congressional Budget Office, CBO, cost estimate accompany any bill or conference report that comes to the House floor and ensures that lawmakers have at least 3 days to review the final text of any bill before casting their votes. 
   We can't make Members of Congress read the bills they are voting on; but if you give them 3 days from the final text to the day of the vote, it gives them the opportunity to read them. Right now, and many times under the Republican-led Congress in the past 6 years, there wasn't an opportunity to read the bills because they would let us see the bills 15 minutes or an hour before we were voting on them, sometimes 300- and 400-page bills. 
   Commonsense ideas that we are putting into legislation. 
   Another integral part of the Blue Dog fiscal accountability package is this, and I have done my best to go through it and explain to you what it is that we are trying to do there. It's a resolution aimed at strengthening and increasing the transparency of the budget process. All too often Members of Congress are forced to vote on legislation without knowing its true cost implications. This measure will ensure that Members have a sufficient amount of time to properly examine legislation and determine its actual cost. 
   And then, finally, the balanced budget amendment. And I want to thank the Blue Dog leader Kirsten Gillibrand from New York for authoring the balanced budget amendment, which would provide for a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the Federal budget every year. Forty-nine States do it. Most American families do it. And it is time that the United States Congress did it. It allows for flexibility during times of war, natural disaster, or an economic downturn, and it prohibits cuts in Social Security benefits from ever being used in order to balance the budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are just three pieces of legislation that have been endorsed by the Blue Dog Coalition, authored by the members of the Blue Dog Coalition, that we believe can put us on a path toward restoring common sense, fiscal discipline, and accountability to our Nation's government.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (GEORGE HOWARD, JR. FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2011, a bill to dedicate the Federal building and United States courthouse in Pine Bluff, Arkansas as the George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse.     
   First I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton, Congressman Boustany, and others for their support and assistance in moving this bill from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in a bipartisan manner to the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I am also pleased that the entire Arkansas congressional delegation, Congressmen Marion Berry, Vic Snyder, and John Boozman, are supporting and cosponsoring this very important bill with me in a bipartisan way. 
   Judge George Howard, Jr., was a great American who served his country in the State of Arkansas with great dignity. He was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where he practiced law and actively served in the community for over 40 years. He attended Lincoln University in Missouri and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where he received his law degree in 1954, among the first African Americans to graduate from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville Law School. 
   During World War II, he chose to serve his country by enlisting in the Navy. Judge Howard was known to be a pioneer throughout his career as he became the first African American in the State of Arkansas to serve on the State Claims Commission, State Supreme Court, the court of appeals, and eventually rising to become the first African American Federal judge for the U.S. District Court in Arkansas. 
   Judge Howard was the first African American member of the State Supreme Court, appointed by then Governor David Pryor in 1977 before being appointed to the State court of appeals by then Governor Bill Clinton in 1979. 
   As a judge, George Howard, Jr. was admired for his fairness and deep belief in the fundamental idea of justice for all. Judge Howard will forever be remembered as a dedicated public servant who cared deeply about his faith, his family, his work, his State, his country, and the judicial process. 
   In respect to Judge Howard's life, career and public service, I felt that it was appropriate to introduce legislation in Congress to dedicate the Federal building and courthouse in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, as the ``George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I can think of no better way to recognize his legacy and his steadfast commitment to justice and equality than by officially renaming this Federal building and courthouse in the city he loved and called home, Pine Bluff, Arkansas. 
   His life and service have paved the way for so many others who pursue careers in public service and law. His life and service opened many doors for African Americans throughout Pine Bluff in southeast Arkansas. 
   Judge Howard passed away on April 21, 2007. He will forever be remembered and his contributions to the State of Arkansas and our Nation live on. It is my hope that each person who walks through the doors of the George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and Courthouse in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, will have an even greater appreciation for the countless contributions Judge Howard made in the lives of people across the State of Arkansas. May this courthouse that hopefully will soon bear his name serve as a reminder to all of us that while he is no longer with us, the example, the shining example, of community service, public service, and of being fair to all people can live on. 
   This recognition will serve as a reminder to young people in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and to future generations that committing one's self to education, hard work, and pursuing a career in public service can be good and noble. 
   I am proud to sponsor this bill in Congress, and I urge my fellow colleagues to vote in favor of it today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Thank you, Chairman Grijalva. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 138, a resolution honoring and recognizing the importance of Hot Springs National Park on its 175th anniversary. I am pleased that the entire Arkansas congressional delegation is supporting and cosponsoring this bipartisan bill. 
   April 20, 2007, will mark the 175th anniversary of Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. This resolution will write into history the important role that Hot Springs National Park has played in the formation of the Department of the Interior and the National Park System. 
   The very idea of setting aside special places in the United States for the future enjoyment of its citizens originated in Hot Springs, Arkansas, when on April 20, 1832, President Andrew Jackson and the United States Congress established Hot Springs Reservation to protect the 47 hot springs in Garland County, Arkansas. That year, Hot Springs Reservation became the first protected area in the Nation and was the only Federal area mentioned by name in the act that established the National Park System. 
   The Hot Springs Reservation was then officially renamed Hot Springs National Park on March 4, 1921, becoming America's 18th national park, joining many other national landmarks. 
   For more than 200 years, Hot Springs National Park has remained an area of exceptional beauty and magnificence. People have used the hot spring water and therapeutic baths to treat a variety of ailments, and the reservation eventually developed into a well-known resort nicknamed ``the American Spa.'' Well, today Hot Springs National Park protects eight historic bathhouses, and the Bathhouse Row area in Hot Springs National Park is a national historic landmark district that contains the largest collection of bathhouses of its kind in North America. It provides visitors from around the country and the world with leisure activities such as hiking, picnicking, and scenic drives and remains a national treasure to be enjoyed by generations of Americans.     
   Hot Springs National Park has played a crucial role in the formation of the United States National Park System. I am proud to sponsor a resolution commemorating its 175th anniversary, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of House Resolution 138 today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, this evening, as most Tuesday evenings, I'm joined by members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition as we come to the floor of the United States House of Representatives to talk about the debt and the deficit and what that means for the future of this country and how so many of today's priorities continue to go unmet because of this. 
   Today's national debt is $9,169,206,830,867 and some change. For every man, woman and child in America, their share of the national debt, $30,205. 
   As you walk the halls of Congress, Madam Speaker, as you walk the halls of the Cannon, Longworth and Rayburn House Office Buildings, you will easily know when you're walking by the door of a fellow Blue Dog member because you will see this poster that reminds us of the national debt, as well as your share. 
   This evening we want to talk about PAYGO. It's an acronym for pay-as-you-go, and basically there was a lot made to do about the first 100 legislative hours in this new Democratic majority. Well, the 47 of us in the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition were proud of what we were able to accomplish in this first legislative hour under this new Democratic majority, and that was reinstating the PAYGO rules, which means pay-as-you-go. If you have got a new program you want to fund, you've got to show us how you're going to pay for it. If you want to cut a tax, you've got to show us how you're going to pay for it. 
   The business of borrowing money from China to fund programs and tax cuts in this country are over, and we want to thank the new Democratic leadership for their commitment, their commitment not to bring a bill to this floor that's not paid for. 
   At this time to talk more about this issue and a lot of talk about AMT, the alternative minimum tax is going to touch a lot more people this year. We want to protect those people. We want to make sure they're not taxed, but we also want to make sure that that bill that comes to this floor is paid for. It doesn't make sense to protect people from taxes if we're simply borrowing the money from China and then asking our children and grandchildren to foot the bill. 
   That's why I was very disappointed last week when the Senate voted 88-5 to fix the AMT. They took the easy way out. It wasn't paid for. The Senate's plan borrows $50 billion just for this year, $50 billion from China to pay for a fix to the alternative minimum tax. We have a plan in the House not only to fix it but to pay for it, and we voted for that a couple of weeks ago on the House floor and we're going to vote on it again this week. 
   And to talk more about this and what it all means for this country and for future generations is one of the founders of the Blue Dog Coalition, my friend, John Tanner from Tennessee.

They sent it back to us without being paid for. Instead, they want to borrow $50 billion from China, and that's what got 47 members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition worked up, and for a good reason.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hill) for his insight on this issue. 
   Madam Speaker, let me make it clear that the Blue Dog Coalition wants to ensure that no additional taxpayers are liable for the AMT tax this year. Let me also make it clear that, unlike the Senate, we want a bill that's paid for. We don't want to simply borrow the money from China to fund a tax cut or to provide tax relief in this country. And that's what makes us different in this new Democratic majority from what we had in the previous Congresses under the Republican control. They have given us the largest debt ever, the largest deficit ever; and the time has come to put an end to that. And someone that understands that better than anyone is the Blue Dog co-Chair for policy, my friend Dennis Moore from Kansas.

   Madam Speaker, in the next 35 minutes, we've got a number of Blue Dogs, fiscally conservative Democrats, that have taken to the floor of the House tonight to join me in talking about the importance of PAYGO, pay-as-you-go, the kind of principle that was in place in this Chamber when President Clinton gave us the first balanced budget of any Democrat or Republican in about 40 years. 
   At this time I would like to call on a former co-Chair of the Blue Dogs from the State of Tennessee, someone that has helped lead this effort and who brings a lot of insight to this issue, the former co-Chair for policy of the Blue Dogs, and that's my friend Jim Cooper from Tennessee.

   Mr. ROSS. I want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee, former co-Chair of the Blue Dogs, for joining us and in being a part of standing firm on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of PAYGO. 
   Some people may say, what's this business all about? Well, the House passed a bill to provide tax relief for millions of people, and it was paid for. We sent it to the Senate and they didn't like it; so they sent it back unpaid for. Their idea was to borrow $50 billion from someplace like China to pay for it.     
   Well, we're going to send it back again, probably tomorrow, Madam Speaker, with another pay-for. And some people are maybe saying, ``Huh? So how are you going to pay for it?'' Well, it's not glamorous, but it makes sense to me. We're going to pay for it by closing loopholes allowing hedge fund managers to defer compensation in offshore accounts. There's no reason why the Senate shouldn't be able to join us in supporting that. It pays for it instead of borrowing the money from China and provides the tax relief that we need for middle-class working families all across this country. 
   I would like to call on a former cochair for communications of the Blue Dogs, my friend from California, a member of the Rules Committee, very involved in this whole issue, and that's Dennis Cardoza.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from California, who has contributed greatly as the former cochair of the Blue Dogs and now a member of the Rules Committee. 
   The reason all of this is so important is because of this: Today, the U.S. national debt, $9,169,206,830,867, you divide that by every man, woman and child in America, and your share, Madam Speaker, is $30,205. 
   Since President Bush took office, the gross national debt has increased by nearly $3.5 trillion, $3.427 trillion. That's $41.54 billion per month. That's $9.57 billion per week. That's $1.37 billion per day. That's $56.93 million per hour. That's $948,907 per minute. And that's $15,815 per second. Any way you divide it out, Madam Speaker, for a country boy from south Arkansas, that's a whole lot of money. And this group, the Blue Dogs, fiscally conservative Democrats, are trying to restore common sense, accountability, and fiscal discipline to our national government. And right in the middle of it all is my friend from Louisiana, a fellow Blue Dog member, Charlie Melancon.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
   And as our friend John Tanner from Tennessee has said so eloquently, this administration, this President has borrowed more money from foreigners than the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   Since President Bush took office, our Nation has borrowed $1.23 trillion from foreign sources. That's a big number. Let's break it down. That's $15.45 billion per month. That's $3.54 billion per week. That's $505.6 million per day. That's $21.07 million per hour. That's $351,113 per minute. And that's $5,852 per second. 
   So, Madam Speaker, that's why we're here. We want to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our national government. We want to put an end to this reckless spending and this debt and this deficit, and to help us do that is my friend from Ohio, new member of the Blue Dogs, serving his first term in the 110th session of Congress, Zack Space from Ohio's 18th congressional district.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Indiana. Madam Speaker, if you have any questions, comments or concerns you can e-mail us, Madam Speaker, at bluedog@mail.house.gov. 
   The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Space) was saying that he didn't have his calculator with him, but he knew it was a lot of interest that had been paid. This year we have paid $239 billion in interest on the national debt. That is close to $1 billion a day, without a calculator. But with a calculator, and to put it in perspective, the same amount we would pay for any of the following, stocking every family in America's refrigerator for 7 months, filling every U.S. gas tank, and that is not easy to do this these days, for 10 months, filling every American's gas tank for 10 months at today's gas prices, providing 4 years of in-state public tuition for 10.2 million students. I have a daughter in college now. I can appreciate that one. Paying 1 year of salary for 8 million new teachers. We could do any one of those things, Madam Speaker, with the amount of interest we have paid on the national debt this year. 
   The whole point here, Madam Speaker, is we will continue, this demonstrates it right here, the reds, the amounts we are spending on interest, the light blue, or the turquoise as we would say back home, is the amount we are spending on education. The dark green is how much we are spending on veterans. And the purple is how much we are spending on homeland security. 
   America's priorities, Madam Speaker, are out of whack. And they are going to remain out of whack until we get our fiscal house in order. And no one understands this better than the leader of the Blue Dogs, the administrative co-Chair for the Blue Dogs who spends a lot of time on these issues, and I can't thank him enough for being here and waiting patiently all night and letting all our fellow Blue Dog members go, we have had a dozen tonight, that is a lot, to come to the floor of the House tonight to talk about these issues. We have about 10 minutes left. The gentleman from Florida, ALLEN BOYD, can have as much of it as he wants.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Florida, the administrative cochair of the Blue Dogs, Mr. Allen Boyd from Florida's Second Congressional District, for being a part of this Special Order this evening, as he is so many Tuesday evenings. 
   What we are talking about here, Madam Speaker, is the Republican Congress, the Republican administration, after having a balanced budget under President Clinton for the first time in 40 years, gave us the largest debt ever in our Nation's history, largest deficit ever in our Nation's history, and there has been a lot of talk about all this. 
   Mr. Tanner was talking earlier about how this administration has borrowed more money from foreigners than the previous 42 Presidents combined. That has to be paid back with interest. And to put it in perspective, the Federal Government has sent $709 billion abroad in the form of interest payments since President Bush took office, and $155 billion in 2007 alone. The same amount would fund any of the following: The amount of money this administration has sent to foreigners to pay interest on the debt that we have borrowed from them to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. With the interest paid on this debt, this foreign debt, the amount of your tax money, Madam Speaker, that we have sent overseas, with that amount of money, we could have built 12,000 new elementary schools, 7,000 new veterans clinics, and I might remind you, Madam Speaker, we have a new generation of veterans coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq. And get this: We could have funded all road and bridge construction and improvements for 10 years. 
   It's about priorities, and it's time this Nation got its priorities in order. It's time we got our fiscal house in order. Make no mistake about it, Madam Speaker, for the second time this week we are going to send to the Senate an AMT fix that ensures that no, not one, additional taxpayer is liable for the AMT tax. Not one. Madam Speaker, we are paying for it, and as conservative Democrats we are reaching across the aisle and we are begging, we are begging Republicans to join us in doing the right thing and fixing this the right way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I rise on behalf of the 44-member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the Halls of Congress, you will notice these Blue Dog Coalition posters along the hallways which signify that you are walking by the door to an office of a fellow Blue Dog Member. And the reason you will find these posters scattered across the Cannon, Longworth and Rayburn House Office Buildings is because we are committed to restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. And it is important to us, Mr. Speaker, that we remind every Member of Congress, as well as the general public that walk these Halls, that our Nation is in debt. In fact, the U.S. national debt, as of today, is $8,721,415,192,294. And we ran out of room on the poster, Mr. Speaker, but 43 cents. Our national debt, $8,721,415,192,294.43. That is a big number. What does it mean? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you what it means. For every man, woman and child living in America, including those children being born today, their share of the national debt is $29,093.20. It is what we refer to as the debt tax, D-E-B-T. That is one tax that cannot be cut, that cannot go away until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Why is it important? Because our Nation is borrowing about $1 billion a day. But, Mr. Speaker, before we borrow $1 billion a day, we are going to spend a half a billion dollars paying interest on the debt we have already got. And many of America's priorities in the area of education, veterans benefits, health care, roads, many of America's priorities continue to go unmet and they will until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   As members of the Blue Dog Coalition, which is just another name for fiscally conservative Democrats, we are concerned about this. But, Mr. Speaker, our concerns do not end with the debt and the deficit. We are also concerned about accountability, and this Democratic Congress is going to restore accountability to this Chamber, to this administration, and, yes, to the Government of the United States of America. 
   The Constitution clearly gives Congress, not only the power and the authority, but it is our constitutional duty to provide oversight of this administration. And yet this Republican Congress that we have had for the past 6 years has been nothing more than a rubber stamp for President Bush and his administration. 
   It is time that Congress did its job. It is time that Congress put the rubber stamp in the drawer and pull out the Constitution and read it and understand that we have a duty, a constitutional duty, to provide oversight to this administration and to this government. We are going to do that. And we are doing it in many areas, including providing for accountability for how the hardworking people of this country's tax money is being spent in places like Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, you ask a hundred different people what they think about this Iraq war policy, you will get about a hundred different answers. And by the way, very few or none of them are going to agree with the direction that President Bush is currently going. If you ask fellow Blue Dog members, you will get different answers as well. I, personally, am opposed to the surge. Others may not be. That is something that we believe each Member must make a decision on and speak from their heart and represent their constituency. 
   But one of the things that we are united on as Blue Dog members is restoring accountability for how this money is being spent in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to show here a couple of numbers that are very important. One is the cost of the Iraq war. They spent $2.5 billion pre-invasion in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, $51 billion was spent. In 2004, $77.3 billion was spent. In 2005, $87.3 billion was spent. In 2006, $100.4 billion. 2007, to date, we are getting ready to vote on another supplemental appropriation bill for the war, but to date, $60 billion. That puts the total cost to the taxpayers of America at nearly $400 billion, $378.5 billion.  
   Now, what does that mean? That is a lot of money. How do you break it out? The total cost for 2006 alone, $100.4 billion. That is $8.44 billion per month of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, going to Iraq. 
   Another way of putting it, $275 million a day, or about 11 or $12 million per hour. And yet there has been a lack of accountability on how your tax money is being accounted for and how it is being spent in Iraq. 
   So we, Mr. Speaker, have what is called House Resolution 97 that we have filed as members of the Blue Dog Coalition. And it is a resolution to provide for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability. And let me just get to the meat of it. Basically, the resolution says this: that within 30 days after the adoption of this resolution, and every 90 days thereafter, the Department of Defense Inspector General and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction shall prepare and transmit to Congress an unclassified report with a classified annex, if necessary, that would contain, one, a detailed accounting of how military and reconstruction funds in Iraq have been spent thus far; two, a detailed accounting of the types and terms of contracts awarded on behalf of the United States, including the methods by which such contracts were awarded and contractors selected; three, a description of efforts to obtain support and assistance from other countries toward the rehabilitation of Iraq; and, four, an assessment of what additional funds is needed to complete military operations and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including a plan for security of Iraq, a detailed plan for how any future funds will be spent and a statement of how those funds will advance the interests of the United States and Iraq. 
   If either Inspector General fails to submit a quarterly report, the Government Accountability Office shall conduct an audit and report to Congress. Sanctions shall be imposed against contractors who have engaged in fraud or abuse or war profiteering. Congress should create a Truman-like committee to conduct an ongoing study and investigation of the awarding and carrying out of contracts by the United States to conduct activities with regard to Operation Iraqi Freedom and make such recommendations to the House as the Select Committee deems appropriate. 
   Funding requests for Operation Iraqi Freedom in fiscal year 2008 and beyond must come through the regular appropriations process and not be hidden through these so-called emergency supplementals. In furtherance of the partnership that is critical to success in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the administration should firmly condition further American financial, military and political resources upon steady improvement in Iraq, assumption of principal responsibility for internally policing Iraq. 
   In other words, Mr. Speaker, this resolution says that it is time for this administration to be accountable for how the hardworking people of this country's tax money is being spent in Iraq, no more rubber stamps for this administration. We will fulfill our constitutional duty of providing oversight. 
   And it also says, Mr. Speaker, that the President should do all he can to get Iraq to take responsibility for their own actions and to take the lead on trying to restore order to that country. 
   And it also says that this administration must be held accountable for how your tax money is being spent, that there should be transparency to the process, and full disclosure of who is getting paid to do what in Iraq when it comes to private contractors, and to make sure that this war profiteering in Iraq by private contractors comes to an end. That is basically what the resolution says. 
   Mr. Speaker, every one of us in the Blue Dog Coalition, and I think every one of us in this Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, supports our troops. We can't do enough for our troops. And I can tell you, as far as I am concerned, as long as we have men and women in uniform in harm's way, I am going to do my part to ensure that we provide them the resources they need to get the job done as safely as possible. 
   But it is also important that this Congress fulfill its constitutional oversight responsibility and demand that this administration be accountable for how your tax money, some $275 million a day, is being spent in Iraq. And there are reports that indicate that at least 20 percent of the money going to Iraq cannot be accounted for. 
   Think what we could do to provide health care benefits, housing benefits and other benefits for our veterans. And in Iraq and Afghanistan we have got a new generation of veterans coming home, and we have got to be there for them as a country. We cannot do enough for our men and women in uniform. We cannot do enough for our veterans. We have got to be there for them. 
   We have also got to be sure that this money, some $100.4 billion in 2006 that this administration is sending to Iraq, is accounted for and that it is being spent in support of our soldiers and that we have the resources to take care and to honor our veterans, including a new generation of veterans coming home today from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   A number of fellow Blue Dog members will be joining me this evening as we talk about providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability. And one of those who has joined me is a fellow Blue Dog member, someone that is very active in the Blue Dogs, was a member of our nominating committee for officers earlier this year, and that is the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler). And I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky.

And I certainly thank him for helping sponsor this resolution that, hopefully, we will get through the House to demand accountability, fiscal responsibility and accountability for how this administration spends billions of tax money, Mr. Speaker, in a place a long way from Arkansas and a long way from America, and that is in Iraq. 
   And I couldn't help but think when the gentleman from Kentucky was talking about accountability, I think it is important to note that Congress has appropriated over $25 billion to various departments and agencies for reconstruction projects that are intended to improve the lives and living standards of the Iraqi people, and, yes, to endear them to our way of life; and yet we find that only half the projects have been completed. 
   For example, the Special Inspector General for Iraq reconstruction reported that funds allocated for health care projects, health care projects, are more than 65 percent expended--that is, the funds--but fewer than 36 percent of the projects have been completed. Funds were allocated for construction of 142 primary health care clinics and only 20 were completed. 
   Likewise, the Inspector General reported that a contract was made to construct 20 rehabilitation hospitals, and only 12 were completed.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, a fellow Blue Dog member, a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, for joining us to discuss the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition's House Resolution 97 that provides for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability. 
   The Constitution clearly gives Congress oversight authority, and this Congress, this new Democratic Congress, is going to provide oversight of this administration, of this government, and fulfill our constitutional duty and demand that our troops get the money they need to get the job done as safely as possible; but also demand that it be done in a way to where this administration is held accountable for how, Mr. Speaker, your tax money is being spent in Iraq. 
   I recently received an e-mail from a soldier from my hometown. He wrote to me in an e-mail from Iraq, and there are a couple of points I would like to point out. I am quoting this soldier now in Iraq. ``Needless to say, war profiteering is high, and disgusting to witness as a taxpayer.'' This is a citizen soldier, this is a soldier that comes to us from the Army Reserve. He has now been in Iraq 7 months. And in his e-mail to me he said, ``Needless to say, war profiteering is high, and disgusting to witness as a taxpayer.'' 
   He goes on to say, ``And the black market thrives over here as well. For example, much of the fuel never reaches the military; it ends up in the wrong hands through a complex network of interconnected relationships that truly reminds me of the Mafia.'' 
   Another example from a soldier on the ground in Iraq that has been there 7 months about the need for accountability for how tax money, some $400 billion so far, some 20 percent of that $400 billion is unaccounted for, according to the most recent reports. 
   As members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we are offering up a resolution to demand that this money, your tax money, Mr. Speaker, be accounted for in how it is being spent in support of our soldiers in Iraq. And you know what? We might just find enough waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq that we could take that money and invest it in veterans' benefits, to ensure that our men and women coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan are properly cared for. 
   With that, I yield to a gentleman that knows a lot about this subject, a gentleman that is not only a very important member of the Blue Dog Coalition, but someone who served on the House Armed Services Committee, someone who now serves on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, and that is the gentleman from Long Island (Mr. Israel).

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his heartfelt comments. 
   This war has had an impact on just about every family in America; and my brother-in-law, who is in the United States Air Force, career, is now in Kurdistan, which is one of the entry points to Afghanistan. 
   My first cousin, his wife, gave birth to their first child while he was in Iraq, and it has had a tremendous toll on the families, and not only for the military but also the citizen soldier, those who serve as members of a National Guard and as a member of an Army reserve. 
   When the President talks about a surge, when the President talks about adding another 21,500 troops to Iraq, that is code for calling back up the National Guard and the Reserves. Many folks in the National Guard today have been sent out of country at historic levels. In many instances, the citizen soldiers, those in the Guard, have been called up more times than some soldiers that are in the full-time military as a career. It has a tremendous toll on the family, the families that are left behind, and a huge increase in the number of divorces that occur when they come back. 
   The bottom line is we are creating a generation of veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we can sit here and talk about being patriotic and supporting our soldiers all night long, but what is important is that we cast our votes in a way that honors them and ensures that they have health care and the things they need when they come back so hopefully we can minimize the number of divorces. We cannot do enough to thank our men and women in uniform for their service to our country. 
   One of the ways I think we can honor them is by demanding accountability for how tax money is being spent in Iraq, not only in the rebuilding efforts but also in support of them, making sure those men and women in uniform have the resources they need to stay safe while they are there. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you have got any comments, questions or concerns for us, I would encourage you to e-mail us at bluedog@mail.house.gov. Again, that is bluedog@mail.house.gov. 
   The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler) was talking about Halliburton earlier. Let me just make this quick point and I want to yield to the gentleman from Long Island, but last year, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction reported that the Coalition Provisional Authority could not track over $8 billion it had transferred to Iraqi ministries and that CPA officials left millions of dollars in cash unsecured in their offices. 
   Halliburton failed to complete required work under its oil infrastructure work, leaving distribution points unusable. Auditors in one region found that contract managers could not account for $97 million disbursed from the development fund for Iraq. 
   Under its no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure contract, Halliburton overcharged by over 600 percent for the delivery of fuel from Kuwait. An audit of programs designed to train guards to protect Iraq's oil and electrical infrastructure concluded that U.S. agencies could not provide reasonable assurance that $147 million expended under these programs was used for its intended purpose. 
   In one case, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that a company which was awarded a security management contract worth  hundreds of millions of dollars could provide no assurance that it was providing the best possible safety for government and reconstruction personnel as required by the contract and could not even show that its employees, authorized to carry weapons, were trained to use those weapons. 
   Halliburton tripled the cost of hand towels, hand towels at taxpayer expense, by insisting on having its own embroidered logo on each towel, and Halliburton employees dumped 50,000 pounds of nails in the desert. Why? Because they ordered the wrong size, all at taxpayer expense because it was a cost-plus contract. 
   Halliburton double charged tax payers for $617,000 worth of soda and charged taxpayers for services that it never provided and tens of thousands of meals that it never served our soldiers. 
   That is why, Mr. Speaker, we have filed H. Res. 97 to demand accountability on how tax money is being spent in Iraq, and I yield to the gentleman from Long Island.

   Mr. ROSS. H. Res. 97, providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability, and it is quite simple. We want this administration to be accountable for your tax money, Mr. Speaker, that is being spent in Iraq, number one. 
   Number two, we want a Truman-like commission to put an end to war profiteering in Iraq. 
   And, finally, we want this administration to stop playing games and asking for emergency supplementals to hide the true cost of the war and ask for the money the way that all other funds are appropriated by this Congress, through the normal process. 
   One hundred point four billion dollars was the cost for 2006. Over $400 billion has been spent since this war began. That is $8.4 billion a month. That is $275 million a day, and that is nearly $12 million an hour of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, and the tax money of every hardworking man and woman in this country; and it is time to restore commonsense, fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. That is one way, Mr. Speaker, that we believe we can honor our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Berry for offering this amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. It is what I would call a commonsense amendment. 
   I don't have to tell you, Mr. Chairman, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they need help in trying to figure this program out. This is the same Federal agency that has 8,000 brand new, fully furnished mobile homes sitting in a cow pasture in Hope, Arkansas several years after Hurricane Katrina, mobile homes that never got to the victims. And when we had a tornado on the Mississippi River in  Dumas, Arkansas, it took FEMA 3 weeks to figure out how to move 30 of them 2 1/2 hours down the road, and now FEMA is trying to wreak havoc on our National Flood Insurance Program. 
   The gentlewoman from Missouri is absolutely correct; it seems to me what FEMA is trying to do here is pay for their flood insurance program by forcing people to buy insurance who they know are never going to have a claim. This is a step in the right direction in trying to provide a commonsense fix to another mess that has been created by FEMA, and I am pleased to stand here with my colleagues from Arkansas and Missouri in support of it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the passage of the House amendment to S. 2382, the FEMA Accountability Act of 2008. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for all of their hard work on this bill. I also want to thank Senator Mark Pryor, who introduced the Senate version of this bill and whom I have worked tirelessly with to ensure that this critical legislation becomes law. 
   Last year, I introduced H.R. 4830, the House version of this legislation which would require FEMA to quickly and fairly address the abundance of surplus temporary housing units stored by the Federal Government across the Nation at taxpayer expense. My bill would require FEMA to devise a plan to distribute the excess temporary housing units being stored around the country that have been deemed safe and ready to be used. 
   The legislation specifically gives the agency 3 months to determine the number of housing it needs on hand to shelter future disaster victims; 6 months to provide a plan to permanently store the units it plans to keep, sell usable surplus units and dispose the rest; 9 months to implement its plan, and one year to report the status to Congress. 
   Families all over the Nation are in desperate need of housing. However, as many of you know many of the manufactured homes and travel trailers purchased by FEMA for use in Hurricane Katrina are still sitting unused in FEMA staging areas around the country. In my congressional district alone, FEMA is storing over 7,000 brand new, fully furnished, never before used manufactured homes in Hope, Arkansas. 
   These manufactured homes were originally purchased for Hurricane Katrina victims, but never made it to them. Instead, they have been sitting idly by in Hope since 2005. Since that time, many other natural disasters have occurred where temporary housing units were desperately needed by those who lost their homes. 
   However, it is my hope that the passage of this bill today will make FEMA recognize the continuing need to change this and deliver these homes to families all over the nation that desperately need them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, this evening, as most Tuesday evenings, I rise on behalf of the 43 member strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are 43 fiscally conservative Democrats that are committed to restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. We are not from one particular region of the country. Members of the Blue Dog Coalition stretch from California and Utah to New York, and we are united in trying to restore fiscal sanity to our Nation's government. Why? Because today, the U.S. national debt is $8,821,563,738,020. And I ran out of room, but right here it should say 12 cents. And for every man, woman and child in America, your share of the national debt is $29,225.95. It is what we refer to as the debt tax, d-e-b-t, which is one tax that cannot be cut; it cannot go away until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   It is hard now to believe, but from 1998 to 2001, we had a balanced budget in this country of ours. And now, under the past 6 years of Republican rule, with the Republicans controlling the White House, the House and the Senate, after 6 years we've got the largest debt ever in our Nation's history and the largest deficit ever in our Nation's history. In fiscal year 2004, it was $568 billion. In fiscal year 2005, it was $493.6 billion. In fiscal year 2006 it was $434 billion. Fiscal year 2006 it was $247 billion, and the projected deficit for fiscal year 2007 is $172 billion, but not really. The projected deficit for fiscal year 2007 is $357 billion. When they tell you it's only $172 billion, they're not counting the money they're borrowing from the Social Security trust fund. 
   When I first came to Congress in 2001, the first bill I wrote was a bill to tell the politicians in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security trust fund. The Republican leadership refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill, and now we know why, because they are using that money to fund our debt. $357 billion deficit projected for fiscal year 2007, and much of that is coming, about half of that is coming from the Social Security trust fund. Where is the rest of it coming from? It's coming from foreigners. In fact, this administration has borrowed more money from foreigners in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. Let me repeat that. This administration has borrowed more money from foreigners in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. My good friend and a founder of the Blue Dogs, John Tanner, put it best when he said, If China decides to invade Taiwan, we will have to borrow more money from China to defend Taiwan. 
   David Letterman has a top 10 list, and we've got one, too. The U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders. Foreign lenders currently hold a total of about $2.199 trillion of our public debt. Compare this to only $623.3 billion in foreign holdings back in 1993. Again, this administration in the past 6 years has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   Japan, $637.4 billion. The United States of America has borrowed $346.5 billion from China. The United Kingdom, $223.5 billion. OPEC, yes OPEC, and we wonder why gasoline is approaching three bucks a gallon. Our Nation has borrowed $97.1 billion from OPEC to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year.  Korea, $67.7 billion. Taiwan, $63.2 billion. The Caribbean banking centers, $63.6 billion. Hong Kong, $51 billion. Germany, $52.1 billion. And rounding out the top 10 list, and this will surprise some folks, the United States of America's 10th largest loanee to our government is the Government of Mexico and investors in Mexico. Mexico, investors have loaned the United States of America $38.2 billion. That's right, the United States of America has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico. And that rounds out the top 10 list of the foreign countries that our Nation is borrowing money from. 
   We believe this is very critical to our Nation's security. That is why we are trying to restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our Nation's government, put an end to these massive debts and massive deficits. Our Nation is borrowing a billion dollars a day, but before we borrow a billion dollars a day, we're going to spend half a billion paying interest on a debt we've already got. And that's a half a billion that can't go for Social Security, it can't go for health care, it can't go for new roads and fixing roads and infrastructure. It can't go for education, it can't go for homeland security, and it cannot go for veterans benefits. Why? Because we are spending that money, a half a billion dollars a day, simply paying interest on the debt we've already got before we increase it a billion dollars today. I think we need that half a bill to invest in the best and most advanced technology out there when it comes to bullet-proof vests to protect our men and women in uniform, to give them the best and most advanced equipment they need. 
   I've got a father, John Grant, in Hot Springs, Arkansas, that's very concerned about his son going back for a second tour of duty in Iraq and not having the most advanced body armor that's on the market today. A half a billion a day going to pay interest on the national debt, how many modern, state-of-the-art body armor vests could we buy with just the amount of money we're spending today paying interest on the national debt? 
   I am joined this evening by a number of fellow Blue Dogs, and I am grateful they have come down to spend some time with me on the House floor this evening. 
   At this time I would like to yield to a fellow Blue Dog, someone that's very active on the Blue Dog Coalition, someone that serves on the Armed Services Committee, among other important committees, and that is my friend from neighboring Oklahoma, Dan Boren.

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana, a new  member of the fiscally conservative, Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, Mr. Ellsworth, for joining us for the discussion this evening here on the House floor, as we are every Tuesday night, here talking about restoring fiscal sanity to our national government. 
   Public opinion polls indicate that the American people really aren't concerned about the debt, which is approaching $9 trillion. But I am here to make the case that every one of us in America should be concerned about the national debt, because despite what some people may believe, despite what the Republicans have believed for the past 6 years, money does not grow on trees in Washington, DC, and we have got to begin to run this government the way that I can assure you Holly Ross makes sure that we run the Ross household in Prescott, Arkansas, and that is living within our means. 
   We cannot continue to borrow $1 billion a day. We cannot continue to spend half a billion dollars a day paying interest on the debt we have already got. 
   Why should it matter to every American? Look at this chart right here. Interest payments on the debt dwarf other priorities. For example, in the red you can see the amount of money we are spending of your tax money, Madam Speaker, paying interest on the national debt. You compare that to education in the light blue, compare it to homeland security in the green, compare it to veterans benefits in the blue. 
   You can see where the priorities lay with this administration for the past 6 years. The majority of our money is being spent paying interest on the national debts, not going to educate our children, not going to keep our homeland safe, not going to fund veterans healthcare. 
   At this time I yield to the gentleman from Georgia, a fellow Blue Dog member, Mr. Scott.

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his work with the Blue Dog Coalition, 43 of us, fiscally conservative Democrats. I welcome the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, to remain on the floor with me, if time will permit for him, for a discussion more in depth over the next 40 minutes as we talk about restoring not only fiscal sanity, but also accountability to our government, not only here at home but to the money being spent in Iraq. 
   We all support our troops, Democrats and Republicans alike. Up until now,  the President would have you believe that we are sending $12 million an hour to Iraq, and if you question how any of it is being spent, he would tell you you are unpatriotic. 
   Well, the Blue Dogs have said enough is enough. It is time to demand accountability for how that money is being spent, to ensure it is being spent to provide the very best equipment and the best of the best for our brave men and women in uniform serving us abroad today, not only in Iraq but also Afghanistan. 
   I am joined this evening by the gentleman from North Dakota, Mr. EARL POMEROY, and a fellow Blue Dog member. Welcome.

   Mr. ROSS. I appreciate the gentleman and his leadership within the Blue Dog Coalition and his work on the House Armed Services Committee and for his insight this evening. 
   We all support our troops, Republicans and Democrats alike. As members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we want accountability for how your tax money is being spent. In 2001 and 2002, $2.5 billion was being spent in Iraq. In 2003, $51 billion. In 2004, $77.3 billion. In 2005, $87.3 billion. In 2006, $100.4 billion. And 2007 to date, $60 billion, for a total of $378.5 billion. 
   We are currently spending about $10 billion a month, about $2.5 billion a week. You do the math. It is about $12 million an hour of your tax money we are sending to Iraq. What are they doing with it? Number one, they ought to be ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform get the best body armor available to them. There are reports out that indicate maybe that is not exactly the case. 
   This was brought to my attention by John Grant from Pearcy, Arkansas, just outside of Hot Springs, in Garland County. His son is getting ready to go back for a second tour of duty. He visited a National Guard Armory where he actually saw body armor that was stamped ``Fragile, Handle With Care.'' It is time we did right by our brave men and women in uniform and provide them with the resources they need. 
   The Blue Dogs have written a bill with the help of Captain PATRICK MURPHY, a veteran of the Iraq war and fellow Blue Dog member, and JANE HARMAN, former ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, among others, and our bill demands accountability on how our tax money, your tax money, is being spent in Iraq. 
   One of the reasons that we decided to do this bill was because of reports like this: Washington Post, Monday, April 30, a story by Dana Hedgpeth, entitled, ``U.S. Rebuilding in Iraq is Missing Key Goals, Report Finds.'' Less than a third of Iraq's 3.5 million students attend class. In the medical field, for example, only 15 of 141 primary health care centers have been completed, and only eight of those are open to the public. The list goes on, and we will talk more about this in a little bit. 
   At this time I yield to a former co-chair of the Blue Dogs and an active member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson).

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Utah, and the gentleman's right, the Blue Dog Coalition, we want to thank Chairman Skelton for including key provisions of our bill, H. Res. 97, in the Defense authorization bill. 
   H. Res. 97 was previously introduced by Blue Dog members and calls for transparency in how Iraq War funds are spent. Specifically, the Defense authorization bill addresses the lack of oversight and accountability in the war by requiring that the Government Accountability Office, commonly referred to as the GAO, report every 6 months on the handling of contracts in Iraq. 
   In addition, Blue Dog members applaud the inclusion of measures in the Defense authorization bill which establish essential management goals for the Department of Defense and expand the authority of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to include all reconstruction funding, regardless of source or fiscal year. 
   Again, we're all about providing the funding our troops need. We want to make sure that funding gets to them and that this administration's accountable for it and that the Iraqi people are accountable for how the money is being spent that we send to them. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you have got any comments or questions or concerns for  us, you can e-mail us at bluedogs@mail.house.gov. Again, that's bluedogs@mail.house.gov. 
   I yield to my fellow Blue Dog member all the way from California (Mr. Costa).

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, and as we have been discussing this hour, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 97 demands accountability for how the money is being spent in Iraq. 
   We all support our brave men and women in uniform. We all support our troops. We are all Americans first and foremost, but just as when a small town in America receives a grant they must be held accountable for how that grant money is spent, so should the Iraqi government. 
   Again, Washington Post, Monday, April 30, by Dana Hedgpeth, entitled U.S. Rebuilding in Iraq Is Missing Key Goals, Report Finds. ``Before the U.S.-led invasion, Iraq's power system produced 4,500 megawatts a day with an aging infrastructure in which 85 percent of power plants were at least 20 years old, the report said. Reconstruction officials initially hoped to increase daily output to 6,750 megawatts by the summer of 2004, a target later lowered to 6,000 megawatts. But in the most recent quarter, Iraq generated only 3,832 megawatts a day.'' 
   What does that mean? The story goes on to say, ``The shortage was particularly acute in Baghdad. Before the war, the city received an average of 16 to 24 hours of power a day. Last spring, Baghdad averaged 8 hours of electricity a day.'' That was last spring. ``This year, during the last week of March, the city received only 6.5 hours of electricity a day. The rest of the country, however, received an average of 14 hours of power a day.'' 
   At this time, I yield to the gentleman that helped write H. Res. 97, which is of course the Blue Dog bill, to provide for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability, to provide an accounting for how this $12 million an hour of your tax money is being spent in Iraq, the gentleman who helped white the bill, an active member of the Blue Dog Coalition, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson).

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Childers amendment to H.R. 6842.  
   Tonight is a historic night. The American people are sick and tired of all of the partisan bickering that goes on up in Washington. Time after time, bills come to the floor, and they pass or fail on a straight party line vote. Tonight, a bill is going to be defeated by Democrats and Republicans coming together, and an amendment is going to pass because of Democrats and Republicans coming together. That, in my opinion, is long overdue. 
   Mr. Chairman, when I raised my right hand and took the oath of office, I swore that I would uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. That includes amendment No. 2. Mr. Chairman, I could not be more proud of the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Childers). He may be a new Member of Congress, but he certainly knows where he is, and he knows why he's here--to defend the Constitution of the United States of America. We can't cherry pick. We took the oath to defend the entire Constitution, including the second amendment. 
   Back home in Arkansas, there's a bumper sticker that says, ``When you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.'' Quite frankly, I don't believe it's a coincidence that Washington, D.C. has a high crime rate, a rate where guns can only be found with the outlaws and not with responsible, law-abiding citizens. 
   In June of this year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down D.C.'s ban on handguns and operable firearms for self-defense within the home as in the case of D.C. versus Heller. Mr. Souder and I had a bill to address this issue. We thought we would no longer need to raise the issue after the Supreme Court ruling, but that was before we learned that the District responded by passing an emergency bill that failed to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling. In fact, they snubbed their nose at the Supreme Court. 
   The Childers substitute amendment remedies this by enforcing the Supreme Court's Heller decision and by preventing the District of Columbia's government from restricting the second amendment rights of its citizens. This should be very important to every one of us who is a Member of Congress because, folks, Mr. Chairman, if our Nation's capital can pass gun control, our hometowns all across America could be next. That's why I'm against this bill and why I am for the amendment. I'm proud to stand here as a pro gun Democrat. 
   What did the Washington, D.C. city council do that was so bad and that makes no sense in snubbing their nose at the Supreme Court? 
   Number one, they defined ``machine guns'' to include all semiautomatic guns. Nearly every gun in America today is a semiautomatic gun. We duck hunt with semiautomatic guns. Pistols are semiautomatics. 
   They also said that any gun that you own must be unassembled in the privacy of your own home until you are in imminent danger. In other words, you've got to wait until someone is inside your home and then say, ``Mr. Intruder, would you please respectfully wait while I assemble my gun.''

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. ROSS. That makes no sense either. 
   Then, finally, the Supreme Court said you can have a gun in D.C., but they don't sell guns in D.C. Guess what? The D.C. city council said you can't transport a gun from Maryland or Virginia into D.C. Therefore, that means you can still no longer have a gun in D.C. 
   We're not giving Washington, D.C. any more or any less than what most citizens in this country enjoy today under the second amendment. That is the ability of law-abiding citizens to responsibly own guns and to have them assembled, if they so choose, in the privacy of their own homes. We provide Washington, D.C. in this substitute amendment the same definition as most of the rest of the country has as it relates to machine guns. 
   I urge support of the amendment and a vote against the bill in support of our Nation's second amendment rights.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Childers amendment to H.R. 6842. I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for giving me 2 minutes to address this issue. 
   Some folks may say, why would a Member of Congress from Arkansas be concerned about D.C. gun laws? It's quite simple. Number one, I'm a pro-gun Democrat. Number two, if the Government of D.C. can take your guns away from you in our Nation's capital, Prescott, Arkansas and many other small towns across this country could be next. 
   Now, why are we here? In June, the Supreme Court struck down D.C.'s ban on handguns and operable firearms within the home for self-defense. The District responded by passing an emergency bill that fails to comply with the Court's ruling. Here's what D.C.'s response was to the Supreme Court ruling saying, yes, the second right applies to the citizens of the District of Columbia just as it does to all the other citizens in the United States of America, and this is how the Government of D.C. responded. They did not correct its machine gun ban, which, unlike Federal or State laws, defines machine guns to include semi-automatic firearms. Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker, almost every weapon in America today is a semi-automatic firearm. You can't duck hunt without a semi-automatic firearm. Very few pistols can be purchased that are not semi-automatic firearms. 
   D.C. failed to eliminate its ban on operable firearms within the home, allowing a person to assemble and load a firearm at home only if a criminal attack is underway. In other words, if someone breaks into your house in D.C., you've got to say, excuse me, Mr. Intruder, would you pause a moment while I assemble my gun? This bill makes no sense, and that's why the Childers amendment is in order and that's why I will be supporting it today.

   Mr. ROSS. I'd like to thank the gentleman from Utah for leading this discussion this evening on energy. 
   As the gentleman mentioned, I'm fortunate to serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and on the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee. Through my work there, I've been working on ways to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to address this energy crisis facing America and, quite frankly, facing the world, and I think there are several ways to do it. 
   There is no silver bullet. It's going to take a multifaceted approach. As Congress, we can't control the demand for oil in the world, but as a Congress, we can make an impact on the supply, and that's what I believe that this Congress needs to do. 
   Here is what we do know: In the next 8 years, there will be 100 million new cars on the road, 100 million new cars on the road in the next 8 years, not here but in China and in India. 
   Here is the other thing we know: If we do not change our current energy policy in this country, sometime in the next 12 to 20 years, depending on whose numbers you want to believe, we will go from being 60 percent dependent on foreign oil to being 100 percent dependent on foreign oil. 
   I've got a plan that, I believe, can go a long way toward fixing that. While we have a gasoline crisis today, in the next 35 years, it will be an electricity crisis. I've got a bill, H.R. 5437. It's called the American-Made Energy Act. It's 155 pages long. It's a multifaceted bill that takes a multifaceted approach to this energy crisis. Again, there is no silver bullet. Quite simply, my bill does this: 
   I propose that we drill in ANWR. There are 19 million acres in ANWR. My bill proposes to drill on 2,000 of them--one-sixth the size of the Dulles Airport. We've already got a pipeline going to Alaska, to ANWR, that can handle 2 million barrels a day; we're only putting 1 million in it. Let's fill it up and put the other 1 million barrels in it. 
   Additionally, we can drill off the coast. In fact, it was by executive order that Bush One chose to shut down drilling near the coast of Florida. That was a mistake. They're drilling much closer to the coast in Alabama than they are in Florida today because of an executive order issued by former President Bush, often referred to as Bush 41, I believe. 
   So this is not a Democrat or a Republican problem. I think both parties, quite frankly, have some blame to share here, but we don't have a Democratic energy problem or a Republican energy problem; we've got an American energy problem, and we need to fix it as a Congress. I think it would be most helpful if we did it, quite frankly, in a bipartisan way. 
   I'm not talking about drilling off the coast or in ANWR and utilizing 1940 or 1950 technology, not even utilizing 1990 technology. I'm talking about doing it while utilizing 21st century technology that can allow us to do it, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and yet remain good stewards of this environment, of this land that God has given us to care after. 
   Then there are the lease and royalty payments from drilling in those areas. By drilling in those areas, we meet our short-term oil needs. We've got some great ideas. I've actually test-driven a hydrogen fuel cell car. You can drive it. It sounds like an electric golf cart, and it runs like a regular car, and when you stop, if you jump out and run to the tailpipe with a clean 
   glass, in time, it'll pour you a half a cup of water. They tell me you can drink it. I didn't try, Madam Speaker, but they say you can. 
   I mean these are not Star Wars-ish ideas. These are not ideas of the next century or of the next generation. They're here, but we need an energy policy that embraces them and that moves them from the science lab to every street corner in America where you see a gas pump today. 
   So my bill does this: It says drill in ANWR, utilizing new environmental technology. Drill off the coast, utilizing new environmental technology. Then the revenue from the lease and royalty payments, it's estimated, will total $80 billion. I want to take that $80 billion and put every dime of it into alternative and renewable fuels to move these ideas from the science lab to the marketplace. 
   This year, this administration will spend less than $4 billion on alternative and renewable fuels. Now, for a country boy from Hope, Arkansas, $4 billion sounds like a lot of money, but to put it in perspective, we will spend that amount in Iraq in the next 10 days. Bill Gates will spend twice that amount on research and development for Microsoft Corporation alone this year. When President Kennedy said he was going to put a man on the Moon, he didn't just say it; we invested in it. In today's dollars, it was $90 billion, and we did so much more than put a man on the Moon. We grew a new generation of innovators in this country  who have created and who have invented a lot of the technologies that we're now beginning to take for granted. 
   It's time for another President Kennedy ``let's go to the Moon''-sized investment and, this time, with alternative and renewable fuels so we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil. That's exactly what I try to accomplish with the American-Made Energy Act, H.R. 5437. 
   I'd like to thank the gentleman from Utah for allowing me to come and to speak on my bill for a few minutes this evening, and I appreciate his leadership on these energy issues. 
   With that, I yield back to him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise on behalf of the 43 Member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that are committed to restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   As you walk the Halls of Congress, Mr. Speaker, it is easy to know when you are walking by the office of a fellow Blue Dog Member because you will see this poster that says ``The Blue Dog Coalition.'' It says, ``Today, the U.S. national debt is, 8,887,793,986,597.86.'' And for every man, woman and child in America, their share of the national debt is $29,465. It is what we refer to as the ``debt tax.'' And that is one tax that cannot be cut, that cannot go away until this Nation gets its fiscal house in order. The Federal deficit continues to climb. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is hard now to think back and realize, but from 1998 through 2001, this country had a balanced budget; and yet under the Republican leadership for the previous 6 years, we have seen them rubber-stamp the President's budget year after year after year, giving us the largest deficit after the largest deficit after the largest deficit, record deficits. And as a result of that, we have seen the national debt grow to where it is today, approaching $9 trillion. 
   Why does this matter? It matters because the total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion, but by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. This is a doubling of the 211-year debt in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget. And the debt tax is one that cannot be repealed. Deficits reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who own some 40 percent of our debt. 
   This chart here, Mr. Speaker, graphically depicts why the American people should be concerned about the fact that our country is nearly $9 trillion in debt. You see, our Nation spends a half a billion dollars a day, give or take a  few dollars, simply paying interest on the debt, and that is money that could be going for education, health care, veterans benefits, to properly equip our men and women in uniform and ensure that they've got the best body armor possible. 
   And this really graphically depicts it, as you can see. The red bar is the amount of money our Federal Government spends simply paying interest on the national debt. The light blue bar demonstrates how much money we spend educating our children. The green box indicates how much we spend on our veterans. And the purple box indicates how much we spend on homeland security. Again, you can see overwhelmingly our tax money is going to pay interest on the national debt. 
   It is time to get our fiscal house in order. It is time to restore common sense to our Federal Government. And once we do, we can begin to spend less of your hard earned tax money, Mr. Speaker, on paying interest on the national debt, and we can spend a lot more on educating our children, taking care of America's veterans, keeping our homeland secure, and the list of America's priorities goes on and on. 
   One of the co-chairs for the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition is Allen Boyd from Florida. He is our administrative co-chair. I am delighted that he has joined me this evening for this lively discussion about restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our national government. And part of the way we do that, we believe, is through accountability. 
   Throughout the evening we are going to be talking about the budget, we are going to be talking about the debt and the deficit, we are going to be talking about accountability, not only at home, but also in Iraq, and making sure that the hardworking people of this country are getting the most for their tax dollar. I don't think that is asking too much. And I think it is very appropriate that on tax day we rise on the floor of the House to demand accountability for how the American taxpayer's money is being spent. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Boyd, the co-chair for administration for the Blue Dog Coalition.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his work within the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition in trying to restore commonsense and fiscal discipline to our national government, trying to give us a budget that will return us to the days of record surpluses instead of record deficits. Hopefully, as a result of the budget passed on this floor just in the last week, we will see this number start back down once again, because it is important; it is important that we put an end to deficit spending. 
   One of the ways we do that is through accountability. Let me just say that if we are going to ask the American people to get up and go to work and pay taxes, we as a Congress should be held accountable and the various Federal agencies should be held accountable to ensure they are getting the most value for their tax dollars, that we truly are doing things that will honor their work and ensure that we leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for our children and our grandchildren.     
   One of the leaders in the Blue Dog Coalition, in fact, one of the founders of the Blue Dog Coalition that has done a lot in the area of accountability is the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner), and at this time, I will yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner). Thank you for joining me this evening.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Indiana, a new member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition for joining me this evening and being a part of this discussion on how we restore common sense, fiscal discipline, and accountability to our government. 
   Mr. Tanner said it very well earlier in the evening when he said the American people are sick and tired of all the partisan bickering that goes on at our Nation's Capitol. I can tell you those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition, we don't care if it is our idea or the Republican idea. We are looking for commonsense ideas, ideas that promote accountability, ideas that make sense for the people back home. 
   Now, there are others that will come to this floor and talk about the Democrats being bad on this or so forth and so on, and there are Democrats that will talk about the Republicans being bad on this or so forth and so on, but the American people are sick of that. The American people get it. They recognize that we are all Americans first and we are in this together. 
   Talking about accountability, this is a bipartisan issue that I would like to raise in the closing minutes of this Special Order. The United States is spending about $9 billion a month in Iraq, which translates to about $275 million a day or $12 million an hour. However, even with all of this spending, many believe that the U.S. Army is not providing our troops with the most technologically advanced and effective body armor available. 
   If you ask 100 different people what they think about this post-war Iraq policy, you get about 100 different answers. But I can tell you that there is one thing that all of us, Democrat and Republican, should remain united on, and that is funding and supporting and properly equipping our men and women in uniform. This war has affected all of us. My brother-in-law is in the United States Air Force. He is in the Middle East region this evening. 
   Let me tell you that 2 weeks ago, one of my constituents, Mr. John Grant of Hot Springs, Arkansas, brought this issue to my attention. Mr. Grant has become an expert on the types of body armor that are currently available in the market due to the fact that his youngest son serves in the Army National Guard's 39th Infantry Brigade. Arkansas' 39th was recently informed that they could be deployed to Iraq by the end of the year. It will be their second deployment. I was there in Baghdad visiting them August 11, 2004, on their previous deployment, soldiers from my hometown, soldiers from throughout my district, people that I used to teach in Sunday school and people that, well, I have duck hunted with.     
   And they will be returning again, perhaps by the end of the year, and I believe that we owe it to this soldier, his family, and all soldiers and their families, to ensure that our troops are given the finest armor and equipment available. 
   This issue specifically involves the U.S. Army's recent testing and comparison of Pinnacle Armor's so-called Dragon Skin body armor and the Interceptor Body Armor, often referred to as IBA, currently in use by the Armed Forces. Because of equipment shortages in 2005, some troops purchased equipment at their own expense, including body armor, and Congress enacted legislation to reimburse these soldiers. However, months later, the Army issued a ``safety of use message,'' which instructed all commanders to ensure that only IBA brand is used by soldiers, prohibiting the use of any other body armor. 
   The Army's ``safety of use message'' also dispelled recent reports that Dragon Skin was superior to the IBA, citing that Dragon Skin has failed various tests and therefore does not meet the Army's requirements for soldier body armor protection. 
   Military support organizations, such as Soldiers for the Truth, of which Mr. Grant is a member, along with Dragon Skin manufacturer Pinnacle Armor, argue that Dragon Skin did not fail any test. They have stated that the testing was biased, and they continue to stand behind their assertions that Dragon Skin is superior to the IBA. 
   They point out that Dragon Skin has also been approved and is used by the U.S. Air Force, the CIA, the NSA, the U.S. Department of Energy officials in Iraq, the U.S. Secret Service Presidential Protection detail, some Special Forces units, and various police departments and SWAT teams around the Nation. However, our troops cannot purchase or use this body armor. I have even been informed that, as a result of this message, if a soldier purchases and uses any armor other than the IBA, this action will be construed as though the soldier has disobeyed a direct order and could, could, jeopardize his or her family receiving service group life insurance if killed in combat. 
   It is not certain whether this is true, but if it is, I completely disagree with this policy and believe that our combat soldiers should not be denied the use of the latest and most effective body armor if it will result in the preservation of their lives. 
   Therefore, for the protection of our troops, I am calling for a full investigation into whether the U.S. Army is using the most effective body armor for our troops' protection. We need an unbiased external investigation to determine whether the IBA is the most effective armor available. And if additional testing reveals that Dragon Skin body armor or any other brand is the superior product, then it should be provided to our troops. 
   I am extremely grateful to Mr. Grant for bringing this issue to my attention, as there is no greater obligation we have to our troops, who risk their lives on a daily basis, than to supply them with the most advanced technology and resources available. 
   I believe that we must demand that the most stringent test possible be conducted to resolve whether our troops are being given access to the absolute best body armor available. What might have been good in 2003 might very well be outdated today. My only goal is to protect our troops in harm's way by ensuring that they receive the most advanced body armor on the market today as they carry out their mission. 
   May God bless our country, may God bless and keep our soldiers safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my strong support for raising the federal minimum wage. Today's legislation would increase the existing minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over two years. 
   The minimum wage has not increased in more than nine years which is the longest period in the history of the law. The real value of the minimum wage has plummeted to its lowest level in 51 years. 
   At the current rate of $5.15 an hour, a full-time minimum wage worker brings home $10,712 a year--nearly $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. Increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour would benefit up to 13 million Americans who struggle to raise a family. 
   Last year the state of Arkansas, along with varying other states, realized the need for raising the minimum wage and did so. Now it is time for the Congress to accept this plan and move forward with passage of this important legislation, which can make a real difference in the lives of working families across this country.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, on behalf of the 44 member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition, I rise to spend an hour this evening talking with you and Members of this body about the Blue Dog Coalition's desire to restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our national government. 
   Over the next hour, we plan as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition to talk on this floor about the Blue Dog Coalition's 12-point plan for budget reform. We plan to discuss our accountability measures, because we believe it is time to restore accountability, fiscal discipline, and common sense to our national government. 
   Before I begin the formal presentation this evening, and will be joined by other members of the Blue Dog Coalition, I would like to take a moment to recognize Sergeant Marcus Wilson. Sergeant Wilson grew up in Dermott, Arkansas, in southeast Arkansas, in our congressional district back home. 
   This afternoon I had the honor to go to Walter Reed Army Hospital where I was able to sit down and visit with Sergeant Wilson and his wife and his son and thank him for his service to our country. He is there because of injuries suffered in Iraq. 
   Before that he served in Afghanistan. All of us have different ideas about what we should be doing with this post-war Iraq policy. But one of the things that I believe is absolutely critical and important is that as Members of this Congress, and as American citizens, that we remain united in support of our men and women in uniform. This evening I pay tribute to Sergeant Marcus Wilson of Dermott, Arkansas, and thank him for his service to our country and pray for him as he recovers from injuries he suffered in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish you could have been with me there this afternoon in conversations with Sergeant Wilson because he makes all Americans proud with his attitude, his attitude of perseverance, his attitude of service to our country as a soldier in the United States Marines. Again, I pay tribute and salute Sergeant Wilson. 
   Mr. Speaker, on this day my brother-in-law leaves to go to Kyrgyzstan, which is the entry point for Afghanistan, much like Kuwait is the entry point for Iraq, for his second mission there. I hope that all of us will keep him and all our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere across this globe in our hearts and in our prayers. 
   Mr. Speaker, the underlying purpose of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition is to demand a balanced budget in this country. Mr. Speaker, it was not too long ago from 1998 through 2001 that we had a President named Bill Clinton, from my native State, from my home State, who gave us a balanced budget. 
   One of the ways he did that was with PAYGO rules in place on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, rules that the Republican leadership threw out after they took control of the House and Senate and the White House in 2001, the beginning of the 107th Congress. 
   What we have witnessed over the past 6 years has been absolutely staggering, if not startling. We have seen the largest deficit year after year after year until we have accumulated the largest debt ever in our Nation's history. 
   As members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, we are committed through our 12-point plan for budget reform and through our accountability package to restore fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   As we begin this evening, today the U.S. national debt is $8,701,316,295,722.43. We ran out of room. For every man, woman and child in America, their share, your share of the national debt, $29,035.60, what we refer to as the debt tax, d-e-b-t, which is one tax that cannot be repealed, cannot be cut until we go away and get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   If this is not startling enough, what's even more alarming is the fact that our Nation is borrowing about $1 billion a day. On top of that, we are spending about half a billion every day paying interest on the debt we have already got before it increases by another $1 billion a day. It is important that we get our fiscal house in order, that we return to the days of a balanced budget, that we restore fiscal discipline to our national government, because it is about priorities. 
   Many of America's priorities, honoring our soldiers, giving them the resources they need to get the job done, honoring our veterans and providing them the services that they were promised and so desperately need, especially with this new generation of veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the world, the priorities in education, and so many other areas that are going unmet, half a billion dollars a day is not going to those priorities, they are going to simply pay interest on the debt we already got before it increases another $1 billion just about every single day. 
   We want to do something about this. We want to effect change. We are sick  and tired of all of the partisan bickering that goes on in our Nation's capital. As members of the Blue Dog Coalition we don't care whether it is a Democrat or Republican idea. We ask ourselves if it is a commonsense idea and does it make sense to the people who sent us here to be their voice. 
   We have pushed, for 6 years we have asked the Republican leadership to reinstitute the PAYGO rules on the floor of this House, and for 6 years they turned a deaf ear to us. We are really proud that this new leadership, the Democratic leadership, has listened to the Blue Dog Coalition. In the first 24 hours of the 110th session of Congress, we saw the new Democratic leadership on this floor institute rules that reinstated PAYGO, which is the first step in returning to a balanced budget and putting an end to deficit spending. 
   This evening, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be joined by a former cochair of the Blue Dog coalition, a real leader within our group from the State of California (Mr. Cardoza). At this time I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardoza).

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for joining us this evening as a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition to talk about the need to restore common sense and fiscal discipline and accountability to our Nation's government. 
   On the accountability front, Mr. Speaker, under the United States Constitution Congress has an obligation to provide Congressional oversight of the executive branch. Congressional oversight prevents waste and fraud, it ensures executive compliance with the law and evaluates executive performance. 
   What we saw, Mr. Speaker, for the last 6 years is a Congress that failed to uphold its constitutional duty to provide oversight of the administration. Rather, what we saw was a Congress that provided a rubber stamp. 
   The 110th Congress will be different. We will uphold the Constitution of the United States of America and we will provide oversight of the executive branch, as the founders of this country wrote into our Constitution. The reason we are doing that is because when Congress does not do that, it abandons its responsibility by failing to conduct meaningful investigations of allegations of serious waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for this Congress to hold this administration and the Pentagon accountable for how your tax money is being spent in Iraq. Let me be clear about it: As long as we have soldiers in harm's way, we will support our men and women in uniform. As I mentioned earlier, my brother-in-law is in the U.S. Air Force, and today is headed from Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington, to Kurdistan, where he will be serving for the next few months, if not the first year. My first cousin is in the U.S. Army. His wife gave birth to their first child while he was in Iraq. 
   This war has impacted all of us across this country in one way or another. I have had 3,000 National Guard soldiers, brave soldiers from Arkansas, spend more than a year in Iraq. I e-mailed today with a soldier from my district in Iraq. Make no mistake about it, as long as we have men and women in uniform in harm's way, we will support them and ensure that they receive the resources they need to get the job done. 
   But that should never be confused with holding the administration, the Pentagon and the Department of Defense, accountable for how this money is being spent. We are sending some $9 billion a month, with a B, of your tax money to Iraq. The last report I got, it was some $57 million a day to Afghanistan. It is time that this Congress held this administration and the Department of Defense accountable for how it is spending your tax money in Iraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the world. 
   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, it is time that we hold this new Iraqi government accountable. They must be accountable for their actions. If we are going to put soldiers in harm's way, if we are going to have soldiers dying and becoming injured and returning home without arms and legs and with other injuries that forever change their life, it is time we hold this new Iraqi government accountable for what they are doing or not doing in Iraq. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is important, it is absolutely critical, that we stop this nonsense of passing supplemental after supplemental in funding for the Iraq war when we know that this is a long-term deal. It is time for the President to quit playing games with the American people, to stop this nonsense of passing supplements. It is my understanding he is going to ask for billions more in a supplemental just days, if not weeks, before the budget comes out for fiscal year 2008. It is time to make the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan clear to the American people, provide a level of transparency, and include it in the budget. 
   This is what we are talking about when we are talking about restoring accountability to our national government. Once we demand accountability we will see these deficits begin to disappear. 
   When I was a small child growing up, I always heard it was the Democrats that tax and spend, and yet I come to Congress and we have got for 6 years a Congress that is controlled by Republicans in the House, the Senate and the White House, a country controlled by the Republicans, and what do they give us? They gave us the largest deficit ever in our Nation's history, year after year after year, in fact, the largest deficit ever. $413 billion in hot checks occurred in 2004; in 2003, it was $378 billion in hot checks; in 2005, $318 billion; in 2006, $296 billion in hot checks. 
   It is time to restore fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. It is time for this government to have a balanced budget once again, because where is this money coming from? It is not only coming from taxpayers, but we are spending more than we are taking in. It is coming from foreign central banks and foreign investors. In fact, this administration has borrowed more money in 6 years from foreigners than the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be joined this evening for this discussion  by the cochair of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Boyd.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, a real leader in the fiscally conservative movement, cochair for administration in the Blue Dog Coalition, for his insight this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you have any comments, questions or concerns for us, you can e-mail us at bluedog@mail.house.gov. That is bluedog@mail.house.gov. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are often asked how we got the name Blue Dog Coalition if we are just simply a group of fiscally conservative to moderate Democrats. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, ironically, after the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, we were a group, which I wasn't yet a part of, I came here in 2000, but the conservative-moderate movement in this Congress was a group of Democrats that, you have heard the phrase ``yellow dog Democrat,'' well, the Democrats to our left were choking us blue and the Republicans to our right were choking us blue, and we found ourselves in the middle, which is where we believe America is and where we are trying to bring our country, or at least our Congress as we try to restore fiscal discipline to our national government. 
   But on this accountability measure, if you think with me, Mr. Speaker, no business in our country could succeed financially if it failed to fully report to its shareholders on how it is spending its money. However, that is exactly how our Federal Government has been operating for the past 6 years. This administration is not telling its shareholders, the American taxpayers, how it spends the money coming into our Nation's capital. 
   In 2004, $25 billion of Federal Government spending went absolutely unaccounted for, according to the Treasury Department.     
   The Bush administration was unable to determine where the money had gone, how it was spent or what the American people got for their tax money. Even worse, the Republican-controlled Congress at the time failed to hold the executive branch accountable for this omission. Again, a rubber-stamp Congress year after year. The 107th Congress, a rubber-stamp Congress; the 108th Congress, a rubber-stamp Congress; the 109th Congress, a rubber-stamp Congress; the 110th Congress, no more rubber-stamp Congress. 
   You are going to see a Congress that upholds its constitutional duty given to it in the Constitution of the United States of America to provide oversight. That does not mean go on witch hunts. It means do our job that we have been elected to do in providing oversight and accountability on how the American people's tax money is spent. 
   In fact, in 2005, the General Accountability Office reported that 18 of 24 major Federal agencies had such bad financial systems that they do not even know the true cost of running some of their programs. Yet the Republican-controlled Congress at the time did not force these agencies to fully account for how money was being spent before doling out billions more of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, to the same programs. 
   Clearly, Congress year after year has failed to ask the serious questions  about the Bush administration's fiscal irresponsibility and record-high deficits 4 years in a row and have now pushed the Federal debt to nearly $9 trillion. 
   The time has come to hold this administration accountable for its reckless behavior here at home, as well as in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of the world. You are going to see this 110th Congress do that under the leadership of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. 
   I believe Congress must act now to renew its constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance for overspending, waste, fraud and financial abuse within the executive branch. Wasteful government spending has forced the national debt to its current record level; and future generations, our children and grandchildren, have to pay that bill. Future generations will have to pay back with interest the money the Federal Government is borrowing from other countries due to this administration's fiscal recklessness. 
   The time has come to restore commonsense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. As members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we have a plan to restore accountability to our government and we have a 12-point plan for budget reform. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to a new Blue Puppy, if you will, a new member of the Blue Dog Coalition from Ohio (Mr. Wilson).

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio, and we welcome him to the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and appreciate his commitment to restoring accountability, commonsense, and fiscal discipline to our national government. 
   A lot of times when people think of conservative Democrats, they think of the South; and you will find with the Blue Dog Coalition that we come from every region of the country, Arkansas, Ohio, Long Island, Burbank, Florida, California, and everywhere in between, and we share a common value, and that is, to be responsible stewards of the tax money that is sent to this capital and to ensure that we leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for our children and grandchildren. 
   Mr. Speaker, what brings us here this evening is, as this poster demonstrates, the national debt, $8,701,316,295,722 and some change. Again, you divide that number by every man, woman and child in America, everyone's share of the national debt is $29,035. A lot of money, a number we need to pay down by going back to the days of a balanced budget, as we had in this country from 1998 through 2001. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the Halls of Congress, it is easy to detect when you are walking by the office of a Blue Dog member because you will see this poster as a welcome mat by their door to constantly remind Members of Congress and the American people of the national debt. This number, unfortunately, not only changes daily but will go up some $40 million during the hour that we are on the floor this evening discussing this crisis.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I guess a good way of putting that was the total national debt, not just 6 years ago, but the total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion. Today, it is approaching $9 trillion; and by 2010, it is estimated to total more than 10 and approaching $11 trillion. Put it another way, it is doubling, a doubling of the 211-year debt in the past 6 years. 
   The reason the debt should matter, Mr. Speaker, is because interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget, which means less money for education, less money for veterans benefits, less money for health care, less money for roads, and on and on and on. 
   So deficits do matter. Deficits reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own a sobering 40 percent of our debt. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Florida.

   Mr. ROSS. The gentleman makes an excellent point. In fact, I have a list here. I guess it is like David Letterman's top 10 list. It is the top 10 current lenders. These are the countries that the United States of America are borrowing money from, and for the past 6 years, we have literally gone out and borrowed money from foreign central banks, foreign investors to give folks in this country earning over $400,000 a year a tax cut and leaving our children and grandchildren to foot the bill to pay back these foreigners, if you will. 
   But the top 10 current lenders are Japan, $640 billion; China, $321.4 billion; United Kingdom, $179.5 billion; OPEC, imagine that one, $98 billion. The United States of America has borrowed from OPEC to run our government. It is time we learned to live within our means again. Korea, $72.4 billion; Taiwan, $68.9 billion; Caribbean banking centers, $61.7 billion; Hong Kong, $46.6 billion; Germany, $46.5 billion. And are you ready for this? Mexico. Mexico, our Nation has borrowed $40.1 billion from Mexico to fund this reckless spending that we have seen in this Chamber and in this government in the past 6 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can assure you, this is every bit as critical to our national security as anything else we have got facing us today because it is a threat to our Nation. It is a threat to our Nation for us to owe this kind of money to so many foreign countries and their central banks and their investors. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Florida.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Florida. As you can see, in 2000 we had a surplus, in 2001 we had a surplus, and then in 2002 you can see what happened. And the purple demonstrates that we have been in the red, deficit spending year after year after year, record deficit after record deficit. 
   I think it is important to note that what we are trying to do here is set the stage, explain the mess we are in, and we are not here to simply criticize the Republican leadership of the past 6 years; we are here to offer up commonsense solutions to fix this mess. I think the American people want us to fix it. 
   As members of the Blue Dog Coalition we have tried to spend the last half hour framing how we have gotten to where we are, because a lot of people remember when we did have a balanced budget in this country. We want to get back to those days, and the way we believe we can do it is through the Blue Dog Coalition's 12-point plan for budget reform. 
   Point number one is require a balanced budget. Blue Dogs support a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget every year except in times of war or national emergency. We believe a balanced budget amendment is the only way to ensure fiscal discipline in Congress. Forty-nine States require a balanced budget. Holly Ross requires a balanced budget. And I don't believe it is asking too much and I believe the American people expect it from us to provide them a balanced budget with their tax money and how we run our government here in these United States of America.

   Mr. ROSS. If the gentleman would yield. When we talk about PAYGO rules, that is an acronym used on the floor of Congress; but to a lot of the folks of America they probably ask, what is this PAYGO business? It means pay-as-you-go. It was the policy that was in place in this Chamber when we saw the first balanced budget in 40 years, and it went out the window with the Republican leadership of 2001 and we have seen record deficit after record deficit since then. And for 6 years we begged the Republican leadership to listen to us conservative Democrats and work with us to reinstitute this PAYGO rule, and for 6 years it fell on deaf ears. And I am very pleased that one of these 12 points for budget reform, in fact a couple of them, have now been implemented as a policy in the rules of this House under the new Democratic leadership, and I want to thank them for not only listening to us but heeding our call and doing it in the first 24 hours of the 110th Session of Congress under the Democratic leadership, which demonstrates that our message is getting out. People are identifying with our message of restoring fiscal discipline to our national government. 
   But many folks on the Republican side still don't get it, Mr. Speaker. I will never forget when we were down here debating the PAYGO rule, and PAYGO means pay-as-you-go; it means if you have got some new idea for a new program, you have got to show us. And I watched Member after Member on the Republican side get up and say that it is nothing more than a disguise for a tax increase, because if you are going to have new spending, you have got to have more money. They don't get it. They are the party that used to believe in cutting spending, and now they think the only way to pay for a  program is raising taxes. Not so, Mr. Speaker. We are talking about paying for programs, paying for ideas that are good for the American people by cutting other programs, cutting the waste out of government. 
   People say, well, there is really waste in the government? Yes, sir, Mr. Speaker. I have got $400 million worth of waste sitting in a cow pasture at the Hope Airport in Hope, AR, in some 8,000 brand-new, fully furnished, manufactured homes that FEMA ordered for Hurricane Katrina victims that never got to those victims. They still are sitting there in a hay meadow at the airport in Hope, AR. That is just one of many examples of waste. That is a $400 million example. It is a symbol of what is wrong with FEMA and what is wrong with this administration. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson).

   Mr. ROSS. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for helping me go through the first 6 of our 12 points for budget reform that we believe can go a long way toward cleaning up this mess here in Washington. And next week, Mr. Speaker, we will be going through the other six points for budget reform. And the gentleman is right, a rainy day fund makes so much sense. No more of these supplementals, which is another word for skirting the budget and skirting the normal appropriations process. We are kidding ourselves if we don't believe there is going to be some kind of disaster or need for a rainy day fund in America every year. These are 6 of the 12 points that we believe can lay a foundation to return to the days of a balanced budget to restore fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. 
   A lot of people, Mr. Speaker, want to know, what is this Blue Dog Coalition? We are 44 members strong. But what exactly is the Blue Dog Coalition and what exactly do they stand for? And Mr. Speaker, if you have got any comments or concerns for us, you can e-mail us at BlueDog@mail.house.gov. 
   I am pleased to be joined this evening by a real leader of the Blue Dog Coalition from the State of Tennessee, Mr. Lincoln Davis, who in these closing few minutes is going to tell us exactly what the Blue Dog Coalition is all about and what we as fiscally conservative Democrats stand for.

I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for joining us for this Special Order as we talk about the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition's 12-point plan for meaningful budget reform, what we believe can lay a foundation to return us to the days of a balanced budget, to put an end to this reckless spending, to put an end to this deficit spending, and as we discuss our plan for accountability. 
   We are here to offer up commonsense solutions to many of the challenges facing this country today, Mr. Speaker. As I conclude, I would just remind you that the national debt as of today is $8,701,316,295,722. And that debt during the past hour while we have been on the floor of this House has gone up by an estimated $40 million. It is time to restore fiscal discipline to our national government.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, as every Tuesday evening, I rise on behalf of the 43 member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that are doing our best to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Federal Government. Part of that is accountability. 
   This evening I am pleased to be joined by another gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Berry, from Arkansas's First Congressional District, as we talk about restoring not only common sense and fiscal discipline to our national government, but accountability to our Federal agencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, a week ago, Saturday, February 24, 2007, at about three in the afternoon, not one but two tornadoes devastated the rural delta county of Desha County. The county seat is Arkansas City. It was spared. McGehee was spared for the most part. But Dumas, a town of about 5,000 people, was hit, and hit hard, as you can see from this photo provided to me by Agnes Ross at the Dumas Clarion. This is what was left of the Fred's Dollar Store. My district director's dad was in the meat locker of the grocery store, Matt Butcher, next door, which was also destroyed. In fact, Mr. Speaker, 150 homes were either destroyed or  heavily damaged. Depending on whose numbers you want to rely on, somewhere between 600 and 800 workers were displaced from work, because wherever they worked was destroyed or heavily damaged. That community of Dumas and much of Desha County went without power for five days. 
   It was bad enough that the Governor cut short his trip to the National Governor's Association meeting here in Washington and flew home, and I was privileged to join him in going to Dumas and spending the afternoon visiting folks and reassuring folks that help was on the way. It was bad enough that the Governor called out 150 members of the Arkansas National Guard. 
   That was February 24, 2007. More than a week later, the President still has not declared Desha County a Federal disaster area and FEMA has not responded to my request to move 150 mobile homes that were purchased for Hurricane Katrina to Dumas and Desha County to be used for temporary housing while these good folks in this forgotten delta county get their lives put back together and rebuild their homes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is one example of the damage. Again 150 National Guard soldiers called out; 150 people's homes either destroyed or severely damaged; 600 to 800 workers temporarily displaced from their job because wherever they worked was destroyed or heavily damaged; no power for 5 days. And yet the Federal Emergency Management Agency says that this forgotten delta county, Desha County, is not worthy of a Federal disaster declaration. They want to talk about all these rules and regulations and all this bureaucratic this and bureaucratic that. 
   You would expect that from the IRS, Mr. Speaker, you would expect that from most Federal agencies. But when I think of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when I think of FEMA, I think of first responder. I think of one Federal agency that should be able to cut through the bureaucratic red tape and get something done. If FEMA can't do it, no Federal agency can do it, and FEMA is not. 
   I guess what infuriates me more is a week after these two tornadoes struck Dumas and Desha County, and here is another good photo of one of the houses that was destroyed, we can't convince FEMA that that home is destroyed, but we believe it was destroyed, it is certainly uninhabitable, but what gets me is, a week ago Saturday, the tornadoes hit Dumas. The President has yet to declare it a Federal disaster area, FEMA has yet to help with temporary housing, or anything else, for that matter, and yet the following Saturday, and my heart goes out to the people in Alabama and Georgia, we were fortunate in Dumas and Desha County, we did not have a loss of life. We did have a couple of dozen injuries, some of them very serious, but the good Lord was working overtime in Dumas, Arkansas, a week ago Saturday. There is no doubt about that. People go through and tour this town and they scratch their head. How in the world did no one die? And for those who did die in those tornados that came about a week later in Georgia and Alabama, our heart goes out for those people. 
   But it really galled me to see the director of FEMA with the President in Alabama and Georgia holding hands singing ``Kumbaya'' and talking about the new and improved FEMA. The new and improved FEMA has forgotten this delta county. 
   And this story gets better, and is hard to believe. But you can see here, this is one of the 150 homes that is either destroyed or badly damaged. Dumas is a rural community. It is not like there are a lot of rental houses available there. People, even those with insurance, need a place to live while they get their life put back together and their homes rebuilt, which could take up to a year. And this story gets better, or a better word, this story gets more tragic. Some of you are aware of this, Mr. Speaker. 
   When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in August 2005, one of the first things FEMA did was they ordered thousands of brand new, fully furnished mobile homes; not the camper trailers. We are talking brand new, fully-furnished mobile homes, 14 to 16 foot wide, 60 foot long, built-in microwaves, coffee tables, end tables, sofas, dining room sets, built-in central heat and air with the unit ready to drop out of the back. Most of them are equipped, or filled, I should say, with Ashley furniture. 
   Hope, Arkansas, because it is the old proving grounds from World War II, and it is an old military airport and they had some inactive runways and tarmacs, well, FEMA approached the City of Hope, which is also in my district. Hope used to be known as the birthplace of President Clinton. Now we are known as the largest trailer park in the world. 
   So FEMA entered into an agreement with the City of Hope to store these mobile homes in Hope. Not store. Actually, it was to be a FEMA staging area where they would transition through there on their way from wherever they purchased them to the gulf coast region. That was shortly after August 2005, Hurricane Katrina. 
   They kept delivering these mobile homes to Hope. They kept bringing more and more mobile homes to Hope. This an aerial photo that I took Saturday. This is current. I took this Saturday at the Hope Airport from a small plane. This is a current aerial photo. 
   All these white things, those are mobile homes that were purchased for Hurricane Katrina victims August 2005. And the staging area quickly became a storage area where more and more mobile homes arrived, but none of them ever left. Why? Because, at the time, FEMA said, oh, we don't place mobile homes in flood plains. 
   Well, they knew that they don't place mobile homes in flood plains before they bought them. And guess what? Everybody that lost their home in Hurricane Katrina and needed a home lived in a floodplain. So these homes were never placed. 
   Then President Bush was at the Democratic Caucus last month at Williamsburg, and he and I talked about this after the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson, questioned him specifically about these mobile homes, and the President told me, we are saving them for future disasters. 
   In Dumas, Arkansas, a week ago Saturday, the people were struck not by one but by two tornadoes; 150 homes destroyed or badly damaged; 600 to 800 workers out of work because wherever they worked has been destroyed or heavily damaged; 150 members of the Arkansas National Guard called out; and yet, that was a week ago Saturday, on Monday, the Governor and I toured Dumas and on Tuesday at 9 a.m. in a conference call I asked David Paulison, the Director of FEMA, to release 150 of these 8,420 mobile homes. That is how many are currently at the Hope Airport from the photo taken Saturday. There is 8,420 of these parked at the airport in Hope today. 
   I respectfully requested 150 of these be moved to Dumas, which is only 3 hours away, to provide temporary housing for the people of Dumas and Desha County while they rebuild their homes.     
   I am still waiting on an answer. So I called him back again Thursday. He still couldn't give me an answer. They still have not declared this forgotten delta county a Federal disaster, and they have yet to move a single one of these mobile homes. If what I saw in Dumas is not a Federal disaster, Mr. Speaker, I doubt we will ever see another Federal disaster again. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, if they refuse to move 150 of these 8,420 mobile homes from Hope to Dumas to help folks, isn't that what FEMA is supposed to be in the business of doing? Then do you really believe any of these will ever be moved for the public good to help people? It is reprehensible; I am appalled by it. I am ashamed of our government, Mr. Speaker. This is a symbol of what is wrong with FEMA. This is a symbol of why so many people in this country have given up on their Federal Government. 
   And the story gets better. Shortly after Hurricane Katrina and all these mobile homes showed up in Hope and they weren't moving them to the people that needed them on the gulf coast, Mr. Speaker, I spoke up and brought a photo similar to this to the House floor and I said, FEMA, if you do not move these homes to the people who need them on the gulf coast, they are going to start sinking into the cow pasture, the hay meadow, thinking that would get FEMA off high center and they would start moving them to the people  that needed them. What did FEMA do? They showed up with $7 million worth of gravel to put under them. Folks, you cannot make this up; it is too unbelievable. 
   And so if I appear frustrated this evening, I am because a week ago Monday, Governor Beebe and I toured Dumas and the Back Gate community. And in Back Gate, at least a week ago, and perhaps tonight, there were 30 people crowded in a metal building, calling it home because they have no place to live. I talked to Agnes Ross at the Dumas Clarion earlier today and she said she ran into somebody on the streets of Dumas earlier today, an elderly woman that had no place to go, no place to live, and yet 8,420 brand new, fully furnished mobile homes are sitting there at the airport in Hope, Arkansas, 3 hours from Dumas. 
   When the Blue Dog Coalition talks about restoring accountability to our government and making Federal agencies answer for their action, or a lack of action, this is a good example. This is about as good as it gets. And, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to beat up the President or beat up the director of FEMA. I tried for a week to go through the proper channels and get this done, but for the life of me I am imploring the President and the director of FEMA, Mr. Speaker, to move just a few of those mobile homes from Hope to Dumas to help these folks, provide them temporary housing while they try to get their lives put back together and their homes rebuilt. 
   Marion Berry, a Congressman from the First District of Arkansas, is from Gillette. He doesn't live but a few miles from Dumas. He knows these people, too. This storm affected his area, and he is very aware of what is going on and the lack of attention from FEMA. At this time I would yield to him. I want to thank him for joining me this evening to talk about trying to help the folks of Dumas and Desha County, this forgotten delta county.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for joining me this evening and talking about the lack of accountability within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
   To recount, February 24, 2007, a week ago Saturday, not one, but two tornadoes devastated the town of Dumas and the Back Gate community in Desha County. The Governor declared it a State disaster, called out 150 members of the Arkansas National Guard who were there for nearly a week. It took crews of more than a hundred working for 5 days to restore electricity to that delta county. Some 600 to 800 people remain out of work because of the damage done to their workplace. And yet here we are, a week ago Saturday in Dumas, horrible tornados. And the ironic thing is that FEMA has a staging area with 8,420 brand new fully furnished mobile homes 3 hours away, filled with Ashley furniture and built-in microwaves ready to be set up, and the mayor and the county judge, Marion Gill, the mayor of Dumas, Mark McElroy, the county judge in Desha County, they have got sites available. The zoning is cleared with city water, with water and electrical and sewer hook-ups, and yet FEMA, which is supposed to be in the business of helping people, refused to move a single one of these to the more than 150 people who lost their home, like this family right here.     
   This is one of the 150 homes that were either totally destroyed or heavily damaged. Yes, some of these folks had insurance, but yes, we have 8,420 mobile homes 3 hours away that are not doing anybody any good sitting at the airport in a hay meadow. They were purchased to help people. 
   There is no place to rent in Dumas. These folks in Dumas and Desha County need a place to live temporarily. We are not asking that they give these mobile homes to them. We are asking for temporary assistance. That is what FEMA is in the business of or supposed to be. Allow these folks to temporarily live in 150 of these 8,420 brand new mobile homes, filled with Ashley furniture. 
   They are not doing anybody good in Hope. Let us get them moving, Mr. Speaker, to Dumas, Arkansas, and let these folks in Dumas who lost their homes or had their homes heavily damaged live in them temporarily while they get their life put back together and rebuild their homes. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time we have raised this issue. Here is the timeline, talk about accountability and restoring accountability to our government: Saturday, February 24, two tornadoes devastated the communities of Dumas and Back Gate in Desha County. Monday, February 26, I surveyed the damage on the ground and in the air along with Governor Beebe and other elected officials. Governor Beebe named Desha County a State disaster area and announced his plans to request a Federal disaster declaration. 
   Tuesday, February 27, I held a conference call with FEMA Director David Paulison, along with Senator Lincoln from Arkansas and staff for Senator Pryor. In the call, I conveyed my support of Governor Beebe and requested FEMA expedite their decision and action as well as encouraged FEMA to use 150 manufactured homes from this supply of 8,420 of them from Hope, Arkansas, just 3 hours away, for the families without shelter in Desha County. 
   Later Tuesday, my staff talked with FEMA again regarding the status of the disaster declaration, and they expressed that they did not read the laws as we did and that they are still working with Arkansas to gather information. In other words, the bureaucracy began. 
   Wednesday, February 28, I joined with both senators, Senator Lincoln and Senator Pryor from Arkansas in sending a letter to President Bush and FEMA Director Paulison supporting Governor Beebe's request for a Federal disaster declaration. 
   Thursday, March 1, 2007, I again talked with FEMA Director Paulison regarding the lack of a response and movement of these mobile homes from Hope and expressed my displeasure with his office. It had been 6 days since the tornadoes and the communities were just beginning to regain electricity in parts of the town. At that point, FEMA says the reason for not declaring a disaster area is the high rate of insured homes and the fact that the State is capable of taking care of the damage. 
   Supposedly, they told CNN, FEMA did, that the State has a surplus this year, and they do not need their help. Well, Mr. Speaker, that is the craziest thing I have ever heard of. The city and county is a very rural area. It is in the delta region. They lost half their sales tax base when a big retail store left about a year ago. They had a Fred's Dollar Store and a grocery store left, and they have been destroyed. They have, at least for a short period of time, perhaps up to a year, lost much of their tax base. At the same time, they are struggling to pay for a new county hospital and new city hospital there in Dumas, and they are not getting any help from the one agency that we thought was supposed to be there to help us in the time of need, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
   Friday, March 2, 2007, I again joined with Senators LINCOLN and PRYOR to send another letter to FEMA in support of Governor Beebe and the immediate need for mobile homes in Desha County. 
   Saturday, March 3, during an address in Memphis, Tennessee, at the 55th Annual Mid-South Farm and Cotton Gin show, I commented on the lack of response from FEMA one week after the tornadoes. 
   I went to Hope, and I stood in front of these 8,420 mobile homes to highlight the waste of taxpayers' money, the fact that these brand new, fully furnished manufactured homes are just 3 hours away from Dumas, yet they are not being put to good use. They are not helping the people some 3 hours away in Dumas. 
   Then, Tuesday, March 5, 2007, that is today, I joined Senators LINCOLN and PRYOR in sending a letter in support of Governor Beebe's request to the U.S. Small Business Administration to request small business disaster loans be administered in Desha County to help the 25 businesses which were destroyed and the more than 800 employees who are now without a job or a place to work nearby, some 600 to 800 depending on which day it is and which businesses are able to get back up. 
   My office hand delivered letters from me and photos I took, this photo right here. We delivered an 8x10 copy of this photo along with a letter today to President Bush, to FEMA Director Paulison, and to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff, making one final plea to assist these folks in this forgotten delta county. 
   Well, we have gone on long enough on this, Mr. Speaker, but I think it is important. As members of the Blue Dogs, we talk about accountability, and you cannot talk about accountability and the lack of it without talking about FEMA. Again 8,420 brand new mobile homes sitting there at the Hope airport, not doing anybody any good, and I have got 150 homes either totally destroyed or damaged like one 3 hours away. 
   It has been more than a week. FEMA refuses to send a single mobile home to assist these folks. If they are not going to move them 3 hours away to a disaster area, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you these mobile homes will never be put to the public good. They will never go to help people if they are not going to help people 3 hours away in their time of need. 
   I am, once again, Mr. Speaker, imploring the President and the director of FEMA and the Secretary of Homeland Security to do the right thing and to get some of these mobile homes moving to Dumas, where tonight 30 people are living in a metal building. They need our help, Mr. Speaker. 
   That is what the Blue Dog Coalition is all about. We are about trying to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our national government, and we are about accountability. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, we have what is called the Iraq War Accountability Act, and we are going to be talking about that more this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the halls of Congress, it is easy to know when you are walking by an office that belongs to a member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. Why? Because you will see this poster. A poster reminding Members of Congress and reminding the people who  walk the halls of Congress that our Nation is in debt. 
   Today, the U.S. national debt is $8,811,969,377,773 and some change, and if you divide that by every man, woman and child in America, your share, Mr. Speaker, of the national debt is $29,245. It is time that this Nation get its fiscal house in order, and one of the ways we do that is by restoring accountability to our Federal agencies, which is what this business with FEMA is all about, trying to restore accountability and common sense 
   and cutting through the bureaucracy and red tape to help people in their time of need. 
   At this time, it is a pleasure for me to yield to my friend from the State of Ohio (Mr. Wilson). We are pleased to have Mr. Wilson as a new Member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, and at this time, I recognize Mr. Wilson.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson), an important member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, for sharing your thoughts with us this evening as we try to, Mr. Speaker, talk about the need to restore fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. You gave a good example of putting an end to the debt and the deficit spending, and we have had examples this evening about restoring accountability to government, and the accountability and lack of it within FEMA. 
   We are going to hear about other areas where we need to restore accountability within our Federal Government this evening, and we will talk some about the Blue Dog Coalition's Iraq War Accountability Act. 
   We support our troops. In fact, we support them so much we want to make sure this $12 million an hour that is being sent to Iraq of your hardearned tax money, Mr. Speaker, is going to support our men and women in uniform. Unfortunately, as we have learned, much of it is not, and that is why we have this legislation, H.R. 97, the Iraq War Accountability Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you have got any comments, questions or concerns for us, you can e-mail us at bluedog@mail.house.gov. That is bluedog@mail.house.gov. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to another member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. An important member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats who spends many a Tuesday night here on the floor with me talking about the need to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Federal Government. 
   Why? Because today the U.S. national debt is $8,811,969,377,773 and some change. For every man, woman and child in America, their share, our share of the national debt is $29,245. It is what those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition have coined as the debt tax, d-e-b-t, and that is one tax that cannot go awayand cannot be cut until our Nation gets its fiscal House in order. 
   Why is this important? Our Nation is borrowing nearly $1 billion a day. In addition to billing $1 billion a day, we are spending about half a billion every day paying interest on the debt we already got before it goes up another $1 billion today, a half a billion dollars a day. What could we do with that? 
   Just in my district alone, give me three days' interest on the national debt, and I could complete I-49 across the western side of Arkansas. Give me another three days' interest on the national debt, and I could complete I-69 through the delta region of south Arkansas, two important interstate road projects that could help create economic opportunities and lift up one of the poorest regions in our country. 
   Yet these priorities continue to go unmet. Why? Because of a lack of fiscal discipline, because too much of your hard-earned tax money is going to pay interest, not principal, but just interest on the national debt. Year after year, it is hard now to believe, but from 1998 to 2001, we had a balanced budget in this country and a surplus, the first time either a Democrat or a Republican had given us that, in about 40 years. 
   Yet, we have squandered that, this administration and this Republican Congress, for the past 6 years, year after year, have given us the largest deficit ever in our Nation's history and the largest debt ever in our Nation's history. 
   In fact, to put it in perspective, the total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But for 2010, the total national debt will have increased to nearly $11 trillion. That is a doubling of the 211-year debt in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest-growing parts of the Federal budget, the debt tax we call it, d-e-b-t; and it is one tax that cannot be repealed. 
   Our Nation is spending more money paying interest on national debt than we are educating our children. If that is not wrong, I don't know what is. It is morally wrong. 
   Well, you could see the current national debt is at an all-time high. Why do deficits matter? Because they do reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt. Mr. Speaker, this administration in the past 6 years has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   Mr. Speaker, you might be surprised at who they are. It is kind of like David Letterman and his Top 10 list. Here is the Top 10 list of people that we have gone out and borrowed money from in the last 6 years. The United States of America goes out to other countries and borrows money to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   Here is the Top 10, we have borrowed, the United States of America has borrowed, $637.4 billion from Japan; China, $346.5 billion; the United Kingdom, $223.5 billion. You will love this one, OPEC, the United States of America has borrowed $97.1 billion from OPEC; Korea, $67.7 billion; Taiwan, $63.2 billion; the Caribbean Banking Centers, $63.6 billion; Hong Kong, $51 billion; Germany, $52.1 billion. 
   Rounding out the Top 10 countries, where the United States of America has gone and borrowed money from foreign central banks and foreign lenders, you will not believe this one, Mexico. The United States of America has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico to fund tax cuts in this country for people who earn over $400,000 a year. 
   We are trying to fix this, and in this new Democratic majority, I am proud to tell you that not in the first 100 hours, but the first 24 hours, the new Democratic leadership listened to the 43-member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition and reinstituted what is known as the PAYGO rules, which means pay-as-you-go. Those were the rules that were in place on this House floor from 1998 through 2001 when President Clinton gave this Nation its last balanced budget.  
   Some Republicans will have you believe, oh, that means they want to raise taxes to fund a program. Not so. That means that we think you should review programs and find programs that don't work and cut them to pay for new programs. Pay-as-you-go does not mean raise taxes to fund a new program. It means restore accountability to our government, no more rubber-stamp Congress. 
   It means we are going to demand accountability from our Federal agencies; and when programs don't work, and when agencies don't know how to administer them, we are going to cut them and use that money to fund other programs that can work. 
   Well, we have talked a lot this evening about accountability, and I am real proud to be joined by one of the authors of our Iraq War Accountability Act. We support our troops. In fact, the gentleman here with me tonight, from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murphy, is an Iraqi war veteran. My brother-in-law is serving tonight in the Middle East. 
   We support our troops, but we also want to make sure that this $12 million an hour of your tax money that is being sent to Iraq is accounted for, and that it is being spent on our troops to protect them so they can return home safely. 
   For the remaining 5 or 10 minutes we have got this evening, I recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, a new member but an important member of the Blue Dog Coalition, Mr. Murphy.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his work in helping write the Iraq War Accountability Act, which calls for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent. It creates a Truman-like commission to investigate the awarding of contracts, the need to fund the Iraq war through the normal appropriations process and not the so-called emergency supplementals that hide the funding, and using American resources to improve Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations. Another example of how the Blue Dogs are leading the way, Mr. Speaker, in trying to restore accountability to our government here at home as well as in Iraq. 
   And in closing, Mr. Speaker, as I began this Special Order this evening, I talked about the terrible tornados that devastated Dumas and Desha Counties in my district, and I enter into the Record two letters addressed to the President, one February 28 and one March 5, 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Madam Chairman, earlier today my Blue Dog colleagues and I stood together to offer our official endorsement of Chairman Spratt's budget because it is clear that we share the common goal of eliminating wasteful government spending, adhering to strict PAYGO principles, and finally addressing the long-term fiscal challenges facing this country. Not only does this budget resolution begin to address our long-term fiscal challenges, it also includes measures that crack down on wasteful government spending so that no tax dollar is wasted. 
   This budget continues to take steps to reverse the reckless fiscal policies of the past 7 years of Republican rule by incorporating strict PAYGO rules. It does this in two ways: First, it provides for fiscally responsible tax relief for 23 million middle-income Americans by including a fully offset fix to the alternative minimum tax; second, Chairman Spratt's budget resolution includes a commitment to the extension of the same statutory PAYGO requirements which proved instrumental in turning the large deficits of the early 1990s under a Republican into record-budget surpluses under a Democrat for the first time in over 40 years. 
   The Blue Dogs are committed to addressing the serious long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States, and we should confront these challenges earlier rather than later so that we do not pass the burden of unmanageable debt on to our children and grandchildren. 
   This administration, this Republican administration, has borrowed more money from foreigners in the past 7 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. It is time to restore common sense and fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. That's what this budget resolution does, and I'm pleased to stand and speak in support of it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the development of renewable resources. However, establishing a nationwide standard through a one-size-fits-all approach makes this goal unachievable for States like my home State of Arkansas. 
   In fact, if this amendment passes, I will be forced to vote against an energy bill that I helped write. The energy bill went nine, 10 or 11 committees without this language, and here we are in the eleventh hour trying to put it on the bill in the House floor. 
   My home State's wind capacity is minimal. And while we have great potential for biomass, the industry is years away. That means that in the meantime, this requirement would force consumers to have to bear the burden of making these technologies cost effective. 
   Arkansans are among some of the lowest income in the United States, and this requirement will disproportionately affect them, resulting in their being forced to pay up to $15 more a month for electricity. That is why the Arkansas Public Service Commission, appointed by a Democratic Governor, has come out against this amendment. 
   If this amendment is so great, why has its authors exempted municipal power systems, the TVA, electric co-ops and the State of Hawaii?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening, as I do most Tuesday evenings, on behalf of the 43-member strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. Some people may say, what's the Blue Dog Coalition and what's it all about? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we're a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that are trying to restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our Nation's government. We're a group of conservative Democrats that were founded back in 1994 after the Republicans took control of the Congress. And at the time, it was a group that felt like they were being choked blue by the extremes of both parties. And today, we believe that we are in the middle, which is where we believe the majority of the people in America are. 
   We talk a lot about fiscal discipline. We talk a lot about accountability, because it is important, Mr. Speaker, that this Congress and this administration is responsible and accountable for how your tax money is being spent. 
   As you walk the halls of Congress, it is not difficult to know when you're walking by the office of a fellow Blue Dog Member, a fellow fiscally conservative, common-sense Democrat, because you will see this poster that says  the Blue Dog Coalition, and it reminds Members of Congress and the constituents, the citizens of America who walk the halls of Congress that today the U.S. national debt is $8,831,299,779,793. Again, 8,831,299,779,793. That's a big number. But if you were to divide that by every man, woman and child living in America today, including those born today, every one of us, our share of the national debt is $29,242. It's what those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition refer to as the debt tax, D-E-B-T tax. And that is one tax that cannot be cut and that cannot go away until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   So for the past 6 years we've seen record deficit after record deficit, which has resulted in this record debt. Now that the Democrats have a majority in this Congress, we, as members of the Blue Dog Coalition, are trying to put our Nation's fiscal house back in order. We are trying to restore fiscal sanity to our Nation's government. We are trying to restore common sense to our Nation's government. 
   As a small child growing up, I always heard it was the Democrats that spent the money, and it was the Republicans that balanced the budget. And after 6 years of the Republicans controlling the White House, House and Senate, what did they leave us? They left us the largest debt ever, ever in our Nation's history and they gave us record deficit after record deficit. 
   When I first came here in 2001, the first bill I filed as a Member of Congress was a bill to tell the politicians in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security Trust Fund. Republican leadership refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why, because they have continued to raid the Social Security Trust Fund to fund tax cuts for folks earning over $400,000 a year, and they have continued to pass record deficit after record deficit and leaving our children and grandchildren with the bill. 
   The total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. Mr. Speaker, this is a doubling, a doubling of the 211-year debt in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget, and the debt tax, D-E-B-T is one that cannot be repealed until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order and return to the days of a balanced budget. 
   At the Ross household in Prescott, Arkansas, my wife makes sure that we live within our budget. And I can assure you that most of the people in America live within their budget. Small businesses, big businesses, the majority of businesses in America live within their budget. Farm families live within their budget, and I don't believe it's asking too much to ask our Nation to do what 49 States are doing, and that's living within their means, requiring a balanced budget. 
   Why do deficits matter? Deficits reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. 
   They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt. Let me repeat that. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt. The U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders. Foreign lenders currently hold a total of about $2.199 trillion of our public debt. Compare this to only $623.3 billion in foreign holdings in 1993. 
   Who are they? Our Nation continues to borrow money not only from the Social Security Trust Fund, but under the past 6 years of Republican rule, not only have they borrowed money from the Social Security Trust Fund, with absolutely no provision made on how it's going to be paid back or when it's going to be paid back, but they've also borrowed money from foreign central banks and foreign investors. 
   And much like David Letterman, we have a top 10 list. The top 10 current lenders, countries loaning money to the United States of America that, for the past 6 years, under these failed policies of the Republican leadership, have given tax cuts to people earning over $400,000 a year leaving the rest of us to foot the bill.     
   So who are they? Rounding out the list, number one, Japan, our Nation has borrowed $637.4 billion from Japan; China, $346.5 billion; the United Kingdom, $223.5 billion; OPEC, imagine that, $97.1 billion; Korea, $67.7 billion; Taiwan, $63.2 billion; the Caribbean Banking Centers, $63.6 billion; Hong Kong, $51 billion; Germany, $52.1 billion. 
   And rounding out the top 10 countries that lend money to the United States of America to help us pay off these massive debts: Mexico. That is right. The United States of America has borrowed $38.2 billion from foreign central banks and foreign lenders in Mexico to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   Record deficit after record deficit equals what? The largest debt ever in our Nation's history: $8,831,299,779,793. That is right. Today, the U.S. national debt, $8,831,299,779,793 and some change, but we ran out of room on our poster. 
   Well, as I mentioned earlier, another reason deficits should matter is because interest payments on the debt are one of the fastest-growing parts of the Federal budget. In fact, our Nation is spending about a half billion dollars a day, that is with a ``b.'' Our Nation is spending about a half billion dollars a day paying interest on the national debt. And that, Mr. Speaker, is before we borrow an additional billion dollars every day. And that is money that cannot go to education, to homeland security, to veterans' benefits, to build highways and roads, that can create jobs and economic opportunities, because it is going to pay interest on the national debt. It is going to pay interest to Japan, China, United Kingdom, OPEC, Korea, Taiwan, Caribbean Banking Centers, Hong Kong, Germany, and Mexico. 
   In my district, I represent about half of Arkansas, 29 counties. About 13 of them are in the delta region, one of the poorest regions in our country. A lot of hope in that region that I-69 will some day bring jobs and economic opportunities. I-69 was announced 5 years before I was born in Indianapolis; and with the exception of 40 miles in Kentucky and the section they are now building from Memphis to the casinos, there has not been any of it completed in 50 years south of Indianapolis. 
   We need about $1.6 billion to complete Interstate 69 across my district in Arkansas. That is a lot of money. At least for a country boy from Prescott, Arkansas, that is a lot of money. But, Mr. Speaker, we will spend more money paying interest on the national debt in the next 4 days than it would take to build I-69 across the delta region of my district, the delta region of this country, creating jobs and economic opportunities for generations to come. That is on the eastern side of my district bordering Mississippi. 
   On the western side of my district, bordering Texas and Louisiana to the south and also Oklahoma to the west, there is a lot of hope for the completion of Interstate 49. It will be the first north-south corridor through the middle of our country. We need about $2 billion to complete Interstate 49. They have been talking about it since I was a small child. About $2 billion is needed to complete Interstate 49. A lot of money. But, again, we will spend more money paying interest on the national debt in the next 4 days than it would take to complete I-49 across Arkansas. 
   There are a lot of people that would like to see U.S. Highway 82 four-laned across Arkansas from Texas to Mississippi. It is the only section of U.S. Highway 82 that is not four-laned. I don't know. It would take $3 or $4 million to do it. We will spend more money paying interest on the national debt today than it would take to four-lane U.S. Highway 82. 
   Interstate 530 is under construction in my district. We need $300 million to complete it. It will connect I-30 and I-40 in Little Rock and Pine Bluff with someday I-69 between Monticello and Warren, Arkansas, and eventually, hopefully, find its way to connect with I-20 in Louisiana at Bastrop, Louisiana. We need, depending on what section of it you want to complete, between $300 million and $800 million to complete that highway. A lot of money. But, again, we will spend more money paying interest on the national debt in the next 2 days than it would take to complete this interstate, creating jobs and economic opportunities. 
   If you think back with me, the last two Presidents to make any significant  investment in our Nation's infrastructure was Roosevelt with the WPA program and Eisenhower with the interstate program. It is time that we invest in this Nation's infrastructure. We can create jobs and put people to work to build this Nation's infrastructure; and, once it is completed, it will create economic opportunities and jobs for many generations to come. But as long as we are spending half a billion dollars a day paying interest on the national debt and borrowing another billion dollars each day from places like Japan and China and Mexico, we will continue to neglect our Nation's infrastructure. And that is one reason why it is important that we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Let me tell you another reason that interest payments on our national debt do matter, and this chart makes it crystal clear. In the red, Mr. Speaker, you will see the amount of money that we spend each year paying interest on the national debt. That is the red bar. Contrast that to what we spend on education. 
   We say we love our children. We talk about how we want to ensure that they receive a world-class education. We talk about making college education more affordable for our young people. We talk about giving 3- and 4-year-olds a fighting chance, and we should. 
   We live among the freest of all people in the world. One of the few things in life we do not get to choose is who our parents are. Some children get really lucky; some don't. I did, and I can tell you that as an American citizen and as a Member of this House I believe that we have a duty and an obligation to be there for all of God's children. We can invest a little bit in them at an early age and have a good chance at turning a lot of children that have been neglected at home into productive, tax-paying adults. Or we can continue to neglect them and do what? Spend tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars warehousing them for a lifetime behind bars. I believe that we should commit ourselves to education. 
   But look at the light blue bar. Look at how much we are spending on our children's education compared to the red bar, how much we are spending simply paying interest on the national debt. 
   Homeland security, a lot of talk these days about homeland security. But look how much we are really putting into homeland security. Again, the red bar demonstrates the amount of money that we are spending of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, paying interest on the national debt. Contrast that to the light green bar, which demonstrates how much money we are spending protecting our homeland. 
   And, finally, and very sad, the dark blue bar, look at the amount of money we are spending on our veterans, on our veterans. And we all know that we have got a new generation of veterans coming home from places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Contrast the dark blue box, the amount of money we are spending taking care of our veterans, keeping our promises to our veterans, ensuring 
   that they receive health care, compare how much we are spending on our veterans to how much we spend paying interest on the national debt. And I believe that chart very clearly demonstrates why deficits matter, why debts matter, and why the 43 members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition are committed to commonsense principles that will help get this Nation's fiscal house back in order. 
   One of the new Members of Congress and new member of the Blue Dog Coalition is my good friend from Indiana, Mr. JOE DONNELLY. At this time, I yield to him and thank him for joining me this evening.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. The gentleman is correct. I mean, we talk a good game when it comes to our veterans, but then we saw the truth about what was really going on at Walter Reed. And tomorrow there will be a hearing with the Armed Services Committee that is a follow-up to a series that NBC News did about whether or not our men and women in uniform are really getting access to the very best body armor on the market today. 
   I don't care who makes it. I don't care where it comes from. I would prefer for it to come from America. I believe that is important. But if our Nation is going to continue to send $12 million an hour, $12 million an hour of your tax money to Iraq, I believe it is time to tell the Pentagon and this administration and the Iraqis that it is time for them to be accountable for how this money is being spent. And part of that is ensuring that our brave and dedicated men and women in uniform and, yes, my brother-in-law is in his 18th year in the Air Force, and I am very proud of him. My first cousin is in the Army and getting ready to go back to Iraq for a second time. 
   We all have been affected by this war. We all know someone who has been to Iraq. Unfortunately, too many of us know people who have been injured or have died; and I question this government on how many of those deaths and life-changing injuries could have been avoidable had we ensured that our men and women in uniform were properly equipped. 
   So this hearing tomorrow is going to be about body armor. And, again, I don't care who makes it. I don't care where it comes from. I want it to come from America. But just because our men and women were receiving the very best body armor when the war began in 2003 does not necessarily mean that in 2007 that that is still the very best body armor on the market. 
   And John Grant, I want to thank John Grant from Pearcy, Arkansas, in Garland County, the father of a soldier in the 39th Brigade of the Arkansas National Guard. His son has been to Iraq once. You know the deal with the Guard. You are supposed to go once every 5 years, but the President did that waiver thing, and now they are headed back again.     
   They haven't even been home 3 years. It is my understanding that by Christmas, or shortly thereafter, they will be back for a second tour of duty. These are not full-time military, these are members of the Arkansas National Guard, 39th. John Grant wants to ensure that his son and all soldiers, not just the 39th, but all soldiers in Iraq are receiving the very best body armor possible. 
   This hearing tomorrow before the Armed Services Committee tomorrow will be very important. I am committed, as are some 42 Members of Congress that signed a letter with me to the Pentagon, in ensuring that our brave men and women in uniform are provided the very best in equipment and the very best in body armor so that we can ensure their safe return. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Well, I thank the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly) for his insight and for his work on the Veterans Committee, among others. We appreciate what he's doing there to try to help our veterans and our men and women in uniform. 
   These are examples of why it is important that we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. As long as we've got record debt after record debt and record deficit after record deficit that the Republicans have given us, and we can't turn this thing around overnight, but we've got a budget that's going to put us back in balance by 2012, perhaps sooner. That is important if we are going to meet America's priorities, improving our infrastructure, improving and making health care more affordable and more accessible, funding education at the level it deserves to ensure our children receive a world-class education, keeping our homeland safe, making homeland security a lot more than just a buzz word. Let's put our money where our mouth is and ensure that every American citizen in this country is safe from terrorists. And of course, making sure that our veterans have the health care and have the things they need and were promised for their service to our country. 
   A lot of talk about Iraq. If you ask a hundred different people what they think about this Iraq policy, you get about a hundred different answers. I can tell you one of the things that the Blue Dog Coalition is united on is demanding accountability for how your tax money, Mr. Speaker, is being spent in Iraq. Now, for the last 4 years, if you had questioned the funding in Iraq, the President would tell you you're unpatriotic. Well, members of the Blue Dog Coalition are now standing up and saying enough is enough, and we demand accountability for how your tax money, Mr. Speaker, is being spent in Iraq. 
   What are the Iraqis doing with your tax money, some $12 million an hour? Is enough of it going to protect our men and women in uniform? Is enough of it going to provide them the most advanced body armor on the market today? Well, we all know that waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars has happened in the Iraq war. In fact, over the past several years, media and government reports have detailed examples of the abuse of taxpayer dollars in the government's funding of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As recently as April of this year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has released reports detailing examples of how long-standing problems with the management of government contracts, yes, government contracts, continue to provide opportunities for fraud, waste and abuse in the funding of the war in Iraq. Specifically, the GAO identifies the following major factors contributing to the mismanagement of contracts and ultimate waste of taxpayer dollars. 
   Number one, military commanders and senior officials at the Department of Defense do not have visibility over 
   contractors, which prevents the Department of Defense from knowing the extent to which it is relying on contractors for support in Iraq. Also, the Department of Defense lacks clear guidance and leadership for managing and overseeing contractors. The Department of Defense personnel lack the most basic ability to make sure that government contractors even provide the services they are being paid to provide. The report finds that the Department of Defense's limited visibility has unnecessarily increased contracting costs to the Federal Government and introduced unnecessary risk. 
   For example, one Army official estimates that about $43 million, $43 million is lost each year on free meals provided to contractors' employees at deployed locations who also receive a per diem, food allowance. Additionally, the GAO found that the Department of Defense and its contractors all too often do not have a clear understanding of reconstruction objectives and how they translate into the terms and conditions of a contract. As a result, at least $1.8 billion of taxpayer money has been obligated on contracts without Department of Defense and the contractors reaching an agreement on the final scope and cost of the work. 
   The report gives one particularly shocking example of this, where the government allocated $84 million for an oil mission and never agreed upon the final terms of the task order until more than a year after the contractor completed the work. The GAO estimates that the United States has obligated about $14 billion to restore essential services such as oil, electricity and water, and more than $15 billion to train, equip and sustain Iraqi Security Forces. However, the Iraqi government continues to be fraught with corruption, operating ineffectively and inadequately resourced accountability institutions. 
   U.S. officials estimate that a shocking 20 to 30 percent of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior personnel are ``ghost employees,'' nonexistent staff paid salaries with your tax money, Mr. Speaker, that are collected by other corrupt officials in Iraq. 
   The GAO also highlights in its report the weaknesses in the $15.4 billion program to support the development of Iraqi security forces. Consequently, poor security conditions have hindered the management of the more than $29 billion that has been obligated for reconstruction and stabilization efforts since 2003. Additional government and media reports have exposed equally as outrageous examples of waste, fraud and abuse in the funding of the war in Iraq. Is this $12 million an hour we are sending to the Iraqis being used to protect and equip our brave men and women in uniform? 
   One such report details an instance where U.S. administrators could not account for $20.5 million in development funds for Iraq grants. Another government report exposed a situation where $7.3 million was mismanaged, and $1.3 million entirely wasted during construction of a police academy in Iraq. The Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction just recently released its quarterly report to Congress. As in previous reports, this most recent one again describes continued abuses in the government's funding of the war in Iraq. And we are going to go into more of this in just a little bit. We are going to provide specific examples of what was contained in that report. 
   But at this time I want to yield to my fellow Blue Dog, a new Member of Congress from Pennsylvania, a veteran of the Iraq war, a captain that served in Iraq, and that is the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy).

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murphy, an Iraq war veteran, for his insight and leadership within the Blue Dogs and within this Congress on restoring accountability, on how our tax money is being spent in Iraq, and ensuring that it is being spent to protect our men and women in uniform. 
   The gentleman raised an interesting point. We are in year five of this thing now, and a recent survey indicated that 71 percent of the Iraqi people don't want us there. In fact, 60 percent of them think it is okay to kill a U.S. soldier. You contrast that with Afghanistan, where 80 percent of them are glad we are there. The last time I checked, Osama bin Laden was spotted closer to Afghanistan than he was to Iraq. 
   So, while we continue, and I think this is just me personally, I think we have got to demand more from the Iraqi government to train Iraqis to be on the front lines, providing the police and military force for them in this civil war. 
   This line that it is better to fight the terrorists there than here, I don't buy that. If there are some 10 to 14 to 20 million illegal immigrants in this country, do you think we only allowed illegal immigrants into this country? Terrorists are already here in America, and that is why we need to do more to protect our homeland by properly funding the Department of Homeland Security. That is why we need to demand more of the Iraqis and to do more in Afghanistan, that is becoming more and more neglected every day. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Donnelly.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana, a fellow Blue Dog Member, Mr. Donnelly, for his insight, and invite him to continue to stay with us for the remaining 15 minutes or so we have got here this Tuesday evening on the House floor to talk about accountability, on how your tax money, some $12 million an hour of your tax money being spent to Iraq is being spent. 
   You can see the cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Starting in 2001-2002, $2.5 billion; $51 billion in 2003; $77.3 billion in 2004; $87.3 billion in 2005; $100.4 billion in 2006; and $60 billion in 2007. That was before the supplemental that we passed about a week ago which was about $100 billion. So we are actually up to about $160 billion for 2007, which brings this number not to nearly $400 billion, but to now nearly $500 billion, nearly half a trillion dollars. 
   Now, I promised to show a few of the examples of the waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars that was detailed in the report from Iraq. 
   Number one, of 150 primary healthcare centers that were originally planned to be built, only 15 have been completed. Of those 15, only eight are currently open to the public. In addition, eight primary healthcare centers have stopped work altogether. 
   Number two: The U.S. Agency for International Development Office of Transition Initiatives was supported by $350 million to focus on democracy building, human rights, civic programs and investigations of crimes against humanity. However, USAID could not determine whether the intended outputs of the 4,789 grants under this contract were even accomplished because of ``insufficient documentation.'' 
   Number three: The report also found water damage in one healthcare facility that caused bathroom floor tiles to break and ceilings in lower floors to leak and collapse, increasing the health risk to patients. 
   Number four: A shortage of sinks and toilets combined with workmanship deficiencies, inferior materials and insufficient maintenance, caused significant deterioration to the barracks at one military base, a facility which cost our government $119.5 million. 
   The report also details construction and equipment installation at the Iraq Civil Defense Headquarters that did not comply with the international standards required by the contract and task order. This particular project cost the Federal Government, our government, our tax money, Mr. Speaker, some $3 million. We will come back to this in a little bit. 
   Number six: At the Baghdad International Airport, an enhancement project costing the Federal Government $11.8 million required the installation of 17 new generator sets. However, when the airport was recently inspected, 10 of the 17 generator sets were not even operational. 
   And the list goes on and on. We will come back to it. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield back to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy).

   Mr. ROSS. I thank Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania for joining us this evening and for helping write House Resolution 97, providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability. We are not just talking about this. We are trying to do something about it. 
   In fact, some of these key provisions were included in the defense authorization bill, and we want to thank Chairman Skelton and members of Armed Services for doing that. 
   It does four things. It calls for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent. It calls for the creation of a Truman-like commission to investigate the awarding of contracts. It provides a need to fund the Iraq war through the normal appropriations process and not through the so-called emergency ``let's hide the real cost of the war'' supplementals. And, finally, it encourages the use of American resources to improve Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations. In other words, put Iraqis on the front line and get our soldiers off the front line and provide our soldiers to train their soldiers so they can fight their own civil war. 
   I yield to Mr. Donnelly.

   Mr. Speaker, if you have any comments, questions or concerns, you can e-mail us at BlueDog@mail.house.gov. That is BlueDog@mail.house.gov. 
   I am talking about House Resolution 97, providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability. We are not just talking about a problem. We are trying to fix the problem. There are only 43 of us in the Blue Dogs, a group of conservative Democrats, and yet we already have 63 cosponsors on this bill. 
   House Resolution 97 also calls for the Iraqi government and its people to progress towards full responsibility for internally policing their own country. 
   Recently, members of the Blue Dog Coalition worked together with House Armed Services Committee Chairman, IKE SKELTON, to include key provisions of House Resolution 97 in the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization bill. With the passage of this bill, we took the first step towards ensuring complete fiscal transparency in the funding of the war in Iraq. 
   The American people deserve to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely and that our troops have the resources they need to succeed. The Blue Dogs are committed to passing legislation that accomplishes this goal. 
   Members of the Blue Dog Coalition also believe strongly that funding requests for the Iraq war should come through the normal appropriations process, as I mentioned earlier. Since 2003, the Republican-held Congress has been funding the war through emergency supplemental requests, two of them in 2003, another one in 2004 and 2005 and 2006 and 2007. It is time we stop hiding the cost of this war. We demand fiscal accountability in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OUACHITA NATIONAL FOREST ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 390, a resolution honoring and recognizing the importance of Ouachita National Forest on its 100th anniversary. I am very fortunate to represent a good part of the Ouachita National Forest within the Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas. 
   I'm also pleased that the entire Arkansas Congressional Delegation, Congressmen John Boozman, Vic Snyder and Marion Berry have joined me in supporting and cosponsoring this bipartisan bill honoring one of our Nation's true national treasures. 
   This marks the 100th birthday or anniversary, if you will, of one the largest and oldest national forests in the  southern region of the United States, the Ouachita National Forest. 
   As Chairwoman CHRISTENSEN indicated, in 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt created the Arkansas National Forest on reserved public lands south of the Arkansas River. And by 1926 President Calvin Coolidge issued an Executive order to change the name of the forest to the Ouachita National Forest, named after the Ouachita Mountains, which stretch from near the center of Arkansas to southeast Oklahoma, and after the principal river which drains the national forest, the Ouachita River. 
   For the past 100 years, the Ouachita National Forest has remained a vast, magnificent region that offers spectacular recreation, scenic and wilderness areas for numerous visitors from throughout the world. The forest provides an array of activities, ranging from ATV recreational activities and opportunities, to hiking and to mountain biking to horseback riding trails and swimming. The forest also contains five lakes, often referred to as ``Diamond Lakes,'' which are known for their crystal clear quality and beautiful scenery. 
   In addition to the scenic views and outdoor activities the forest has to offer, the Ouachita National Forest is also one of the only places in the United States that contains an incredible crater area which allows visitors and rock collectors to dig for real diamonds and quartz crystals. 
   Today the Ouachita National Forest also includes more than 1.8 million acres in Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, and provides timber and forestry products throughout the United States. 
   And while the word ``Ouachita'' is the French spelling of the Native American word for ``good hunting ground,'' the forest also contains six locations that have been designated as wilderness areas covering 65,000 acres. These areas provide environmentally safe habitats for wildlife and fish, including many threatened and endangered species, as well as watershed protection and improvement and wilderness area management. 
   This resolution honors and recognizes all the important services and contributions that the Ouachita National Forest continues to make available to visitors all across our country and throughout the world who come here to visit and to the spirit and practice of ensuring that our natural resources remain sources of pride for our citizens, our communities and, yes, our Nation. 
   I'm proud to sponsor a resolution commemorating its 100th anniversary, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of House Resolution 390 today and honor Ouachita National Forest's centennial celebration.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, September 11, 2001, was a day I will never forget. From my office window I saw the smoke rise from the Pentagon shortly before my staff, several constituents and I were evacuated. A few hours later, I would learn that a young naval petty officer from my district named Nahamon Lyons was among the casualties in that attack on the Pentagon. Picking up the phone and calling his mom, Mrs. Jewel Lyons, back in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was one of the most difficult calls I have ever had to make.     
   There was no one who wants to put an end to terrorism more than I do. That is why I supported our President when he chose to send U.S. military forces to Afghanistan to go after those who attacked our Nation on 9/11. 
   I met with the President at his invitation in the White House on September 26, 2002, to hear his case for a preemptive strike in Iraq. I kept my notes from that important meeting, and this is what the President told us. He said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; he said that Saddam Hussein trains terrorists on weapons of mass destruction; and he said that if military force is used it will be fierce, swift and tough. We now know that none of that information was accurate. 
   I do not know whether the President intentionally misled our Nation or received bad intelligence. Perhaps we will never know, but regardless, both possibilities trouble me. 
   Had I known that the information the President shared with me on September 26, 2002, was not accurate, I would have never given him the authority to use force in Iraq. At worst, the President misled us, and at best, our intelligence failed us. 
   There is not a more difficult decision Members of Congress must make than whether to send our brave men and women in uniform into harm's way. And when we are asked to make those decisions, we must know that our intelligence is correct. 
   We have all been personally touched by this war. I have a brother-in-law in the United States Air Force who is currently serving in the Middle East. My first cousin was in Iraq when his wife gave birth to their first child. 
   I have also traveled to Walter Reed Medical Center and met with countless soldiers who have suffered life-altering injuries in combat, many from my home State of Arkansas. The most recent was a U.S. Marine, Staff Sergeant Marcus Wilson of Dermott, Arkansas, who recently lost his leg in Iraq. 
   And I have visited with too many families of soldiers who are not coming home. 
   On August 11, 2004, I visited Iraq when the 39th Infantry Brigade of Arkansas had over 3,000 soldiers stationed there, and if the President gets his way with this escalation of the war, they will be back in Iraq by early next year. 
   Let me be clear on one very important point. I strongly believe that as long as we have troops in harm's way we must support them. I also want to see to it that our government keeps its promises to our military veterans. 
   When we invaded Iraq, the President said we were doing so with the intent of removing the evil regime of Saddam Hussein from power and to find and eliminate his weapons of mass destruction. We have since learned that there were no weapons of mass destruction, and not only has Saddam's evil regime come to an end, but he has now been put to death. 
   So I ask, why are we still there? We now find ourselves spending nearly $9 billion a month to try and force our way of life on a people who live a long way from Arkansas. 
   Had I known then what I know now, I would never have voted to give the President authority to use force in Iraq and, instead, would have directed the full strength of our military to Afghanistan to go after Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, those who actually attacked our Nation on 9/11. 
   It is my duty as a U.S. Congressman to demand accountability from this administration, accountability for the decisions that are being made in Iraq, accountability for how these decisions are carried out, and accountability for how our hardworking taxpayers money is being spent. 
   Sending 21,000 new troops into Iraq is not a new direction. It is simply an escalation of the war. 
   I am not advocating that we leave Iraq tonight, but we must begin to accelerate the training of the Iraqi Army and police force and replace American soldiers on the front lines of this war with Iraqis. 
   I rise this evening in support of this resolution to stop the escalation of this war. We can no longer tolerate more of the same, and we must demand from this President, our Commander in Chief, a new strategy and a new direction in Iraq.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, on February 24, a tornado hit Dumas in Desha County, Arkansas. The Governor called out the National Guard for nearly a week. For 6 days, there was no electricity to this delta county. 650 people remain out of work because their workplace has been severely damaged or destroyed, and 150 homes were either heavily damaged or destroyed. And here we are more than a week later still waiting for the President and the Director of FEMA to declare this forgotten delta county a Federal Disaster Area. In fact, the FEMA spokesman, John Philbin, in the Arkansas News Bureau, Stevens Media, is quoted today in an Aaron Sadler story as saying ``The damages or need for Federal assistance are not readily apparent.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the people at FEMA certainly did not visit the same Dumas and Desha County that I did. The people of Dumas and Desha County need the help of the Federal Government, and I implore the President and the Director of FEMA to assist this forgotten delta county.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for leading this hour-long Special Order, this discussion on the debt, the deficit, but more importantly on accountability, in restoring common sense, accountability, fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   Madam Speaker, I don't have to tell you that we have got the largest debt ever in our Nation's history; $8,835,629,777,913 and increasing some $40 million every hour. Our Nation is spending a half a billion dollars a day simply paying interest on a debt we've already got, and that is before we increase it by $1 billion a day. Half a billion dollars a day going to pay interest on the national debt. That is a half a billion dollars a day we do not have to properly equip our troops, to support our troops, to support our veterans, those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, to educate our children, to build roads. The list of what should be America's priorities is endless, and yet our Nation is spending half a billion dollars a day simply paying interest on a debt we've already got. 
   It is time to restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our government, and one of the ways we do that is by requiring accountability in Iraq. That is why the Blue Dogs have written what has become known as H.R. 47, providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability. 
   Let me just say this, that 9/11, September 11, 2001, is a day that I will never forget. From my office window in the Cannon House Office Building I could see the smoke rise from the Pentagon. A few hours later, after being evacuated, I would learn that a young Navy petty officer, Nehamon Lyons, IV, from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was among those killed at the Pentagon on that dreadful day. 
   In the months that followed, I voted to give the President the authority to go to Afghanistan to hunt down Osama bin Laden. Remember him? To bring him to justice and to put an end to the Taliban, to put an end to terrorism. And then on September 26, 2002, I was called to the White House. I sat in the Cabinet Room, took notes, I still have  them, where the President and Andy Card and Condoleezza Rice and about 20 Members of Congress present proceeded to tell us that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that Saddam Hussein trains terrorists on weapons of mass destruction, and that if military force is used, in the President's word, it will be, quoting now, ``swift.'' September 26, 2002. 
   Fast forward to March 13, 2007. More than 3,000 brave men and women in uniform have died, have sacrificed with their lives in Iraq. Thousands more injured in ways that will forever change their lives. As long as we have men and women in uniform in harm's way, I am going to support them; members of the Blue Dog Coalition are going to support them. 
   This war has affected all of us. My brother-in-law is presently stationed in the United States Air Force in the Middle East. My first cousin was in Iraq when his wife gave birth to their first child. People that I grew up with and taught in Sunday school and duck hunt with have already served one tour through the Arkansas National Guard duty in Iraq and will likely be returning next year if the President gets his way with this so-called surge. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that the American people spoke on November 7, and they told us they do not want more of the same. And simply adding 20,000 more troops to Iraq is, in my opinion, more of the same. The American people want a new direction in Iraq, not more of the same. In line with that, the American people want accountability for how their tax money is spent, not only in Iraq, but also here at home. And that is what we are trying to do with House Resolution 97. 
   Government investigations and media reports have detailed waste, fraud, and possible war profiteering by some of the very contractors that are being paid billions of dollars by the United States for their services in Iraq. Most recently, a report issued January 30 by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction counts unsanitary conditions, potential health hazards, poor construction methods, and significant cost overruns among the examples of waste, fraud and abuse rampant in the government's funding of the Iraq war. 
   House Resolution 97, which has been written and endorsed by the 43-member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, puts forth tangible commonsense proposals that ensure future transparency and accountability in the funding of Operation Iraqi Freedom. House Resolution 97 is an important first step toward making sure that more resources get to our troops in the field. 
   House Resolution 97 focuses on four crucial points for demanding fiscal responsibility in Iraq: a call for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent; the creation of a Truman Commission to investigate the awarding of contracts; a need to fund the Iraq war through the normal appropriations process and not through these so-called emergency supplementals; and, finally, using America's resources to approve Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations. 
   Funding requests for the Iraq war should come through the normal appropriations process so that Congress and the people have a clear understanding about what is being spent on the war in Iraq. With House Resolution 97, the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition is calling for the Iraqi Government and its people to progress toward full responsibility for internally policing their country. Without such progress, it is wasteful to continue our investment in the lives, limbs, and taxpayer dollars in Iraq. 
   We must honor those who have sacrificed in Iraq, our brave men and women in uniform, and the thousands more that have come home injured in ways that will forever change their lives. It is very important that we honor them, we support them and their sacrifices through demanding accountability from the Iraqi people. It is time to tell the Iraqi people it is time to step up and accept more responsibility for your own country. If you are going to continue to shoot at one another and to shoot at us, if public opinion poll after public opinion poll coming out of Iraq says that 70 percent of them don't want us there and 60 percent of them think it is okay to kill a U.S. soldier there, then we should send a clear message to the Iraqi people that it is time for them to step up and assume responsibility. If they want us to continue to sacrifice our brave men and women in uniform and return many more thousands home injured, if they want us to continue to spend $12 million an hour of our tax money in Iraq, some $2.5 billion a week, then it is time for the Iraqi people to accept more responsibility and more accountability for their actions. 
   At the same time, Madam Speaker, it is very important that this administration understand that if we are going to support $12 million an hour, $2.5 billion a week of hard-earned taxpayer money going to Iraq, we want to know how it is being spent, we want it accounted for, and we want to know without a shadow of a doubt that it is going to support our brave men and women in uniform. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mr. ROSS. Let me just say there are those in this Congress that do not support sending $12 million an hour to  Iraq, then you are unpatriotic. I differ with that. I strongly differ with it. No one needs to question my patriotism, no one needs to question my support for our men and women in uniform. 
   If you ask me, giving them more of the same is not showing support for our men and women in uniform. They need a new direction. They need a new direction in Iraq, one that will allow them to do their job and come back home to their families. The President proposing a surge of some 21,000 troops is not a new direction, it is more of the same. 
   At the same time, Madam Speaker, let me tell you that the other thing that the American people want is they want responsibility. They want responsibility by the Iraqi government. They want them to buy into this. 
   The other thing the American people want is accountability within our own government, which is clearly why we are advocating the passage of the Iraqi War Accountability Act, H.R. 97. Why is it needed? Because auditors in one region found that contract managers could not account for $97 million disbursed from the development fund for Iraq. Under its no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure contract, Halliburton overcharged by over 600 percent for the delivery of fuel from Kuwait. 
   An audit of programs designed to train guards designed to protect Iraq's oil and electrical infrastructure concluded that U.S. agencies could not provide reasonable assurance that $147 million expended under these programs was used for its intended purpose. 
   In one case, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that a company which was awarded a security management contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars could provide no assurance that it was providing the best possible safety for government and reconstruction personnel as required by the contract, and could not even show that its employees authorized to carry weapons were trained to use those weapons. 
   Finally, Halliburton tripled the cost of hand towels at taxpayer expense by insisting on having its own embroidered logo on each towel. You can't make this stuff up. Halliburton employees dumped 50,000 pounds of nails in the desert because they ordered the wrong size all at taxpayers' expense. This is not supporting our troops. 
   We want to fund our troops. We want to support our troops, and the way to do that is by requiring more accountability by this administration and the Pentagon. Quite frankly, for the last 6 years, Congress has not fulfilled its constitutionally given duty of providing oversight. It has been a rubber stamp for whatever this administration wants. 
   Those days are over, the new Congress has arrived, and we are going to begin to provide that oversight and accountability and demand responsibility, not only from this administration, but from the Iraqis through the passage of H.R. 97.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, as most Tuesday evenings, I rise on behalf of the 47-member-strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. 
   As I sat here, Mr. Speaker, thinking about what I wanted to discuss in this next hour with some of my Blue Dog colleagues, I couldn't help but listen to some of the rhetoric that we've heard over the past hour. You know, for 6 years, for 6 years the Republicans controlled the White House, the House and the Senate. And what did they give us? They gave us tax cut after tax cut for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   And this new Democratic majority, what has the Democrats given you? We are giving you health care for children of working parents. Let me repeat that. This is health care for the children of working parents. This is not for children whose parents are on welfare. They're already covered under a program known as Medicaid, which is health insurance for the poor, the disabled and the elderly. 
   Some 10 million children in America will go to bed tonight without health insurance, without the ability to go to the doctor when they get sick. And who are they? They're the children of parents who are trying to do the right thing and stay off welfare, but they're working the jobs with no benefits. 
   While the Republicans were hiding earmarks, the Democrats in this new majority have been passing legislation that says if you're a Member of Congress and if you break the law, you lose your pension, period. And while the Republicans have been on an agenda that benefits those earning over $400,000 a year, the Democrats in this new majority have raised the Federal minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. 
   If we're serious about moving people from welfare to work, we've got to pay them more than $10,712 a year, which is what the previous minimum wage represented if you worked 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, never get sick, and never take a single day off for vacation. 
   Now, they said that the Democrats are wanting to provide health insurance for children of working parents. We plead guilty to that, and after all, if the working families have been benefiting from some of these tax cuts that primarily benefited those earning over $400,000 a year for the past 6 years, our working families might not need the help, but they do because under the past 6 years of a Republican White House, House and Senate, quite frankly, they haven't got it. 
   It's time, Mr. Speaker, to tone down the political rhetoric and look at the facts, and as a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, I can tell you what we're all about. We're about fiscal discipline and accountability. We're about putting an end to the partisan bickering. We don't care if it's a Democrat or Republican idea. We ask ourselves, is it a commonsense idea and does it make sense for the people that send us here to be their voice? 
   Today, the U.S. national debt is $9,063,547,746,613. If you divide that enormous number by every man, woman and child in America, including the children being born today, every one of us, our share of the national debt, $29,888. That's what those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition refer to as the debt tax, D-E-B-T, which is one tax that cannot be cut, cannot go away until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Tonight, we're going to be talking about the debt, the deficit, and as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, we're going to be talking about ways to put an end to this reckless spending. 
   If you ask 100 people on the street what they think about this Iraq war policy, you will get about 100 different answers, but one of the things that unites us as Blue Dogs is we believe that the money that this administration asks for for Iraq should be accounted for. We believe that if this President is going to continue to spend, and this is year 5, if this President is going to continue to spend $16 million an hour, $16 million every 60 minutes going to Iraq, and if this President's going to continue down that path, then we believe we're not here tonight to debate the merits of $16 million an hour going to Iraq, but we're here tonight to hold this administration accountable for how that money is being spent and to ensure that it's being spent not on projects for Iraq but providing the protection and the state-of-the-art equipment that our brave and honorable men and women in uniform not only need but deserve. 
   This war has affected all of us. My first cousin was in Iraq when his wife gave birth to their first child. He's now back for a second time, and he will be there when she gives birth to their third child. My family's not any different from many families across America. 
   Many families have made the sacrifice, some of them the ultimate sacrifice, in support of their loved ones who have gone and simply done what they've been asked to do. And Mr. Speaker, if we're going to send our men and women in uniform to Iraq, we need to make sure some of this money is being spent on them, and we need to make sure that we're taking care of them. 
   At this time, one of the things that the Blue Dog Coalition has done is  we've written legislation known as H. Res. 97 that was drafted by members of the Blue Dog Coalition to ensure accountability for how the money is being spent in Iraq. At this time, I would call on one of the cochairs, the cochair for policy for the Blue Dog Coalition, and that is my dear friend, the cochair for policy for the fiscally conservative Blue Dogs, and this is Dennis Moore of Kansas who's going to talk more to us this evening about H. Res. 97, which simply is called, Providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability, and I thank Congressman Moore for being a part of this Special Order this evening.

   Mr. ROSS. The gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) is the cochair of policy of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. 
   As you can see, the 2007 Iraqi war funding, the total cost, $135.2 billion; the cost per month, $11.3 billion; the cost per day, $370 million. That's about $16 million an hour. I helped dedicate and break ground on interstate I-530, which someday will connect I-30 and I-40 in Little Rock through Pine Bluff to I-69 in southeast Arkansas, which could create a economic revival in one of the poorest regions of the country, the delta region. 
   In my speech in Pine Bluff yesterday I couldn't help but point out in the last transportation reauthorization bill there was about $6 billion for new interstate construction for all of America for the next 5 years. That's about the amount we will spend in Iraq in the next 2 weeks. 
   Don't get me wrong, let me make it very clear, as long as we have troops in harm's way, I am going to support them and make sure we support them as a Nation in providing them the very best that money can buy and the technology and the equipment they need to do their job as safely as possible and return home to their families. We have to ask ourselves at some point, $16 million an hour going to Iraq means $16 million an hour we don't have to invest in our communities in America, that we don't have to invest in education and homeland security and veterans benefits, and the list is endless. 
   At some point, at some point we have to demand a new direction in Iraq and begin to invest in America again. 
   At this time, I would recognize our administrative cochair of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, and that's my good friend, ALLEN BOYD from Florida.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Boyd), the administrative cochair of the Blue Dogs for his insight and examples of waste, fraud and abuse that's going on with your tax money over in Iraq. 
   If you have got any comments or concerns or questions of us, you can e-mail us at bluedog@mail.house.gov. That is bluedog@mail.house.gov. 
   Again, this is an hour where most Tuesday evenings we come and lead a discussion about accountability and fiscal discipline in our government by the Blue Dog Coalition. 
   If you are wondering how in the world did we get our name, Blue Dog Coalition, a lot of folks, especially in the South, have heard of a Yellow Dog Democrat, meaning you would vote for a Democrat even if it was a yellow dog as long as it was running as a Democrat. Somewhere along the way we were Yellow Dog Democrats that felt we were being choked blue by the extremes of both parties. Thus the name the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative, commonsense Democrats that are trying to restore fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. 
   At this time I am pleased to turn this thing over to a former policy cochair of the Blue Dogs, the gentleman from Tennessee, JIM COOPER.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank my colleague and former policy cochair for the Blue Dogs from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper, for his insight on not only Iraq war spending but these other fiscal responsibilities, trying to restore fiscal responsibility to our government and those issues surrounding that. 
   You mentioned Medicare. Medicare is health 
   insurance for, basically, it's the only form of health insurance most seniors have to either stay healthy or get well, not to be confused with Medicaid, which is health insurance for the poor, the disabled, and the elderly. 
   Your bill, as you discuss the entitlement programs and find ways to put an end to these deficits, I applaud you for trying to do this in a bipartisan manner and having support on both sides of the aisle. 
   Do you have any other examples you'd like to share with us on this legislation?

   Mr. ROSS. It was a fascinating discussion, and you raise a good point, and that is that it wasn't too long ago that Members of Congress were coming to this floor to debate how to spend a budget surplus, how to invest a budget surplus. You know, it was under President Clinton. I'm proud to say it was a fellow Arkansan from my home town of Hope, Arkansas, where I grew up and graduated high school, who gave us the first balanced budget of any Democrat or Republican President for the first time in what, 40 years?

   Mr. ROSS. And he did that. There were several contributing factors that allowed him to be able to lead us in that direction, one of which was having what's called PAYGO rules on the floor of this very House, something the Republican leadership threw out the door with this new Republican President back in 2001. And what PAYGO rules mean is it means pay as you go. PAYGO is an acronym for pay as you go, which means exactly what it sounds like it means. If you've got an idea for a new program that's going to cost money, you've got to show how you're going to pay for it. No more of just borrowing money from China. If you want to cut taxes for folks earning over $400,000 a year, you've got to show how you're going to pay for it. No more borrowing money from China. 
   And I'm proud to tell you that in this new Democratic Congress, there's a lot of discussion about the first 100 legislative hours where we raised the Federal minimum wage and where we implemented the 9/11 Commission recommendations, where we said Members of Congress who break the law will no longer receive a pension, where we passed earmark reform, where we have passed SCHIP to ensure that the children of working parents receive health care. We've done a lot in this session of Congress. Unfortunately, a lot of it is sitting over on the Senate's doorsteps waiting for Senate action, which is somewhat disappointing for a lot of us that come here every week and work hard to pass these policy initiatives that are good for working families, good for children and good for seniors. 
   But not in the first legislative 100 hours, not in the first 9 months of this new 110th Congress under a Democratic majority, but in the first hour on this very floor of the United States House of Representatives, this new Democratic Congress reinstituted a House rule known as PAYGO. 
   You want to expand on that?

   Mr. ROSS. That is a national security issue, in my opinion, Mr. Cooper. What if those countries decide to call those loans? What does that mean? The ``dream team,'' Mr. Rubin and the others told us today what it meant, and I think you asked the question. And it means higher interest rates. They will have to raise interest rates in this country to where it's attractive for other countries to buy our paper, to buy our money. That is, I think, directly a threat to our national security. 
   And to put it in perspective, the total national debt from 1789 through 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion under this Republican President's administration and under his budgets that he sends to Congress. This is a doubling, a doubling, of the 211-year debt in just 10 years. Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest-growing parts of the Federal budget, and the debt tax is one that cannot be repealed. For every man, woman, and child in this country, you take the national debt and divide by the number of people. It is about $29,000 per person. And that is one tax that cannot be cut until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Our Nation, under this Republican President's budget, is borrowing about a billion dollars a day. But before we borrow another billion dollars a day, we are spending about a half billion paying interest on the debt we have already got. 
   This puts it in perspective. Interest payments on debt dwarf other priorities, the 2008 budget authority in the billions of dollars. The red box is the amount of money, your tax money, Mr. Speaker, that is going to pay interest on the national debt, to repay the loans to places like Japan and China and the United Kingdom and OPEC and Korea and Taiwan and the Caribbean Banking Centers and Hong Kong and Germany and Mexico. 
   We talk a lot about education. We talk about how we want our children to receive a world-class education. But the turquoise box, this box, Mr. Speaker, reflects how much of your tax money is going to educate our children compared with the amount going in the red to pay interest on the national debt. 
   We say we want to keep our promises to our veterans. We say we want to provide our veterans with world-class  health care and housing and education when they return home. But in the green box, Mr. Speaker, you will see the amount of money we're spending on our veterans compared to the red box, the amount of money being spent on interest on the national debt. 
   And, finally, the purple box, homeland security. Now, I came here in 2001. The first 9 months of 2001, I don't think I ever heard the word ``homeland security'' mentioned once. But that is now a household name, a household phrase, a household word. Homeland security. It make us feel good. We go through the metal detectors at the airport and we feel safer. We take our shoes off and I always take my pen out of my pocket, and we feel safer. And what most of us don't know is about half the belly of a plane is not your suitcase that you saw X-rayed. It's freight, freight that continues to go unchecked. About one out of every 100 containers that enter our ports, five out of every 100 containers, maybe 10 out of every 100 containers that enter our ports are checked. 
   And what about the food we put in our body? Mr. Speaker, for all the seafood and fruits and vegetables that come into this country from other countries by way of port, do you know how many FDA inspectors there are at those ports? Not per port. But for all the ports in America. For all the seafood, fruits, and vegetables coming into America from all over the world, there are about 70 FDA inspectors. Not per port, not per shift, not counting the ones that aren't sick or on vacation. There are 70 total. Homeland security, the purple box, this is how much we are really investing in protecting our homeland. And that is why a recent nonpartisan assessment indicated that we are less safe today in America than we were on September 11, 2001. 
   These priorities, education, veterans, homeland security, will continue to go unmet until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Deficits matter. They reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who, as Mr. Cooper pointed out, now own 40 percent of our debt. That's right. Our Nation, the U.S., is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders. Foreign lenders currently hold a total of $2.199 trillion of our public debt. Compare that to only $623.3 billion in foreign holdings in 1993. It's kind of like David Letterman and his top 10 list. The top 10 countries, this Republican administration, this Republican Congress for the past 6 years time after time after time has borrowed money from foreigners to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   And whom have we borrowed the money from? Japan, $637.4 billion; China, $346.5 billion; United Kingdom, $223.5 billion; OPEC, $97.1 billion; Korea, $67.7 billion; Taiwan, $63.2 billion; Caribbean Banking Centers, $63.6 billion; Hong Kong, $51 billion; Germany, $52.1 billion. 
   And rounding out my version of David Letterman's top 10 list, the 10th country that we have borrowed the most money from, number 10 on the list, all this debate these days about immigration policies, and I think we do need to secure the border and I think that we should have those who want to come here and live among us play by the rules, respect our laws, learn English, respect our flag. I believe those things. No amnesty, as Mr. Reagan gave us during his years in office. We learned that doesn't work. But rounding out the top 10, while everybody is focused on immigration: Mexico. The United States of America has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. Those are the facts. 
   I am pleased to be joined by a fellow Blue Dog from the State of North Carolina, Mr. Mike McIntyre. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening you've heard from Blue Dog members from Kansas, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina, Iowa and Arkansas. And we're a group of 47 fiscally conservative Democrats that are simply trying to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's Government as we try to offer up commonsense, practical ways to put an end to this reckless spending and hold this government accountable for how your tax money is being spent.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (ECONOMIC OBSERVATIONS BY THE 43 MEMBER STRONG, FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATIC BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, as most Tuesday evenings, I rise on behalf of the 43 member strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are a group of Democrats that believe in restoring common sense, fiscal discipline and accountability to our Nation's government. 
   As you walk the Halls of Congress, Mr. Speaker, it is easy to know when you are walking by the office of a member of the fiscally conservative, Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, because you will see this poster in the hallway as not only a welcome mat to that Blue Dog member's office, but to remind Members of Congress and the American people on a daily basis that our country is in a fiscal mess. 
   In fact, today, the U.S. national debt is $8,827,851,749,695, and I ran out of room, Mr. Speaker, but you could add a quarter on to that, 25 cents. You divide that enormous number by every man, woman and child in America, and every one of us, our share of the national debt is $29,262. It is what I commonly refer to as the debt tax, D-E-B-T tax, which is one tax that cannot go away until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   The Federal deficit is something we don't have to have, Mr. Speaker. In fact, from 1998 through 2001 our Nation enjoyed a surplus. We had a balanced budget. We lived within our means. That was under President Clinton. He was the first Democrat or Republican to give us a balanced budget in some 30 or 40 years. And the economy was doing pretty good when there was no deficit and when we had a balanced budget. 
   We all remember those days, how the stock market performed. People had good-paying jobs with good benefits. Many of those jobs today have been shifted to places like China and Mexico and India. It is true that most of the folks have gone on and found other work, but if you really research it and look at it, they have found lesser-paying jobs with lesser benefits or, in many cases, no benefits at all. 
   In fact, this is Cover the Uninsured Week, Mr. Speaker. Forty-eight million people in America are without health insurance tonight. Who are they? It is not the people that can't work or don't want to work. They qualify for Medicaid, which is health insurance for the poor, disabled, and elderly. It is not our seniors. They are provided coverage through Medicare, which is the only health insurance plan most seniors have to stay healthy and get well. 
   So who are these 48 million people? It is the folks in this country, working families, Mr. Speaker, that are trying to do the right thing and stay off welfare, but they are working the jobs with no benefits. Ten million of them are children. One in five children will go to bed tonight in America hungry. Ten million will go to bed tonight without health insurance. This is America, and I believe that we have a duty and an obligation to find a way to ensure that health care is affordable, available and accessible for all of God's children and for all of us here in America. 
   As long as we have got this type of debt and this type of deficit, it is going to be difficult to meet that challenge, as well as others. 
   The total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion; but by 2010, under this administration, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. Mr. Speaker, that is a doubling of the 211-year debt in just 10 years. In just one decade. 
   Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we will spend more of your tax money this year paying interest on the national debt than we will spend on educating our children, providing health care and other benefits to our veterans, and, yes, we will spend more money paying interest on the national debt this year than we will spend protecting our homeland through the Department of Homeland Security. 
   So many of America's priorities are going unmet. Why? Because this town and this Congress and this administration for the past 6 years have given us record deficit after record deficit, record debt after record debt, to the extent that today, today our Nation is borrowing about $1 billion a day. But what is even more alarming than that is before we borrow $1 billion today, we will spend half a billion dollars paying interest on the debt we already have.     
   I represent a very rural district in south Arkansas, in the western half of Arkansas. Half of the 29 counties I represent, nearly half of them, are located in what is referred to as the Delta region of this country, one of the poorest regions of America. 
   We have hope in that area by investing in alternative renewable fuels like ethanol by biodiesel, creating new jobs for our working families and new markets for our farm families and our landowners through cellulosic ethanol, taking the slash, the treetops and the limbs, what is left down in the woods and giving it a value and finding a use for that. 
   Another way for us to accomplish those things, our government must invest in research and development for cellulosic ethanol. Our government must invest more in research and development for alternative and renewable fuels. The real tragedy is that we will send the Iraqis more money in the next 8 hours than we will spend on research and development for alternative renewable fuels in the next 365 days. That is one example of why the deficit and the debt do matter. 
   A half a billion dollars a day going to pay interest on the national debt. We could build 200 brand-new elementary schools every single day in America just on the interest that we are paying on the national debt. In southeast Arkansas, we have great hope in Interstate 69, an interstate under construction, sort of. It was announced in Indianapolis 5 years before I was born, that was 50 years ago, and with the exception of 40 miles in Kentucky and a stretch just south of Memphis, none of it has been built south of Indianapolis in 50 years, and yet we have great hope that this road can create jobs and economic opportunities for the people in the Delta region. We need $1.5 billion to finish it. 
   For a country boy from Prescott and Emmet and Hope, Arkansas, I can tell you that is a staggering amount. But when you look at it this way, we will spend more money paying interest on the national debt in the next 3 days than what it would take to build Interstate 69. 
   On the western side of my district, there is great hope for Interstate 49. We need about $2 billion to finish it, again a staggering number until you look at it this way: We will spend more money in the next 4 days paying interest on the national debt than what it would take to complete Interstate 49, which would provide the first and only interstate quarter through the middle of the United States of America. 
   So until this Congress starts standing up to this administration and saying ``no'' to these irresponsible budgets, America's priorities will continue to go unmet. 
   I am proud to tell you that under this new Democratic majority, they are listening to the 43 of us in the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dogs. For the last 6 years, we reached out to the Republicans on the other side of the aisle and asked to work with them on a budget that made sense for the American people. We were told that they didn't need us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are sick and tired of all of the partisan bickering that goes on in our Nation's Capital. For members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we don't care if it is a Republican or Democrat idea, we want to know if it is a commonsense idea, and does it make sense for the people back home who sent us here to be their voice. 
   So the Republican leadership turned a deaf ear to us for the past 6 years while they were in power. The American people decided to give the Democrats a chance at being in the majority this past November. I am proud to tell you that we didn't have to offer up a Blue Dog budget this year. Why? Because the new Democratic majority listened to the Blue Dogs and included our key provisions that can restore commonsense fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. 
   So we are beginning through the budget that passed on the floor of this House just a few weeks ago, we are beginning to develop a path that over  time, in fact by 2012, Mr. Speaker, can get us back to the days we had under President Clinton of a balanced budget in this country. 
   Why do deficits matter? They matter because they reduce economic growth, they burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. Again, the debt tax, D-E-B-T, is $29,262 for every man, woman and child in America, and they increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt. 
   This President, this administration and, for the past 6 years, this Republican-led Congress up until January borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 Presidents combined. You want to talk about a risk to a national security, there is one for you. 
   We have got a lot of active Members within the Blue Dogs who come to Washington and stand up and proudly proclaim that they are conservative Democrats with a commonsense vision for the United States. I am absolutely delighted to be joined this evening by several of them. At this time I would yield to an active Member within the Blue Dog Coalition, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Salazar).

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Salazar, a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition for joining us this evening. 
   The gentleman is absolutely correct. Every one of us, Democrat and Republican, we support our troops. All of the troops in harm's way tonight are in our prayers. 
   Just this week I visited Walter Reed Army Hospital and visited a 19-year-old corporal, John Slatton, from Delight, Arkansas. Most folks have never heard of Delight, Arkansas. It is a town of about 400 people. If you are my age or older, you might remember it as the hometown of Glen Campbell, who was a country singer and had a comedy show on Saturday nights back in the 1960s. 
   But this young man got to Iraq in October, had to have staples put in his head from a bullet that grazed his head in December. And on Easter, his family received a call that he had been shot by enemy fire and the bullet had entered near his left ear and exited the right side. The good Lord was working overtime that day. It missed his brain and  he is going to survive. He is going to have some challenges, and I ask that everybody join me in keeping him and his family in our hearts and our prayers. 
   We have all been touched by this. My brother-in-law is in the Air Force. He is serving in the Middle East tonight, and I am so very proud of his service and all of those who serve us in uniform. They do everything that we as a government ask them to do. But it is very important that we not only support them but that we provide them a direction that can ensure victory in Iraq and allow them to return home in the not-too-distant future to their families and loved ones.     
   I thank the gentleman for standing here with me tonight to demand accountability because we owe it to these brave men and women in uniform who serve our country and who we are so very proud of. 
   This is not a Democrat or a Republican thing. This is an American thing, and as Americans, we all stand in support of our men and women in uniform, not only while they are serving us overseas, but we have a commitment to them to provide them a new generation of veterans coming home with the very best in medicine and health care and opportunities so that they can be reintegrated into our society as productive citizens, as important citizens who have done so much for this country and for whom we owe so much. 
   I am very pleased to be also joined this evening by a fellow Blue Dog from the State of Tennessee, Mr. Lincoln Davis. At this time, I would yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.

   Mr. ROSS. The gentleman from Tennessee makes a very important point, and that is, look, I was here on 9/11 and shortly after the plane hit the Pentagon we were evacuated. A few hours later, I would learn a young Navy petty officer named Nehamin Lyons from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, would be among those killed on that tragic day that we now all refer to as 9/11. 
   And all of us, Democrats and Republicans, for the most part voted to go to Afghanistan to put an end to terrorism. 
   I will never forget later being invited to the White House September 26, 2002, sitting in a cabinet room: Andy Card, Condoleezza Rice, about 18 Members of Congress and the President. I have still got the notes I took that day, and the President told us that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, trains terrorists on weapons of mass destruction, and if military force is used, it will be, in the President's words, swift. September 26, 2002. 
   And then a few months later, we saw the banner ``Mission Accomplished,'' and we thought, wow, it was swift. But now we know, and I am not one of these conspiracy theorists that believes the President misled us. I think he received bad intelligence and shared it with us; and until proven otherwise, that is what I will believe because anything other than that would be a very unfair and strong attempt at trying to say something that we do not know whether it is true or not. I have to assume he just received bad intelligence. 
   But I will tell you this: there is not a more difficult decision that Members of Congress have to make than whether or not to send our men and women in uniform into harm's way; and when we are asked and called upon to make those kind of decisions, we have got to know, we must know that our intelligence is correct. 
   So for the most part, we all voted to go there. We are now there. What do we do about it? You want to talk about supporting the troops, one of the ways that you support the troops is to stop moving the goal post, to stop moving the victory line. 
   We say we went there because of weapons of mass destruction. They no longer have them. We won. 
   Then they said, well, we have got to stay until we overthrow Saddam.     
   We won. They said we have to stay till we capture him. We pulled him out of that spider hole. We won. Then the administration said we have to stay till we assassinate him. We assassinate him until he is executed, put to death, and he was. 
   So, based on that, we won. Then they said, well, we have got to stay until the Iraqi people can have elections. They did. We won. 
   Yet, now they are saying that, you know, we have got to stay there, and it's, you know, the line they use now is it's better to fight the terrorists there than here. There weren't terrorists in Iraq. Saddam wouldn't put up with them. He chopped their heads off. 
   Obviously, there are terrorists there now, and there are those from other neighboring countries wanting to create havoc. But for the most part what we have today, as the gentleman from Tennessee indicated, is civil war. Nobody fought our civil war for us, and it's pretty apparent the Iraqis don't want us fighting their civil war for them. 
   Now, understand, we had 3,200 U.S. soldiers die there, 25,000 injured, over 10,000 in ways that will forever change their lives. We are sending the Iraqis $12 million an hour. What do they think about us? Seventy-one percent don't want us there and 60 percent of them think it's okay to kill a U.S. soldier. 
   Contrast that with Afghanistan, where the Taliban is back on the rise. They are back training. We will spend more money in Iraq this month than we will spend in Afghanistan in the next 2 1/2 years. We have 225,000 troops in the Iraqi region today, and the President wants to add 21,000 more. Yet we only have 25,000 in Afghanistan. 
   The Taliban is back, organizing and getting trained, and the mountains of Afghanistan are nothing more than a breeding ground for terrorists. This administration is so focused on Iraq that they are losing sight of what is going on in Afghanistan, where 84 percent of the people in Afghanistan do want us there. 
   I just wanted to throw that out there for any comment you might have, because I thought you made an excellent point about how we fought our Civil War, and it's time they accept responsibility and fight their own. We cannot continue to put our men and women in uniform on their front lines and have them standing behind us. It is time for them to step up, accept responsibilities, train their men and women, and put them in uniform. They need to fight this war, if they really want a taste of freedom. No one can give you that. You have got to get it country by country.

   Mr. ROSS. As you can see from the chart here, let me just work through it with you. With the enactment of fiscal year 2007 appropriations, Congress has approved a total of about $378.5 billion for military operations initiated since the 9/11 attacks. According to the Congressional Research Service, this number will continue to escalate over the next several years. 
   The cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom alone cost American taxpayers $2.5 billion in 2001 and 2002, $51 billion in 2003, $77.3 billion in 2004, $87.3 billion in 2005, and $104.2 billion in 2006. You see a trend here. The cost of the war continues to go up.

   Mr. ROSS. It's my understanding the cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom is $378.5 billion. That is to date. Now, you have to understand what that means is, at this time we are spending about $2 billion a week, about $9.5 billion to $10 billion a month, or, again, put it another way, if you do the math, that is about $12 million an hour. 
   The Congress has appropriated $29.9 billion in aid to the Iraqi people. Of this amount, only $16.9 billion of that has been disbursed to the Iraqis, and yet the President is now asking for more. 
   On February 5, 2007, the Defense Department submitted a $94.4 billion fiscal 2007 supplemental request. If enacted, the DOD's total emergency funding for fiscal year 2007, and, again, for 2006, was $104 billion, this is to date, today, this is $60 billion. But if they get what they asked for, then the spending for $2007 will be $163.4 billion. I will repeat that. In 2006 it was $104 billion. In 2007 it will be $163.4 billion; or, put it another way, 40 percent more from the previous year and 50 percent more than the Office of Management and Budget estimated last summer. 
   Now, the administration also requested about $3 billion for Iraq, and $1 billion for Afghanistan in emergency foreign and diplomatic operations funds, if that is where you are going with that. If the fiscal year 2007 supplemental request is approved, total war-related funding would reach about $607 billion, including about $448 billion for Iraq, $126 billion for Afghanistan, $28 billion for enhanced security, and $5 billion that is unallocated. 
   For fiscal year 2008, the Department of Defense has already requested $481.4 billion for its regular budget, and $141.7 billion for war costs. If Congress approves both, the fiscal year 2007 emergency supplemental request and the fiscal year 2008 war request for the fiscal year beginning in October, then total funding for Iraq and the global war on terror would reach about $752 billion, including $564 billion for Iraq, $155 billion for Afghanistan, and $28 billion for enhanced security. Put another way, it almost doubles the number that was prepared January 24 of this year. 
   In fiscal year 2007 alone, spending on the thousands of government contractors involved in reconstruction has risen to $10 billion per month, including $8.6 billion for Iraq and $1.4 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. 
   Since the war is essentially financed through deficit spending, interest payments over time could amount to another $100 billion or more. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that additional war costs for the next 10 years could total $919 billion by 2013. If these estimates are added to already appropriated amounts, total funding for Iraq and the war on terror could reach about $980 billion to $1.4 trillion by 2017.     
   Adding another 21,500 troops alone will cost the American taxpayers another $5.6 billion per year. 
   Believe me, we have got 225,000 troops in the Iraqi region today. If adding another 21,500, which the President is already doing, would win this thing, we would all be for it. But, again, we have had numerous victories over there. Again, the President and this administration continues to move the goal post, the victory line. And that is not fair to our men and women in uniform who have performed bravely and admirably for our Nation.  
   We don't need a troop surge in Iraq. We need a diplomatic surge, and we need to demand responsibility from the Iraqi people. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Colorado for joining me this evening here on the floor to talk about restoring accountability to our government and demanding responsibility from the Iraqi people. 
   The American people spoke loud and clear on election day: they are ready for a new direction in Iraq. They don't want more of the same; they want a new direction. And that is what will be voted on on the floor of the House tomorrow. There will be a lot of mischaracterizations of what we are voting on. 
   Here is the bottom line: we are giving the President every penny he asked for for Iraq. Above and beyond that, we are going to provide funding for Walter Reed Army Hospital and for other VA hospital facilities to ensure that this new generation of veterans coming home, not only from Iraq, but also from Afghanistan, receive the very best in health care available to them, because we owe it to them. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to our brave men and women in uniform who have done everything that has been asked of them. 
   What this bill also does, I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that people understand this, the other thing this bill says is that we will have troops in Iraq for another year. And even after the year is up, we will continue to have troops there; but instead of having our men and women in uniform from America on the front lines getting shot at and wounded and killed, we will be there in an advisory role to train Iraqis and demand, a year from now, demand that they step up, that they step up and provide the police and military force for their country. 
   I think it is very important that the American people understand we are going to send our brave men and women in uniform every dime the President has asked for them, but we are also going to demand accountability and responsibility by the Iraqi people and tell them a year from now it is their turn.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Colorado, a fellow Blue Dog member, a member of the 43-member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, for joining me here on the floor this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you have any comments, questions, or concerns, I would invite you to e-mail us at BlueDog@mail.house.gov. Again, Mr. Speaker, if you have any comments, questions, or concerns, I would encourage you to e-mail us at BlueDog@mail.house.gov. 
   In the final 3 minutes that we have in the Special Order this evening, I want to point out that one of the things that has been endorsed by the Blue Dog Coalition that we are 100 percent united on is what is called House Resolution 97, Providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability. The Blue Dogs have endorsed and introduced House Resolution 97. It was offered by Jane Harman, former ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee and Congressman Patrick Murphy who was a captain in our Army and served in Iraq. And it provides for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability to address the lack of oversight and accountability with regard to the Federal Government's funding of the war in Iraq. 
   House Resolution 97, which currently has 61 cosponsors, puts forward tangible commonsense proposals that ensure future transparency and accountability in the funding of Operation Iraqi Freedom. If we are going to send $12 million an hour of your tax money to Iraq, we expect accountability and responsibility for how that money is being spent. We want to know without a shadow of a doubt that it is being spent to protect and equip our brave men and women in uniform. It is an important first step toward making sure that more resources get to our troops in the field. 
   There is a big debate right now of whether the body armor provided them in 2003, is that the best body armor in 2007. If we are going to send our troops over there, we must provide them with the very best, most advanced equipment that is available. 
   House Resolution 97 focuses on four crucial points for demanding fiscal responsibility in Iraq: 
   Number one, a call for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent; 
   Number two, the creation of a Truman Commission to investigate the awarding of contracts; 
   Number three, a need to fund the Iraq war through the normal appropriations process, and not through the so-called emergency supplementals; 
   And, number four, using American resources to improve Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations, demand more from this new Iraqi Government. 
   In addition, House Resolution 97 calls for the Iraqi Government and its people to progress toward full responsibility for internally policing their country. Members of the Blue Dog Coalition also believe strongly that funding requests for the Iraq war should come through the normal appropriations process rather than through multiple emergency supplemental requests. Since 2003, the Republican-held Congress has been funding the war through emergency supplemental requests, $166 billion in 2003, $25 billion in 2004, $76 billion in 2005, $50 billion in 2006, and another $70 billion after that and $99 billion for 2007 and $142 for 2008. And the list goes on and on. 
   If we are going to be there and if we know we are going to be there, let's put it in the budget and quit hidingit in the so-called emergency supplementals. The American people deserve to know that some $12 million an hour of their tax money is going to Iraq. And what the Blue Dogs are asking for in House Resolution 97, we are demanding from this administration and from the Pentagon accountability to ensure that every dime that goes over there is spent protecting and equipping and serving our honorable men and women in uniform who do everything that this country asks of them. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in keeping our brave men and women in uniform serving us tonight in Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the world in our hearts and in our prayers. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Reverend Roy P. Smith of Little Rock, Arkansas. I first met Roy in 1992 when he moved to my hometown of Prescott, Arkansas, to lead the church that my family and I belong to, the First United Methodist Church of Prescott. During his 3 years in my hometown, Roy was my pastor, my spiritual adviser, and a leader in our community. By the time Roy, along with his wife Sandy, daughter Martha Helen and son Andrew left Prescott to move on to their next assignment up the road in Malvern, Arkansas, Roy had become one of my closest and most trusted personal friends. 
   My family and the Smith family will be forever linked together by a strong and lasting bond of friendship, and it is a distinct pleasure to have Reverend Roy Smith here today to open this legislative day in the United States House of Representatives with his thoughtful and meaningful words of prayer. As we go about doing the work of the people, may we remember the prayer Reverend Roy Smith delivered on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives this day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, I rise on behalf of the 43-member-strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know about you, but I believe the American people like me are sick and tired of all the partisan bickering that goes on at our Nation's capital. I can tell you that I don't care if it is the Democratic or Republican idea. I ask myself is it a commonsense idea and does it make sense for the people in Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District? Then I vote accordingly. 
   What we have witnessed on this floor this evening is a lot of talk, and I think it is time that we speak to the facts, the facts about the state of our Nation and how we get out of this mess that we have seen be created during the past 6 years when the Republicans controlled the White House, the House, and the Senate. 
   Let's begin by looking here at the Blue Dog Coalition poster. The Blue Dog Coalition is nothing more than a name for fiscally conservative Democrats. And as you walk the halls of Congress, the Cannon House office building, the Longworth House office building, and the Rayburn House office building, you will occasionally happen upon one of these Blue Dog Coalition posters reminding Members of Congress, reminding those who walk the halls of Congress that today, today, the United States national debt is $8,841,089,074,666.40. 
   If you divide that by every man, woman, and child living in America today, every one of us, our share is $29,326.47. It is what those of us in the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition call the debt tax, d-e-b-t, and that is one tax that cannot be cut, that will not go away until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   This evening, they have been talking about the budget for fiscal year 2008 that will begin October 1. Let's begin by talking about the budget passed by the Republicans for fiscal year 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have got to tell you that when I came to Washington back in 2001, the first bill I filed as a Member of Congress was a bill to tell the politicians in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security Trust Fund. That was back when the Republicans controlled the White House, the House, and the Senate. And the Republican national leadership would not give me a hearing or a vote on that bill. Now we know why. Because this year, under the budget that was approved last year by the Republicans for fiscal year 2007, the deficit, the deficit is $427 billion. That is counting the portion that they are borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund with absolutely no provision made on how it is going to be paid back, when it is going to be paid back, or where the money is coming from to pay it back. 
   We hear a lot of talk about the national debt. It doesn't show up much in most public opinion polls. A lot of folks think we can simply print more money. Oh, how I wished it were that simple. The total national debt from 1789 until 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But, by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. 
   I know those are big numbers. They are big numbers to me. But I can tell you this: It is a doubling, it is a doubling of the 211 year debt in just one decade, in just 10 years. 
   Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest-growing parts of the Federal budget, and the debt tax, d-e-b-t, is the one tax that cannot be repealed. And every man, woman, and child in America, our share is $29,326.47. It would take all of us in America writing a check that large to pay off this debt that has been accumulated as a result of the reckless spending we have seen from this administration and this Republican-led Congress for the past 6 years. 
   Well, as you can see, the current national debt, $8,841,089,074,666.40, again,  every man woman and child in America, our share of the national debt, $29,326.47. 
   Why do I raise this issue and why is this issue so important to the 43 members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition? Here is why: Deficits do matter. Deficits reduce economic growth. They burden our children, our grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders. 
   In fact, I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we look here at the amount of foreign-held debt and the fact that it has more than doubled under the Bush administration. These numbers are in the billions. You can see how much was borrowed from foreigners in 2001, and you can see how much is borrowed from foreigners today. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders to fund our government. Foreign central banks and foreign investors currently hold a total of about $2.224 trillion. That is, $2,224,000,000,000 of our public debt. Compare this to only $623 billion in foreign holdings in 1993. 
   Kind of like David Letterman and his Top Ten List, we have a Top Ten List of whom the United States of America has borrowed money from, we are talking foreign central banks and foreign investors, to fund our government. Since 2001, this administration and this Republican-led Congress has continued to pass tax cuts that primarily benefit only those earning over $400,000 a year. They have done so while America is at war. Never before have we cut taxes when America was at war. In the past wars, we have had a shared sacrifice; and this war the only sacrifice being made is by our men and women, our brave men and women in uniform and their families.     
   I know this. My brother-in-law is currently stationed in the Middle East in the United States Air Force. This war has affected all of us in one way or another, and I know the kind of toil that takes, not only on him but his family back home at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington. Yet we have seen this administration, this Republican-led Congress, up until January pass tax cut after tax cut that primarily only benefits those earning over $400,000 a year. 
   Where is the money coming from? We haven't had a surplus. It has come, first, from raiding the Social Security trust fund. After they have gotten all the money they can suck out of it, they have gone to foreign investors and foreign central banks. Here is the top 10 list. 
   Japan: Our Nation has borrowed $637.4 billion from Japan to fund tax cuts for people in this country earning over $400,000 a year. 
   China: $346.5 billion. 
   The United Kingdom: $223.5 billion. 
   OPEC: Now we understand why gasoline was approaching $3 a gallon last summer. We have borrowed $97.1 billion from OPEC to fund tax cuts in America for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   Korea: $67.7 billion. 
   Taiwan: $63.2 billion. My friend John Tanner, one of the founders of the Blue Dogs, said it best when he said our country is in such a mess that if China does decide to invade Taiwan, we will have to borrow even more money from China to defend Taiwan. 
   The Caribbean Banking Center: $63.6 billion. 
   Hong Kong: $51 billion. 
   The United States of America has borrowed $52.1 billion from Germany to fund our government. 
   And get a load of this: The United States of America, our country, has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico to help fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   Those are the facts, not rhetoric, as we have heard. 
   Well, the Democrats are now in the majority, and it is now our responsibility to offer up a commonsense budget that puts America's children and families first again. Yes, we are doing it without raising taxes. In fact, we are proposing tax cuts. We are proposing a fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is now eating away at middle-income families all across this country. 
   I think it is important to note that for the first time in 40 years, and this is not a partisan thing, President Clinton was born and grew up in Hope and Hot Springs Arkansas, two towns I am proud to represent in the United States House of Representatives. I am a 1979 graduate of Hope High School and live some 16 miles up the road from there now in Prescott, Arkansas, which is where Holly and I are raising our children. 
   But if you think back with me, it was President Clinton who gave us the first balanced budget in this country by a Democrat or a Republican, either one, in about 40 years. You can see that the debt added under President Clinton was $1.6 trillion. We actually had a balanced budget from 1998 through 2001. Then the debt added under President Bush so far, $3.9 trillion. This is an accumulation of gross national debt in trillions of dollars, the difference that we have seen. 
   How did that happen? Well, in the Clinton years, when we had the first balanced budget in about 40 years, one of the ways it happened was by the House of Representatives implementing what is known as the PAYGO rules, which means pay-as-you-go, something that we do at the Ross home in Prescott, Arkansas, something that we do at our small-town family pharmacy that my wife, who is a pharmacist, and I own, and something most families in America and most businesses in America adhere to. Pay-as-you-go. 
   Yet for the past 6 years, those rules were abolished on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. The PAYGO rules were not in effect, and we saw the largest deficit after the largest deficit after the largest deficit in the history of this country, which has totaled into the largest debt ever in our Nation's history. 
   I am real proud of the new Democratic leadership, because the 43 members of the fiscally conservative, Democratic Blue Dog Coalition went to the Democratic leadership and said we are in the middle, and we believe we are where America is and it is important to us that you govern from the middle, and they have. 
   There was a lot of talk about the first 100 hours, and we did a lot of good things for the American people in the first 100 hours. We did a lot of good things for children, we did a lot of good things for working families, and, yes, a lot of good things for seniors. We cleaned up the mess in Washington by passing ethics reform. We raised the Federal minimum wage for working families. We passed legislation to allow our government to negotiate with the big drug manufacturers to bring down the high cost of medicine for America's seniors. We did a lot of good things in the first 100 hours. 
   But the most significant thing we did early on, one of the first things we did in the first few hours of the 110th session of Congress, is we adopted PAYGO rules on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, meaning pay-as-you-go. 
   It means if you have got an idea for a program you want to fund over here, you have to show us how you are going to pay for it. You have to show us what you are going to cut over here. 
   Now, some Republicans seem to think that means that the way you pay for new programs is raising taxes. We saw the largest deficit ever in our Nation's history, year after year. We saw the largest debt in our Nation's history ever. And we saw all this money that the Republican leadership and this administration was borrowing from foreign central banks and foreign investors to fund tax cuts and to fund programs. 
   They were so out of touch that they forgot the idea that you could actually cut programs to fund programs, cut programs that don't work to fund programs that do. 
   You don't have to raise taxes to fund programs. You do away with the programs that do not work. You want to talk about waste? There is all kinds of waste in our Federal Government. I have about $400 million worth of waste sitting in a cow pasture at the airport in Hope Arkansas. 
   In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit, one the first things FEMA did was order tens of thousands of brand new, fully-furnished mobile homes. They brought many of them, 10,777 at one time, to the airport in Hope, which had these inactive tarmacs and runways that were World War II era, and they thought it was a wonderful place to have a so-called FEMA staging area. 
   The idea was they were going to come through there on the way to the  Gulf Coast. They all came, but they never went. This was 2005, and these mobile homes never got to the storm victims of Hurricane Katrina. At last count, FEMA has 8,420, 8,420 of these brand new, fully-furnished, not camper trailers, we are talking about mobile homes, 16 foot wide and 60 foot long, just sitting there. Just sitting there. 
   To try to get them to the homeless on the Gulf Coast, I raised the issue with the Inspector General at FEMA back in late 2050, saying, Mr. Inspector General, Mr. Director of FEMA, Mr. President, if you don't move these mobile homes off this cow pasture, they are going to start sinking and it is going to destroy them. I did that to try to get them off high center and get them to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.     
   You know what they did? Mr. Speaker, do you know what they did? They showed up. They didn't move them. They showed up with $7 million. FEMA showed up with $7 million worth of gravel to put under them. This stuff is so crazy you can't make it up. And they continue to sit there today. 
   So the Republican leadership needs to understand when we talk about paying for something, when we talk about cutting programs that don't work and use that money to pay for programs that do, we are not talking about raising taxes, we are talking about identifying waste, like the $400 million, the more than 8,000 brand new, fully furnished mobile homes sitting there in the cow pasture at the airport in Hope, Arkansas. 
   That was one of the first things that happened on the floor of the House at the Blue Dog's insistence, as this 110th began under the new Democratic majority. And I am proud of this majority for listening to the 43 of us. It was one of our 12 points that I spent the last 2 years on the floor of the House talking about for meaningful budget reform. It was one of the first things implemented on this floor which will help us get back to the days of a balanced budget and a surplus, which is very, very important for a lot of reasons that we will discuss. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we look at the facts. The debt when President Bush took office, $5.7 trillion, the debt today $8.8 trillion. The debt added so far under the Bush Administration, $3.1 trillion, the debt projected at the end of the Bush Presidency is $9.6 trillion, the total Bush increases to the debt, $3.9 trillion. Deficits without the Social Security surplus. The OM budget deficit for 2007, $427 billion. The OM budget deficit for 2008 under the President's budget, $451 billion, one of the largest deficits ever in our Nation's history. 
   The cost of debt service. This is why it matters to every man, woman and child in America. The net interest for 2002 was $170 billion. You can see what's happening here. The net interest for 2008 is projected to be $261 billion. What does that mean? That means our Nation is spending three-quarters of a billion dollars a day simply paying interest on the national debt before we borrow another billion dollars today. Every day, our Nation starts off owing three-quarters of a billion dollars in interest payments. 
   Let me tell you why that matters. Because the interest payments on the debt are dwarfing other priorities. The red is the amount of money we are spending of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, paying interest on the national debt. 
   We talk about our children and how we love them and how we value their education. Look at how much we are investing in education in this country. Again, the red demonstrates the amount of money we are spending in a year paying interest to the national debt, which continues to go up to the tune of about $1 billion a day. The light blue reflects how much we do, as a Nation, value education. It reflects how much we are spending in a year educating our children. 
   The green. Oh, we talk about how we support our men and women in uniform on the floor of this House. And I hope every Member that gets up and says that does. You know, money speaks louder than words. Look at our priorities. The green represents the amount of money our Federal Government is spending on veterans, including a new generation of veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. Look how that compares to the red, the amount of money we are spending simply paying interest on the national debt. 
   And this new buzz word ``homeland security.'' Oh, we all take our belt off and take our shoes off and go through all that at the airport, and we feel safer. Are we? Look at the purple. Look at how much we are investing in homeland security. Look at how much we are investing as a Nation under the President's budget, all of this is under the President's budget in keeping America safe, and look how all those, education, veterans, homeland security compare to the amount of money our Nation is spending paying interest on the national debt. 
   I represent a district about half of Arkansas, and about half of that is in the Delta region, one of the poorest regions in the country. We have a lot of hope in that region that someday I-69 will be completed. I-69 is an interstate that was announced in Indianapolis 5 years before I was born. I am 45. With the exception of about 40 miles in Kentucky and a few miles in Tennessee, none of that has been completed south of Indianapolis. Just to complete the Arkansas section that can create economic opportunities and help the Delta region realize an economic revival with will take some $1.6 billion. That's a lot of money we don't have as a Nation. Why? Because we are spending it paying interest on the national debt, a debt that continues to go up under these 
   Republican policies and under this administration's budget. 
   As I said earlier, we are spending three-quarters of a billion dollars a day simply paying interest on the national debt. Give me about 2 days interest on the national debt, Mr. Speaker, and I can build I-69 through Arkansas and create all kinds of jobs and economic opportunities and help this poor Delta region recognize an economic revival. 
   On the western side of my State, folks have been waiting since I was a small child for the completion of Interstate 49. It, too, can create jobs and economic opportunities and open up the western side of Arkansas and complete the first north-south corridor through the middle of our country. I need $2 billion to complete I-49 in Arkansas. It's a lot of money, but it's about 3 or 4 days interest on the national debt. 
   We need new public schools built in this country for our children to be able to receive the very best education possible. We could build about 200 brand new elementary schools every single day in America just for the interest we are spending on the national debt. 
   My point, Mr. Speaker, is that America's priorities, education, veterans, homeland security, roads, infrastructure, are going to continue to go unmet until this Nation gets its fiscal house in order. That is what the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition is all about. We are about restoring fiscal discipline and common sense to our government. 
   This week, the Democrats are going to offer a budget that is fiscally responsible. Our budget adheres to the PAYGO budgeting rules that I talked about earlier and provides a commitment to the compensation of statutory PAYGO requirements. Our legislation, I should say legislation that was passed by the Republican Congress and signed by President Bush, has increased mandatory spending by $262 billion over the last 5 years. The PAYGO rule, as applied to mandatory spending increases as well as tax cuts, will enforce much greater spending restraint than the Republicans passed over the last 5 years. And I have gone through the details of why in my presentation earlier. 
   The Democratic budget meets the President's levels of spending for national defense, very important to me and members of the Blue Dog Coalition. We've got to have a strong national defense. Our brave men and women in uniform are doing whatever we ask of them; and as long as they are willing and able to do that, it is our duty and our obligation to provide them the resources that they need to do their job as safely as possible. And it is also our duty and obligation to them to ensure they receive the health care and veterans benefits that they have earned as this new generation of veterans return from Afghanistan and Iraq. And the Democratic budget increases homeland security funding levels.  
   The Democratic budget reaches balance, a balanced budget by 2012, and provides for greater deficit reduction than the President's budget over 5 years. Total spending in 2012 will be 18.9 percent of GDP, exactly 1 percent lower than it will be this year and lower than it has been in any year since 2001. And, yes, that's Democrats offering that budget, a commonsense budget to restore fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. This is a lot different than how the other side tried to explain it. 
   Our budget provides accountability. If there is one thing our Nation needs as a government, it is to restore accountability to our government. Defense auditors estimate that more than one of six dollars they have audited for Iraq is suspect, including $2.7 billion in Halliburton contracts. The Democrat budget assumes substantial savings from more efforts by the Defense Department, with increased congressional oversight, to root out wasteful spending, building on just-passed reform legislation to reduce waste in Federal contracting.     
   You know, the Constitution of the United States of America gives Congress the duty, the authority to provide oversight; and for the past 6 years this Republican-led Congress has been nothing more than a rubber stamp for whatever this administration wants. That is not what the framers of our Constitution envisioned. I am not suggesting, Mr. Speaker, that we go on a witch hunt or start issuing a lot of subpoenas. But what I am suggesting is that it is time for this Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty and responsibility of providing oversight. And we have started doing that. No more flying into Washington on Tuesday and out on Thursday. You are seeing a new Congress that is cleaning up the mess, that is coming in on Monday and staying to Friday, rolling up their sleeves. And, yes, not just voting on the floor of the House, but meeting in committees and providing the oversight as required by the Constitution of the United States of America. 
   Also under the Democratic budget, the House committees will conduct performance reviews to make sure that government programs are working, and work to eliminate, yes, the Democratic budget will work to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending. Similar efforts saved billions of dollars under the Clinton administration which gave us the first balanced budget by a Democrat or a Republican in some 40 years. 
   The Congress will save millions of dollars by investing in efforts to identify and eliminate wasteful spending and improve government efficiency. Our budget addresses the permanent AMT reform. You heard the Republicans tonight talking about the Democratic budget is going to raise our taxes. We are not raising anyone's taxes. In fact, our budget calls for a permanent fix for the alternative minimum tax, commonly known as AMT, to provide tax relief, yes, tax relief, for middle-class families, without increasing the deficit, and reaffirms support for extending middle-income tax cuts consistent with the PAYGO rules, pay-as-you-go. 
   The Democratic budgets includes a deficit neutral reserve fund that provides the framework necessary for permanent AMT relief for America's middle-income working families. While our plan to permanently reform AMT is a revenue and deficit neutral approach, the President's budget calls for a temporary 1-year fix and contributes to the already out-of-control deficits. Well, providing a permanent fix to the AMT will prevent millions, yes, millions, of hardworking Americans from facing a devastating tax increase this year. 
   The Democratic budget, our budget, will cut taxes for America's working families. President Bush's failed tax policies have left us with a debt of nearly $9 trillion. In fact, Mr. Speaker, as you can see here, again I will remind you, today the U.S. national debt: $8,841,089,074,666.40. 
   Well, in taking a revenue and deficit neutral approach to reforming the AMT, our budget is taking a measured and responsible approach to cleaning up the fiscal mess in which our Republican predecessors have left us. Over the past 6 years they have done these things, and now we have asked for a chance the clean them up, and we are in the process of doing that. 
   The Democratic budget meets the needs of veterans. Very important. Our budget meets previously unmet needs for veterans by increasing discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs from $36.5 billion to $43.1 billion. That is a $6.6 billion increase over fiscal year 2007. That is an 18.1 percent increase over last year, and a $3.5 billion increase, or 8.9 percent over the administration request for fiscal year 2008. Over the 5-year budget, the Democratic budget resolution includes $32 billion more to protect the health and well-being of our men and women in uniform than does the administration's request. And, yes, we owe it to our brave men and women in uniform, a new generation of veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. And, as a Nation, we had better be there for them and provide them the health care and the resources that they need, because they are there for us doing what our Nation is asking of them. 
   The additional funds will allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide excellent health care, keeping up with the high rate of health care inflation, and the continuing increases in new veterans entering the VA system. In fiscal year 2008, Mr. Speaker, the VA will treat 5.8 million patients. Yes, America is at war, and we need to recognize it and we need to properly fund the Veterans Administration to provide the health care and the needs of our new veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Our budget addresses the Veterans Administration's repair and maintenance backlog in the wake of a VA report that outlines 1,000 specific problems at VA facilities around the country. That is no way to honor our veterans. We have got to fix these 1,000 specific problems that have been outlined by the Veterans Administration, not only at Walter Reed, but all across this country. 
   Our budget increases efforts to address mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain injuries. The Democratic budget also rejects the Bush administration's proposed enrollment fees and near doubling of prescription copayments for America's veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last half of this hour I want to visit more about this budget that may very well be on the floor of this House on Thursday. Our budget provides for a strong national defense. Our budget provides for robust defense funding levels while targeting resources on the most pressing security concerns. It increase funding for veterans health care and services by $5.4 billion above current services. The Democratic budget provides more homeland security funding than the administration and provides funding for the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Yes, we are going to fund the bipartisan 9/11 Commission recommendations that should have been done several years ago. 
   In the area of health care, our budget accommodates an increase of $50 billion to expand children's health insurance to cover millions of additional uninsured children. Mr. Speaker, we have 48 million people in this country without health insurance. This is America. We are the leader of the free world, and we have got 48 million people in this country that don't have access to health care. And who are these? Not the people who don't want to work. If you don't want to work or can't work, you qualify for Medicaid, which is a health insurance program for the poor, the disabled, and the elderly. 
   These 48 million folks, who are they? Ten million of them are children. Children. And the rest of them are people that are trying to do the right thing and stay off welfare and they are working the jobs with no benefits. We want to expand children's health insurance to cover the millions of additional uninsured children in this country. 
   Education. The Democratic budget provides a 2008 program level that is $3 billion over current services for education, training, and social services, which includes funding for No Child Left Behind programs, special education, and aid to help students afford college. Now, this idea of No Child Left Behind was a great concept, but it has become nothing more than an unfunded mandate for our local school districts, and it has forced our schools and teachers to spend all their time teaching to  a test instead of teaching our children how to learn. 
   This No Child Left Behind business is so messed up, Mr. Speaker, that we are spending the whole school year teaching a test, and then giving the children the test in March on everything that they were supposed to learn through May. It is my understanding the reason they give the test in March on everything they are supposed to learn through May is they have got to do it early, as in March, so that the people that grade the tests can get the results back by October so the school district will have it to write a report that is due in September on how they are going to make the school better.     
   And they call it No Child Left Behind. It needs some serious fine tuning, and we need to put an end to this unfunded mandate and fund this program and fund our children's education. 
   Well, the budget, as I mentioned, also will provide aid to help students afford college. The Democratic budget increases funds for Head Start and child care. 
   Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that we live in a country where we get to choose where we work, where we worship, whom we marry. One of the few things in life we don't get to choose is who our parents are. Some children get really lucky. I did. Some don't. But as a Nation, I believe we have a duty and an obligation to be there for all children. And, Mr. Speaker, if we will invest in their education, in Head Start funding, if we will invest in the early years of a child's life, we can turn them into a productive, lifelong citizen of this country. Compare that to turning our backs on them and spending $25,000 a year warehousing them behind bars. The choice is easy for me, and that choice is reflected in our Democratic budget. 
   Well, the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition in the past has had to write our own budget. Why? Because the Republican leadership wouldn't give us a seat at the table. They wouldn't listen to our ideas. They would not include our ideas in their budget. This year the new Democratic majority leadership invited the Blue Dog Coalition, the 43 of us that are fiscally conservative Democrats, to sit at the table and to help draft a commonsense budget that reflects our values, our priorities, and restores fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. We asked for several principles to be included in this budget, and I am pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the budget that will be on the floor of this House on Thursday includes all six of the provisions that we asked for. Again, we are in the middle, America is in the middle, and as you can see, we are ensuring that this new Democratic majority governs from the middle. 
   Here are the six points that we asked to be included in the budget, and they have been: Number one, as we mentioned earlier, the Democratic budget adheres to the House pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule, a principle long advocated by the Blue Dogs as a solution for putting an end to deficit spending and reducing the nearly $9 trillion national debt. Republican budgets over the past several years included a net total of hundreds of billions of dollars in new mandatory spending. By contrast, this budget includes a net total of zero dollars in new mandatory spending. Due to its adherence to PAYGO rules, any increases in mandatory spending must be offset elsewhere in the government. That means cut programs that don't work. Don't borrow more money from China and Mexico. That key provision is included in the budget that will be on the floor of this House, the Democratic budget, on Thursday. 
   The second thing we asked for and got in this budget: The Democratic budget provides a commitment to the extension of statutory PAYGO requirements, a tool that was instrumental, as I mentioned earlier, in the return of the budget surpluses during the 1990s. Our budget resolution puts the House on record as endorsing an extension of the statutory version of PAYGO, pay-as-you-go, rules, which proved instrumental in bringing the budgets from large deficits of the early 1990s to the budget surpluses achieved by the end of that decade. We have now passed PAYGO as a rule in the House, and now in this budget we are endorsing it as law. 
   Number three, we asked for and received in this budget a provision for a strong national defense. The budget provides for a strong national defense and ensures that the protection of all Americans is the number one priority of our Federal Government. The preamble of the Blue Dog Coalition talks about fiscal discipline and talks about a strong national defense. It was important to us that we matched the funding request in the President's budget and provide increases in homeland security funding levels, and we have done that. The Democratic budget does that. It targets these resources to our most pressing security needs, and the budget includes an increase over the President's request for veterans health care and homeland security. That is the third point. 
   The fourth point that we asked for and got included in the budget: Unlike the President's budget, the Democratic budget is fiscally responsible and realistically reaches balance in 2012. Our budget puts an end to irresponsible deficit spending and has a better bottom line than the President's budget over 5 years by $234 billion and therefore accrues less debt and waste, fewer resources on interest payments on the national debt. Our budget holds the line on mandatory spending levels, putting our country back on the path toward fiscal responsibility. 
   The fifth thing we asked for and got in the budget, Mr. Speaker, provides for fiscally responsible tax relief. The budget calls for a permanent fix, not temporary, but a permanent fix, for the alternative minimum tax, AMT, to provide tax relief for middle-class families without increasing the deficit and reaffirms support for extending middle-income tax cuts consistent with PAYGO, pay-as-you-go, rules. 
   And, finally, number six, the last thing we asked for and got included in the budget: The Democratic budget contains tough program integrity measures to crack down on wasteful spending while ensuring that legitimate recipients of Federal funds and law-biding taxpayers are not penalized. That is what our new Democratic budget does. It will be on the floor of this House on Thursday. 
   Here is the alternative. This is what has been proposed by the President in his budget: The Bush administration has turned a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion into a projected 10-year deficit of $2.8 trillion. Under the last 6 years of fiscal irresponsibility, America's national debt has increased 50 percent to nearly $9 trillion, or $29,000 for every American. About 75 percent of America's new debt has been borrowed from foreign creditors, making our fiscal integrity a matter of national security. The national debt is up $3 trillion since 2001, and it will soar to more than $12 trillion by the end of 2012. President Bush has now borrowed more money from foreign nations than the previous 42 U.S. Presidents combined. Let me repeat that. This administration has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. You want to talk about a threat to our national security, there is one. 
   Well, the President's budget continues on the same fiscally irresponsible course. Under the President's budget, America's national debt will grow by $3 trillion over the next 5 years to $11.5 trillion, more than twice the size of the debt that the Bush administration inherited. Under the President's plan, deficits continue for the next 5 years. The deficit would increase by $24 billion in fiscal year 2008 if not for a growing Social Security surplus that is used to mask the true nature of the President's deficits. With honest and realistic accounting, under the President's budget, we have a deficit projected to rise to $464 billion by 2016. To hide this fact, the budget omits enormous costs, including the full cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the full cost for the Iraqi war, which is now costing us as taxpayers some $12 million an hour.     
   $2.5 billion a week it costs us, $9 billion a month. 
   The President's budget cuts domestic purchasing power by $114 billion over 5 years. Well, the President's budget omits the full cost of the administration's policy in Iraq and Afghanistan,  which means the President will come back, as he did last week, asking for more emergency spending, asking for more supplemental measures, another way of trying to hide the true cost of the war in Iraq. 
   The President's budget only provides $50 billion for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan after fiscal year 2008, yet last week he asked for $95 billion just to get through the rest of this year. Despite the numerous underestimations provided in years past and the nearly half a trillion dollars spent already, again he has come in and underestimated the amount of money that will be needed for fiscal year 2008 in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The administration's budget discontinues the funding after just a down payment for 2009, even though the administration is increasing troop strengths and has no current plans to scale back operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, a recent CBO, Congressional Budget Office, scenario estimated war costs for Iraq, Afghanistan and the Global War on Terrorism, could be as much as $603 billion higher over 10 years than what is included in the administration's budget. The President's budget uses rosy assumptions that boost the bottom line. The President's 2008 budget relies on unrealistically rosy assumptions that the economy will grow its way back to a budget surplus. 
   For example, in 2012 it assumes revenues that are $155 billion higher than comparable projections made by CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. Without these optimistic assumptions, a claimed 2012 surplus of $61 billion becomes a $94 billion deficit. 
   The President's budget fails to address permanent AMT reform. The President's budget includes only a 1 year fix for the Alternative Minimum Tax. This will allow the number of taxpayers affected by the AMT to skyrocket from 3.5 million in 2006 to 26.5 million in 2008, and represents a $247 billion tax increase on middle class families over the next 5 years. That is in the budget President's budget, a $247 billion tax increase on middle-class families over the next 5 years. 
   Forty-three members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition do not support tax increases like the one found here in the President's budget. The AMT has been deliberately used by the Bush administration to mask, to hide, the cost of its tax cuts, which have been paid for by the middle-class. 
   The AMT has also taken back a large portion of the Bush tax cuts promised for middle-class families. In 2001, an act provided marriage penalty relief by increasing the standard deduction and the size of the 15 percent tax bracket, but it did not reduce the marriage penalty contained in the AMT. In essence the 2001 act did not provide marriage penalty relief for many married taxpayers. 
   Democrats are going to fix that in the budget voted on on the floor of this House on Thursday. It remains unfixed, however, in the President's budget. 
   Congress has recently enacted a series of temporary fixes that limited the expansion of the AMT, Alternative Minimum Tax, to about 4 million taxpayers. But if left unchanged, next year the AMT will become a burden on the pocketbooks of millions of middle-class Americans. 
   Well, the President's budget also includes additional hidden taxes and fee increases. For example, the President's budget raises taxes on about 30 million families with employer-provided health insurance by over $300 billion over 10 years. The President's plan will result in a growing proportion of seniors paying higher Medicare premiums every year by eliminating indexing of the income related premium and extending it to the Medicare prescription drug benefit. These proposals will increase premiums paid by seniors to the tune of $5.5 billion over the next 5 years. 
   Veterans, I told you what the Democratic budget is going to do for veterans. Let's look at the President's. The President's budget proposes new enrollment fees and increases copayments for veterans healthcare. These fee collections will cost veterans $2.3 billion from 2008 to 2012. 
   The President's budget also imposes medical fees on TRICARE, the health insurance plan for military retirees under the age of 65. The increased fees imposed on military retirees will amount to $1.9 billion in 2008 and $14.5 billion over 5 years. 
   The President's budget eliminates, doesn't cut, it eliminates, a $9 million traumatic brain injury program at a time when hundreds of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are returning home needing help as a result of these traumatic brain injuries. 
   Education. We talked about what the Democratic budget will do for education. Let's look at the President's. The President's budget cuts funding for elementary and secondary education, denying 3.2 million children the extra reading and math help they were promised by the so-called No Child Left Behind Act. 
   The Bush budget eliminates higher education programs designed to help lower income students afford college, including the Perkins loans, the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program and the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program. Approximately 1.5 million students would lose financial aid awards as a result of these Bush higher education cuts. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Bush budget eliminates, not cuts, it does not cut, it eliminates 44 education programs, including Supplemental Opportunity Education Grants, Education Technology, Even Start, Ready to Teach, school counseling, mentoring and school drop out prevention. 
   The President's budget cuts, I am sorry, it doesn't cut, it eliminates, 44 education programs that can help to lift up our young people. The President's budget cuts discretionary education funding by $1.5 billion, or 2.6 percent below fiscal year 2007. 
   Well, the President's budget also reduces the availability of low cost loans for financially needy students by proposing to recall $419 million from Perkins loan revolving funds held by 1,315 colleges and universities. This will be the first step toward recalling $3.2 billion over 5 years from these revolving funds, which are used to provide low income loans averaging $2,000 to financially needy students. 
   The President's budget eliminates the $771 million Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program and the $65 million Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program, both of which help lower income students afford a higher education. 
   Overall, Mr. Speaker, approximately 1.5 million students would lose financial aid awards as a result of these Bush higher education cuts. 
   The Bush budget cuts funding for Head Start by $100 million. If enacted, this cut in the President's budget means that up to 13,500 children will be cut from the program next year. 
   There are cuts to healthcare. There are so many cuts. There are cuts to agriculture. There are cuts to homeland security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know as our time winds down that it is important that we look at the President's budget, it is important that we look at the Democratic budget and that we ask ourself, which one reflects our values, our priorities? Which one reflects America's values and priorities? 
   I am proud that this new Democratic majority on the Budget Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Spratt, that they sat with us, 43 member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition and gave us input in helping write a common sense budget that meets America's values and priorities, while restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government.     
   And I hope on Thursday, Mr. Speaker, we will see this budget, this commonsense budget pass that does reflect our values. It relates to our children and education, to our working families, to our seniors and their security, their Social Security and their retirement security and their health care security, and to children, some 10 million without health insurance tonight. 
   It is a commonsense budget that can help us return to the days of a balanced budget, that can help us put an end to this deficit spending, that can help us put an end to this reckless spending that we have seen for the past 6 years occur day after day on the floor of this House Chamber. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I close this evening, I remind you that as you walk the halls of Congress, as you walk the  House Office Buildings, you will note this Blue Dog Coalition poster reminding every Member of Congress and those who walk the halls that today the U.S. national debt is $8,841,089,074,666.40. And every one of us, every man, woman and child in America, our share is $29,326.47. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that it is our duty and obligation to restore fiscal discipline to our national government; and that when we leave here someday we will be able to say to our children and grandchildren that we helped make this country a better place for all of us to call home. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 43 member strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I rise on behalf of the 44-member-strong, fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, as we demand from this Government fiscal accountability as well as fiscal responsibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the halls of Congress, it is easy to know when you are walking by the door of a fellow fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition member, because you will see this poster as a welcome mat to his or her office to remind Members of Congress, to remind you, Mr. Speaker, to remind me, and to remind the American people and all of those who walk the halls of Congress, that the U.S. national debt today is $8,696,414,214,377.65. 
   For every man, woman and child in America, their share, our share, my share of the national debt is $28,900.92. That is a big number. 
   A lot of people think, well, it really does not matter what the debt is, our Government can simply print more money. I wish it was that simple. 
   Our Nation today is spending the first half a billion dollars it collects in taxes not to improve veterans' health care, to protect our troops, to build roads, to fund health care, to protect Social Security and Medicare, to ensure the 47 million folks without health insurance have access to it. No. The first half a billion dollars that we collect every day in taxes from the hard-working people in this country go to simply pay interest, not principal but interest, on this number, the national debt. 
   And those which should be America's priorities will continue to go unmet until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. This is something that affects every man, woman and child in America. We have a plan, a 12-point plan for budget reform to ensure that we can live within our means, that we can pay down this debt and restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our Government. 
   One of those 12 points, by the way, Mr. Speaker, is what we referred to as PAYGO rules, which means pay as you go. And I am real proud that the leadership under this Democratic Caucus in the first 24 hours, not 100 hours, but the first 24 hours, the Democratic leadership reinstituted PAYGO rules on the floor of the House. Which means, quite simply, if you want to fund a new program, you got to show us where the money is coming from. 
   Now the Republicans tend to think that that means that to fund new programs you raise taxes. I find it quite interesting that the Republicans think that PAYGO, pay as you go, means raise taxes to pay for new spending. It does not mean that. It means cut programs. It means make the tough choices to put an end to the waste in Government. 
   I got some 8,000 brand new, fully furnished mobile homes sitting at the airport in Hope, Arkansas, that were destined for Hurricane Katrina storm victims but never reached them. That is $400 million right there. 
   We are not talking about raising taxes to pay for a new program. But I can tell you what we are talking about, Mr. Speaker. We are talking about putting an end to the days of the Republican leadership borrowing money from China to fund a new program creating this large number, making it go up daily. It is still going up nearly a billion dollars a day under the Republican budget that was approved last year. 
   No more of that, Mr. Speaker. No more borrowing money from China to build a rain forest in Iowa. We are demanding that you show us how you pay for your projects and your programs. We are going to restore fiscal discipline and accountability to our Government. 
   This week, the President came out with his budget; and we will be visiting more about the President's budget during this hour. 
   But another thing that the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition is doing is we have gotten together and we have written and endorsed what is referred to as House Resolution 97. And House Resolution 97, we have 39 cosponsors. It is providing for Operation Iraq Freedom cost accountability. 
   Put quite simply, we are demanding accountability on how your tax money, Mr. Speaker, and the tax money of the hard-working people of this country is being spent in Iraq. You ask 100 different people what they think about this Iraq policy, you will get about 100 different answers. You will find some Members of the Blue Dog Coalition that are for the surge, some are against. I am against the surge. I think the American people want us to go in a different direction in Iraq. 
   But one of the things that unites us as a coalition and the things that we have endorsed and that we have written and we are trying to put in place is House Resolution 97, which has four crucial points that demand fiscal responsibility in Iraq. 
   Point number one, a call for transparency on how Iraq war funds are spent. The American people are sending some $9 billion a month to Iraq. That is about $12 million an hour. And the American people in this country that work hard and pay taxes deserve to know how their money is being spent in Iraq. 
   Number two is the creation of a Truman Commission to investigate the awarding of contracts. It is time, Mr. Speaker, to put an end to war profiteering in Iraq. 
   Number three, a need to fund the Iraq war through the normal appropriations process. Play by the rules. No more of this so-called emergency supplemental appropriations to hide from the American people the true cost of the war. 
   Finally, number four, use American resources. This is America. We are the leader of the free world, and we should  be using our resources to improve Iraqi assumption of internal policing operations. In other words, it is time for the Iraqi people to step up to the plate and buy into this and take more responsibility and accountability. 
   I am joined this hour by a number of my Blue Dog colleagues, Mr. Speaker. At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler).

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his valued insight into H.R. 97, which is the Blue Dog-endorsed House resolution to demand accountability and fiscal responsibility in how tax money is being spent in Iraq, some $9 billion a month; put another way, some $12 million an hour. 
   Let me be clear that as members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we support our troops 110, 120, 130 percent. We can't do enough for our troops. And as long as we have troops in harm's way, we are going to be there to ensure they have what they need to get the job done and to get it done as safely as possible, and hopefully get on back home to their families. 
   This has impacted every family in America in one way or another. My brother-in-law is in Kyrgyzstan now, which is the entry point for Afghanistan, just as Kuwait is oftentimes the entry point for Iraq. My first cousin was in Iraq when his wife gave birth to their first child. 
   Before coming down here today, I visited with a Ms. Watson in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, whose son, and she is so very proud of him and I am too, Lt. Colonel Watson, continues to serve us today in Baghdad. We thank him. We thank all soldiers for their dedicated service to our country. 
   This is about accountability. This is about having responsibility and oversight on how our tax money is being spent in Iraq. 
   Not only that, but this hour is dedicated to talking about this new Bush budget that was delivered to Capitol Hill yesterday. Thank goodness that, as Members of Congress, we get a vote on this budget, that we can ensure that funding is there for education and for our veterans. And, yes, we are creating a new generation of veterans in Afghanistan and Iraq today. And we have got to be there for them. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, a former cochair of the Blue Dogs for policy, Mr. Cooper.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper) for his valued input and insight into this budget process. The President has done the annual ceremoniously bringing of the budget, if you will, to Capitol Hill. And, in fact, Mr. Speaker, here is a copy of it. This is the budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2008 from the Office of Management and Budget. And it is quite a lengthy document.     
   But if you read over it, you will learn that the budget submitted this week continues the same policies that helped create the fiscal mess now facing our government. 
   While the administration's budget claims to reach balance in 2012, unfortunately, this budget is in deficit every year under realistic Bush policy assumptions. The budget continues to make the wrong choices for the American people. It proposes substantial cuts to programs that benefits seniors, working families and children, all to help pay for an extensive tax cut for folks earning over $400,000 a year. It is about priorities, Mr. Speaker; and the priorities found in this budget, this budget as delivered this week by President Bush, are misplaced. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, a very active member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, Mr. Scott. I hope he will stay for the remainder of this hour as we discuss the President's budget for fiscal year 2008, as well as the Blue Dog Coalition-endorsed House Resolution 97 to demand accountability on how the hardworking people of this country's tax money is being spent in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the 6 years of the Bush Administration, the government has posted the highest deficits in the Nation's history. The administration has squandered the budget surplus it inherited, transforming a $5.6 trillion projected 10-year surplus into a deficit of some $2.9 trillion over the same period, a swing of $8.4 trillion, based on realistic estimates of the cost of the President's policies. The President's new budget calls for a deficit of $244 billion for 2007, and $239 billion for 2008, marking 6 years in a row of deficits of more than $200 billion. 
   This budget that the President delivered to Capitol Hill this week includes $244 billion worth of hot checks for fiscal year 2008 and $239 billion worth of hot checks for fiscal year 2009. Unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. That means that this Nation will continue to borrow about a half a billion dollars a day every day, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Every day, under the Bush budget, we will borrow over a half a billion dollars, and that is before we spend a half a billion dollars each day paying interest on the debt we have already got. 
   America's priorities will continue to go unmet until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. Meanwhile, this budget continues to climb the climb of decline of our Nation's debt, which has already grown by $3 trillion during this administration. 
   Put another way, this President, this administration has borrowed more money from foreign lenders, foreign central banks than the previous 42 Presidents combined. In fact, we had only borrowed $623.3 billion in foreign holdings in 1993. Today, foreign lenders currently hold a total of about $2.199 trillion of our public debt. 
   I was with the President at a meeting Saturday morning. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner) asked him about whether he believed borrowing so much money from foreign central banks and foreign investors was a security threat to our country. His response was that he didn't know how much money we had borrowed from foreigners. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope the President is listening to us today, because, Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you, Mr. Speaker, what I refer to as the top 10 list. This is the top 10 list of the 10 countries that we have borrowed the most money from: Japan, $637.4 billion; China, $346.5 billion; the United Kingdom, $223.5 billion. 
   Can I go back to China for a moment? You know, we don't do business with Cuba because they are Communist, and yet we do business with Communist China out of a spirit of international relations. And while we are all focused on the Middle East and what is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan, Cuba has hired China to drill for oil on their behalf 55 miles from Key West, Florida, when the United States does not allow drilling within 100 miles of Key West. Can you imagine that? And yet we have borrowed $346.5 billion from China to give folks who live in this country who earn over $400,000 a year a tax cut and to leave our children and our grandchildren with the bill. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. Point well taken. Thanks for sharing that with us. 
   Let me just round out the top 10 current lenders. These are the countries the United States of America is borrowing money from in order to provide  tax cuts for folks in this country earning over $400,000 a year. That is in the President's budget. That is what he is proposing to do. Here is what he has done already. 
   In the past 6 years, our Nation has borrowed more money from foreigners than the previous 42 Presidents combined. Again, Japan $637.4 billion; China, $346.5 billion; the United Kingdom, $223.5 billion. OPEC. And we wonder why gas was approaching 3 bucks a gallon in August. Our Nation has borrowed $97.1 billion from OPEC to give folks who live in this country a $400,000 tax cut.     
   That is exactly what the President is proposing to continue. Mr. Speaker, I dare say that in this new Democratic majority, we will stop that. 
   Korea, $67.7 billion. Taiwan, $63.2 billion. If China decides to invade Taiwan, the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Tanner, has made this point before, our country and our fiscal house is in such a mess that if China decides to invade Taiwan, we will have to borrow more money from China to be able to afford to go assist and defend Taiwan. 
   The Caribbean banking center, $63.6 billion. Hong Kong, $51 billion. Germany, $52.1 billion. A lot of discussion about our border, and I believe we must secure our border, but are you ready for this: the United States of America has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico in the past 6 years to fund tax cuts for people who live here earning over $400,000 a year, leaving our children and grandchildren with the bill, which is the very reason why our Nation today is in debt $8,696,414,214,377. 
   That is a big number. How do you explain it? If you divide it by everybody that lives in America, some 300 million of us, every one of us owes $28,900. I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but I can't afford to write a check for $28,900 to the government. It is what we call the debt tax, D-E-B-T, and it is one tax that can't go away until we get our fiscal house in order and begin to meet America's priorities again. 
   Today, the money is going to pay interest on the debt, and it is going to borrow more money to fund the war that is costing us $9 billion a month, again, a big number, break it down, $12 million an hour. $12 million an hour.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for joining us during this Special Order to discuss the President's budget, which has been delivered to Congress this week, as well as to talk about the War Accountability Act, House Resolution 97, to demand transparency, accountability and just good government, Mr. Speaker, in how we are spending the hardworking people of this country's tax money in Iraq. 
   There are a lot of misplaced priorities in this enormous budget. Here is the top ten list: 
   Number one, it includes tax increases for middle-class families. 
   Number two, it has cuts in it to health care and to seniors. 
   Number three, while it is very cold outside right now, while much of the country is frozen, if you will, Mr. Speaker, it cuts home energy assistance for those who need help the most with finding the money to afford to heat their home in the winter months. 
   After 5 years following 9/11, it has devastating cuts to police and firefighters. 
   In direct opposition to the wishes of the people of this country, here it comes again, it has a plan to privatize Social Security. 
   The President's budget includes cuts to veterans health care. At a time when we are creating a new generation of veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the President's budget includes cuts to our veterans. We need to ensure that our veterans receive the health care they so desperately need. 
   I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but I get letter after letter and call after call from veterans who have to wait in line weeks and months at a time to be able to see a doctor. That is not the kind of health care we promised America's veterans. We should honor them by properly caring for them. 
   It includes cuts to education and cuts to housing assistance. And with Iraq veterans returning with devastating injuries, it includes cuts to the brain trauma research that is so desperately needed by many of these returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   President Bush's budget says a lot, but it does very little. It is filled with misplaced priorities. I will challenge you, Mr. Speaker, to read it for yourself, make your own decision. 
   As members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we are not here to beat up the President. He can't even run again. We are here to reach out across that aisle and work with him and work with the Republican Members of Congress, because the American people have sent a message very loud and clear, they want us to work together. That is what the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue  Dog Coalition is all about. We want to work in a bipartisan manner to put this Nation on a track toward a balanced budget, to pay down the debt, and to restore some fiscal discipline and common sense to our Nation's government. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Lincoln Davis.

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 781. This legislation honors and recognizes the life and work of Colonel Charles D. Maynard by redesignating lock and dam No. 5 of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System as the Colonel Charles D. Maynard Lock and Dam.     
   I would like to first thank Chairman Oberstar and subcommittee Chairman Johnson, along with Ranking Member Mica and subcommittee Ranking Member Baker and Mr. Westmoreland of Georgia for their support and assistance in moving this bill from the Transportation Committee to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in a bipartisan manner. 
   I am also pleased that this legislation has received the support and cosponsorship of the entire Arkansas congressional delegation. I would like to personally thank Congressman JOHN BOOZMAN, a Republican; Congressmen VIC SNYDER and MARION BERRY, Democrats. The entire Arkansas delegation in a bipartisan manner have come together in this legislation. 
   Colonel Charles D. Maynard served our Nation with distinction as an engineer officer in World War II. Following the war, Colonel Maynard oversaw the Arkansas River Project in the early 1960s, which at the time was the most substantial and largest civil works project ever undertaken, ever undertaken, by Corps of Engineers. At the same time Colonel Maynard also oversaw the construction of Greers Ferry and Beaver Dams on the White River in Arkansas. 
   Colonel Maynard was also the Little Rock Corps District Engineer in charge of construction of all locks and dams in Arkansas from 1962 to 1965. During that time he directed planning, design, and construction of 13, 13, locks and dams of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation Project. 
   In addition to his work with the Corps, Colonel Maynard actively promoted the development of waterborne transportation in Arkansas and was appointed by three Governors to a prestigious position on the Arkansas Waterways Commission, where he served for 21 years. He also served as Chairman and President of the Water Resources Association of America, President of the Arkansas Basin Association, and he was a member of the Arkansas Basin Coordinating Committee. 
   As a member of the Arkansas River Hall of Fame, Colonel Maynard provided congressional testimony in support of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, the Fourche Creek Flood Control Project, and the Montgomery Point Lock and Dam on behalf of various Arkansas associations and committees. 
   In addition to his numerous accomplishments in waterways, Colonel Maynard was also a dedicated citizen who served in a variety of community and civic roles in the State of Arkansas. These included his service as the United States Savings Bond Coordinator for Arkansas for 10 years, the Campaign Chairman for the United Way of Pulaski County, the Chairman of Central Arkansas Radiation Treatment Center, and President of the Little Rock, Arkansas Chamber of Commerce. 
   Finally, Colonel Maynard's steadfast service on numerous boards and councils at the State and local level will never be forgotten. These include the Arkansas Arts Center, the Arkansas Symphony, and the Foundation Board of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
   The life and work of Colonel Charles D. Maynard were immensely important to not only the State of Arkansas but to the entire Nation. This resolution will write into history Colonel Maynard's countless contributions. As such, I am proud to sponsor a resolution that commemorates his life's work and achievements by redesignating Lock and Dam No. 5 of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System as the Colonel Charles D. Maynard Lock and Dam. I urge my fellow colleagues to vote in favor of this worthwhile legislation today.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening on behalf of the 44 member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that are committed to restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. During the 109th session of Congress, we had 37 members; in the 110th session of Congress, we have grown to 44 members, 44 fiscally conservative Democrats that share my vision of putting America on a path toward fiscal responsibility, putting America on a path toward accountability, and putting America on a path that will restore common sense to our national government. 
   As you walk the Halls of Congress, as you walk the Cannon House Office Building, the Longworth House Office Building, as you walk the Rayburn House Office Building, you will see this poster, Mr. Speaker; and as you see this poster, it will be a symbol that you are walking by an office that houses a Blue Dog member. You will find 44 of these posters in the Halls of Congress to remind the American people and to remind the Members of Congress and to remind all of us as we walk these Halls that our Nation is one that is tragically in debt. 
   The current national debt of these United States of America is $8,690,905,471,722, and actually 43 cents. I just didn't have room to put it on the poster. I ran out of room. And for every man, woman, and child in America, your share of the national debt is $29,005.60. It is what we have coined in the Blue Dog Coalition as the debt tax, D-E-B-T tax. It is one tax that cannot be cut, that cannot be repealed until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, you might be thinking, Now, didn't President Clinton leave us with a balanced budget, the first one in some 40 years? Didn't we have a balanced budget from 1998 through 2001? Yes, Mr. Speaker, we did. But in the past 6 years, this Republican President and this Republican Congress has given us record budget deficit after record budget deficit. 
   On this chart you will see the four largest deficits ever in our Nation's history. The first rank was 2004 when our Nation wrote $413 billion worth of hot checks. The second largest deficit  ever in our Nation's history was in 2003 when our Nation wrote $378 billion in hot checks. In 2005, it was $318 billion. And in 2006, the President actually had a press conference to brag on the fact that he came in under projection and only wrote $296 billion worth of hot checks, the largest deficit year after year after year under this Republican-controlled Congress that has given us the largest debt ever in our Nation's history. 
   As members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, we believe that the American people have given us the majority in this Congress because they want us to do something about it; and, Mr. Speaker, we have a plan. We have a 12-point plan to restore budget discipline and common sense to our national government. 
   Why is this important? It is important because if you think with me, Mr. Speaker, the total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion; but by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. That is a doubling, a doubling of the 211-year debt in just 10 years. 
   Interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget, and the debt tax, D-E-B-T tax, is one that cannot be repealed. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reason this should matter to every man, woman, and child in America is quite simple: deficits do matter. Deficits reduce economic growth; they burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities; they increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt. Let me repeat that: foreign lenders now own 40 percent of our debt. 
   Put another way, this administration and this Republican Congress over the past 6 years have borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 Presidents combined. It is time to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   Why? Why does it matter to the working families and seniors to this country? It is quite simple. Our Nation is borrowing some $1 billion a day. We are spending one-half billion dollars each day paying interest on the debt we have already got before we increase it another $1 billion today. And as you can see, the red graph is the increase we spend on your tax money paying interest on the national debt. The blue is how much we spend on education. Look at the difference. The red graph illustrates the amount of your tax money that is going not to pay principle but to pay interest on the national debt. The blue represents how much we are investing in our young people, how much we are spending on education. The green represents how much we are spending on homeland security. Tragically, the dark blue illustrates how much we are spending taking care of our veterans. 
   It is time this country gets its priorities in order, and I believe the American people on November 7 spoke loud and clear in giving us a chance to lead in this Chamber, and we are ready to lead, and we are ready to lead with the Blue Dog Coalition's 12-point plan for budget reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that we have grown to 44 members in the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, and one of those members that has joined our ranks is the gentleman from Ohio, and at this time I would yield to my friend from Ohio, CHARLIE WILSON, for as much time as he would like to take.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson) for joining us on the floor this evening for the Blue Dog Special Order as we talk about restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. And the gentleman from Ohio, a new member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, he mentioned that one of the things that we have done already in this 110th Congress under the Democratic leadership is reinstitute the PAYGO rules. That means pay-as-you-go. And on the very first day in the first 24 hours of the 110th session of Congress, we are very pleased as members of the Blue Dog Coalition that the leadership of this House under Democratic control chose to include in their rules package reinstituting the PAYGO rule, because that rule was in place from 1998 through 2001 when we saw a balanced budget in this country. It makes sense to me. 
   You know, 49 States require a balanced budget. Holly Ross requires a balanced budget at the Ross family in Prescott, Arkansas. We own a small business; we are required to balance the books there. And in our opinion, it is not asking our Nation too much to balance its books. And one of the ways that you begin the process of doing that is instituting the PAYGO rule, which means pay-as-you-go. If you have got a wonderful program, then show us what program you are going to cut to pay for it. 
   Now, I got a big kick last week during the debate on this very floor when Republicans jumped up and down opposed to reinstituting the PAYGO rule. When I was a small child growing up, I always heard it was the Democrats that tax and spend, and yet it was the Republicans over the last 6 years that has given us record deficit after record deficit, the largest debt ever in our Nation's history. And last week they said they were opposed, many of them said they were opposed to the PAYGO rule because it meant to pay for a new program raising taxes. They don't get it, Mr. Speaker. It is not about raising taxes; it is about cutting spending. It is about reducing the size of our government. It is about paying as you go. If you want to create a new program, show us which program you are going to cut to pay for it. 
   As members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition we are sick and tired of the games; we are sick and tired of the partisan bickering that goes on at our Nation's Capitol. I don't care if it is a Democrat or Republican idea. All I care about is, is it a commonsense idea? Does it restore accountability and fiscal responsibility  and discipline to our Nation's government?     
   At this time I yield to Joe Donnelly, a Member of Indiana, a member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana, a new member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, for joining us on the floor this evening as we talk about our plan to restore fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   Mr. Speaker, on November 7, the American people spoke, and they said they wanted a new direction for this country both here at home and abroad. And in speaking, they gave us, as Democrats, a chance to lead in this 110th Congress. And Mr. Speaker, we are ready, willing and able and prepared to do so. 
   And part of the way that we believe we can restore fiscal sanity to our National Government, it took 6 years to create this mess, and we can't fix it overnight, but we have a plan to begin to restore some fiscal discipline to our Nation's Government. And it is what we call the Blue Dog Coalition's 12-point plan for budget reform. And I am pleased to be joined this evening by the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Bean, who is going to join me in talking about some of these 12 points, and I now yield to Ms. Bean.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I think it is very important that we point out that not only the PAYGO rule, which means pay-as-you-go, no more borrowing money from China to fund some project and let our children and grandchildren worry about it, but 
   pay-as-you-go is one of the rules implemented during the first 24 hours of the 110th Congress under this new Democratic leadership. It is very significant because it is one of the 12 points of the Blue Dogs Coalition's plan for budget reform. But also another one of our 12 points that was included in those first 24 hours in the rules package is adding a level of transparency, justifying, if you will, pet projects or earmarks. I think it is very significant that, of these 12 points that you are reading off, two of them we have tried for years to get the Republican leadership to work with us in a bipartisan manner on this. And two of these 12 were included in the first 24 hours of the Democratic-controlled Congress. I think that is very significant, and I want to thank the leadership for including those.

   Mr. ROSS. The gentleman makes an excellent point. You want to talk about something that is critical to our national security, it is this business that over the past 6 years we continue to cut taxes on folks earning over $400,000 a year with money that we borrowed from foreign central banks and foreign investors, and left our children and grandchildren with the bill to pay. 
   The gentleman was ticking some of these off, but if I may, it is kind of like David Letterman and his top 10 list, the top 10 current lenders: Japan, $640.1 billion; China, $321.4 billion; the United Kingdom, $179.5 billion. This is the amount of money the United States of America has borrowed from foreign countries to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over $400,000 a year. 
   The voters on November 7 said it is time for a new direction and new priorities in this country, and we are going to give them to the American people. But to continue the list: OPEC, $98 billion, and we wonder why gasoline was approaching $3 a gallon in August; Korea, $72.4 billion; Taiwan, $68.9 billion; the Caribbean banking centers, $61.7 billion; Hong Kong, $46.6 billion; and Germany, $46.5 billion; and to round out the top 10 current lenders to the United States of America, and you are not going to believe this, Mexico, $40.1 billion. 
   This administration over the past 6 years has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 Presidents combined, and that is why we rise tonight as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition to talk about leading America in a new direction, a direction that will restore fiscal discipline to our government; and the way we achieve that is through our Blue Dog Coalition 12-point plan for budget reform.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, a real leader within the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition for joining us this evening on the House floor as we talk about this new direction for America. 
   The American people have spoken, and they have told us that it is time for a change. They have given us Democrats an opportunity to lead them in a new direction. I am proud of what we have accomplished in the first few hours of the 110th Congress. We have instituted the PAYGO rules, the rules that say if you are going to spend money, you have to show us how you are going to pay for it, the rules we had in place when we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 until 2001. 
   You are seeing us put in place earmark reform, a greater level of transparency and knowing clearly who is asking for the money and where it is going and who is benefiting from it. 
   Second in our Blue Dog Coalition's 12-point plan for budget reform, in the first 24 hours of this new Congress, we are making progress. We have heard the American people. They have given us an opportunity to lead, and we are demonstrating we can do that. In the first 100 legislative hours, we are passing the 9/11 Commission recommendations that were not implemented in the 109th Congress under the Republican leadership. We are raising the minimum wage, which is something I am very excited about. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we are serious about moving people from welfare to work, we have to pay them more than $10,712 a year. That is what the Federal minimum wage in this country represents if you work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, never get sick and don't take a single day off for vacation. We can do better than that by America's working families, and we will. We will this week, the first full week of the 110th session of Congress. 
   We will pass legislation on the floor this week that tells our government that, yes, it can negotiate on behalf of 40 million seniors with the big drug manufacturers to bring down the high cost of medicine. The American people on November 7 gave us an opportunity to lead. And in these early hours of the 110th Congress, and as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, we are demonstrating that we are ready to lead and that we are leading America in a new direction. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, the national debt, $8,690,905,471,722. Let's think about this. $8,690,905,471,722.43. The 43 cents wouldn't fit on the poster. For every man, woman and child in America, to get us out of this mess, everybody in America would have to write a check for $29,005.60. That is why we must restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the Halls of Congress, you will know when you are walking past the door of a Blue Dog Coalition member because you will see this poster; and, unfortunately, you will see this number change each day. We are going to do our part to hopefully see this number go down as we push for a balanced budget in this country, as we push for the day when we can see a balanced budget in this country, as we push to restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our national government and its budgeting process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce another new member of the 44 member strong fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, the Congressman from Florida, Mr. Mahoney.

   Mr. ROSS. I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana for his commitment to putting an end to these record deficits in our Federal Government. 
   The gentleman is absolutely right. I grew up in a small Methodist Church outside of Prescott and Hope, Arkansas, Midway United Methodist Church, and I can remember Sunday after Sunday after Sunday growing up where the preacher would talk about being a good steward, that was always before he passed the plate, and the preacher would talk about being a good steward. 
   Well, the American people have sent us here and had us raise our right hand and put our left hand on the Bible and take the oath of office and pledge, swear to uphold the Constitution, and, yes, be good stewards of the American people's tax money. That is really what this is all about. 
   I think it is very important, the work that we are doing as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, and trying to be good stewards of the tax money of the people back home and to make sure it is spent wisely and to make sure it is accounted for. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Wilson.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for that perspective as we discuss something that is very important to our Nation, and that is how we get our fiscal house back in order after 6 years of reckless spending. We believe we have a plan to do it. That plan is now being implemented. 
   In the first 24 hours of the 110th Session of Congress we saw the PAYGO rule implemented, which can give us a balanced budget again. It worked before. It can work again. And we saw transparency, a new level of transparency added to earmark reform.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the many members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition for coming to the floor of the House of Representatives this evening and joining me for a discussion on how we can restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our national government, how we can bring this number down, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening on behalf of the 43 Members that make up the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are conservative Democrats, we are commonsense Democrats that want to restore fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the halls of Congress, as you walk the halls of this Capitol and the Cannon House Office Building and the Longworth House Office Building and the Rayburn House Office Building, it's not difficult to know when you're walking by the door of a fellow Blue Dog member because you will see this poster that reads, ``The Blue Dog Coalition''. And it will tell you, it serves as a reminder to Members of Congress and to the general public that walk the halls of Congress that today the U.S. national debt is $8,807,559,710,099. And I ran out of room, but if I had a poster that was just a little bit more wide, Mr. Speaker, I would have added 85 cents. 
   Your share, every man, woman and child, including the children born today in America, if you take that number, the U.S. national debt, and divide it by the number of people living in America today, our share, everyone's share of the national debt is $29,174.38. It is what those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition refer to as ``the debt tax,'' d-e-b-t tax, which is one tax that can't go away, that can't be cut until we get our Nation's fiscal house in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the first bills I filed as a Member of Congress back in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in Washington to keep their hands off the Social Security trust fund. The Republican leadership at the time refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill, and now we know why; because the projected deficit for 2007, based on the budget bill written when the Republicans controlled Congress, they will tell you is only $172 billion. 
   Not so. It's $357 billion. The difference is the money they are borrowing from the Social Security trust fund, with absolutely no provision on how that money will be paid back or when it will be paid back or where it's coming from to pay it back. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, when I go down to the local bank in Prescott, Arkansas, and sit across from a loan officer and get a loan, they want to know how I am going to pay it back, when I am going to pay it back and where the money is going to come from to pay it back. It is time the politicians in Washington keep their hands off the Social Security trust fund. 
   The national debt, the total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was $5.67 trillion. But by 2010, the total national debt will have increased to $10.88 trillion. That is a doubling of the 211-year debt in just a decade, in just 10 years. Interest payments on the debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the Federal budget. And the debt tax is one that cannot be repealed. 
   People ask me, why should I care about the fact that our Nation is in debt? Why should I care that we continue to borrow billions of dollars? After all, it's future generations that are going to be stuck with the bill. 
   I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that it should matter for a lot of reasons. But here is a good one right here: interest payments. Our Nation is borrowing about a billion dollars a day. We are spending about a half a billion a day paying interest on a debt we've already got before we borrow another billion dollars today. 
   I-49 is important to the people in Arkansas in my congressional district. I need nearly $2 billion to finish I-49, an interstate that was started when I was in kindergarten. That's a lot of money, at least for a country boy from Prescott and Hope, Arkansas. But I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that we will spend more money paying interest on the national debt in the next 4 days than  what it would cost to complete Interstate 49 in Arkansas, creating with it all kinds of economic opportunities and jobs. 
   That's on the western side of my district. I represent about half the State. 
   On the eastern side of my district, I-69 is very important. I need about $2 billion to finish I-69. I-69 was announced in the State of Indiana, in Indianapolis, 5 years before I was born. That was 50 years ago. And with the exception of about 40 miles in Kentucky in a section they are now building from Memphis to the casinos, none of it has ever been built south of Indianapolis. $2 billion is a lot of money, but we will spend more than that in the next 4 days paying interest on the national debt. 
   As you can see from the chart here, in red, that is the amount of money, of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, that we will spend paying interest on the national debt this year. Compare that to how much we are spending on our children and their education. 
   You know, folks in this country come up to me all the time saying that English should be the official language. And I personally don't necessarily disagree with that. But let me tell you what people should be equally concerned about; they should be equally concerned about the fact that we have got more young people today in India learning English than in America. We've got more young people today in China learning English than in America. And it is not because they love America, it is because they want our jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely critical that we provide our young people with a world-class education, and yet you can see we are spending a fraction on educating our children of what we will spend this year paying interest on the national debt. 
   You hear a lot of talk about homeland security. We all take off our shoes when we go through the airports. And I guess we feel a little bit safer, but look at what our real commitment as a Nation is to homeland security compared to what we are spending paying interest on the national debt. Homeland security is in the green, the red is the interest we are paying on the national debt. 
   And finally, veterans. We can talk about patriotism all we want, but I will tell you what, the rest of the world can look at America and determine how much we value our soldiers by how we treat our veterans. 
   And a whole new generation of veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. How do we value them? The dark blue shows how much we are spending of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, on our veterans compared to the red, which is the amount we've been simply paying interest on on the national debt. 
   Where is this money coming from that we are borrowing a billion dollars a day? I have already told you, Mr. Speaker, a lot of it is coming from raiding the Social Security trust fund. Where is the rest of it coming from? Foreign central banks and foreign lenders. 
   That's right, Mr. Speaker. In fact, to put it another way, this administration has borrowed more money from foreigners in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. Let me repeat that. This administration has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors in the past 6 years than the previous 42 Presidents combined. 
   Foreign lenders currently hold a total of about $2.199 trillion of our public debt. Compare that to only $623.3 billion in foreign holdings in 1993. Who are they? The top 10 list. 
   Japan. The United States of America has borrowed $637.4 billion from Japan to fund tax cuts in this country for people earning over $400,000 a year, leaving our children with the bill. 
   China, $346.5 billion. 
   The United States of America has borrowed $223.5 billion from the United Kingdom. 
   $97.1 billion from OPEC. And we wonder why gasoline is $3.25 a gallon today in south Arkansas. 
   Korea, $67.7 billion; Taiwan, $63.2 billion; the Caribbean banking centers, $63.6 billion; Hong Kong, $51 billion; Germany, $52.1 billion. 
   And get a load of this. Rounding out the top 10 countries that the United States of America has borrowed money from to fund tax cuts in this country for folks earning over 400,000 a year and to fund the war in Iraq: Mexico.     
   Our country has borrowed $38.2 billion from Mexico to fund our government. 
   So debts do matter. Deficits do matter. And in this case, I submit to you, it is a national security issue. 
   So what do we do about it? As members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, we have got a plan. We have got a plan for budget reform. We have a plan to demand accountability in Iraq. We support our soldiers, and as long as we have soldiers in harm's way, we are going to make sure they are funded. 
   But this administration has acted like if you challenge them on how they are spending your tax money in Iraq, then you are unpatriotic. We are not going to stand for that anymore, because, Mr. Speaker, we believe that this administration and the Iraqi Government should be accountable for how $12 million of taxpayer money is being spent every hour in Iraq. 
   That is right, our Nation is spending $12 million of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, every hour in Iraq, and it is time that the Iraqis be held accountable for how that money is being spent. It is time we demand that they step up and accept more responsibility for training the Iraqis to be able to take control of their police and military force. And, yes, it is time that we demand more accountability from this administration on how this money is being spent on Iraq and ensure that it is being spent on our brave men and women in uniform. 
   John Grant of Pearcy, Arkansas, brought to my attention the fact that our soldiers may very well not be equipped with the most advanced and the best body armor that is made. I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that we must ensure that the very best in body armor is being provided to our men and women in uniform. We have learned a lot about that in the last few days through an NBC investigative report. I am proud to tell you that over 40 Members of Congress, including a lot of my Blue Dog friends, have signed on to a letter to the administration, to the Pentagon, demanding that further tests be done, and that our men and women in uniform be provided with the very best in body armor. 
   I am joined by a number of fellow Blue Dogs this evening, and it is with great honor that I introduce at this time my friend, an active member of the Blue Dog Coalition from the State of Colorado, Mr. JOHN SALAZAR.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for his active involvement in the Blue Dog Coalition and for his words this evening. 
   Some people may be saying, what is the Blue Dog Coalition? The Blue Dog Coalition was founded back in 1994 shortly after the Republicans took control of Congress by a group of conservative Democrats, Democrats that used to be Yellow Dog Democrats. The saying in the South is that a Democrat is so Democratic that they would vote for a yellow dog if a yellow dog was running for office. That is where the saying comes from. 
   There was a group of conservative Democrats back in 1994 that felt like they were being choked blue by the extremes of both parties. That is what the Blue Dog Coalition is all about. We are a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that want to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. We don't care if it is a Democrat or Republican idea. We ask ourselves, is it a commonsense idea, and does it make sense for the people who send us here to be their voice in our Nation's Capital? 
   An active and leading member of the Blue Dog Coalition, an independent voice within the Congress from the State of Georgia, is Mr. David Scott. At this time I yield to him.

I thank Congressman Murphy from Pennsylvania for his insight and life experiences as a veteran of the Iraq War, and for sharing his thoughts with us this evening as we demand accountability and common sense on how your tax money, some $12 million an hour of your tax money, is being spent in Iraq. It is important, we believe, that we make sure that it is being spent on our troops, to protect and support them, and that it be accounted for.     
   That's what H. Res. 97 is all about, and we're very pleased, and we want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Skelton, for including key provisions of our legislation, written in part by Mr. Murphy, in the Defense authorization bill this year.

There's a lot of folks that believe Members of Congress are held to a different standard, and they should be. They should be held to a much greater standard, a much harsher sentence than the average citizen on the street, because if Members of Congress can come here and make laws, they ought to abide by those laws they make. And if they can't, they should have additional time put onto their sentence. 
   And I want to thank the gentleman from California for trying to work with those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition to clean up the mess here in Washington.

   In the hour we have been on the floor this evening talking about the need to restore common sense and fiscal accountability to our Nation's government, we have seen the national debt increase by at least $40 million. 
   Today, the U.S. national debt is $8,807,559,710,099. And for every man, woman and child in America, their share of the national debt is $29,174. Every Tuesday night, those of us in the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition take to the floor of the House to demand that we pass commonsense solutions to this problem, because it affects all of us. It's time that we restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government.

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, this Democratic House has voted twice in a fiscally responsible manner to provide this tax relief which I voted for. Unfortunately, Senate and House Republicans have sadly chosen to side with protecting tax cheats and their offshore accounts instead of siding with 23 million working families and providing them with the tax relief they deserve. 
   Abandoning our commitment to the fiscal responsibility and passing an AMT bill that is not paid for leaves our children to foot the bill to the tune of some $80 billion. 
   It is morally wrong to continue to borrow money from China and to rob the Social Security trust fund to fund our domestic needs here at home. This vote today will do just that, a vote forced on us by Senate Republicans. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this Republican tax increase on our children, grandchildren and future generations.

   Mr. ROSS. Madam Speaker, as he prepares for retirement at the end of this year, it is impossible to think about Razorback athletics and imagine what it would be like without Coach Frank Broyles. His achievements on the field are numerous and distinctive. However, it is his battle off the field that inspires me even more. In 1999, Coach Broyles' wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, needless to say, this battle changed his family forever. Studying defenses on the football field for decades prepared Coach Broyles as he looked for a way to attack perhaps his greatest challenge yet. 
   After years of caring for his wife and receiving calls and letters from supporters, he sat down and compiled his most impressive playbook ever: ``The Coach Broyles' Playbook for Alzheimer's Caregivers: A Practical Tip Guide.'' His playbook has helped countless families caring for loved ones with Alzheimer's, letting them know that their fight with this disease is not something they must face alone. In 2004, Coach Broyles' wife, Barbara Broyles, succumbed to the disease, which still has no cure. 
   His accomplishments in college football will never be forgotten, but the hope and faith he has given to families across this Nation coping with Alzheimer's will leave a lasting impact on our society for generations to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (BLUE DOGS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of talk, a lot of rhetoric about energy. We have heard a lot of partisan talk about energy. 
   You know, Congress has never been in session in August, in recent memory. It is a traditional district work period. And all the Republicans that complained about Congress adjourning for August, as it does each August, if the truth be known, if you were to look at their schedule, they had public events scheduled throughout their district in August. Why? Because they knew that Congress is traditionally not in session in August. 
   And, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, if we had stayed on the floor the whole month of August, we would be hearing a lot of the stuff we are hearing tonight. We would be hearing all this partisan bickering about energy. But instead, all 435 Members of Congress went back home to their respective districts during the month of August. And if you listen to the national press, it sounds like we were all laid up on the beach somewhere for 5 weeks. 
   The fact is, most Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle did what I did; I began the break by making a trip to Iraq to visit the 3,000 members of the Arkansas National Guard. Regardless of how we feel about what is going on in Iraq and what we should or should not be doing, it is important, not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans, that we remain united in support of our men and women in uniform. 
   So I made the trip to Iraq to visit the 3,000 members of the Arkansas National Guard. It is their second deployment in 33 months. They have gone above and beyond what has been asked of them. When that National Guard recruiter showed up, they said, ``Sign here, son, and the most you will be out of the country is once every 5 years.'' This is the Arkansas National Guard 39th Brigade's second deployment in 33 months. And I felt like the least I could do is make the trip to Iraq, let them know we support them, thank them for their service, and to make sure that some of the $16 million an hour of your tax money that is going to Iraq is being spent on the equipment and supplies that they need. 
   Then I came home to Arkansas, and during the month of August I visited something like 40 towns across my district. Most Members of Congress did the same thing during August; they were visiting their constituents. And if they did, I am sure, like me, they got an earful about the high price of gasoline. And I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress going home to their districts and getting an earful on high gasoline prices will go a lot further toward getting a commonsense energy bill passed on the floor of the United States House of Representatives than having all of us sit here and fight and bicker and act like a bunch of school-aged kids for a month. 
   And because we were home in our districts in August and because we did get an earful, I predict that we will see a commonsense energy bill passed on the floor of the House this month. The question is whether the Republicans really want to pass an energy bill, or whether they just want to try and blame the Democrats. The irony of this is they have been in control of this for the last 6 years of the White House, House, and Senate. And during that time, of course, I don't have to tell anyone what has happened with the price of gasoline. 
   So this month, I predict, on the floor of the House the Republican Members of this body will have an opportunity to help pass a bipartisan, commonsense energy bill. The question is, will they do that, or will they not do it and try to continue to use this issue and the American people as a political football? 
   I can tell you that people in my district, they work hard, they get up, they go to work, they work hard for a living, and many of them live in rural areas and they travel great distances to and from work and they are sick and tired of being a political football. They don't see this as a Democrat or a Republican energy crisis. They see it, as I do, as an American energy crisis. 
   Here is what I do know. When I was born in 1961, our Nation was 19 percent dependent on foreign oil. By the time I graduated from high school in 1979, we were 45 percent dependent on foreign oil. We are now approaching 70 percent dependency on foreign oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we go to the gas pump and when we tank up, we are indirectly putting money in the hands of the terrorists who want to harm us. That does not make any sense at all. 
   Here is what else I know. There is going to be 100 million new cars on the road in the next 8 years. 100 million new cars on the road in the next 8 years; not here; in China and India. And I don't care who tells you what, no President, no Member of Congress can change the expansion of the middle class in China and India or anywhere else in the world. 
   The second thing that I want to point out is 3 weeks ago Kurdish rebels went into Turkey and blew up an oil pipeline, halfway around the world, and yet the next day in South Arkansas we were paying more per gallon of gasoline. No President, no Member of Congress can do anything about that. 
   We can't change world demand and world circumstances, but I will tell you what we can change. We can change our domestic supply here at home. And that is why a number of us that are Democrats believe that we have got to drill here at home. 
   The Republicans say, drill and your problems are solved. Not so. The fact is, that because demand is going to continue to increase, if we do all the alternatives and renewables that are in the science lab today and bring them to the marketplace, our oil needs will still be just as great in 20 years as they are today because the demand is going to continue to increase. 
   So some say drill and your problems are solved. They are not leveling with you. Others say do alternative renewable fuels and your problems are solved. 
   They are not leveling with you, either, Mr. Speaker. I contend it is going to take all of these things. And I have a plan to accomplish that. It is called the American-Made Energy Act, and here is how it works. 
   Number one, to get us the oil we need short term we drill here at home in ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is real controversial with some, and I understand that. The truth is, there is 19 million acres in ANWR, and using new technology we only need 2,000 acres out of the 19 million to recover the oil we need. 19 million acres in ANWR at issue; the land area we need in order to drill and recover the oil that is there is 2,000 acres. Put it another way, one-sixth the size of the airport near Washington, D.C. 
   We need to drill off the coast. We need to drill where it makes sense, in the 48 continental United States, not using 1940 or 1950 technology, not even 1990 technology. My bill says that we will do it utilizing 21st century technology that can allow us to recover the oil we need and be good stewards of the environment all at the same time. 
   Here is what else it does. It generates $80 billion in lease and royalty payments to our government. $80 billion. When President Kennedy set out to put a man on the moon, in today's dollars it was a $90 billion investment, and we did a lot more than put a man on the moon. We grew a new generation of innovators in this country that went on to create many of the jobs and technologies that we enjoy today. 
   You contrast that with energy. Everybody is talking about alternative and renewable fuels, but the truth is we will spend more money in Iraq in the next 10 days than we will spend this year on research and development of new and exciting alternative and renewable forms of energy, and that is wrong. 
   I want to take the revenue from the lease and royalty payments, $80 billion, and I want to put every dime of it into making a President Kennedy ``let's go to the moon'' size investment in alternative and renewable fuels. 
   We can take automobiles that run on gas and run them on natural gas. We have a lot of natural gas in America. We have a plentiful supply of natural gas, and new areas are being found all the time. In Arkansas now we have got something called the Fayetteville Shale, and a lot of people who used to not have very much are now finding  themselves in the middle-class or even better. A lot of poor farmers, a lot of poor working families are now discovering some wealth because of the Fayetteville Shale, which is where they are recovering natural gas. 
   Now, not too long ago, they didn't know it existed. And then they knew it existed, but they didn't have the technology to recover it. And then they had the technology to recover it, but it was too costly. And then the price of natural gas went up, and, guess what. Now we are seeing this great explosion of this natural gas find in Arkansas known as the Fayetteville Shale. There is another one in Louisiana. They are both going to rival what is known as the Barnett Shale in Texas. 
   New and exciting technologies are allowing us to possibly move to natural gas powered cars. Biofuels, ethanol, cellulosic ethanol where we take the treetops and the tree limbs, add value to the land owner, and we can turn them into ethanol. The first ever cellulosic ethanol plant is being built right now in Georgia. The people building it I recently had on the panel when I hosted the first ever Arkansas Biofuels Conference at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, a forestry school located within my district. 
   Batteries, a lot of promise with batteries. Now, battery powered cars, plug-in electric cars probably won't make a lot of sense for those of us in rural areas. Last Thursday, I traveled 450 miles in my district. I represent about half of Arkansas. That is a lot of miles. Obviously, plug-in and battery powered doesn't make sense for a lot of folks that live in rural areas and drive 20 or even 50 miles each way to and from work. But you know what? For those folks in the urban areas, for those folks where we have a lot of people living, if we can transition them into battery and plug-in electric cars where they spend an hour getting 6 miles to work each day, that will reduce our Nation's need for oil and, therefore, it will reduce the price that we pay at the pump in areas where we will continue to have automobiles that run on gasoline, which comes from oil. 
   There is a lot of promise. Hydrogen fuel cell. I have test driven a hydrogen fuel cell car. It sounds like an electric golf cart, it runs like a regular car, and no pollution. And when you stop, if you take an empty cup and run to the tailpipe in time, it will pour you a half a cup of water that you can drink. This is not Star Wars stuff. This is not stuff that is even in the science lab anymore. These are ideas that are out of the science lab and ready for the marketplace. The problem is, we do not have an energy policy in this country that embraces them. 
   So that is what my plan does; it drills, it gives us the oil we need short term; it reduces the price we pay at the pump; it makes a President Kennedy ``let's go to the moon'' size investment in alternative and renewable fuels that can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs here at home. 
   Ironically, high gas prices helped get us in this economic recession, and having a President Kennedy ``let's go to the moon'' size investment in alternative and renewable energy, growing a new generation of energy innovators in this country can also help get us out of this recession. I call it my Common Sense Energy Plan for America's Future. And I am going to talk more about it a little bit later this evening, because we don't just address the high price of gasoline, we also address electricity. Because I can tell you, we have a gasoline and diesel crisis today, but we are going to have an electricity crisis as early as 2030, and it is going to be far greater and much worse than the gasoline crisis we have today, and my bill speaks to that. It is H.R. 5437, the American-Made Energy Act, and we are going to talk about it in more detail a little bit later this evening. 
   But at this time, I have got a number of Democrats that have joined me that are for new energy, they are for drilling, they are for alternatives, they are for renewables. They are for American-made energy. Again, this is not a Republican or a Democratic energy crisis, it is an American energy crisis, and we are here to say that we want to make a difference. 
   I am pleased at this time to introduce my good friend, my colleague from California, the Honorable Jim Costa.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from California for his insight, his commitment to finding a common sense to this energy crisis facing America today. And the Member from California, Mr. Costa, talked about the Blue Dogs. 
   The Blue Dog Coalition is a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that come from all over this country. There's 49 of us. And we're about trying to restore fiscal discipline, common sense and accountability to our government. 
   We're sick and tired of all the partisan bickering that goes on up in Washington. We don't care if it's a Democrat or a Republican idea. We want to know is it a common sense idea. Does it make sense for the people that send us here to be their voice at our Nation's Capital. 
   Tonight you're hearing from various members of the Blue Dog Coalition. It's not necessarily a Blue Dog position. It's Democratic positions. It's individual positions from individual Members within the Blue Dogs. 
   But you know, to listen to the Republicans tell it, you'd think Democrats aren't for drilling. We're for drilling, we're just not for giving the big oil companies a free ride to go along with it. 
   And tonight, I have got a number of my colleagues, Democratic Members of Congress, that, like me, believe that we need to drill, and we need to drill now, here at home in America to reduce the price we pay at the pump. 
   But we're not so short sighted that we stop there. We also say, take the revenue from the lease and royalty payments, and let's make the single largest investment in the history of America in alternative and renewable fuels. 
   At this time I'm pleased to yield to my colleague from Ohio, Charlie Wilson, for as much time as he desires. Not to be confused with the other Charlie Wilson. Charlie Wilson from Ohio.

   Mr. ROSS. I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio for joining us. And if you are able to stick around, we'd love to visit more about coal with you. 
   We've got at least a 225-year supply of coal here in America. Instead of saying it's bad and turning our back on it, doesn't it make sense to invest some of this $80 billion from the lease and royalty payments from drilling here at home and trying to find ways to clean it up? Coal-to-liquid. 
   We're so close to getting coal-to-liquid figured out that if we could, we wouldn't need to import another barrel of oil for 300 years in this country. I look forward to visiting more with the gentleman from Ohio about coal. In fact, I've got a coal plant being built in my district right now. Coal is not the cleanest form of energy. We all recognize that. But I can tell you this: with new technologies when this plant comes on line, it will be the cleanest new coal plant in America today. It will be plumbed, outfitted for carbon capture and sequestration, another promising technology that's currently in the science lab but getting close to being ready for the marketplace. 
   At this time, I would like to yield to my dear friend, a real leader in the United States House of Representatives from the State of Texas, and that's Nick Lampson.

   And Mr. Speaker, when I committed to doing this hour this evening on our need for energy, including drilling here at home as well as investing in alternative renewable fuels, I wasn't sure if I would be spending an hour here by myself or not. The reality is that we've got Democrats that keep filing on to the floor of the United States House of Representatives, so many so that we may not be able to get to them all in this hour. 
   These are Democrats that are demanding a new energy policy for this country, and we can only hope the Republicans will join us in passing one in a bipartisan way. We're here to reach out to the Republicans and say, This is not a Democrat or Republican energy crisis, it's an American energy crisis. Let's solve it together. 
   I'm pleased now to yield to a brand new Member of Congress, all the way from Mississippi, who's brought a good dose of commonsense and fresh air to Washington with him, and that's my friend Travis Childers.

They are Democrats who share a common vision, a common plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to create new jobs here at home, to drill here at home, to take the lease and royalty payments to invest in alternative and renewable fuels which will create new jobs here at home, all of which, of course, will lower the price we pay at the pump. 
   We invite Republicans to join us. It's H.R. 5437, the American-Made Energy Act. It's a bipartisan bill. I hope Republicans will support it as well as they will support these other bills mentioned this evening.

If the Republicans will do that, if they will come to the table and will sit down and will talk to us and with us instead of at us, I promise you, Mr. Speaker, we will pass a commonsense energy plan for America, a plan that will reduce the price we pay at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, as on most Tuesday evenings when Congress is in session, I rise on behalf of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. We are a group of 47 conservative to moderate Democrats that simply want to come here, put an end to the partisan bickering, and restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   This evening, as we begin this hour-long conversation, we are going to focus on Iraq, and specifically we are going to focus on how your tax dollars are being spent in Iraq. 
   You have heard a lot of talk this evening about Iraq. And I can assure you as long as we have our men and women in uniform in harm's way, we are going to support them. They are doing everything that has been asked of them and then some. My brother-in-law is in the U.S. Air Force. He has been in the region several times. My first cousin is in the U.S. Army, and he is in Iraq this evening. It has affected all of us in one way or another. We have all had family or friends serve there. 
   This evening we are going to specifically focus on how your tax money is being spent in Iraq. For the last 5 years, the President has pretty much asked for a blank check, and if you ask him to be held accountable for how your tax money is spent in Iraq, he will tell you that you are unpatriotic. It is time that we stood up to this President and demanded the kind of accountability on how your tax money is being spent in Iraq just as we demand accountability from local and State governments when they receive a Federal grant. To put it another way, $16 million of your tax money is being spent in Iraq every hour; $16 million of your tax money is being spent in Iraq every hour. That is $16 million an hour that can't go to replace the bridge in Minnesota that fell. And, by the way, there are thousands more structurally deficient bridges in this country, and this should have been a wake-up call for all of us to get about the business of rebuilding this Nation's infrastructure and begin to invest in America again. 
   Just in my congressional district during the month of August, some people think we go home and go on vacation for a month, but what we really do is we go home and see the people, which I think is an important part of this job. If you are going to represent folks, I think it is important you get out of Washington and you go home and you see them. And as I traveled my 29 counties and 150 towns in Arkansas's Fourth Congressional District, every town I went to I learned of a project, of a need. On the western side, they want to finish I-49, which can create jobs and economic opportunities. An interstate where construction started on it back when I was about 5 years old entering kindergarten. I am now 46 and have a daughter in college. 
   When I go to the eastern side of my district, I hear a lot of talk about wanting to complete I-69, which was announced 5 years before I was born. In the central part of the district, I hear a lot of talk about four-laning U.S. 82, four-laning 167, how we need money to invest in getting off the Sparta aquifer and having more and more commercial and residential people getting their water from other alternative water sources. As I traveled and toured Millwood Lake, I learned about how this wonderful recreational lake, a lake that contributed to the economy, it is now becoming very difficult to fish in about a quarter of it and they are worried about the rest of it. Why? Because of the neglect. The neglect in our Nation's infrastructure, the neglect in our waterways, in our highways. And yet we continue to spend $16 million an hour of your tax money in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, I say it is time to start investing in America again, and we are going to talk more about that this evening. 
   During the past 6 years, we have had a President that has given us the largest debt ever in our Nation's history, the largest deficit ever in our Nation's history, for the past 6 years, during the time that we had Republicans controlling the White House, the House and the Senate. We have passed a budget this year that will put us back in balance by 2012 and will begin to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government. 
   But this is what the new Democratic majority inherited in January: a debt that is $8,993,600,200,089 and some change. That is a big number. What does it mean? If you break it out and divide it by every man, woman and child living in America, including those born today, each one of us, our share of the national debt: $29,704. It is what those of us in the Blue Dog Coalition refer to as the ``debt tax,'' d-e-b-t, which is one tax that cannot be repealed, that cannot be cut. And that is one of the reasons that we are not able to invest in America's priorities, investing in our homeland, investing in our veterans, investing in education, investing in rebuilding America's infrastructure. No. We are too busy paying interest on this debt. 
   Our Nation is borrowing about a billion dollars a day, but before we borrow a billion dollars today, we are going to spend a half billion today paying interest on the debt we have already got. That is above and beyond the $16 million an hour that we are sending to Iraq, much of which goes unaccounted for. 
   So we are going to spend this hour addressing that and other issues surrounding Iraq. And I am absolutely delighted to be joined by a number of my Blue Dog colleagues. I mentioned there are 47 members in the Blue Dog Coalition, and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the four newest members: CHRISTOPHER CARNEY from Pennsylvania's Tenth Congressional District, GABRIELLE GIFFORDS from Arizona's Eighth Congressional District, BART GORDON from Tennessee's Sixth Congressional District, and ZACH SPACE from Ohio's Eighteenth Congressional District. 
   At this time I am pleased to yield to a fellow Blue Dog, someone who has become very involved in this conservative-moderate Democratic movement on Capitol Hill, someone who is not afraid to take a stand for what is right, and that is my friend JOE DONNELLY from Indiana's Second Congressional District.

   Mr. ROSS. You mentioned something that really piqued my interest, and that is making sure that we are providing our soldiers with the best technology in armored vests. And I want to thank you for raising that this evening. 
   I've got a constituent in my district whose son is getting ready to go back for the second time, Arkansas National Guard, 39th Brigade, being asked to go back for a second time. And when you sign up for the National Guard, you're supposed to spend 1 year out of 5, and now they were there in 2003 and 2004, they're being asked to go back again by Christmas of this year or early next year. And he raises a very important issue. This is a constituent from Garland County in Pearcy, Arkansas, near Hot Springs, and that is, he wants to ensure that our men and women in uniform, his son, has the best armored body gear and protection available. There are a lot of tests going on right now; there is a lot of debate going on. There have been hearings on this in the Congress. But 5 years into this war you would think, if our government, if this administration is sending $16 million an hour of your tax money to Iraq, the very least they could do is ensure that our brave men and women, our soldiers that do everything that is asked of them, have the very best in body gear and protection.

   And regardless of how you feel about what's going on in Iraq, and I personally have voted three times for a new direction in Iraq, but one of the things that I think we can all agree on is that we need more accountability for how our tax money is being spent in Iraq. And we need to ensure that money is going to provide our men and women in uniform with the very best equipment that's available to them today, not what was the best equipment 5 years ago, but what is the best equipment today to best protect them as they perform their duty and service to our country. And that's one thing that we can all agree on. 
   At this time, I'm pleased to introduce another fellow Blue Dog, a new Member in his first term in the 110th session of Congress who is rapidly and quickly becoming very involved and immersed in the fiscal issues of the Blue Dog Coalition, and that's my friend, Mr. Mike Arcuri from New York's 24th Congressional District, who just returned from a trip to Iraq.

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from New York for his insight on his recent return from a trip to Iraq. 
   I was last there August 11, 2004, when we had the 39th Brigade from Arkansas' National Guard there. Now they're ready to go back, and I hope to be able to go back while they're there because the least we can do is go there when our troops are there from our respective districts and let them know that we support them and make sure that some of this millions of dollars is being spent on providing them the very best equipment that technology and money can afford to buy. 
   What we're talking about this evening is the cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The gentleman from New York is absolutely correct, we need a new direction in Iraq. Basically, we're there fighting their civil war for them. And as long as they're shooting at us instead of shooting at one another, there is no incentive for them to learn how to get along. No one fought our Civil War for us, and I'm absolutely convinced that the only people that can decide the fate of Iraq are the Iraqi people. 
   We have had a lot of victories there. We went there because of weapons of mass destruction. We now know there are no weapons of mass destruction. It's debatable whether there ever was or not, but that's an issue that we can debate all night. But hindsight is 20/20. We stayed until Saddam was removed from power. We stayed until he was brought to justice and executed. Clearly, he was an evil dictator. We have evil dictators all over the world, many of whom remain in power today. We stayed until a new Iraqi Government was installed. We stayed and tried to train their police and military force. And yet this administration continues to move the goal post on our soldiers. And so how many victories are they going to have to accomplish before we allow them to come home and allow the Iraq people to decide the fate of their own country? 
   The cost of Operation Iraqi Freedom, this is one statistic that is not debatable. You want to know how well it's going? In 2003, we spent $53 billion of your tax money in Iraq. In 2004, that increased to $75.9 billion. In 2005, that increased to $84.7 billion. In 2006, that increased to $101.7 billion. And in 2007, $135.2 billion so far. The administration is getting ready to come back here shortly for more. That's $11.3 billion a month, that's $370 million a day. You do the math. That's between 15 and $16 million an hour of your tax money going to Iraq and, as Congressman Donnelly mentioned, much of which is unaccounted for. 
   At this time, I yield to my friend, fellow Blue Dog member from my neighboring State of Tennessee, and that's Lincoln Davis, an active member of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition that's never afraid to speak his mind. We're glad to have him here with us this evening. And sorry about Tennessee's loss this Saturday. We're looking forward to playing y'all in football.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. He raises an excellent point. All this started after 9/11, and we all know Osama bin Laden was responsible for 9/11. We now have some 25,000 troops in the Afghanistan region. Contrast that to be a quarter million troops in the Iraq region. Eighty-something percent of the people in Afghanistan want us there. Contrast that with Iraq. 71 percent of the Iraqi people don't want us there, and 60 percent of them think it is okay to kill a U.S. soldier. I believe it is time for a new direction in Iraq. Three times this year I have voted for a new direction in Iraq. 
   Let me be perfectly clear: As long as we have got troops in harm's way, I am going to support them. As I indicated, my brother-in-law is in the Air Force. He has been in the region. My first cousin is in the U.S. Army and is back for the second time in Iraq right now. 
   Back home in Arkansas, young people I have taught in Sunday school and duck hunted with will soon be going back for a second tour of duty in Iraq. I will be there every step of the way to support them. But I also want this administration and this Congress to give them a mission that is obtainable, one that will take them out of harm's way. 
   I have had too many soldiers from my district die in Iraq. Just in the last few weeks, Specialist Donovan Witham from Malvern, Arkansas, gave his life in Iraq. Just a few days ago, I was able to spend some time with his family in their living room letting them know that his service to this country will not be forgotten. I will make sure of that. His family remains in my heart and in my prayers, as do all the family members of the nearly 4,000 troops that we have lost in Iraq.

   Mr. ROSS. I appreciate the gentleman joining me and his commitment to our brave men and women in uniform. I thank the President for going to Iraq. He was there, I think it was his third trip, he was there for a few hours. I spent a day in Iraq. You have been several times. I think it is important that we go and we let our soldiers know we support them and make sure some of this money over there is being spent on them and providing them the best equipment that money can buy. They deserve nothing less. 
   But the type of folks that I think the President needs to spend a lot more time listening to are the type of Members of Congress that have served in the military, like Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania. Patrick, not too long ago, was known as Captain Murphy and spent not a few hours in Iraq, but a few months in Iraq, nearly a year. Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional District, a fellow Blue Dog member who helped write H.R. 97, which is a bill endorsed by the Blue Dog Coalition to provide for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability to ensure that this $16 million an hour of your tax money, Mr. Speaker, which is going to Iraq, is being spent on our soldiers. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman-Captain Patrick Murphy.

   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening on behalf of the 44-member fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition. Each week we come to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to discuss with you and the people of this Congress, Mr. Speaker, about the need to restore fiscal discipline and common sense to our national government. 
   We speak of the need for accountability. Why? Because today the U.S. national debt is $8,710,232,192,210; and, we ran out of room on the poster, but if you want to be exact about it, 43 cents. And for every man, woman, and child living in America today, their share of the national debt as of tonight is $29,061.20. It is what those of us in  the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition refer to as the debt tax, D-E-B-T, which is one tax that will never go away until we get our fiscal house in order. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you walk the halls of Congress, it is easy to detect when you are walking by an office of a fellow Blue Dog member, because you will see this poster reminding Members of Congress and reminding the American people of the fiscal recklessness that we have witnessed all across this Nation for the past 6 years. The American people have spoken, the American people have given the Democrats an opportunity to lead this Chamber, and we are determined as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition to getting our Nation's fiscal house in order and restoring fiscal discipline and common sense to our national government. 
   The Blue Dog Coalition is about accountability. And, Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, on Tuesday, many members of the Blue Dog Coalition will be filing a resolution for the 110th Congress, a resolution providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability. I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Patrick Murphy) for his work on this, a veteran of the Iraqi war who will be joining us later this evening on the floor. 
   This evening, as members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we plan to talk about providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability. You ask people what they think about this postwar Iraq policy, you ask 100 people, you get 100 different ideas about how we ought to do it. One thing is for sure, everybody believes that we need to move in a new direction. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that really makes me proud to be an American is that, unlike Vietnam, and I believe one of the painful lessons to come out of Vietnam is this time, this time at least, we are getting the support for soldier part of this right, because I see us all, not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans first. And what I have witnessed this time around has been truly amazing and has made me proud to be an American, and that is that everyone, regardless of how they feel about the war in Iraq, regardless of whether they are a Democrat or a Republican, everyone in America for the most part has stood united in support of our men and women in uniform. 
   I couldn't help but notice the plane I was on today from Little Rock to Atlanta had about a half dozen soldiers heading to Iraq, and I had the opportunity to shake their hand and thank them for their service to our country. I noticed others doing the same when I was changing planes in Atlanta. There were a lot of soldiers today in Atlanta headed for Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, personally I am opposed to this surge. I think that is not a new direction, I think it is more of the same. But as members of the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, we didn't take a position on that because everyone needs to represent the views of their district, and everyone needs to speak from their heart. 
   We have approached this, Mr. Speaker, from an accountability standpoint. And, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read to you this resolution so you will know exactly what is in it, and you will know exactly what the fiscally conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition stands for and what we are talking about, and then a number of Blue Dog fellow members will be joining me in this Special Order to discuss various aspects of this. 
   But resolution providing for Operation Iraqi Freedom cost accountability says: 
   Whereas it has been nearly 4 years since Operation Iraqi Freedom began; 
   Whereas our military personnel have performed with honor and bravery, and deserve the support of all Americans; 
   Whereas more than 3,000 American military personnel have been killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and more than 20,000 have been injured; 
   Whereas the United States has spent nearly $400 billion in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom; 
   Whereas the United States has spent tens of billions of dollars paying private contractors for services performed in Operation Iraqi Freedom; 
   Whereas government investigations and media reports have detailed waste, fraud, and possible war profiteering by some of these contractors; 
   Whereas American taxpayers deserve a detailed cost accounting for funds spent in Operation Iraqi Freedom; 
   Whereas instead of the normal budgetary process, the administration has used emergency supplemental appropriation bills to fund Operation Iraqi Freedom; 
   Whereas the normal appropriations process gives Congress greater oversight concerning both the need for and use of budgeted funds; 
   Whereas the annual need to budget substantial funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom is not unanticipated within the meaning of section 502 of the fiscal year 2007 budget resolution, and further funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom should be attained through the normal budgeting process; 
   Whereas since coalition forces removed Saddam Hussein from power, success in Operation Iraqi Freedom has depended upon an active and effective partnership between coalition forces and the Government and people of Iraq, a partnership that provides indispensable leverage to the coalition's financial, military, and political investments; 
   Whereas Iraqis must assume principal responsibility for internally policing Iraq, failing which past, present, and future coalition investments will not lead to security in Iraq and Iraq will dissolve in chaos. 
   Let me read that again: Whereas Iraqis must assume principal responsibility for internally policing Iraq, failing which past, present, and future coalition investments will not lead to security in Iraq and Iraq will dissolve in chaos. In other words, we are in this together, and it is time for the Iraqi people to step up to the plate and assume more accountability and responsibility for the internal policing of Iraq. 
   Now, therefore, be it resolved that; and this is what the Blue Dog Coalition's accountability measure is about: Within 30 days after the adoption of this resolution, and every 90 days thereafter, the Department of Defense Inspector General and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction shall prepare and transmit to Congress an unclassified report, but with a classified annex if necessary, that would contain: 
   Number 1. A detailed accounting of how military and reconstruction funds in Iraq have been spent thus far; $400 billion of tax money from the hardworking people of America has gone to Iraq, and they deserve to know how that money has been spent in support of our men and women in uniform in support of this new Iraqi Government; 
   Number 2. A detailed accounting of the types and terms of contracts awarded on behalf of the United States, including the methods by which such contracts were awarded and contractors selected; 
   Our cities and counties all across this Nation are expected to advertise for bids and award bids based on the lowest bid they receive for services rendered for what they are looking for. Our Federal Government should not be any different. 
   Number 3. A description of the efforts to obtain support and assistance from other countries toward the rehabilitation of Iraq; 
   And, number 4. An assessment of what additional funding is needed to complete military operations and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including a plan for security of Iraq, a detailed plan for how any future funds will be spent, and a statement of how those funds will advance the interests of the United States in Iraq. 
   That is one point. 
   The second point: 
   If either Inspector General fails to submit a quarterly report, the Government Accountability Office shall conduct an audit and report to Congress. 
   Sanctions shall be imposed against contractors who have engaged in fraud or abuse or war profiteering. 
   Congress should create a Truman Committee to conduct an ongoing study and investigation of the awarding and carrying out of contracts by the United States to conduct activities with regard to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and make such recommendations to the House as the select committee deems appropriate. 
   Funding requests for Operation Iraqi Freedom in fiscal year 2008 and beyond must come through the regular appropriations process, and not through so-called emergency supplementals.  
   No more hiding the cost of the war. 
   In furtherance of the partnership that is critical to success in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the administration should firmly condition further American financial, military, and political resources upon steady improvement in Iraqi assumption of principal responsibility for internally policing Iraq.     
   That is the resolution that many members of the Blue Dog Coalition will be filing, a resolution endorsed by the 44-member strong, fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, with the Clerk of the House on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. I just read it in detail, word by word, so the American people, Mr. Speaker, will know exactly what it is that we are offering up. 
   It is not complicated. It is not partisan. It is not about whether we should or should not be in Iraq and about whether we should or should not leave tonight or tomorrow, next month or next year. It is about being accountable for the $400 billion that has already been spent in Iraq, and God knows how much more will be spent in Iraq, and the American people, the hardworking people of this country that get up, go to work, work hard and pay taxes, deserve to know and have a full accounting for how their money is being spent in Iraq. 
   That is what this resolution is all about. It is what the Blue Dog Coalition is all about. It is about standing for responsibility, transparency and accountability and in getting our Nation's fiscal house in order so we can see this number, Mr. Speaker, the national debt, begin to trend downward, because as long as we are spending a half a billion dollars a day paying interest on the debt we have already got, before we increase it another billion dollars a day, many of America's priorities will continue to go unmet. 
   We have got to get our fiscal house in order because, you know what, coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the world is a whole new generation of veterans. It is our duty in these United States to be there in support of our veterans, to be there in support of our men and women in uniform, regardless of whether they are serving us in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere across the globe. 
   We can have differences of opinion with the President on Iraq and his Iraq policy, but what makes me proud to be an American is that we are standing together in support of our men and women in uniform. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have got a number of folks that have joined me this evening to talk about accountability in this Iraq War, and at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott).

   Mr. ROSS. I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Arcuri), a new Member of this Congress, a new member of the Blue Dog Coalition, for coming and visiting with us this evening about the need for accountability and responsibility in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, the Blue Dog Coalition is about fiscal responsibility. It is about restoring common sense and fiscal discipline to our Nation's government, not only here at home, but also in Iraq. And that is why this week the Blue Dog Coalition will file a resolution that its coalition, the Blue Dog members, have endorsed to demand accountability in Iraq. 
   We read the resolution in its entirety at the beginning of this Special Order. Basically, we want a detailed accounting of how military and reconstruction funds in Iraq have been spent thus far, a detailed accounting of the types and terms of contracts awarded on behalf of the United States, including the methods by which such contracts were awarded and contractors selected; a description of efforts to obtain support and assistance from other countries toward the rehabilitation of Iraq. The U.S. should not be going this alone; an assessment of what additional funding is needed to complete military operations and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including a plan for security in Iraq; a detailed plan for how any future funds will be spent; and a statement of how those funds will advance the interests of the United States in Iraq. Sanctions shall be imposed against contractors who have engaged in fraud or abuse or, yes, war profiteering. 
   We are calling for the creation of a Truman-like committee commissioned to conduct an ongoing study and investigation of the awarding and carrying out of contracts by the United States to conduct activities with regard to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and make such recommendations to the House as the select committee deems appropriate. 
   Funding requests for Operation Iraqi Freedom in fiscal year 2008 and beyond must come through the regular appropriation process, not through the so-called emergency supplementals; no more of not being accountable; no more hiding the true cost of the war. 
   And finally, the administration should firmly condition further American financial, military and political resources upon steady improvement in Iraqi assumption of principal responsibility for internally policing Iraq. 
   Now, why are we filing this resolution? Because our Nation has now spent over $400 billion, nearly a half a trillion, in Iraq. Total for 2006, $100.4 billion; for the month, $8.44 billion; the cost per day, $275 million. And, Mr. Speaker, yes, each hour we are sending $11,458,333 of your tax money to Iraq. And we believe it is time for this Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to provide oversight on how this money is being spent. 
   I yield to my fellow Blue Dog member from California Mr. Costa.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I don't really know where to begin. My wife is a pharmacist. We own a family pharmacy back home in Prescott, Arkansas. Just minutes ago she shared with me by telephone that she had to turn her television set off because she has heard so many untruths and misinformation coming from the Republican side of the aisle during this debate here today. 
   But let me be clear about this: A ``yes'' vote for the motion to recommit is a vote for the big drug manufacturers, and a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit is a vote for America's seniors. Now, today we are trying to correct a wrong that occurred back in 2003. Let us reflect back for a moment. 
   We passed the so-called Medicare part D prescription drug benefit back in 2003, some 500 pages, gave us less than a day to read it and somewhere around 50 or 60, they actually, the Republican leadership actually put language in the bill that says the Federal Government shall be prohibited from negotiating with the big drug manufacturers to bring down the high cost to medicine for America's seniors. 
   That is in the bill, and that is what today we are fixing, and then, to be sure the big drug manufacturers would not have to lower their prices, the Republican leadership back in 2003, they decided that they would spread all 43 million Medicare beneficiaries, over 30 companies, offering more than 1,200 private plans, so no plan and no company would be able to negotiate on behalf of very many seniors. That is what they did. 
   Now we know, Mr. Speaker, now we know why back in 2003 the vote on this occurred at 3:00 in the morning. Now we know why the vote took 3 hours for passage. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, we are letting the sun shine on our seniors, and on the way we conduct business in this Chamber as we hold the big drug manufacturers accountable and bring down the high cost of medicine for America's seniors.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 668, a resolution honoring and recognizing the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine. First, I would like to thank Chairman Conyers for his support and leadership in moving this resolution from the Judiciary Committee to the floor of the United States House of Representatives. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, which honors the anniversary of the nine students who gained national attention 50 years ago when Little Rock Central High School was integrated. 
   Little Rock Central High School found itself in the spotlight of the entire Nation on September 25, 1957, when nine students escorted by the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army walked up the front steps and integrated the school. 
   The names of these nine individuals are barely recognizable alone, but collectively as the Little Rock Nine they gained national attention for their strength and unified determination to make our public schools a place where everyone can learn regardless of race.     
   This resolution honors their courage by commemorating the 50th anniversary of desegregation of Little Rock Central High School and encourages all Americans to recognize the historic contributions of the Little Rock Nine, who not only secured integration for Little Rock Central High School, but for hundreds of thousands of schools across our country. 
   Tomorrow marks the 50th anniversary of this historic event, and I'm also proud to be taking part in the celebration of this civil rights achievement through the dedication of a permanent Little Rock Central High School Museum and Visitors Center. I'll be joined tomorrow by many of my colleagues, including the Arkansas congressional delegation, Congressmen JOHN BOOZMAN, MARION BERRY and VIC SNYDER. 
   The Little Rock Nine have been acknowledged with numerous awards and recognitions, including the 2007 Little Rock Central High School desegregation 50th anniversary commemorative coin, one of only two such coins that are done annually. And I want to thank my good friend from Arkansas, Congressman VIC SNYDER for leading the effort in securing this as one of the two coins for this year. They've also been recognized for the Congressional Gold Medal. That was back in 1999. This resolution adds one more recognition to this important group of individuals. 
   As we memorialize their legacies of bravery so that future generations of Americans will forever know their struggle, we can never forget the sacrifices endured by these nine individuals for the sake of progress on behalf of millions. The Little Rock Nine are symbolic of the victorious dismantling of school segregation, and as such, I am proud to cosponsor this resolution honoring their contributions, and I urge my fellow colleagues to vote in favor of it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROSS. (FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to try to bring about some common sense to a Federal agency known to many as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and known to others as FEMA. 
   Many of you will recall, Mr. Speaker, that after that horrible hurricane that devastated the Gulf Coast, Hurricane Katrina, back in August of 2005, FEMA went out and purchased tens of thousands of brand new mobile homes that were destined for storm victims after Hurricane Katrina. 
   They came to Hope, Arkansas. We have got the old World War II proving grounds there, an old airport there with a lot of inactive runways and tarmacs, and they thought it was a good place to have as a so-called FEMA staging area, a place for them to bring mobile homes in transit on their way to storm victims on the gulf coast. 
   Starting about October of 2005, they started arriving, and they continued to arrive, but none ever left. And this quickly became not a FEMA staging area but, rather, a FEMA storage area. 
   This is an aerial photo that was taken this past Saturday, and these white dots, I mean, it is hard to understand and comprehend, but as you look at this aerial photo, what you are looking at is 8,420 brand new, fully furnished, never used, mobile homes that were destined for Hurricane Katrina victims that found themselves homeless. 
   FEMA purchased them, and then they said, we won't put a mobile home in a flood plain. And of course, everybody who lost their home as a result of Hurricane Katrina lived in a flood plain. So they have remained stored at the airport in Hope, Arkansas, on this cow pasture, if you will, since about October of 2005; 8,420 brand new, fully furnished mobile homes. 
   There is also approximately 16,000 camper trailers at the Hope airport. The camper trailers did work. They were used by storm victims, and they are now bringing them back to Hope. And if they need more than $1,500 worth of repair, they are auctioning them off. If they can repair them for less than $1,500, they are going to repair them there at the Hope airport and store them for future disasters. That is being a good steward of your tax money. That mission, that program makes a lot of sense. 
   My problem with FEMA is this: There are 8,420 brand new, fully furnished, never used mobile homes sitting there, as you can see from this aerial photo, at the Hope airport in Hope, Arkansas. Now, let's fast forward. 
   Well, one other point I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, is, about 8 months ago, to try to get FEMA off high center and to move these homes to the people, I said they are going to start sinking into the cow pasture, thinking that would get FEMA off high center and they would move them to the storm victims. 
   Instead, FEMA showed up at Hope with $7 million worth of gravel to put under them. I mean, this is so crazy, you can't make this stuff up. 
   And then, fast forward, tragically to February 24, 12 days ago, where a tornado ripped through another part of my district, not Hope, Arkansas, but Dumas, Arkansas in DeSha County. 
   This is one of 150 homes that have been either totally destroyed or heavily damaged. If there is any doubt about the amount of damage done, this is the Fred's Dollar Store and the grocery store in town and an 18-wheeler. 
   The bottom line is this: I immediately went to Dumas to be with the people there. I told them help was on the way. The Governor declared it a State disaster. The Governor called out 150 members of the National Guard; 150 homes heavily damaged or destroyed, 650 people out of work because their workplace has been heavily damaged or destroyed. No power for 6 days. 
   And I asked FEMA to help; 12 days later, the President still has not declared Dumas and DeSha County a Federal disaster area. 
   And what does the FEMA spokesman, John Philbin, say? March 7, 2007, Stephens Washington Bureau, in a story by Aaron Sadler, FEMA spokesman, John Philbin, says, ``The damages or need for Federal assistance are not readily apparent.'' If that is not damage that is readily apparent, I don't know what it is. 
   I implore the President to declare Dumas and DeSha County a Federal disaster area. And I beg FEMA to begin to move some of these mobile homes to the people of Dumas who are without housing this evening.
