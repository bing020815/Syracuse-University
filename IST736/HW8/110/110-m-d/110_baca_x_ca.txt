<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I speak on behalf of the 12 to 14 million immigrants in the United States. 
   Throughout history, America has been a Nation of immigrants. For decades, immigrants have contributed with their heart, sweat, and tears to have the American dream like the rest of us. 
   Immigrant families continue to pay property taxes in the form of rent, pay sales taxes on every purchase, and most importantly, contribute to Social Security without legally having any claim to any of it. Yet, there are those who wish to downplay these positive contributions for political gain. 
   You don't see many local governments turning away taxes paid by undocumented immigrants. However, you do see local governments spending these tax dollars to create anti-immigration legislation that strip away families of basic services. 
   I urge my colleagues to get past the anti-immigrant myths and look at the facts about the true positive contributions of immigrants. 
   We must stand firm and pass comprehensive immigration reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (PRIMARY LATERAL SCLEROSIS AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 896, the Primary Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month Act. I would like to thank Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Nathan Deal, along with Mr. Terry, for helping guide this legislation through the committee. 
   Primary lateral sclerosis, commonly referred to as PLS, is a neurological disorder that affects the cells that control the voluntary muscles. PLS is similar to ALS, often called Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   Can you imagine someone who is diagnosed with PLS, but yet they are told that it is ALS and in fact it was PLS that they were diagnosed, and thinking that they only had X amount of time to live, its impact it has on the family members and others as they begin to look at that disease because not enough research has been done? That is devastating to the individuals and the family members who are diagnosed. That is why it is important that we do the research. 
   This illness is, of course, named after the famous Yankee baseball player who suffered and died of ALS before we knew much about it. As with many other neurological disorders, once the nerve cells that control the voluntary muscles are affected, a person's physical ability to function becomes very difficult. 
   Symptoms of PLS include difficulties with balance, sudden involuntary muscle spasms in the hands, feet, legs, and speech problems when the facial muscles are affected. But these symptoms are not unique to PLS alone. PLS is often very difficult to diagnose because the symptoms vary, and may progress slowly over a period of time of many years. I would rather have someone be diagnosed with the right PLS versus ALS to know that they are going to live a lot longer. 
   Because of this, many Americans are still unaware of the severe nature of PLS, even though the disorder was first discovered in 1850 in France. That is why we need to continue with greater and more expansive research. 
   My resolution serves to raise awareness across the Nation by urging all Americans to recognize February of 2009 as PLS Awareness Month. This resolution emphasizes the need of greater funding and more research to combat neuromuscular disease. With this bill, Congress is helping educate our doctors and nurses and the rest of the medical community about PLS. 
   However, there are many courageous and dedicated individuals who are doing this already. 
   One is my good friend, Hardy Brown, who is from my district and, of course, owner of the Black Voice Newspaper in California. He has dedicated his life to serve as a voice for underrepresented communities in the Inland Empire. Throughout his life, Hardy Brown has done a tremendous job in the community raising awareness of Lou Gehrig's disease. Now he is diagnosed with PLS. Hardy Brown, once a vibrant, active leader, is now in a wheelchair doing what he can despite difficulties moving, speaking, and typing. 
   Another individual, Tyonja Bathgate from Maryland, whose husband was diagnosed with PLS, has torn herself from her husband's bedside to advocate on behalf of this issue. 
   We want to thank these individuals and all others who have worked to raise the awareness of these conditions. But we must do more, and urging the establishment of a PLS Awareness Month is a step in the right direction. There is currently no cure for PLS, and hopefully one day we will find a cure. God willing, we will do that. 
   Treatment and symptoms vary from person to person, and the age of onset is generally between the ages of 35 to 66, and, as it was stated, over 2,000 have been diagnosed with this.     
   Because of the similar symptoms, researchers believe that PLS patients are often diagnosed with ALS, and I have already stated the effects it has on families when they are told that. 
   Most of us have heard of Lou Gehrig's disease, but this legislation today will help raise the awareness and stress the importance of a very familiar disorder. The medical community must be able to properly diagnose those individuals who suffer from PLS and other neuromuscular disease to ensure proper care and treatment. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H. Res. 896, and join me and all individuals and organizations in this effort to fight this devastating illness. And I want to thank again Mr. Pallone, Mr. Terry for helping us with this legislation and many of the others that will support this to make sure that not many other individuals suffer from this type of disease that will affect others as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. 
   I'd like to thank my colleagues, Congressman Tanner and Congressman Abercrombie, for their hard work on this issue and their dedication to a new direction forward in Iraq. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3087. 
   Mr. Speaker, a change of course in Iraq is long overdue. 
   The cost of this war is already too high. America has spent over $455 billion and lost more than 3,700 lives in Iraq. 
   This responsible legislation would require the President and senior administration officials to develop and submit a comprehensive redeployment strategy to Congress within 60 days, and every 90 days thereafter. 
   Additionally, this bill recognizes that the U.S. Armed Forces and U.S. civilians have worked valiantly, and that it is time for Iraq to manage its future. 
   The bill also notes that when Congress authorized military force in 2002, it was concerned about an Iraqi government that has since been removed from power. 
   The brave men and women of America's armed forces have served their country valiantly and will continue to do so. 
   But it is time to bring them home from Iraq. 
   We must refocus our mission on the global threat of terrorism. 
   As a veteran, I voted against this war in 2002 because no one could convince me why we needed to be there. 
   Now, after five years of the President's failed policies, Congress must take action. 
   I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for a new direction in Iraq and for the future security of America, and support H.R. 3087.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I speak on behalf of the 12 to 14 million immigrants here in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, the memory of Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez will always remain in our hearts. Gutierrez, an undocumented immigrant who came here as an orphan from Guatemala, graduated from high school despite many obstacles. While in community college, he enlisted as a marine to show his patriotism and love for this Nation. 
   On March 31, 2003, Gutierrez became the first combat casualty of the war of Iraq. His belief in the American dream of a better life is a testament of what many others who come to this country wish to have. Gutierrez will forever be a symbol of patriotism, hard work, and commitment. 
   Sadly, his sacrifices are lost in the hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric. Every day, 12 to 14 million immigrants work from sunset to sundown to reach the American dream--all positively contributing to America's economic health. 
   I urge my colleagues to keep in mind these contributions and make a firm commitment to work towards comprehensive immigration reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I support the Children's Health Insurance Program Act. 
   It's a shame that we live in the richest country of the world, yet 3.8 million children are uninsured. 33,000 of these children are in my District. 
   This bill is not about politics, it's about helping hardworking families and the poorest among us. 
   Leaving children uninsured is unacceptable. With health care costs going up, working families are on the edge. Expanding coverage is the only solution. 
   I am disappointed that this bill does not cover pregnant women and children who are legal permanent residents. This is a health care issue, not an immigration issue. 
   A simple pre-natal exam can detect future complications and prevent costly visits to the emergency room. This would save tax payers millions of dollars in the end. 
   No mother who is working here legally and paying taxes should have to choose between buying baby formula and taking her infant to the doctor. 
   No child should die from a sore throat or be denied access to lifesaving treatments. It costs less than $3.50 a day to cover a child through SCHIP. 
   This is not the time to play politics, our children must come first. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1400, the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act of 2007. 
   With this bill, the United States will have the tools to persuade Iran's Government to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. 
   We are sending a strong message to the world. We will not tolerate violations of the Genocide Convention. This bill calls for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to be brought before the International Court of Justice for his repeated calls for the destruction of Israel. 
   We will continue to use diplomatic methods to stand tough and protect our allies abroad. This bill ends all Iranian imports to the United States and restricts U.S. exports to Iran to strictly food and medicine. 
   I also believe economic pressure is an effective deterrence. This bill prevents U.S. subsidiaries of foreign oil companies that are sanctioned for investing in Iran's oil sector from receiving U.S. tax benefits for oil and gas exploration. 
   Iran will not violate rules and go unnoticed. This bill also encourages the administration to prohibit all Iranian state-owned banks from using the U.S. banking system. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2642. 
   This bill calls for a responsible redeployment from Iraq; and forces the Administration to answer for its actions. 
   The cost of this war continues to devastate America. 
   This bill includes $96.6 billion in funding, but not without accountability. 
   This bill includes funds to equip our troops. You would not have a surgeon perform a surgery without proper tools; we must not send our patriotic Americans to war without the proper equipment. 
   This bill will increase transparency in our relationship with Iraq, and redirects the voice of America back to Congress, not the Administration, and pass on the cost of future reconstruction of Iraq back to the hands of the Iraqi people. 
   I believe our troops and their families should be our first priority. 
   The cost of this war comes in many forms, including unexpected costs for our military families. Just like World War II veterans, our soldiers returning from overseas will now have a GI bill that keeps America's promise of an education to them. 
   With the costs of the war rising, the costs of oil skyrocketing, and the number of foreclosures hitting emergency levels, many working families are facing uphill battles. Congress must not just stand by and watch. 
   This bill includes emergency provisions for harmful Medicaid cuts and an extension on the devastated unemployment compensation program for working families. 
   From my District alone, this war has cut short the lives of 13 young men and has brought back hundreds of injured soldiers. 
   The cost of this war is too high both at home and overseas; our families are hanging on by a thread. I urge my colleagues to bring our troops home and support H.R. 2642.

   This was a very difficult decision. I have only had to vote on a few issues that have caused me so much difficulty. One being my vote against the war in Iraq. The same difficulty is here today. 
   Today's votes will decide the future for the Lumbee tribe. 
   However, H.R. 65 determines the future of many more individuals, such as the entire Native American Community and our Nation as a whole. 
   There is too much information arguing both for and against giving Federal recognition through the legislative process to this tribe. 
   As a Hispanic, I understand what it is like to have to fight for equality. 
   As an American, I treasure and understand the importance of sovereignty, of liberty, independence, autonomy and freedom. 
   I believe that the best method to decide whether to develop a new sovereign relationship is to have the Lumbee directly apply to the BIA. The Lumbee tribe should apply for recognition via the administrative process and I support allowing this to occur. 
   My vote today will follow that decision because of the many questions regarding their name, the criteria to be Lumbee, and their bloodline. 
   I want the Lumbee tribe to know that I respect the individuals whose strength, courage and determination have allowed them to fight for their people and to continue the struggle.

   Mr. BACA. Thank you, Mr. Inslee, for allowing me this time to speak on the comprehensive immigration legislation that is pending on the Senate side. 
   I appeal to the Members of the Senate on a bipartisan basis to vote on allowing for the cloture of the legislation to move forward on behalf of the 12 million and some undocumented here in the United States. Undocumented means there are people, not only Hispanics, Irish, Italians, Asians, African American. It impacts a variety of different individuals. 
   Without allowing cloture, we will not be allowed an opportunity to fix the immigration legislation as it stands right now and will allow the continued abuse that exists. We need to protect American families and working families. We need to make sure that we allow this legislation to move forward. 
   On behalf of democracy, I appeal to all of the Members on a bipartisan basis to allow this legislation, to allow the debate to continue. It is important that all of the Senators tonight, those individuals that can, and I would like to commend Senator Reid, Senator Salazar, Senator Menendez, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, Senator Graham and some of the other individuals who have taken a stand in support of a comprehensive legislation. We need you to allow this process to continue. 
   If this process does not continue, America will lose. The taxpayers will lose. It is our responsibility. 
   When we talk about national security, we need this legislation to allow the process to continue. When we talk about protecting, and I know some of us don't like the legislation. There are individuals that say I don't like provisions of the guest worker program or the border aspects or the enforcements. I think we will be able to fine-tune it and work on it to allow the process to where we can fix the legislation. 
   On behalf of working families and on behalf of protecting the American people, we need this process. We need this legislation on behalf of humanitarian issues. We should not have people living in fear, not knowing whether they are going to be here for the next couple of years or what is going to happen to the 12 million and some. It is important. 
   Senators on your side of the aisle, please allow this process to continue to happen. Vote for the cloture. Then you can vote on provisions, whether you like or dislike other portions of the bill. But allow us to continue to have the debate in order to make sure that we continue to protect the American people and we continue to protect working families and we end illegal immigration as it is right now and fix it. It is important.

   Mr. BACA. Madam Chairman, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Student Access to Federal Student Loans Act. 
   Access to education and equality of opportunity are rights that every American deserves. 
   H.R. 5715 helps to protect these rights--by ensuring the turmoil in the U.S. financial markets does not keep students from accessing the federal loans they need to pay for college. 
   Because of the current stress in the U.S. credit markets, these protections are necessary now more than ever. 
   This responsible bill increases the loan limits on federal college loans by $2,000 for undergraduate students, and also increases the total loan limits available to students over the course of their education. 
   H.R. 5715 also gives parents more time to begin paying off their federal PLUS loans; and helps struggling home owners by making sure that short term delinquencies in mortgage payments don't prohibit eligible parents from taking federal loans; 225 thousand students in the state of California alone use need-based student loans. 
   It is critical that Congress takes every step necessary to ensure the credit crunch does not prevent even one of them from receiving the education they deserve. 
   I urge my colleagues to help keep America the land of opportunity, and to cast a vote in favor of H.R. 5715.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleagues and my friend Albio Sires for yielding me the time. I would also like to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and then, of course, my friend Dan Burton and the leadership for their support and their effort in bringing this bipartisan resolution to the floor. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 347, a resolution honoring the significance and impact of Cinco de Mayo. This Resolution 347 recognizes the Cinco de Mayo holiday, which commemorates May 5, 1862, the date in which the Battle of Puebla was fought by Mexicans who were struggling for their independence and freedom. 
   While Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexican Army's victory over  France in this key battle, it was also but one of many battles for the courageous Mexican people who won their long and brave struggle for independence and freedom. 
   Today the Cinco de Mayo holiday is not only the commemoration of the defeat of the French foreign army, it is also a celebration of virtues of individual courage and patriotism of all Mexicans and Mexican Americans who have fought for freedom and independence against foreign aggressors. 
   Cinco de Mayo is also a day to celebrate the rich cultural heritage that Latinos have brought to the United States. Latinos are the fastest growing minority population in the country, representing 45 million people, 17 percent of the total population. The Latino community has made many important contributions in all aspects of life: the arts, sports, the business world, sciences. Latinos have also fought in all American wars beginning with the Revolutionary War, earning 41 Medals of Honor overall. In World War II, 500,000 Hispanics fought, 65 Puerto Ricans fought. Thirteen Medals of Honor, 11 Mexican Americans, one Puerto Rican. Today there are over 30 Latino Members in the United States Congress. This statistic points to what a driving force the Latino community has become in our country economically, socially, and politically. 
   Cinco de Mayo also provides us with a great opportunity to look back at our own heritage as Americans. We must remember that our country was built by people from different homelands with different diverse cultures held together by common bond with a willingness to fight and die for freedom. 
   Unfortunately for Latinos, there are many inequities that have put our communities at a social and economic disadvantage. My colleagues and I in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus are working together in a bipartisan basis to end these barriers to increase opportunities for Latinos, particularly in areas of education, health care, homeownership, and equal representation in corporate America. As Americans, we must unite to achieve these common goals. 
   In a large sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito Juarez once said: ``The respect of other people's rights is peace.'' 
   I ask my colleagues to support H. Res. 347.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. 
   I voted against this war 5 years ago and believe we should never have gone into Iraq. 
   But as a veteran, I stand by our troops and have always committed to providing for them regardless of politics. 
   And H.R. 1591 supports our troops before, during, and after service. It mandates proper training and equipment, it requires that our troops get the rest they need between deployments to stay sharp, and provides for our wounded as they return from battle. 
   This bill also sets deadlines for the Iraqi government so that we can start shifting responsibility to the Iraqi people and bring our troops home by 2008 at the very latest.  
   Mr. Speaker, we have 160,000 American troops on the ground in Iraq right now, many of which lack proper equipment and training. 
   We also have 32,000 wounded soldiers from the Iraq conflict who need medical attention and assistance to get back on their feet. 
   Unfortunately, we have a veteran healthcare system that is failing. Report after report indicates under funding, neglect, improper conduct, and almost no accountability. 
   If the tragedies at Walter Reed Army Medical Center have taught us anything, it is that wartime spending shouldn't just stop with tanks and guns. 
   It needs to extend to taking care of our wounded heroes and their families after they return from the battlefield. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recently visited our returning veterans at Walter Reed Medical Center. And what I saw there just broke my heart. 
   Some of our wounded told me their doctors weren't giving them the attention they needed and that they even had to prove to the medical staff that they were injured! 
   One man in particular really touched my heart. I met a wounded soldier from my home State of California who told me about his father who had dropped everything, closed his business, and flew to Washington so that he could take care of his son full time. 
   This young man's family not only had to risk their son for this war, they're now sacrificing their livelihood to help him recuperate. 
   And yet sadly, he's one of the lucky ones. 
   What about the majority of military families who simply can't afford to quit their jobs, move cross-country and take care of their husbands, wives, and children? 
   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, the American people shouldn't have to put up with these hardships. 
   They shouldn't have to worry that their family members in uniform are getting the best care possible. 
   How poorly does it reflect on us as a Nation when we don't adequately take care of our veterans when they come back home? 
   Veterans healthcare is one of the most neglected and underfunded programs in this country. 
   This isn't just embarrassing, it is unconscionable. 
   We have a duty to minimize the risk to our troops and their families by making sure they have the very best training, the finest equipment, and stay deployed only as long as absolutely necessary. 
   Furthermore, we have a moral obligation to take care of each and every soldier who has been injured in the line of duty in defense of our great Nation. 
   H.R. 1591 addresses these responsibilities and that's why I will vote in favor of this bill today. 
   The American people have already paid too high a price for this war. 
   3,233 soldiers have died in Iraq, including 10 men from my own district. 
   We owe it to these heroes to set a deadline for withdrawal and let our soldiers move on with their lives. 
   We owe it to our families who are praying for the safety of their loved ones to take care of our troops every step of the way. 
   That's why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1591.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 237. 
   I want to thank Representative Filner for his commitment to this resolution in support of our veterans. And I say ``the support of our veterans.'' As a veteran myself who served in both the 101st and 82nd Airborne Division, I am proud to stand with our brave men and women. 
   Today, there are over 23 million veterans living in the United States; 165,000 in Iraq and Afghanistan. In my district, we have over 32,000 veterans. There are also many veterans who serve in Congress, and I want to thank those Members who have served this country. And I salute each and every one of the Members who have served our country. 
   To my fellow veterans, I commend you for your service. When our troops commit to serve our country, they make a promise to serve and to protect this country. 
   We also have a moral responsibility to protect the returning veterans and their families. Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan must receive the best treatment. Sadly, for the last few years, I don't believe that our government has held its end of the bargain. The conditions at Walter Reed show us that in many cases our veterans are not receiving the care they deserve. This resolution reminds us that Veterans Day is not just a day off from school or work. This is a special day of reflection to honor those who have defended our country. 
   I visited Israel a few years ago. There I learned how truly they respect and honor veterans in that country. Israel calls for 1 minute of silence across the whole country. The country's emergency siren goes off at 10 a.m., and all TV and radio stations are also interrupted and programs sounding the alert. Everyone then stops whatever they are doing, working, driving, anything else, and stands in silence for those heroes who have served their country. That's paying respect. 
   My resolution also encourages schools to educate our young people about the contributions of our veterans to this country because they ultimately have made the sacrifice for the freedoms that they have to be in school and to be all that they want to be. 
   This year, as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I have worked closely with Hispanic veterans and the Medal of Honor veteran winners from World War II until today. The stories of courage and sacrifices I've heard from them were nothing short of amazing. They deserve to be recognized and thanked, as well as every veteran who has served our country. 
   I also believe a special thanks is necessary to the veterans and military families that are left behind. Too often we forget about the families and veterans who are left behind. They have sacrificed so much for their loved ones and for America, for America that we stand up with, America that we have always been with. You are the support system and the backbone for all of these veterans. 
   On November 11, on Veterans Day, do not forget those who are the true heroes of this country. Reflect on the true meaning of Veterans Day, and remember the sacrifices made by so many proud American sons and daughters that we will honor on that day. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Veterans Day is about our heroes.

Each and every person who serves in the Armed Forces generally loves his country and is willing to give their ultimate sacrifice. And these individuals gave their ultimate sacrifice for this country, for a dream of coming here. 
   Each individual was prepared to lay down his or her life to protect what is sacred to all of us, hope, freedom and opportunity, not only for them, but for all of us who believe in this country, because we know ultimately every person who has served in our military has been willing to lay down their lives so that we can enjoy the freedoms, the freedoms that we have today. And the 69,300, 43 percent noncitizens, or 5 percent of the United States, believed in the same sacrifice as other individuals who have served us. They know that our freedom comes from men and women who are willing to serve this great Nation. 
   When I look at the names of immigrant soldiers who've died in Iraq and Afghanistan, it makes me realize why America is the greatest country in the world. And when we look at those individuals who served in World War II, the 500-some thousand, how many of those were noncitizens and immigrants? 
   And when we look at my district, or the State of California, 26 foreign-born soldiers from my State have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. And they come from all over the world. But whether they come from El Salvador, Korea, Mexico, Jamaica or Honduras, when they put on that United States military uniform, they do it as Americans and with pride. 
   Douglas Jose Marencoreyes, a young man from my district, was an immigrant to this country from Nicaragua. Corporal Marencoreyes came to this country with his family in search of opportunity and hope. Yet he was willing to serve in the Armed Forces when many others were not even willing to serve. And yet he found that by serving in the military that it was an honor. 
   The same goes for Sergeant Jorge Alberto Molinabautista, an immigrant from Mexico who lived in my hometown of Rialto, California. Both of these young men died while serving in the global war on terror. And they did so proudly, with honor, with honor for what they believed and what this country stands for, for the freedoms, so they know that their children and others can enjoy the freedoms that we have, because this is the greatest Nation, the greatest country; and they knew it and they served for this country. 
   Both men were posthumously awarded citizenship for their service to this Nation. Why? Because nothing would have honored the sacrifices more than to be recognized and acknowledge their love for this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, our country is currently engaged in a great debate regarding immigration. And there are many who want to diminish or even deny the great contributions of immigrants to our Nation's history, economy, and culture. And many of these have contributed and continue to contribute to our country because they believe in this country. They come here for hope, for freedom and opportunity and are willing to serve and die for this country. 
   But as we move forward in this debate, let us not forget the 69,300 immigrants soldiers out there in the battlefields, those who are willing to risk their lives every day to protect the same people who are criticizing them, the same people who are criticizing, they're willing to stand up and defend those individuals because they believe in the principles and the freedoms and opportunities of this country. 
   I urge the American people to support all troops, all individuals and the sacrifices of every one of our soldiers, regardless of where they were born, because at the end of the day they are willing to give their lives for this country and to sacrifice for this country. Each one of them are patriots and are true American heroes.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 63. 
   I thank the Armed Services Committee chairman, Mr. Skelton, for carrying this legislation in support of our military troops and opposing the President's plan to send at least 21,500 more troops to Iraq. 
   I speak today as a proud veteran who served in the United States armed service as a paratrooper in the 101st and 82nd Airborne Division. 
   As a veteran and as a Congressman, I voted against this war in year 2002 because no one could convince me why we had to be there in the first place. I was tormented with this decision. I talked to many of my constituents. I called the bishop in my area. I couldn't see what invading Iraq had to do with securing the homeland. No one in the administration could convince me that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But we sent our troops there anyway, without proper training or proper equipment. 
   This administration was in such a hurry to invade Iraq that we sent our military in there with defective body armor and Hummers that couldn't withstand the roadside bombs. In fact, before Congress made any appropriations for an Iraq invasion, the President took $600 million from our troops in Afghanistan and sent it to Iraq. 
   The administration has refused to listen to its own generals, to Congress or to the American people. They just do what they want. 
   After September 11, I was willing to do anything to make our country safe, like all of us. We came together in a bipartisan way. I believed in fighting terrorists in Afghanistan was the right thing to do, but the current situation in Iraq proves what we have been saying all along, that the Iraq war has not and will not make America safer. Instead, it is costing the American taxpayers $200 million every day. The money that we spent in Iraq could have sent 17 million high school students to college. Can you imagine, 17 million students going on to college right now that we could have provided assistance to, or paid for 6 million new school teachers, reduced the student ratio, funded the No Child Left Behind Act, or help with Katrina. But more money has been spent on this war, and yet it is costing us money for those that are losing their lives right now. 
   Over 3,000 men and women have given their lives for this war, and over 23,000 are coming home wounded or disabled. Mr. Speaker, over 10,000 of these troops are so severely wounded that they will never be able to serve again. Let me tell you, and you have to look at them, never able to serve again. 
   Now the President wants to send 21,500 more troops to the most dangerous part of Iraq. Why? Why are we sending our troops to fight in another country's civil war? Mr. Speaker, this isn't a strategy for success. This is a desperation attempt by the administration who can't admit that they made a mistake. They made a mistake, and they need to admit it. And the sooner we come to this realization, the better off this country will be. As a veteran, I understand that sometimes war is necessary, but as a veteran, I also know that war should always be the last resort because war means someone's sons and daughters won't come home. That means separating parents from their children, leaving their homes, someone making a sacrifice. 
   In my home State of California alone, we have lost 325 men and women in Iraq. Back in my home district, we have lost 10 outstanding young men. It just breaks my heart. Mr. Speaker, you don't put the American families through this kind of pain unless you are sure, beyond any shadow of doubt, that there are no other options. The President had failed to convince me in 2002, and I am still not convinced to this day. 
   I say let's support this resolution. Let's bring back our men.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for their hard work and dedication in helping the thousands of victims that have been left homeless by the hurricane on the gulf coast. Thank you for caring and wanting to take action. 
   I rise in support of the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act, H.R. 1227. Eighteen months have passed since Katrina hit, yet thousands are still struggling to get back on their feet. This bill is about the thousands of people struggling to get back on their feet. 
   Last year, the TriCaucus Chairs, GRACE NAPOLITANO, MIKE HONDA and MEL WATT, met in Houston to cohost a townhall meeting on Katrina, where they listened to Katrina victims who had been displaced to Houston. Since then, we have learned that 99,000 families are still living in trailers, including 65,000 in Louisiana, 31,000 in Mississippi, and thousands more individuals are still living with relatives in States throughout the Nation. 
   Families, workers and businesses can't return to the gulf area until they have homes to return to. We need to rebuild. Their lives are being impacted, and it is affecting their ability to improve their quality of life. This is their home. This is their castle. We need to rebuild. 
   The administration's slow response has been a major factor in the pace of recovery. The President didn't even mention Katrina in his 2007 State of the Union Address. Billions of dollars are going to rebuild Iraq, while American families are waiting for assistance right here at home in America. Shame. 
   Enough is enough. We can't afford to leave these families behind. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1227.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL SUFFRAGISTS DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H. Con. Res. 105, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of a National Suffragists Day. This resolution promotes awareness of the women's suffragist movement and the brave individuals who fought to make the right to vote a reality for all women. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Berkley, for sponsoring this important legislation. 
   The women's suffragist movement has a long history in America. Today it may seem hard to believe, but less than one hundred years ago, women did not have the right to vote in federal elections in this country. 
   National Suffragists Day would honor women such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who together founded the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869. 
   These two leaders, along with other courageous women such as Lucretia Mott, Alice Paul, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis, and countless other brave Americans, fought tirelessly to achieve their God-given rights to freedom and opportunity. 
   I have introduced legislation of my own to posthumously honor Alice Paul and raise awareness of her powerful contributions to the suffragist movement and American society. 
   Finally, due to the sacrifice, hard work, and diligence of women like Alice Paul, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in the summer of 1920, giving women the right to vote on a national level. 
   While today's resolution honors some great Americans of the past, it also provides us with an opportunity to look at the current state of women in our country. 
   We have come a long way as a nation since the summer of 1920. My home state of California is represented by two female Senators. We have a woman serving as Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a very strong female presidential candidate. 
   Still, there is much more that needs to be done. Inequalities in pay, health care discrepancies, and a lack of good and affordable childcare still haunt many women in the United States today. 
   We must remain vigilant. We must ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity for success and happiness. With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for honoring and increasing awareness of suffragists in America, and support H. Con. Res. 105.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (RECOGNIZING THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF IMMIGRANTS -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, Congress came back this week from celebrating our Nation's Independence Day. This is a special time to reflect on America's difficult history and the true essence of what she stands for. Since the beginning, America has thrived on the contributions of its immigrant labor force. Sadly today, the positive contributions of the immigrant labor force to our society are too often unnoticed. 
   Hardworking families contribute daily and pay their share into the American system. Hardworking mothers sometimes work three jobs, give up their weekends, and take overtime and night shifts to feed and clothe their children. Hardworking fathers wake up at 4 a.m. to go to work, earn below minimum wages, and manage to provide for their families. 
   Immigrants contribute in taxes from their paychecks just like the next person through shopping at a variety of stores, restaurants, and gas stations. In fact, the IRS reported that between 1996 to 2003, immigrants contributed $50 billion in Federal taxes. 
   We cannot afford to ignore the figures, and more importantly, we cannot afford to ignore the positive contributions of immigrants in America. We need comprehensive immigration for the security of our Nation.

   It is 2008, and yet our wives, daughters, sisters still face gender-based wage discrimination. 
   I am proud to advocate for equal pay because this is not a women's issue. This is an American issue. Discrimination on wages based on gender is unacceptable. Congress has a duty to tackle this issue.  
   The wage gap hurts families' ability to pay for basics like groceries, child care, health care. Today 41 percent of women are heads of households and are sole income earners. We're in a recession. People have lost their homes right now. The gap continues to be there. Gas prices continue to go up. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1338, and allow for all women to receive fair treatment and equal opportunity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of H. Res. 717, the ``Privileged Resolution on the Passing of the Honorable Jo Ann Davis'' 
   Today we stand in remembrance of a distinguished member of the 110th Congress, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, who after a two year battle with Breast Cancer has passed away. 
   Her husband, Chuck Davis, battalion chief for the Hampton Fire Department; two sons, Christopher and Charles Davis, and extended family survive her, remembering the incredible legacy Congresswoman Davis has left behind her. 
   A woman of modest beginnings, Congresswoman Davis knew the meaning of hard work and proved headstrong and committed as she worked her way to becoming the first Republican woman to lead the First District of Virginia. She would maintain her leadership there for 7 years. 
   She has been praised for her commitment to Armed Services, and commended for her commitment to researching and pursuing legislative reform. 
   Her determination to pursue change and prevail over hardships knew no bounds, even in her fight against breast cancer. 
   Even in this moment of memorial, her presence and upstanding character is reflected as we discuss a recommitment of H.R. 1124--a bill providing financial assistance to low-income students and ensuring a brighter future for all Virginian youth. 
   Because of the Congresswoman's ongoing commitment to preserving life on a social and political level, my colleagues and I will make great strides to continue supporting breast cancer awareness and the wellbeing of all Americans. 
   In her memory we will continue to uphold two priorities to which she was greatly dedicated. 
   While it is with sadness that we say goodbye to an incredible woman, we think of her with joy and fondness as we remember her devotion to creating a better America. 
   The use of her life to benefit ``America's First District of Virginia'' is unquestionable and has served to ensure a sense of responsibility among her fellow colleagues in the 109th and 100th Congress. 
   I thank Congresswoman Davis for dedicating her life to service on the behalf of the 1st District of Virginia. I am honored to have worked with her and I truly appreciate all she has given. 
   Her efforts have touched many lives and her exceptional impact upon our country will create a lasting legacy for generations to come. 
   Congresswoman Davis will be greatly missed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of House Resolution 32 the Denouncement to the Suppression of Women. 
   Thousands of women a year fall victim to societies that deem them unworthy and in turn suffer at the hands of discrimination and violence. We must recognize that this violence is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women and it must be eliminated. Too many women are continuously tortured, beaten, mutilated and assaulted by husbands, fathers, and complete strangers without hope for support or promise of a safe haven to run to. 
   Domestic violence is the major cause of death and disability for women aged 16 to 44, accounting for more death and ill-health than cancer or traffic accidents. More than 60 million women are ``missing'' from the world today as a result of sex-selective abortions and female infanticide. The World Health Organization has reported that up to 70 per cent of female murder victims are killed by their male partners. 
   As Americans, citizens striving to preserve human life and oppose the discrimination of any person, we must move to impair these malevolent occurrences in full force. 
   United, we must denounce these demeaning practices and fervently demand an end to this persecution and a commitment to preserving the rights of female populations all over the world. No longer can we stand silent while thousands of women fall victim to cultural prejudice and international trafficking. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   The preservation of female rights must be a priority to this the 110th Congress as we continue to work towards ensuring democratic ideals worldwide.

   This Peru Free Trade Agreement does not guarantee American jobs will stay right here in the United States. That is the bottom line: jobs that need to stay right here in the United States. 
   American families have lost jobs because past trade agreements did not lead to the creation of jobs right here at home. American families are earning less now than they did before. Three million jobs have been lost, and we have an $800 billion trade deficit. 
   We need to create jobs here. We need to help hardworking families who are struggling. Many of these American families that are struggling today to make it, we need to help them. American workers deserve it. Americans at home deserve to benefit from the global economy. We need to protect jobs, and I state we need to protect jobs from further offshoring caused by unfair trade agreements, and we have seen what has happened. 
   Now is not the time to rush ahead with more of the same damaging NAFTA-CAFTA style trade policies that have proven to hurt the American workers, and we have seen how it has hurt the American workers and the livelihoods of many, that will benefit all and not just the wealthiest few. 
   Vote for American workers and not for the Peru Free Trade Agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, thank you for all of the work that you have done. I'm angered, frustrated, and sad, but I believe that we've got to do the responsible thing. Therefore, I'm going to support the bill.  
   Madam Speaker, today, I find myself frustrated, angry and sad. Predatory lending and  greed are at the root of the current financial storm our Nation is facing. I voted against the bailout bill on Monday because I believe it did not do enough to provide direct relief to families that are facing foreclosure, and have been victimized by these practices. 
   Over the past few days, I have fought vigorously to include stronger foreclosure mitigation provisions in a revised bill. Many of my colleagues joined me in an effort to include language from my bill H.R. 4135, The Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation Act, in any revised rescue plan. This language would keep more families in their homes. 
   While I believe today's bill still does not do enough to protect struggling homeowners, I am pleased that it does include critical improvements in the areas of oversight and accountability. This bill does a better job of protecting America's taxpayers, and ensuring their investment is not squandered. 
   But sadly, our economy is now in turmoil. We find ourselves in a state of quicksand, and we are sinking fast. We cannot delay action any longer. I will vote for this bill today. Not because it solves all our problems, but because I do not have a choice. 
   If the credit crunch is allowed to continue, the consequences for the Inland Empire will be disastrous. In my district, too many families are facing the possibility of being homeless. Credit unions and big banks have limited their lending, and as a result families are at a greater risk of losing their homes, their jobs and their opportunities for success. 
   Car loans have dried up, and some dealerships have closed and been forced to layoff workers. Student loan companies across the Nation have shut down or stopped participating in Federal student aid programs. 
   And now, to make matters worse, we have received word that California needs a $7 billion emergency loan from the Government, in order to keep funding day-to-day operations. The consequences of doing nothing are too dire to imagine. 
   Without immediate Federal action, California will be unable to sell voter-approved bonds for highway construction, schools, housing or water projects. And because of the extreme delay in passing the state budget, California's cash reserves would be exhausted by the end of October without this loan. This means that payments for teachers' salaries, nursing homes, law enforcement and every other State-funded service would stop or be significantly delayed. This must not be allowed to happen. 
   Ultimately, today's bill is about providing confidence in our markets and stabilizing our economy. We must do this if we are to protect our jobs at home, stop further outsourcing, and ensure our society has access to the credit it needs to run. 
   The market dropped on Monday because of a lack of confidence. Because of predatory lending and the complete lack of regulation we have seen from the Bush administration in the last 8 years, Wall Street has been allowed to run amok--and because of that the American people have suffered. 
   I am voting for this bill today to restore that confidence. But we must come back and work on a more comprehensive package that will provide the assistance America's working families need to survive in these difficult economic times. I have received a commitment from the House Financial Services Committee that hearings will be held next February to examine my bill, the Family Foreclosure Rescue Corporation, and move it forward in the legislative process. 
   The Bush administration and the rubber stamp Republicans in Congress are responsible for the lack of leadership and effective government oversight that caused this crisis, but we all must work together to get America back on track. I am confident that with a change of leadership, we will stabilize our Nation's financial markets and keep America's working families safe and secure.

   This bill will provide long overdue and much-needed reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, and update the program to meet the needs of the 21st century. 
   Hurricane Katrina caused property damage from both wind and flooding in parts of five parishes of Louisiana, three counties of Mississippi, and two counties of Alabama. 
   Yet insurance companies in those areas have refused to count claims where property damage was a result of both wind and water. Instead, for 2 years they engaged in the practice of denying and delaying claims and took advantage of the desperation of disaster victims who lost everything. 
   This bill provides fair and equitable protection of combined wind and flood losses by allowing property owners to purchase wind and flood coverage in a single policy. It will help us right that wrong for many victims. 
   As we saw during Hurricane Katrina, FEMA's maps are significantly outdated, often understating flood risk and leaving homeowners without enough information to protect themselves. 
   I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to address this problem by requiring FEMA to conduct a thorough review of the nation's flood maps, making the updating and modernization of flood maps an ongoing process, and increasing funding for mapping. 
   H.R. 3121 addresses a number of weaknesses in the Flood Insurance Program that were exposed by the unprecedented 2005 hurricane season. It is a strong bill that will ensure the program's continued viability, encourage broader participation, and increase financial accountability. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Chi-Chi is famous for his success on the golf course. He was a self-taught golfer that started out fusing a branch from a guava tree for a club and a metal can as a ball. 
   He then went on to win 8 titles on the PGA tour and represented our country as a member of the 1973 U.S. Ryder Cup team. 
   He is a true ambassador of the game, and a role model for all Latino golfers, including myself. 
   From his childhood in the sugar cane fields of Puerto Rico, to the World Golf Hall of Fame, Chi-Chi has lived the American Dream. 
   What most people don't know about Chi-Chi is his dedication to working with underprivileged kids. He inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. 
   At the Chi-Chi Rodriguez Academy, kids learn valuable lessons to help them in life--respect, confidence, honesty, responsibility, integrity, and sportsmanship, to name a few. 
   Under-achieving students with behavioral problems and learning disabilities get free help at Chi-Chi's academy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. 
   Today, the House will consider a fiscally responsible budget which I proudly support because it contains the right priorities for America's families. 
   This budget strengthens our national defense and honors our promises to California's brave troops and veterans. It provides the largest increase for veterans' health care in the history of our country--providing $3.5 billion more than the President's budget. This will help to ensure that the 2,310,967 veterans in California receive care worthy of their sacrifice. 
   This budget also puts children and families first. For example, in California, 1,380,800 children do not have health insurance. It helps these children by increasing funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program--SCHIP--reducing the number of uninsured children across the county. 
   In addition, this budget also provides substantially more funding for California's 6,518,000 children enrolled in public elementary, middle and high schools--providing nearly $8 billion more in 2008 and 11 percent more over the next 5 years for education and training programs than requested by the President. This will increase resources for No Child Left Behind, special education and Head Start--rejecting harsh cuts and underfunding for these critical education programs included in the President's budget. Under the President's budget, 421,277 California children will go without promised help in reading and math and Head Start--a vital program for 98,432 California children--is cut by 1.5 percent below the 2007 level.  
   It also recognizes that the 3,575,200 small businesses in California are the engine of the economy. To spur economic growth and support small businesses, the budget rejects the President's proposal to cut the Small Business Administration by 26 percent from last year's request. 
   And it restores funding for environmental programs cut by the President's budget--including restoring $28,270,000 in clean water revolving loan funds in California that help improve wastewater treatment. 
   Finally, this budget supports middle-class tax cuts and protects middle-income families from a tax increase by setting up a reserve fund for a long-term fix for the alternative minimum tax, AMT. In 2004, 606,000 California families were subject to the AMT--and if nothing is done to fix the system, an estimated 4,434,000 families here in California will be subject to the AMT in 2007. 
   In sum, this budget will restore fiscal responsibility and accountability to Washington; strengthen our national defense; and invest in the next generation and America's prosperity; and I urge my colleagues to support it.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Weiner) having assumed the chair, Mr. Thompson, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 99) revising the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2007, establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2008, and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2009 through 2012, pursuant to House Resolution 275, he reported the concurrent resolution back to the House.

   I want to thank my friend, Rep. James Oberstar, and the Members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   This legislation will provide support for vital projects to my home state of California, and in particular to the city of San Bernardino, located in my district. I commend the Chairman for his foresight in giving states the flexibility our districts need to carry out these important transportation projects. 
   I am particularly pleased this bill includes a technical correction for High Priority Project # 2826. This change will allow transportation officials in the Inland Empire to double the number of grade separations constructed on the Alameda Corridor East. 
   There is no doubt this project will go a long way to help reduce congestion and improve road safety for residents in my home district and all Californians traveling to and from the Inland Empire. I urge my colleagues to support our local communities and cast a vote in favor of H.R. 1195.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 963, supporting the goals and ideals of National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Week. 
   February 11-15, 2008, has been designated by the President as National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Week. In over 155 VA hospitals across the Nation, we have suffering veterans who face the physical and mental wounds of combat every day. As a veteran myself, I understand the real-life sacrifices an individual does through while on duty. Living far away from family and loved ones is a sacrifice that hospitalized veterans continue to face every day. 
   As President's Day approaches, let us not forget those veterans that are the real-life examples of the courage and service our Nation was founded on. These veterans are our heroes--and now they need a hero of their own to thank them for their service and sacrifice. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this most dignified and deserving honor for our hospitalized veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I stand here to honor a true American hero, Sergeant Rafael Peralta, an immigrant that made the ultimate sacrifice for this country, using his body as a shield to protect his fellow marines from a grenade blast. 
   Peralta's story is an example of the heroes that love this Nation. For his disregard of personal safety and heroism, his commander recommended him to be awarded the Medal of Honor. This was not the case. Sergeant Peralta was awarded the Navy Cross, which is also an extraordinary feat. 
   However, his sacrifice merits that of the Medal of Honor. That is why I have joined my colleagues in asking the President to review this case. 
   Sergeant Peralta is a true example of how much many immigrants in America love this country. No one can deny Peralta's love for this country, having joined the United States Marine Corps right after becoming a legal permanent resident. 
   Recognizing the sacrifice of Peralta, America cannot turn her back on immigrants. 
   I urge my colleagues to support comprehensive immigration reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Chairman, I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007. This bill updates the FHA program so it can provide better mortgage options to low and moderate income families and minorities. This is important because the FHA program has not kept up with the needs of underserved communities, especially those in high cost areas like California. As a result, many families have turned to high cost and riskier subprime loans. 
   Because of the high number of subprime loans granted in the last few years--our Nation is now in a home foreclosure crisis. The Inland Empire has the fourth highest rate of foreclosure filings in the Nation and comprised the hardest hit area in California through the first half of 2007. According to the Neighborhood Housing Services of the Inland Empire, in San Bernardino County alone there were over 19,000 foreclosure filings in the first half of 2007. The current median home price in San Bernardino County is only affordable for 2 out of every 10 families. 
   H.R. 1852 will raise the FHA loan limit so that these hard-working families get a fair chance at getting a better deal for their home. The reforms in H.R. 1852 will allow the FHA program to reach into these underserved communities to provide low and moderate-income buyers a better deal at a fair price. 
   Again, Madam Chairman, I express my full support of this bill and urge my fellow colleagues to adopt its final passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (REMEMBERING VICTIMS AT VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY AND HONORING HISPANIC WORLD WAR II VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank our Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Veterans Affairs for addressing this important issue of those men and women who served during World War II, and that is our chairman, Ciro Rodriguez. It is important that people realize the contributions of many of our Hispanics who served during that period of time, that we are visible and that we were not invisible during that period of time and that we made many contributions to this country during that period of time. 
   So I rise today in honor of the over 500,000 Hispanics who bravely served our country during World War II with honor and with integrity and were proud to wear the uniform. And for those of us who wore that uniform, men and women who were willing to ultimately sacrifice for this country, it is an honor for us and our family members when we put on that uniform and fight for this country. 
   Madam Speaker, 65,000 Puerto Ricans also served during that period of time. Thirteen Medals of Honor were given out, 11 were Mexican American, two were Puerto Ricans. So when you can look at the contributions of these individuals and many others, as a veteran, I am proud of our heritage and our long history of continuing to fight for this country. 
   More Hispanics fought for this country's freedom and security during World War II, and I state that is an important fact to understand, and it is important that it be included in part of our history of the contributions that Hispanics have made. More Hispanics than any other minority group have served this country with distinction. 
   Just one example is Company E of the 141st Regiment of the 36th Texas Infantry Division. This company was made up entirely of Hispanics, bilingual individuals who were willing to serve for this country. After 361 days of combat in Italy and France, the 141st Infantry Regiment sustained 1,126 casualties, 5,000 wounded and more than 500 missing in action. 
   In recognizing their extended service and valor, the members of the 141st were awarded three Medals of Honor, 31 Distinguished Service Crosses, 12 Legions of Merit, 492 Silver Stars, 11 Soldier's Medals, and 1,685 Bronze Stars. We were, and are, visible and participated and gave our lives during World War II. And that is an important fact for many of our children and others to know the contributions of many of our men and women who served us, who sacrificed for this country. 
   Hispanic women also made a huge contribution to the American war effort. Madam Speaker, 200 Puertoriquenas served during the Women's Army Corps, which was one of the first service opportunities for women in American history.     
   Bilingual Hispanic women also worked in important positions within  the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps in areas like communications and interpretation. They also worked as specialized bilingual nurses and logistics specialists all over the world, providing the United States military the services vital to the war effort and to this country. 
   Hispanic veterans have made huge contributions to American society after serving our country in this war. 
   Dr. Hector P. Garcia of Corpus Christi founded the American GI Forum in 1948 to advocate on behalf of veterans rights, and as our chairman indicated, many veterans who came back home, who served this country, were trying to buy homes and trying to receive the same benefits that many other individuals were given in this country but yet were denied those same rights, whether to buy a home, obtain a education, have the same rights as others. I know because I experienced the same thing when I returned back after serving this country and was trying to rent a home, and they would not rent to me, and of course, they rented to my wife. In doing so, the GI Forum became an important civil rights organization for Mexican Americans. 
   Another organization that came out of the World War II generation of Latinos was the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, in 1968. Mexican American World War II veterans, such as Pete Tijerina, Ed Idar and Albert Armendariz, came together to advocate for low-income Mexican Americans who needed fair treatment within the American legal system. 
   As a Hispanic, a veteran and as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I cannot tell you how humbled I am by the sacrifice of these brave men and women who came before me, who ultimately gave the sacrifice, who believed in this country and continue to believe in this country and will continue to fight for this country because we know it is an honor to serve for the United States and its principles and what it stands for. 
   I am particularly honored to know of a dear friend of mine who served during World War II, David Guerra Galvan, who recently passed away on March 23 when I went back to the district. He was born in my district and was a resident of Rialto, my hometown, for 50 years. 
   David served his country in the Army during World War II as a paratrooper and in the 101st Airborne Division. During his European tour, David was also transferred to the 82nd Airborne Division as part of a detachment for the personal protection of General Dwight Eisenhower. After his military service, David continued to serve his country as a data communications operator at Norton Air Force Base. He retired after 40 years of outstanding service to the Armed Forces in 1990. 
   David was a dear friend of mine, and he is a perfect example of the hundreds of thousands of veterans that we are honoring today who have served our country and will continue to serve our country. 
   David Galvan was a Hispanic, he was an American and a proud American, and he loved this country. He spent his entire life serving our Nation and his community and his family; as well as my brother Abilio Baca who served in the Armed Forces in the Army during the Korean conflict; as well as my brother-in-law, Ted Dominguez, who served during World War II. 
   I feel honored to have followed in David's footsteps by serving in the 101st and 82nd Airborne during my military service, and I thank him and I thank all of the many men and women who served during World War II. They are our heroes. They are our role models. They have paved the way for generations of proud Hispanics. They are the ones who ultimately paid the sacrifices so that we can enjoy the freedoms that we have here today because they were willing to step up to the plate. They stepped up to the plate and were willing to die for this country. That is why we have the freedoms that we have today, and we must not forget the legacy of what they have left for us. They have opened the door. They paved the way. They provided that for us. Let us remember those veterans who have served this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (CESAR CHAVEZ -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of honoring Cesar Chavez,  an American hero, a role model, and an inspiration to many Americans. In this Congress I have reintroduced H. Res. 76, a resolution urging the establishment of a national holiday for Cesar Chavez. This resolution was introduced and supported by the United Farm Workers of America, Cesar E. Chavez Foundation, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and many other of my fellow colleagues. We are urging for a holiday to honor Cesar's memory and educate our youth and community about this remarkable yet humble leader who paved the way for many of us. 
   Cesar Chavez is a true American hero. He carried the torch for justice and freedom. He was a beacon of light for many of us Latinos in the community. His legacy will live on in our hearts and hopes and in our dreams. To quote him, si se puede, yes, it can be done. 
   This is the same cry we hear today, a cry of justice and equality and opportunity for all to have the American Dream here in the United States. Cesar represents the true essence of hope for many of us. From humble beginnings, Cesar was born near Yuma, Arizona, grew up in a migrant labor camp, and fought against the exploitation of workers at an early age. 
   In 1944, Cesar joined the United States Navy and honorably served his country as a veteran. With great courage and passion, he fought to preserve the principles of freedom and equality. He used this same courage and passion to stop the exploitation of workers. 
   Cesar was a trailblazer. In the early 1960s, he founded the United Farm Workers to gain nationwide attention of the exploitation of grape farmers, a too often forgotten labor force. He led his organization to increase protection for workers; to increase health and safety standards; to ban child labor from the field; to win fair wage guarantees; to fight against employment discrimination and the sexual harassment of female workers. 
   Cesar's dedication to social justice meant great sacrifices. This year marks the 40th anniversary of his famous public 25-day hunger strike calling for nonviolence. Cesar organized the farm workers to stand together and in one loud voice say, ``From this day, we demand to be treated like men and we should be respected as human beings. We are not slaves. We are not animals. We are not alone.'' 
   I was lucky enough to be part of his funeral, attended by over 50,000 people. I also had the pleasure of meeting with Cesar Chavez on many occasions in the Inland Empire. 
   In his memory, the State of California in September of 1994 enacted a law designating March 31, Cesar's birthday, as a State holiday. However, Cesar's light reaches beyond California and across ethnic barriers and across income levels across our Nation. Ten States officially celebrate Cesar's birthday as a holiday. This month his legacy will be remembered publicly all across the Nation in over 25 States and over 35 cities. These nationwide actions are about respect, respeto. 
   For this reason, I continue to call for the respect of a great man, a trailblazer who changed the world by using nonviolence. Cesar taught us that all workers deserve respect and dignity. Cesar, a common man with uncommon vision; a humble leader that forged together national coalitions of students, middle-class consumers, religious groups, minorities and others. 
   The significance and impact of Cesar's life transcends any one cause or struggle. In 1994 he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in America. And yet we should have a holiday for him. 
   His slogan, si se puede, yes, it can be done, still rings in the hearts of many Latinos and non-Latinos that it can be done and never give up because you can achieve whatever you want. 
   Yes, I say si se puede, one day Cesar Chavez will be honored, respected and remembered throughout this Nation with a holiday. This is only the beginning. Nationwide we are raising awareness of a great man who has honored our Nation, who has served our country and sacrificed himself for the betterment of others. We will keep his legacy alive.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. 
   This historic piece of legislation is the relief our working families have been waiting for and I am proud to stand with this Democratic-led Congress to make college educations more accessible for our youth. 
   Housing, gas, food, utilities, and health insurance prices are going through the roof. Our middle-class parents are working overtime to keep up with the cost of living and hopefully save for retirement. 
   It has become increasingly difficult for our families to save for college. With tuition prices increasing an average of 3.5 percent each year, American families are facing an uphill battle. 
   As a result, more and more of our children are coming out of school with staggering amounts of debt and many are being forced to attend part-time in order to work and pay for books and student fees. 
   In my home State of California, the average 4-year public school student will walk away with over $15,000 in debt after graduation. This is not how we should be sending our youth into the workforce. 
   H.R. 2669 is going to slash the interest rates on student loans, saving the average American student about $4,400 in interest payments over the life of their loan. 
   Furthermore, we're going to help our families take on less student debt by making Pell Grants keep up with the real cost of tuition. 
   During the Republican-controlled Congress, the maximum Pell Grant amount remained unchanged at $4,050 since 2003. H.R. 2669 is going to increase that figure to $4,310 in 2007 alone. By next year, it will be $4,900 and by 2011, it will be $5,200. 
   In my home State of California, over 600,000 Pell Grant recipients stand to benefit from the legislation we're going to pass today. 
   That means our children will be in a better position to save for retirement, become homeowners, and contribute to the economy. 
   H.R. 2669 will also make landmark investments to our minority serving institutions. Black, Hispanic, Tribal, Native Hawaiian, and Asian-Pacific Islander-serving institutions stand to receive $500 million in aid to teach and equip our minority youth, particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields. 
   H.R. 2669 provides an additional $228 million for Upward Bound, which will fund 188 additional programs to help prepare low-income, first generation students for college. 
   Finally, H.R. 2669 will provide loan forgiveness for students who pursue careers as public school teachers. Each would receive up-front tuition assistance of $4,000 per year, to a maximum of $16,000. This will provide aid to at least 21,500 undergraduate and graduate students who commit to teaching a high-need subject in high-need schools for four years. 
   As the youngest of 15 children, I was the first in my family to attend college. I can tell you from personal experience that it has made all the difference in the world. 
   I worked hard to get through school and I'm grateful for the assistance I received to complete my education. And it's time for the government to step up and give our children the same support. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act is the kind of reform my constituents need and I am proud to support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same and support H.R. 2669.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 535, a resolution to honor the leadership, in raising awareness of hate crimes, of David Ray Ritcheson, a Mexican American who was severely assaulted on April 23, 2006, and passed away last week. 
   Role models come in all shapes and sizes. Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr, Cesar Ch&#225;vez, are all great role models who led by example. 
   Just a few months ago, in our halls of Congress, David Ray Ritcheson at the young age of 18 exposed the harsh reality of hate crimes through his personal experience. 
   Today, we honor his efforts and leadership on this issue. 
   After having survived one of the most horrific hate-motivated criminal acts, David Ray courageously testified in support of the ``Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007,'' H.R. 1592, which passed the House on May 3, 2007. 
   In his testimony he stated: ``It has been a blessing to know that the most terrible day of my life may help put another human face on the campaign'', ``education can have an important impact by teaching against hate and bigotry''. 
   We must continue his efforts. 
   My prayers are with his family in their time of need. 
   We must not forget one of our present day's great role models. David Ray has and will continue to be a strong reason why hate crimes must be exposed. 
   I urge my colleagues to carry on his efforts to put an end to all hate crimes, and vote for this important legislation.

   Let's get back to basics. The minimum wage has not increased. The minimum wage was passed 10 years ago, and during the 10 years, people have struggled to put food on the table, gas prices have increased, the cost of public transportation has increased, the cost of clothes has increased, the cost of housing has increased, the cost of buying food has increased, not to mention every other cost of living in America has increased. 
   This bill is not about continued greed or about outsourcing, but it is about American families and improving their quality of life. 
   Let's get back to basics: $5.15 an hour is poverty. We need this bill because 40 percent of minimum wage workers are the sole bread winners in their families. Nineteen percent of minimum wage earners are Hispanic Americans, and 15 percent are African Americans. 
   It is time. It is time to care for working families of America and to give them a wage that is just, a wage that is fair.

   As Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I believe this bill is a good start in helping Hispanic students across the Nation. I thank Congressman RUB&#201;N HINOJOSA as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Education Taskforce for working to ensure Hispanic students have equal opportunity. Let's make sure that college is affordable and accessible for all students. 
   We need to prepare our students to make sure that we have a workforce for the 21st century. The only way we  can do that is to make sure that all students have access to affordable education. 
   We know that most of the students right now are relying on student loans. Forty-one percent right now have increased the student loans since the year 2001. So more students are relying on student loans. We want to make sure that it is affordable for every student. 
   Hispanics: 33 percent of Hispanics in their communities are under the age of 18 and the number of Hispanics attending colleges are growing in numbers. We want to make sure that they have access and an opportunity to fulfill their goals. It is not just about attending college. It is about completing college and making sure they become part of our workforce. In order to have a strong America, we must make sure that they fulfill their dream and opportunity. I am like many of those, the first one out of a family of 15 that was able to graduate; out of 15, the first one to graduate and obtain college. I went through the military, obtained the GI bill, obtained loans. 
   We want to make sure it is accessible and individuals have that opportunity. An educated nation is a successful nation. The only way we can do that is providing this service. 
   I encourage everyone to support H.R. 5. I thank Mr. Miller for carrying this legislation and caring about many individuals, and I thank my colleague across the aisle too as well, because he has cared about education. 
   We need to support this legislation to make sure that every student has access to affordable education, to make sure that we have the workforce that meets the needs of the 21st century.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, the nutrition title in the Conference Report for the 2008 Farm Bill is a monumental achievement for the millions of Americans who struggle to put enough healthy, nutritious food on the table. I know it's not always easy to make ends meet and to put food on the table each day. I've walked in those shoes, and I've sat at that table. But with this bill we start to fulfill our responsibility to our neighbors. We have improved and strengthened food stamps and other important nutrition programs for our children and seniors. I want to take a few minutes to expand upon some of the accomplishments that are in this nutrition title. 
   First off, we have updated the name of the program. The new name will be SNAP: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. We needed a new name because there are no places left in this country where food stamps actually are ``stamps.'' Instead, like with other modern transactions, people swipe their cards at the store to access their benefits. This has been a huge success for reducing fraud and stigma in the program. We hope and expect that the new name and new image for the program will help us to continue to chip away at the stigma that keeps some proud people, especially senior citizens, from signing up for help in paying for their groceries and puts them at risk of hunger. 
   The name reflects the fact that the program provides a ``supplement'' to help people afford an adequate diet when their own resources are not quite enough. We also say ``nutrition,'' instead of ``food,'' because the program is about more than just food. It has got a vibrant nutrition education component to help our low-income population learn about healthy diets and make the choices that will improve their health status over their lifetimes. So I'm very proud of this new name for food stamps: an established program that is one of the best government programs we've got. Let me be clear, however, that in changing the name and eliminating food stamp coupons we did not intend to make any other policy changes to the program. 
   I think the biggest single accomplishment in the nutrition title is to end the decades of erosion in the value of food stamp benefits. We're all aware of the rising gas and food prices of recent months and the bite they've taken out of the pocketbooks of most Americans. But for many low-income Americans the squeeze has been getting tighter for decades, as the value of their food stamps has been able to purchase less and less food with each passing year. Food stamp benefits average only $1 per person per day. It's not easy to purchase a healthy, nutritious diet on such a limited amount. 
   So in this bill we have addressed this problem. We made critical improvements, and, for the first time in the program's history, we have ensured that, in every aspect, the food stamp program keeps its purchasing power over time. We raise the standard deduction from $134 to $144 and index it for inflation. That is an important accomplishment. It helps about 10 million people afford more food--families, seniors, people with disabilities--all types of low-income food stamp recipients are helped by this change. We raise the minimum benefit, and index it for 
   inflation. We uncap the dependent care deduction so that families can deduct the full cost of the child care they so desperately depend on to hold down their  jobs. And we index the asset limits. We don't know what the future will hold. Hopefully, the high inflation of the past months will shortly subside as the country gets back on track. But we now can rest assured, as never before, that if there is substantial inflation our low-income families and senior citizens won't lose out on food. 
   For me what this bill really is about is people. It's about our senior citizens who have worked hard their whole lives and deserve better than to face the fear of hunger in their last years. It's about children, who come home from school and look to their parents to put a nutritious meal on the table. 
   One of the groups that will be most helped are our Nation's senior citizens. We were able to increase the minimum benefit, which goes predominantly to senior citizens, from $10 to about $14 a month. This is the first increase in almost 30 years in the minimum benefit. I would have liked to have increased it even more, but this change will help make it worthwhile for some of our seniors who qualify for a low benefit to participate in the program. We did this by setting the minimum benefit at 8 percent of the thrifty food plan for a single person. Because USDA adjusts the thrifty food plan every year for increases in food prices, so too will the minimum benefit now adjust. In addition, because of higher food prices in some places, like Alaska, Hawaii, and some of the territories, seniors in these places will now also see a modestly higher minimum benefit. For example in some parts of Alaska, the minimum benefit will be as high as $25 per month. 
   In this bill we've also excluded retirement accounts from assets and indexed the asset limits to inflation. These changes will help seniors and working families to save for the future. It makes no sense to require people who fall on hard times to virtually liquidate all of the savings they've managed to put away in order to get help paying for groceries for themselves and their families. Our seniors, especially, may have no ability to replace these savings, and as a result, no cushion to deal with unexpected expenses. And a working family who is forced to spend down savings now will be that much closer to poverty in their older years. So this is an important change for the long-term ability of low-income individuals to move toward financial independence and for our senior citizens to be able to retain an ability to support themselves in their retirement. 
   But I also want to reaffirm that we did not take away, as President Bush proposed, the State option in the food stamp program to design a more appropriate asset test at the State level. In my home State of California the legislature and Governor have been working together to design an ``expanded categorical eligibility'' program that will revise the asset limit for many food stamp recipients and make it easier for them to save for the future. I hope that other States consider this option, and I urge USDA to work with other States to promote this important policy. 
   In another major improvement for senior citizens, we have expanded to seniors a State option from the 2002 farm bill that dramatically reduces paperwork requirements. This policy is known as ``simplified reporting'' and it will allow seniors to participate without filing paperwork for 12 month periods, unless they have a major increase in their income that makes them ineligible for food stamps. I urge USDA to make this option as simple and streamlined for seniors and States as possible, and to find ways to insulate food stamp benefits from interactions with other programs that low-income seniors participate in, particularly Medicaid. 
   Finally, we have heard reports that despite the overwhelming success of the electronic benefits, some seniors can find the technology confusing. For those at the minimum benefit who receive maybe only $10 to $20 a month, we've heard concerns that if they don't use their benefits fast enough those benefits can be taken away--or moved ``offline''--sometimes in as short a period as 3 months, with the senior citizen not understanding why this has occurred. I don't think this is a very common problem, but it is understandable that a senior citizen might want to store up small benefits to use at one shopping trip every few months, rather than have to keep track of the card every month. This bill allows States to move benefits off-line after 6 months of inactivity, but requires them to notify the household and restore the benefits within 48 hours upon request. This benefit reinstatement should be a simple process, and States should aim to help seniors navigate it, so we don't have our seniors being bounced around an EBT call center trying to figure out what happened to their food stamp benefits. 
   For children and families, the biggest change we make is the increase and indexing of the standard deduction which will significantly boost the ability of low-wage workers to afford food for their families, especially over time. More than $5 billion of the nutrition title's 10-year investment go to this change, which primarily benefits families with children. 
   We also lift the limit on the dependent care deduction. This change will help about 100,000 families who pay out-of-pocket child care costs above $175 per child per month (or $200 for infants), by recognizing that money that is needed to pay for child care so that a parent can work is not available to purchase food. On average, families who are helped will receive an additional $40 a month (or $500 a year), according to the Congressional Budget Office. The dependent care cap has not been raised since the early 1990s, despite the increases in the costs of safe, reliable child care. Families incur all types of costs in order to secure child care for their children, and USDA should continue to allow all of these expenses to count toward the deduction--such as transportation costs to and from day care and the cost of informal care. Finally, as states roll this out to the 100,000 families currently on the program, its important that they make it easy for eligible families to claim the new deduction. Families shouldn't have to make extra trips to the food stamp office or be at risk of losing benefits if they fail to claim a new higher deduction. A household should never have its benefits cut or reduced because of a failure to document child care expenses, but should be given a full opportunity to receive the higher deduction if they have expenses above the current capped amounts. 
   We hear all the time that despite the importance and success of the food stamp program, for most families the benefits run out before the end of the month. That is why it is so important that we provide more than $1.2 billion in this farm bill for additional food purchases for emergency food organizations, like church food pantries and soup kitchens, to feed our families and seniors. We provide $50 million in additional funds this year to help meet food banks needs in light of rising food costs. And, we increase the basic The Emergency Food Assistance Program annual funding level to $250 million. That amount will be adjusted for inflation in future years to insure that this program does not lose any of its food purchasing power. 
   Another important provision for our children is a provision that ensures that children who receive food stamps can automatically, or ``directly'' be certified as eligible for free meals. The eligibility rules for the two programs overlap: virtually every child who receives food stamps is eligible for free meals. So making that connection in an automated way can save the family from falling through the cracks or from having to file duplicative paperwork. Unfortunately, too many States and schools don't currently make the connection adequately. So this bill requires USDA to report to Congress annually on each State's progress in directly certifying food stamp recipients for free school meals, and asks for USDA to report on best practices among the various States and school districts. This is a provision that is about good government--there is no reason the government can't make these connections, instead of requiring school administrators and families to be responsible for duplicative paperwork. 
   In addition to my role as the Agriculture's Subcommittee Chair on Operations, Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry, I also have the great pleasure to assess this bill from the perspective of my role as the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. More than 5 million Latinos, or more than 10 percent of the Latino population, receive food stamps each month. Food stamps constitute 25 percent of total monthly income for a typical Latino family that participates in the food stamp program. All of the changes that I have just described will benefit low-income Latinos who rely upon this program. 
   I must take one moment to express my deep personal disappointment that we were not able to restore food stamp benefits to all legal immigrants who are currently ineligible for the program. Keeping food assistance from hard-working immigrants with whom we live side by side is simply wrong and I will not stop fighting until we fully repeal the benefit cuts to legal immigrants enacted in 1996. 
   In spite of this major setback, we have achieved a number of important improvements for the Latino community. First, USDA will conduct a study on the possibility of bringing the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico back into the national food stamp program. Since 1982 Puerto Rico has received a fixed block grant amount for food assistance, rather than be a part of the U.S. program like the 50 States, District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. This block grant does not take into account changes in economic or demographic conditions, such as unemployment or the number of people who are in need of food assistance. 
   The poverty rate in Puerto Rico (45 percent) is more than three times the national poverty rate. However, because of the block grant, Puerto Rico cannot afford to provide benefits to all households poor enough to qualify for benefits using food stamp program standards. Instead they have been forced to impose rigid eligibility criteria. For example, a family of four  with net income above about $600 a month (or 34 percent of the Federal poverty level) cannot get any food assistance in Puerto Rico. The same family living in California, or any other State on the mainland, could have almost three times as much income and still be eligible for food assistance. An elderly person living alone faces an income limit of $192 per month--just 23 percent of the poverty level. 
   Clearly, some of our most vulnerable American citizens are at risk of being denied food assistance they greatly need. It seems just plain wrong to knowingly leave some Americans with insufficient food. With this study we hope to get a better understanding of what the local conditions are in Puerto Rico, in terms of food costs, poverty and other programmatic factors so that we can figure out how to address the issue in the next farm bill, or earlier if possible. 
   Another important achievement of the bill is to ensure that both Federal statute and regulations have the full force of law, ensuring that clients who do not receive adequate service under these rules and standards may bring suit. Recently, a district court in Ohio dismissed a case brought against the State to enforce the Department's regulations for serving people whose primary language is not English. I can't speak to whether the case had any merit, but my colleagues and I were surprised and disturbed to learn about the court's dismissal. We felt that it was critical to clarify in this bill that it has always been Congress's intent that the program's regulations should be fully enforceable and fully complied with to the same extent as the statute. The farm bill, therefore, clarifies that the Department's rules on serving non- and limited-English speaking people have the force of law and create rights for households. 
   Beyond the issue of bilingual access rules, this legislation makes clear that the Department's civil rights regulations are among those which have the full force of law and which households have the right to enforce. Discrimination is not acceptable in any form or at any point in the food stamp certification process. Households should not be assisted, or not assisted, approved or denied for any reason other than an individual assessment of their need for help or their eligibility by the State. I am pleased to be playing a role in making clear that the committee and the Congress wish the program to be administered in compliance with the Food Stamp Act and its regulations. 
   I'd like to also talk about a somewhat related matter that we did not manage to agree to include in this farm bill, much to my disappointment. I worked hard to include in the House bill, and shepherd through the conference negotiations, a provision that would have strengthened the long-standing policy in the food stamp program that certification and eligibility decisions should be done by State employees, rather than private companies. We would have added to the traditional restrictions around merit systems and provided specific exceptions for certain activities, such as outreach. In recent years the Bush Administration has let two States, Texas and Indiana, experiment with using private companies to collect and review food stamp applications and conduct the sensitive eligibility interview. In my view, these projects are not consistent with current law or good sense. These experiments have been disastrous to the States' treasuries but, more importantly, to the vulnerable families and senior citizens who rely on food stamps and found their applications delayed or improperly denied. Some people even had their private, personal information shared inappropriately. The activities involved in determining eligibility--and ineligibility--for food stamps should be public functions and should not be governed by profit motive or a company's responsibility to its shareholders. 
   While the House voted to include this provision in the conference agreement, the Senate did not because of opposition from the other party and a veto threat from President Bush. I regret this outcome and I am determined to not drop this issue until we have restored the proper balance to food stamp administration. 
   But I urge my colleagues to not forget, that separate from this ``privatization'' issue, in recent years States have been experimenting with a wide variety of changes to food stamp policies and practices that incorporate new technologies and modern business practices. For example, some States are using technology to create new pathways to apply for and retain benefits such as food stamps, health insurance, and child care, including online applications, online program redetermination or recertification, phone interviews, and call centers where changes in circumstances can be reported. 
   On the one hand, creating ways for families to participate in these programs without having to travel to a human service office can expand access and save time and money for States and families alike. In fact, in this bill we've created a new option for States to accept food stamp applications over the telephone. No doubt technology offers numerous opportunities for improved customer service and simpler application and retention processes. 
   On the other hand, if these processes are not well-designed, evaluated, and implemented, then families can face new access barriers. Moreover, some States are exploring these options at the same time that they are reducing human service staffing and closing local welfare offices. These steps can create new access barriers for certain groups of families and need to be carefully monitored. And I am concerned because neither States nor USDA appear to be asking the important questions about what has been the effect of these technological changes on access for food stamp households, particularly vulnerable populations like seniors, people with physical or mental disabilities, or people who do not speak English proficiently. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) last year published a report that found that USDA has not sufficiently monitored the States' ``modernization'' efforts in terms of their effects on program access, payment accuracy, or administrative costs. 
   So in this bill we have included several provisions to require that States that are eager to pursue modernized systems are pausing to ask the necessary questions about how to ensure that the new systems are designed in such a way that they are effective tools for connecting eligible families to benefits. In this bill we require USDA to establish standards for when States are making major changes in program operations and to monitor the effects on households, especially the types of households I just mentioned. I urge USDA to do this in a way that yields useful information so that States can refine and improve their systems to make them as accessible as possible to all clients. 
   Another provision requires States to adequately pilot test new computer systems before they go full-scale. This responds to situations where States have implemented new computer systems without adequate testing. This occurred even though some at USDA knew that there were weaknesses in the system and that serious benefit delays and errors were likely to occur. We also included a provision the Administration suggested to require States, instead of households, to repay any over-issuances that occur because of one of these preventable major systems failures. 
   Finally, in light of all of the modernization changes and the potential access to sensitive information that new players may have, we strengthened the act's privacy protections to ensure that anyone receiving confidential information for appropriate program purposes cannot then share that information with a third party. In addition to our fears that too many people may have access to private food stamp information as a result of new technology, we were also concerned that clients have not been able to access their private records. We heard about clients in Texas who had their benefits cut off, or who never were able to obtain benefits, and could not get access to their case records in order to pursue a claim against the State. That is unacceptable. We also clarified that despite all of the changes in how States are storing and maintaining client records, clients can access these records in litigation. These changes are not in conflict because confidential records would continue to be unavailable to the general public and others not having a legitimate reason relating to program administration. 
   Another concern I have is about two new provisions that would disqualify certain people from food stamps for misusing their benefits. One relates to situations where a recipient of food stamps intentionally uses food stamp benefits to buy a product, like water, that is in a disposable container that can be redeemed for cash, then discards the product and redeems the container in order to obtain the cash deposit. The other new disqualification addresses individuals who intentionally purchase food with food stamp benefits in order to resell the food for a cash profit. I agree that both of these practices are contrary to the purposes of the food stamp program in assisting people in obtaining an adequate diet and it's appropriate to address them in this bill. However, I caution USDA to implement them in a way that ensures that only those who intended to defraud the system in these manners be disqualified. I do not want to see innocent people--who may simply have bought groceries for a neighbor or relative--be caught up as somehow engaging in fraud under this provision. 
   My concerns here are not completely without precedent. In this bill we are revisiting and clarifying a different disqualification rule that was enacted in 1996, and that has, in fact, ensnared innocent people and denied food stamp benefits in inappropriate ways. The intent of the law was to aid law enforcement and prevent criminals who are fleeing to avoid prosecution from receiving food stamps. Unfortunately, in practice, the provision has disqualified innocent people who had their identities stolen, or who have outstanding warrants for minor infractions that are many years old  and where the police have no interest in apprehending and prosecuting the case. 
   So in this bill we direct USDA to clarify that people should only be subject to disqualification if they are actively fleeing law enforcement authorities who are, in fact, interested in bringing them to justice. 
   In addition to the very important changes we have made to the food stamp program and new funding for food banks through TEFAP, the bill would expand and improve the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. This program has been receiving $9 million a year in mandatory funds and operates in 14 States. (Three Indian tribes also operate the program.) 
   Under the conference agreement, mandatory funding would increase to $40 million for the 2008-2009 school year and continue to grow. By 2012, the program would be funded at nearly 8 times its current size: $150 million each year, with annual adjustments for inflation in years after that. 
   In addition to providing increased funding, the conference agreement takes important steps to target program funds to elementary schools with a significant share of low-income children. Our goal is to provide free fresh fruits and vegetables to all elementary schools in the country where more than half of the children are eligible for free or reduced price school meals. This program should expose a whole new generation of children to a healthy way of eating. 
   To sum up, I am extremely proud of the work that our committee and our Congress have undertaken in the nutrition title of the farm bill. With these changes, we are building a healthier better fed population. As a result, we are taking a few important steps towards a stronger future for our children and our communities.

   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, like many other of my colleagues who spoke right before, who told stories about how the lack of immigration reform has affected many families, Madam Speaker, the time for Congress to pass immigration reform is long overdue. 
   Our system is broken. Our country is less safe. Families are torn apart. And people are living in fear. For the Hispanic Caucus, this is an issue that is personal to a lot of us. Our communities should not be a punching bag for the vocal few. It's time to stop this hateful rhetoric that serves only to divide us and bully the vulnerable. 
   Children should not be torn apart from their mothers. We have been asked to stand against what are American values of family, providing a chance to do better. 
   America is a Nation of immigrants, not just from Mexico and Latin America but from Canada, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Immigration is not an Hispanic  issue; it's an American issue. It's an American issue. 
   We want to work together to create a real plan to combat hateful and often racist rhetoric that affects all of us. I ask my colleagues to do the right thing and not the political easy thing and to support real immigration reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4156, the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act. 
   The Iraq war is a failure and it's time for our troops to come home. 
   This bill calls for a responsible redeployment and provides for the checks and balances Congress is authorized to impose. 
   The administration does not have blanket authority and America does not have a bottomless checking account. 
   The President's policy in Iraq has been a complete failure, and Americans are calling for this war to end. 
   Our troops are now trapped in the middle of someone else's civil war. 
   Our military presence in Iraq is not making our country any safer. 
   Instead, this war has taken the lives of over 3,850 soldiers, including 13 brave young men from my District alone. 
   From Rialto, 37-year-old Staff Sergeant Jorge A. Molina was deployed in Iraq and died in hostile fire in the Anbar province. 
   From Rialto, 20-year-old, Specialist Luis D. Santos was deployed in Iraq and died of injuries sustained when a makeshift bomb exploded near his Humvee during combat operations in Buritz. 
   From Rialto, 22-year-old, Corporal Victor A. Garcia was deployed in Iraq and died by small arms fire in Baghdad. 
   From Bloomington, 25-year-old, Corporal Joseph A. Blanco was deployed in Iraq and died by small arms fire in Taji after sustaining injuries from a makeshift bomb. 
   From Fontana, 19-year-old Lance Corporal Fernando S. Tamayo was deployed in Iraq and died while conducting combat operations in Anbar Province. 
   From Fontana, 24-year-old Sergeant Bryan A. Brewster was deployed in Afghanistan and died after his helicopter crashed during combat operations in Afghanistan. 
   From San Bernardino, 22-year-old Corporal Nicanor Alvarez was deployed in Iraq and died in the line of fire in the Anbar province. 
   From San Bernardino, 19-year-old Petty Officer Alex Oceguera was deployed in Afghanistan, and died when a 
   makeshift bomb detonated near his vehicle in Wygal Valley, Afghanistan. 
   From San Bernardino, 24-year-old Corporal Sean Grilley was deployed in Iraq, and died after being fired on by Iraqis during operations in Karbala. 
   From San Bernardino, 24-year-old Specialist Timothy D. Watkins was deployed in Iraq, and died when a makeshift bomb exploded near his vehicle during operations in Ar Ramadi. 
   From Ontario, 21-year-old Specialist Jose R. Perez was deployed in Iraq, and died by enemy small arms fire in Ramadi. 
   From Ontario, 31-year-old Sergeant First Class Rudy A. Salcido was deployed in Iraq, and died when an improvised explosive device detonated near his convey vehicle in Baghdad. 
   These are the true faces of the war. My deepest prayers go out to their families. 
   These soldiers are the reason why I am so adamant about bringing our troops back home, and why we must support this bill. 
   The President's failed policies on the Iraqi war effort must end. We are listening to America's concerns and will not stand by and watch this continue. 
   We need to bring back our loved ones and put our families here at home first. 
   It's time for America to put her priorities in order. 
   This Nation is in debt, but not because of domestic spending. 
   President Bush refuses to sign bills to pay for schools, children's health care, and to protect our workers. 
   However, he comes to us asking for another $200 billion to continue funding the Iraq war. 
   With just one week's worth of funding for the war, my District would never again face a shortage of teachers, of nurses, or of police officers. 
   As a veteran, I voted against this war in 2002 because no one could convince me why we had to be there in the first place. 
   The President believes Iraq is making our country safer. 
   The truth is, it is has put us at greater risk. 
   Our military is stretched so thin that we are at risk of not being prepared for any future emergencies.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud cosponsor of the H.R. 5244, Credit Card Holder's Bill of Rights. 
   Access to fair and affordable credit cards is important for families entering the financial market for the first time, as well as those that rely on cards in times of financial emergency. 
   Credit card reform is vital to the Latino community. 
   Like most Americans, Latino families rely on credit to help them manage their monthly finances and purchase assets that will move them firmly into the middle-class. 
   Currently, 22 percent of Latinos do not have enough credit information available to generate a credit score, and more than one-third do not maintain traditional banking or savings accounts. 
   Because creditors generally rely on automated data mining, the fact that Latinos and immigrants are less likely to have robust credit files leaves them at a disadvantage. 
   As a result, issuers do not solicit our communities with their best priced credit cards. Instead, they offer high fee cards, with higher rates, and engage in other practices that regularly trap families in cycles of debt. 
   The Latino community is often targeted by ``affinity'' cards, cards that claim to be looking out for Latinos, but end up taking their money as an advanced loan scam, leaving consumers with no credit history and more fees than the card is worth. 
   Shopping for safe credit cards has become impossible, with mail solicitation rates rising 30 percent since 2006. 
   According to a Federal Trade Commission survey, 14.3 percent of Hispanics are victims of credit fraud, compared to 6.4 percent of non-Hispanic Whites. 
   Therefore, Latinos are hard hit by unfair credit card industry practices. Hispanic credit card users are more likely to be struggling to manage their debt, and are more susceptible to adverse industry practices. 
   Common abusive practices such as universal default, retroactive fees, no advance notice of changes in terms, and double-cycle billing make it hard for families playing by the rules to get ahead. 
   The Credit Card Holder's Bill of Rights, H.R. 5244, is important to Latinos and families across America for many reasons. 
   H.R. 5244 stops credit cards from changing their terms arbitrarily--instead, the bill requires up-front disclosures of all reasons for an increase in fees or changes in contract terms. 
   H.R. 5244 requires card companies to apply consumer payments to the highest interest balances first, making payments proportional and fair. Currently, many credit card companies apply payments first to lower-rate balances, preventing consumers from paying-off higher interest rate balances until the lowest rates are paid-off. This practice creates a situation where fees and finance charges accrue on the higher-cost balances, beginning a cycle of debt for many families. 
   H.R. 5244 stops universal default. Universal default is an unfair practice of many card companies, in which a consumer's rates can retroactively increase on a card that they have a perfect payment record with, if they have a decline in their credit score, or issues with an unrelated credit card. Minimum monthly payments can skyrocket, affecting a family's ability to successfully manage their debt and maintain financial stability. 
   H.R. 5244 ends unfair late fees on payments that were received on-time. Clearly outlined due dates that can not arbitrarily change will be made explicit to the consumer and companies must mail bills 25 days before their due dates. 
   The complaints of over 30,000 Americans have flooded the Federal Reserve Board in the last 2 months, urging the Board to make their recent credit card proposals permanent. H.R. 5244 will codify the Board's recent proposals so that they cannot be weakened. Congress can send a strong message of approval to the Board, encouraging them not to weaken their proposed protections for the American consumer. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   All of us here, representing Congress have the distinct honor and privilege of working in the one place where America's history meets the law of our land, the one place that displays the many historic monuments, memorials, and permanent images of our Nation. 
   One of the most powerful images in Washington for me is the image of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., conveying his dream during his 1963 ``March on Washington'' on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Dr. King dedicated his life to achieving equal rights for all Americans and had a clear vision on that day in 1963 for what America should look like today. 
   Dr. King understood government has a fundamental responsibility to meet the needs of all Americans regardless of race or economic class. His vision was for true equal economic opportunity for all. In his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. King spoke of the ``fierce urgency of now.'' He said, ``This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.'' Those words were true in 1963 and continue to remain true today. 
   My Democratic colleagues and I are working hard to ensure that Congress fulfills its responsibility to realizing Dr. King's dream. Within these first 100 hours of this Congress, we have already passed legislation to make the American people safer, make our Congress more honest and open, make life better for our seniors, and to give a living wage to all Americans. 
   As our Nation celebrates Martin Luther King Day, we remember him as a beacon of change. Dr. King helped change America by leading the civil rights movement. He gave people the faith and courage to work peacefully for change to stop racial discrimination, and promote equality and opportunity across America. So on this day, and everyday, let us recommit to changing and working to bring about opportunity for all Americans. 
   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Dr. King's birthday, let us carry out his vision for social justice, equality, and peace. Let us continue to work together for the common cause, in the effort of humanity and brotherhood, so all people may enjoy a better way of life and a higher dignity.

   I want to thank my friend and colleague from California, Representative ESHOO, for sponsoring this resolution. 
   Leo McCarthy was many things in his life. He was an airman, a politician, and a life-long public servant. But above all things, he was a decent and compassionate man. 
   Leo was first elected to the California Assembly in 1968. 
   He served with honor and distinction as its Speaker from 1974 and 1980 and went on to serve as Lieutenant Governor of California for three terms. 
   Leo's accomplishments in office express the compassion and love he possessed for his fellow man. 
   His leadership helped change the way California looked at issues like child care, breast cancer research, elder care, and treatment for the mentally ill. 
   Beyond his professional work, he was a loving family man, and dedicated friend and mentor to countless of my California peers. 
   I urge my colleagues to honor the life of this good man. May he rest in peace.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to address the House for one minute. 
   I rise today to voice my strong support for H. Res. 942. This bipartisan resolution recognizes the significance of Black History Month. 
   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Representative Al Green, for introducing this resolution. 
   February is Black History Month, a time for all Americans to learn about and recognize the heritage and achievements of African Americans. 
   African Americans have made historic contributions to this Nation in all walks of life--from economics, to education, to politics and the arts. 
   Sadly, African Americans have been victims of too much discrimination, segregation, and hatred in their history in the United States. 
   That is why it is so fitting we stand here together today, one body in unity, to recognize the amazing accomplishments of our Nation's African Americans. 
   We also stand here to recognize that the ethnic and racial diversity within the United States is a wonderful thing, which only serves to strengthen our great Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to embrace this diversity, to support Black History Month, and to cast a vote in favor of H. Res. 942.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Alice Paul, a woman who dedicated her life to equality, to give her a Congressional Gold Medal. 
   Alice Paul was a remarkable person who made America more democratic by fighting for equal rights and creating opportunities for women to participate in politics. Thanks to Alice Paul, Nancy Pelosi was able to become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Even after her death, her influence continues to be significant on our society and culture. 
   Yesterday marked the day that on January 10, 1918, the House of Representatives first voted to give women the right to vote by approving the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Alice Paul spearheaded the effort to pass the 19th amendment, granting all American women the right to vote. 
   Because of Alice Paul's legacy, my daughters, Natalie and Jennifer, have the right to participate in the electoral process. My grandchildren and their children will forever have this right. 
   Alice Paul's contribution to America cannot be understated. Without her, women may not enjoy many of the rights they have today. 
   Please cosponsor this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bipartisan housing stimulus package. 
   The foreclosure crisis is hurting communities all across the Nation, and my district has been especially impacted: 4,523 families in my district have already lost their homes this year. Over 11,000 families in San Bernardino County are currently in default. And the San Bernardino-Riverside area in the Inland Empire, ranked #2 nationwide in foreclosure filings this year. 
   Everyone pays when there are foreclosures! Crime increases, home values decline, schools are affected, and cities run deficits which impacts revenues for local police, fire, and social services. 
   H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act which passed today, will help stabilize communities harmed by empty homes closed by foreclosure. It will provide loans and grants to States to buy and rehabilitate these properties and restore home values in neighborhoods. 
   The broader housing package is also important for many reasons: FHA Stabilization will allow lenders to refinance mortgages with FHA-insured loans to keep families in their homes. FHA Modernization increases FHA loan limits permanently to help high cost housing areas like the Inland Empire. The $7,500 Tax Credit for Homebuyers will help first-time homebuyers purchasing their first home. Low-income Housing Credit Reform modernizes the credit to increase affordable housing in underserved neighborhoods. The increase in Mortgage Revenue Bonds will allow states to issue more bonds for housing and use the proceeds to refinance subprime mortgages. 
   Finally, my amendment to the financial services committee bill, H.R. 5830, will promote in-person housing counseling to reach homeowners in default. This is more effective than sending a letter in the mail and will help prevent many foreclosures. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this housing stimulus package. This is the right thing to do and will keep people in their homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 1079, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of Financial Literacy Month and thank my friend and colleague Mr. HINOJOSA for offering it. I also want to thank Mr. HINOJOSA for his leadership of the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus (FELC), of which I am a proud member. 
   This year, the theme for my annual women's conference was ``Financial Literacy for Women,'' to recognize the importance of educating and encouraging women to take steps that could result in a better financial future for themselves and their families. At this conference, I invited speakers to motivate the women in my district to think about their finances and plan for the future. 
   That's what this resolution is all about, ensuring that individuals from all walks of life-- women, men, young and old--recognize the importance of managing personal finances, increase personal savings and reduce their debt. In these tough economic times it is important that we all prepare for our financial future. 
   The past few months we have seen rising prices for gas to food, more Americans losing their homes or the value in their homes, and rising unemployment. Earlier this year, the New Direction Congress passed an economic stimulus package to help families with high costs of gas, health care and groceries, and to jumpstart our slowing economy. Recovery Rebates will be in the hands of 130 million Americans, starting early in May. 
   The strain of the economic downturn on middle-class families demands a second growth and relief package now--and Congress will work in a bipartisan way to find solutions for the immediate crisis and for a long-term economic recovery for America. 
   I am a proud member of the House Financial Services Committee and last week, we held a markup of legislation that will help address the foreclosure crisis. The first bill, H.R. 5818 provides $15 billion in loans and grants to States to allow them to buy up repossessed properties. This will help ensure that abandoned homes don't stay on the market too long to keep home prices from dropping even further. The second bill, H.R. 5830 allows the FHA to insure up to $300 billion in subprime loans so that these families in danger of foreclosing can refinance into a more affordable loan. It also provides money to housing counselors to increase their efforts in underserved, poor, and minority communities. 
   Congress is doing its part to help stabilize our economy and help keep families in their homes. This resolution supports our efforts by calling on the President to issue a proclamation calling on the Federal Government, States, localities, schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities to observe Financial Literacy Month with community programs and events. This outreach will help us raise public awareness about financial education and is particularly important for our country's present and future economic well-being. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1079.

   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I rise in strong support of SCHIP or the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, CHAMP. There are 45 million uninsured, and 6 million are children. These are children that are being impacted. 
   We talk about having productive children in our school systems, improving the quality of life. You can't do it without a clean bill of health. We have the responsibility for our children. More than 70 percent of uninsured Hispanic children eligible for public coverage are not enrolled. This is unacceptable. 
   The CHAMP Act takes significant steps in reducing the barriers for all children and seniors of color in our community. Unfortunately, some of the Members are using this legislation as an opportunity to debate unrelated health care, specifically, immigration policies and other issues. 
   We need to make sure that we support the CHAMP act. A vote for CHAMP will help more citizen children get access to health coverage which can be a difference between life and death.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support H.R. 1427 and thank my friend, Chairman Frank, for leading the bipartisan effort in the Financial Services Committee on this important legislation. 
   This bill restores accountability by creating a modern, world-class regulator of the GSEs. It will also help us meet the critical shortage of affordable housing across the country through the creation of an Affordable Housing Fund. 
   In addition, Representatives Bean, Neugebauer, Moore and Miller have offered an amendment which I support. It clarifies that the new GSE regulator does not have the power to reduce the portfolios of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac based on artificial, so-called ``systemic risk.'' 
   This bill already gives the new regulator the FULL authority to supervise the GSE portfolios for safety, soundness and mission. I am not convinced that we should give it powers that bank regulators don't already have. I'm also not convinced that this amendment would in any way weaken the regulator's ability to make sure these companies operate safely and soundly. 
   It is critical that we do not limit the GSE's ability to provide homeownership for low, middle income, and minority families. 
   With their help, the GSEs have been able to increase homeownership rates across this country to a record level of 68 percent. That's impressive, but there is still much work to be done. 
   Homeownership rates in our minority communities are still far below the national average and nearly 2.2 million American families across the country are facing foreclosures. 
   This issue has a great deal of personal meaning for me. I grew up in a family of 15 children without a lot of money. I have been lucky enough to have worked hard and been able to achieve the American dream of owning a home. 
   Yet the dream of homeownership remains unattainable for millions of families. And many other families stand to lose their homes this year. 
   The new affordable housing fund created by H.R. 1427 will go far to help these families. And the new regulator created by this bill will ensure the safety and soundness of the GSEs so that they can continue their important mission in underserved communities for many years to come.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BACA. I appreciate Congresswoman Virginia Foxx talking about Mickey Mantle. He was an idol to many of us that played a lot of sports. I know as a young gentleman who was playing during that period of time, I admired Mickey Mantle. 
   Not only was he a positive role model for myself, in terms of trying to aspire to become a professional baseball player during the time I was in high school, but he was a coal miner, an individual that came from that area in Oklahoma that showed us that with hard work and dedication that you can make it. 
   Not only hearing the history of his personal life but what he did for a lot of us, because not only did he hit from both sides of the plate, which is very important for many individuals, we saw a switch hitter that could hit a lot from both the left and the right. We saw the competition that he led with Roger Maris during that period of time when they were competing for the home run championship. 
   I think having a post office named after Mickey Mantle is a great honor for many individuals, especially as we look at many of the Little Leaguers that play in Little League right now that look towards major league ball players who have played in the past who were a positive inspiration to many of us who say that if you can lead, you can be an inspiration to a lot of us. Therefore, I say that we should support this kind of legislation in naming the Mickey Mantle Post Office Building.

There are those who insist that undocumented immigrants have broken the law, that they are criminals, but what image do you get when you hear that someone is a criminal? Your image is of a murderer, of a thief, of a drug dealer, of someone who intensely wants to hurt another person. 
   These families who are wrongly called ``criminals'' come to the United States without the intent to hurt anyone. Yet there are anti-immigrant attacks that continue to say otherwise. What happened to the Ten Commandments? to love thy neighbor? 
   There are those who say that these families should play by the rules. The rules now are to form a line and to wait many years and to pay a huge fine, but the reality is the immigration process is so complicated that some of us would have a difficult time getting through it. We need comprehensive immigration reform to address the 12 to 14 million people in the United States to play by the rules and to also fix this broken system.

   Since my time in the California legislature, I've been a strong advocate to help preserve the legacy of Native Americans. It's important that we recognize their contributions to all aspects of our society, from our government to our language to history.  
   My bill encourages public elementary and secondary schools to enhance student understanding of Native Americans. We need more classroom instruction to focus on the history, culture and achievements and traditions of Native Americans. 
   Native Americans and their ancestors have played a critical role in the establishment of the freest country in the world. They have fought with valor and have died in every American war dating back to the Revolutionary War to the current wars. We in Congress must encourage greater awareness of the significant roles they have played in our national history.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman who is working on this for yielding me this time. 
   I rise tonight to honor Beatrice ``Bea'' Watson, a woman who dedicated her life to her community and to democracy. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from California for supporting this legislation on a bipartisan basis. Bea Watson died on August 5 at the age of 83. My bill, H.R. 3569, would designate the Santa Ana Avenue post office in Fontana, California, to be named in her honor. 
   My friend, Bea Watson, was a distinguished member of the Fontana community. Bea strove to make a positive difference in her hometown, a positive role model, and was an inspiration to all she came in contact with, and she led by example. 
   In over 45 years of life in Fontana, she served as an elected city councilmember, clerk, historical society officer, women's club president, chamber of commerce member, and organized many events such as parades and festivals in Fontana. 
   Bea was also recognized for her outstanding achievement and loved by all her community for her contributions to the Fontana community. Through her life, she received over 22 prestigious community awards, including the Fontana PTA Council Award, the Chamber of Commerce Outstanding Volunteer Award, the Community Spirit Award, and the California Legislature Woman of the Year Award. 
   In fact, Bea was so loved by the community that she was given the title of ``Mrs. Fontana'' or ``Busy Bea'' in the City of Fontana. Her efforts have touched the lives of her neighbors and her impact on the community will create a lasting legacy for generations to come. 
   As a volunteer, as a public servant and as a friend of her community, Bea proved herself to be an exemplary American. She was an excellent example of the meaning of volunteerism, and the quality of life in Fontana is better because she cared and gave so much of herself knowing that it would be a better place for others. 
   Although now gone, she will continue to serve as an inspiration to us all. It is with great honor that I ask Members of Congress to designate the post office in California's 43rd Congressional District as the Beatrice Watson Post Office. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the 53 Members from California who signed on.  
   Ex-Fontana Councilwoman Bea Watson Dies  
   Former City Clerk and Councilwoman Bea Watson, a tireless community volunteer who organized the city's Christmas and Fontana Days parades, died Sunday and will be remembered in a funeral service Monday. 
   She was 83. 
   Mrs. Watson was elected to two terms as Fontana city clerk, completing her eight years in office in December. She also served one term as a city councilwoman, from 1992 to 1996, losing her re-election bid to Manuel Mancha by 68 votes. 
   ``Bea was a citizen who truly cared for this community,'' said Linda Nunn, Fontana's deputy city clerk. ``She will truly be missed.'' 
   Mrs. Watson, who had been ill for three months, died of congestive heart failure at Legacy Rehabilitation Center in San Bernardino, according to Monica Bentley, her granddaughter. 
   She is survived by her husband, Larry Watson, a production specialist for KFON Channel 3, the city's government access station that airs meetings of the Fontana City Council and Planning Commission. 
   Other survivors include her daughter, Patricia Bentley, of Fontana, her brother, Fay Allen, of San Bernardino, her sister, Marguerite Botsford, of Fontana, Monica Bentley and another granddaughter, and a great-grandson. 
   Mrs. Watson's successor, City Clerk Tonia Lewis, said she would recruit friends and colleagues to help out with civic events. ``It's hard to fill her shoes because she was so active in everything,'' Lewis said. ``She didn't take no for an answer.'' 
   Mrs. Watson didn't let her ailments slow her down. ``Toward the end, she was so sick and so bent over,'' Lewis said. 
   ``She had a hard time getting around. She shuffled and it never stopped her,'' Lewis said. ``She just kept going, like the Energizer Bunny.'' 
   One of Mrs. Watson's passions was the Fontana Historical Society, which was established in 1974 but in recent years needed an infusion of volunteers to replace its aging roster. 
   ``She got me involved with the Historical Society because the society was failing for lack of membership. She hated to see things fail, so she would gather together people she knew who could handle those things,'' Lewis said. ``We had no choice.'' 
   Mrs. Watson was active in several other local organizations and events, including the Fontana Woman's Club, the Fontana Exchange Club; American Legion Auxiliary, Post 772; and the Fontana Chamber of Commerce. 
   She served on committees to commemorate Fontana's 50th and 75th anniversary celebrations, and organized the city's annual Community Prayer Breakfast since 1990. She also was an active volunteer for the Fontana Days Festival, the annual summer celebration of the city's 1913 founding by A.B. Miller, and organized the city's annual Festival of Winter. 
   ``The Christmas parade was her baby. She felt like she was doing it for the kids in Fontana,'' Lewis said. 
   Born July 1, 1924, in Ashtabula, Ohio, Mrs. Watson came West in 1944, living in San Bernardino before moving to Fontana. She attended San Bernardino Valley College and was a retired telephone company administrator with Pacific Bell.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the reauthorization of H.R. 2786, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA). However, I want to register my strong opposition to two amendments which were accepted during today's floor consideration: the Watt and Boren amendments. 
   Both of these amendments would prohibit NAHASDA funds from going to the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma until it fully recognizes all Cherokee Freedmen and their descendants as citizens of the Cherokee Nation. The status of the Freedmen descendents under the 1866 Treaty is a complex legal issue with a long history. Currently, it is being addressed before the Tribal Courts system. I think it would be premature for Congress to intervene before the courts have had a chance to examine the legal issues surrounding this case. 
   I also believe these amendments would set a bad precedent for the basic constitutional values of due process and the role of the judicial branch in resolving legal disputes. 
   NAHASDA is intended to provide housing assistance to low-income families on Indian country. These amendments are not only non-germane; they would harm the most vulnerable members of the Nation. I urge my colleagues to wait on the courts to rule on this case before legislating.

   I want to thank my friend, Congressman GEORGE MILLER, for sponsoring this bill and for his tireless efforts on behalf of working American families everywhere. 
   This past May, the Supreme Court handed down a decision with disastrous consequences for many Americans. With their ruling on the Ledbetter v. Goodyear case, the Court severely limited the right of workers to sue their employers for discrimination in pay. 
   If allowed to stand, this decision will strip many of the rights of employees who have been discriminated against on the basis of sex, race, color, or religion. 
   Today's bill rectifies the Supreme Court's misguided decision. 
   By restoring the longstanding interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act--Congress is ensuring that every American has the basic workplace protection they deserve. 
   Currently--women earn 76 cents to every dollar a man earns. This is unacceptable. Discrimination in the workplace must no longer be tolerated. We must ensure equal pay for equal work. 
   It is our duty to protect the rights of every American--no matter their skin color, gender, or income level.

I want to thank my good friend Congressman Al Green for his efforts in raising this bipartisan awareness on this outrageous issue. This is the year 2007, and yet we continue to see the hanging of nooses in America, that is shameful, as a form of intimidation and racial discrimination. 
   Every child has the right to attend school freely. They should not live in fear. And let me tell you, when this happens, many of our children live in that kind of a fear and that kind of intimidation, and that should not happen to our children, no matter who they are or what color they are. 
   Every American has the right to a workplace that is free from discrimination and hate. We are all children of God, and the Lord has taught us to love thy neighbor and treat each other with dignity and respect, not with hate or discrimination acts like this, but with kindness and love. 
   Nooses remind us of the dark chapters of the past; yet they continue to be used to create fear today, to create fear today. There have been over 40 suspected hate crimes involving nooses in the last 4 months. 
   As Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I strongly support this resolution, because this type of hate affects all of our communities, not just the African American community, but all of us. We should live without fear or intimidation in this country and allow everyone to have that kind of freedom. 
   Over the years, more people have died from lynching than there have been victims at Pearl Harbor, and many of them were African Americans, Italians, Jewish and Mexican Americans. 
   We stand together in solidarity to say the hanging of nooses will not be tolerated by anyone, anymore, for any reason, and I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and support this resolution.

   One in seven households now spends more than half of its income on housing and nearly one million men, women, and children are homeless. 
   How can we claim to be the leader of the free world yet allow so many of our own to be chained by the bonds of poverty? 
   Unfortunately, there are no programs to help build housing for low-income households. This bill will construct affordable housing for the poorest among us who need it the most. 
   It will help families who have lost their homes in the subprime mortgage crisis or due to a family financial crisis, such as ill health or job loss. 
   It will also help reduce homelessness and the number of Americans living in unsafe housing conditions. 
   Because of this bill, more nurses, teachers, firefighters, and police officers throughout California will have access to affordable housing. 
   The bottom line is that no family should have to choose between paying for food and medicine and safe, decent housing. 
   H.R. 2895 restores our Nation's promise of a decent home for every American family and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   The first half of 2007 has included the worst record in history for airline delays. So far, more than one quarter of all flights this year have been delayed. Yet, airline traffic is expected to grow at a rapid pace--with a tripling of the number of passengers flying by the year 2025. H.R. 2881 is an important first step in addressing America's transportation dilemma. It modernizes our aging air traffic control system, and strengthens airport infrastructure to reduce delays and improve safety. This bill provides the necessary funds to improve America's airport infrastructure. 
   H.R. 2881 also includes critical consumer protections by creating a Passenger Bill of Rights, which provides for emergency contingency plans and greater oversight by the FAA into flight delays. In the area I represent, southern California, flight delays and congestion are a major problem. H.R. 2881 provides much needed reforms to help my local airport, the LA/Ontario International Airport, improve its infrastructure--so it may accommodate much of the expected increase in air traffic for the area in the coming years. 
   These reforms will reduce delays, increase capacity, enhance security, and promote new competition at Ontario airport and ultimately help generate much needed economic development and job growth in my district. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2881 is vital to modernizing America's air traffic system, reducing flight delays, and ensuring our Nation is prepared for the massive increases in number of flights we will see over the next decade. 
   Again, I express my full support of this bill and urge my fellow colleagues to adopt its final passage.

   The human dignity of these families have been stepped on. We are a country with moral principles and core family values. There is no blanket solution for the immigration crisis.

   She has fought for paycheck fairness for women during every Congress for the past decade and should be commended for her tenacity. 
   We are a nation with a constitution and bill of rights. 
   It is sad to admit that in a country as prosperous as ours, women only earn 77 cents to every dollar that men earn. 
   It's even worse for minority women: with African American women earning 66 cents to the dollar of Latinas earning 55 cents to the dollar. 
   This bill corrects this injustice by making it illegal for employers to pay unequal wages to men and women who perform equal work. 
   In 1923, women's suffragist Alice Paul, wrote the Equal Rights Amendment which would guarantee ``equal justice under law'' to all citizens. I was proud to sponsor a bill that would honor Alice Paul with a congressional Gold Medal for her heroic leadership in fighting for the ERA and in working to achieve women's right to vote. My bill, H.R. 406 passed the house with 406 cosponsors, a historic record of support! While the ERA was never ratified, the Paycheck Fairness Act brings us closer to achieving its intent. 
   Wage discrimination keeps women down and harms the overall economy. It also represents the worst of America. We must confront discrimination head on and ensure that all Americans, regardless of gender, receive equal pay for equal work.

   Mr. Speaker, we will never forget those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. 
   The House remains committed to defeating terrorists and their supporters who threaten the United States and to providing our armed forces with the resources and support to do so effectively and safely. 
   Let us honor the victims of 9/11, and reaffirm our commitment to defending America from those who would do us harm.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H. Res. 448. This bipartisan resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should establish a National Cancer Research Month. 
   This year marks the 100th anniversary of the American Association for Cancer Research. 
   Thanks to research and expanded cancer education, we have more early detectors, preventative measures, and treatments for cancer than ever before. 
   But we still have a long road ahead of us. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the San Bernardino County alone, nearly 2,500 Americans will die from a cancer-related illness in the upcoming year. 
   Every American is touched by this horrible disease; thanks to great strides, the number of cancer-related deaths is declining. 
   Strengthening research and public awareness of cancer will lead to more scientific breakthroughs that can increase survival rates for cancer patients--and give our cancer survivors a better quality of life. 
   I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for hope, and to support this vital resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 734, a resolution that discloses the corruptive withholding of information in Iraq. The Administration cannot continue to hide corruption in the Iraqi Government. We cannot allow this abuse of the classification process. Americans have the right to know the truth about the situation in Iraq. The fact of the matter is, our military presence in Iraq is not making our country any safer. Instead, in my district alone, we have lost 13 brave young men to this war. 
   The Iraq War is costing the American taxpayers ten billion dollars a month. With the money we have spent in Iraq, we could have hired an additional 7.8 million teachers. Americans should be outraged by this abuse of the system. Americans are paying for the war with their money and more importantly, the lives of their loved ones. I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for honesty and accountability by supporting this resolution.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, the blood, sweat and tears of this Nation's immigrants are interwoven in the fabric that makes America great. We are a Nation founded with a Constitution, a Bill of Rights, on the ideals of family, equality, dignity, and respect for life. 
   Immigrants contribute to America. They pay taxes, worship in our churches, serve us proudly in our military. 
   Henry Cejudo, this summer, won an Olympic gold medal in free-style wrestling. Sergeant Rafael Peralta is being recognized with a military decoration for making the ultimate sacrifice. 
   Immigrants throughout our history have contributed to making our communities a lot stronger, but anti-immigrant rhetoric continues to cloud the  picture. Comprehensive immigration is the only way to solve the problem, an approach that respects our core American values of family, equality and human rights. 
   I challenge my colleagues, as we approach the next session, to look beyond the anti-immigrant rhetoric and join me in comprehensive immigration reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (CALLING FOR RELEASE OF ISRAELI SOLDIERS HELD CAPTIVE BY HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. 
   I rise today to voice my strong support for H. Res. 107. This bipartisan resolution calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah. 
   I want to thank my friend from New York, Congressman GARY ACKERMAN, for introducing this resolution. 
   More than 7 months have passed since July of 2006, when Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel to attack a military post, killing two soldiers and wounding and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. 
   Less than 1 month later, Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Israel and ambushed Israeli troops patrolling the border with Lebanon, killing three soldiers and kidnapping two, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. 
   These despicable acts occurred despite Israel's good faith efforts, which included its total withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May of 2000. 
   These two terrorist groups have withheld all information on the health and welfare of the men they have kidnapped. Defying the most basic standards of conduct, they have prevented medical personnel and members of the International Red Cross from having access to the kidnapped Israelis. 
   In spite of these terrorist attacks, the strength of the Israeli people has not wavered. In these difficult times, our support of Israel must not waver either. 
   The United States must stay committed to the welfare and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic nation with secure borders. 
   Our Congress must stand in one voice and condemn Hamas and Hezbollah, and their primary sponsors, Iran and Syria, for these cross border attacks. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting Israel and condemning these heinous acts, and cast a vote in favor of H. Res. 107.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (HONORING THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND SUPPORTING THE VICTIMS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Clay in reference to H.R. 778. I would also like to thank my good friend ZOE LOFGREN for her work with the California delegation and her leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor in a bipartisan fashion. And I state ``in a bipartisan fashion'' because it impacts the whole State of California. 
   Last week's disaster was a painful time for all of us in the communities of Southern California. Recent estimates show that the fire destroyed over 2,800 structures, including over 2,000 homes. And the fires also destroyed more than 500 acres of land in an area that doubles the size of New York City. 
   Seven people were killed, 113 firefighters and 26 civilians were injured, and I state, 113 firefighters and 26 civilians were injured. These are people that were willing to fight the fires to save not only their own, but to save the lives of many individuals who were impacted. 
   This past weekend, I had a chance to see the devastation firsthand and visit with many of our evacuees in the shelter included in my district, with a total of 4,000 that we evacuated into the district at the Orange County Fairgrounds in my area. And while we can never really understand the losses suffered by so many, we share their pain. We share their pain. 
   We stand together today united as one House first and foremost to say thank you for the heroic actions and sacrifices of the first responders. And I say ``the first responders,'' the firefighters who are willing to put themselves on the line to save many others, law enforcement officers, the National Guard, and many of the volunteers. 
   We also stand here to say to the people of Southern California, we are with you. We are committed to rebuilding our homes and communities in California and rebuilding the lives of those who have lost so much. Our first priority right now is to make sure that everyone is housed, clothed and fed, and after that we will begin to rebuild. But once the smoke is cleared, we will work towards a long-term solution to do everything we can to prevent disasters like this from ever happening again. 
   We have to take a realistic look at the situation. All data indicates that the fires nationwide are increasing in size and intensity. Those of us in Congress must respond to these warnings. Our planet is changing; we must acknowledge that. We need to meet the new challenges we are facing. We need to better fund our firefighters and our Forest Service. And we have to take a serious look at where we build our developments. 
   We must do everything in our power to prevent destruction of life, property, and our environment. Let us take the time to reflect on what we have lost. And we thank God, and I say we thank God for what we still have. Let us say thanks to those heroes who pulled us through this horrible week. Let all those who have lost a home or a loved one know that we stand with you. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support H.R. 3867, the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act. I want to thank my colleague, Chairperson VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, for her leadership. 
   Small business is the backbone of our economy. And I state, small business is the backbone of our economy. Over 4 million minority businesses represent almost 20 percent of all firms in this country. They generate nearly $7 billion annual revenue and employ almost 5 million workers. And I state, 5 million workers. 
   Minorities make up 32 percent of the population of this country, but they only represent 18 percent of all small businesses. This bill will close the gap, and I state, will close the gap by improving the Small Business Administration's small and minority business procurement programs and will help disabled veterans, women, minority businesses, both Hispanic, black, Asians and others, and provides small business minority businesses the assistance they need to grow and prosper. 
   Like in the Inland Empire where the majority of businesses are small businesses and represent the largest growth and the engine that drives the economy in the State of California, SBA 8(a) programs, which open the doors to more than half of all Federal minority business contracts, have not been updated since 1988. 
   This bill revamps the program to improve 8(a) firms' ability to secure in the Federal sector. It is time to level the playing field so the small minority business firms have equal access to Federal contracts. Every dollar invested in the 8(a) program results in over $4 million in contracts to minority entrepreneurs. This translates into more jobs across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   This currently will feed 38 million Americans who do not have enough to eat. We are in an economic recession. People have lost their jobs. People have lost their homes because of foreclosures. Gas prices are going up. This farm bill will put food on the table for over 13 million American families. We have raised the food stamp benefit index to keep up with the lost of living. These changes will help an additional 10 million Americans, including poor working families, the elderly, the disabled, and the veterans. 
   We expanded the USDA snack programs under the fresh fruits and vegetables. We will leave no child behind. This will feed them.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H. Res. 721. This resolution recognizes the 60th anniversary of the landmark Mendez v. Westminster decision. 
   I want to thank my friend, Congressman CHARLIE GONZALEZ, for sponsoring this bill and championing the continued fight for civil and equal rights for the Latino community. 
   The Mendez v. Westminster decision ended segregation of Mexican American students in the state of California, and set the precedent for the history making Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954. 
   I stand here today, a Mexican American serving in Congress, because of the courage of people like Sylvia Mendez and her father, Gonzalo Mendez. 
   They, along with other brave individuals, stood up for the 5,000 Hispanic-American children who were victims of unconstitutional discrimination, by being forced to attend separate ``Mexican'' schools in the school districts of Orange County. 
   This resolution recognizes the significance of this anniversary, and honors Sylvia Mendez for her continued efforts to fight for equality. It also encourages our schools to teach students about the historical significance of the Mendez v. Westminster case, and the positive impact it had on the future of America. 
   I urge my colleagues to show their support in the continuing fight against school segregation, and to cast a vote in favor of H. Res. 721.

   Congress has made it clear over the last weeks that we are standing our ground on behalf of the American family. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush is playing politics on the backs of our seniors and today vetoed H.R. 6331. This is unacceptable. Congress will not stand by and watch our seniors on Medicare get turned away next time they go see their doctor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1676, the Native American Homeownership Opportunity Act of 2007. This important legislation reauthorizes the Section 184 Indian Loan Program, which offers home ownership, property rehabilitation, new construction, and refinance opportunities for Native Americans. 
   I want to thank my friend, Mr. BOREN, for sponsoring this bill and championing this cause which is of great significance to so many Native families in this country. 
   Section 184 advances the opportunity for Native Americans seeking homeownership and addresses the issue of lack of mortgage lending for homes in Indian Country. 
   The Section 184 program guarantees single-family residential loans for Native American borrowers, thereby increasing the homeownership for Native Americans.  
   While many Native Americans struggle to own a home and provide for their families, H.R. 1676 eases that burden. The program provides a 100 percent guarantee of the outstanding principal and interest and payment of other necessary and allowable expenses. 
   Section 184 allows for many Native Americans to become first-time homeowners. According to HUD, since the start of the program roughly 4,200 loans have been guaranteed. 
   Almost 200 tribes participate in the Section 184 program nationwide, 31 of which are from my home State of California. 
   In the Inland Empire alone, the Saboba Band of Luiseno Indians, the Cabazon Band of Cahulla Mission Indians and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians have been able to provide homeownership for many families through this program. 
   H.R. 1676 will help close the homeownership gap and increase for Native Americans in my area and all across the country. Let's help all Americans achieve the dream of owning a home. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   First, I would like to thank Chairman Frank; Ranking Member Spencer Bachus, the minority member; and I'd also like to thank Representative Judy Biggert, who is also a cosponsor of the legislation and who is managing this on the floor this morning. I also want to take time to thank all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives for their support. 
   This is bipartisan legislation that has 406 cosponsors out of the 435 Members. The title of the bill is H.R. 406, and there are 406 cosponsors. 
   I also want to thank my staff for their hard work and dedication to the passage of this legislation. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 406, the Alice Paul Women's Suffrage Congressional Gold Medal Act, a bill to honor Alice Paul, a woman who dedicated her life to equality. This legislation is supported by the National Council of Women's Organizations, the Alice Paul Institute, the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum, the League of Women Voters, MANA, the 4-E-R-A, and the National Organization of Women. 
   This legislation awards Alice Paul and the movement she spearheaded the Congressional Gold Medal, to recognize her role in the women's suffrage movement and in advancing equal rights, and I state equal rights, for women. 
   Many people do not know about Alice Paul, but today they will. It is my hope that this legislation will ratify that fact. 
   Because of Alice Paul and the work of other suffragists, we have the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution that guarantees that women have the right to vote. Women have the right to be Members of Congress, State officials, and to participate in local policies and the ability to run for public office. That's why here in Congress, we currently have 87 women in Congress. Because of Alice Paul, Speaker Pelosi can be the Democratic leader right here in the 110th Congress. Because of Alice Paul, Senator Clinton can run for the highest office in the Nation and maybe be the President of the United States of America. 
   Alice Paul was a remarkable person who made America more democratic by fighting for equal rights and creating opportunities for women. She advocated for women in our country as well as in the Americas, within the confines of the United Nations. Alice Paul helped draft the equal rights amendment in 1923. In 1923. Alice Paul lobbied to ensure that sex discrimination was included in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   I want to stress the blood, sweat, and tears that went hand in hand with the women's suffrage movement. Alice Paul truly gave of herself. She motivated, she empowered women to fight, to have courage, and to challenge the status quo. 
   Alice Paul's leadership was unyielding, tenacious, and never self-serving. She suffered imprisonment, solitary confinement, and force feeding when officials tried sabotage her hunger strike. She dedicated her life for women's rights. A true American. A true champion. An American worthy of our gratitude and never-ending respect. 
   Her work must be honored and preserved by congressional acknowledgment. The Congressional Gold Medal is only a small token in comparison to the legacy that Alice Paul gave us all. Alice Paul's contribution to America cannot be understated. For this reason I urge all Members to support its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Now the most vulnerable of beneficiaries of Medicaid, children and the disabled, are faced with a major crisis. This bill has bipartisan support, this is not about politics. It's about helping hardworking families and the poorest among us. 
   This bill includes a moratorium of 7 CMS regulations, preventing the stripping of over $20 billion in Federal Medicaid funding over the next 5 years to States for vital programs and services. These programs and services will only shrink and shrivel if they are put against the wall to eat up these costs. 
   Even school districts, like Rialto Unified School District from my district, will face difficult challenges in providing direct health services to the 30,000 students it currently serves. 
   Cutting these valuable services at a time when many States, including California are facing record budget deficits is not an option. The poorest amongst us on Medicaid are most affected. We cannot turn our backs during these troubling times of increasing foreclosures and rising gas prices. 
   Cancer does not distinguish between incomes, why should health care coverage?

This is important legislation that would establish a commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of the American Latino.

   This is a bipartisan legislation that basically asks for a study to create a National Museum of the American Latino. Bipartisan. 
   Currently, there are over 45 million Latinos in the United States, including Puerto Rico. The social, cultural and economic contributions of Latinos in the United States have an important history, an important history, and are growing daily. We must realize that. 
   American Latinos are natives to many different parts of the world. Some are from Puerto Rico, some are from South America, while others have roots and ties to Mexico. But while we hail from different countries, including from right here in the United States, we have different backgrounds, and many of us share a similar experience and a wealth of common values.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation to make Americans safer. 
   One of the most important functions of government is to protect people. 
   On September 11, 2001, our Nation suffered the devastating terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and at the Pentagon. Thousands of people were killed, many were injured, and all of us were scarred. 
   We vowed to do whatever was necessary to protect our homeland. We owe it to the victims and their families. We owe it to all Americans. 
   And we are taking a big step to make Americans safe. 
   Congress is now following the recommendations made by the bipartisan commission formed to report on the 9/11 failures. 
   This Commission had both Republicans and Democrats, men and women who have served our country well. They worked hard to produce a report that would help us understand what needed to be done. 
   The 9/11 Commission issued 41 recommendations to the Administration and Congress that were designed to improve homeland security, prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, and develop strategies for preventing the spread of Islamic terrorism. 
   Many of these recommendations have only been partially implemented. Others have been ignored. 
   For more than 5 years after the September 11 attacks, Republican leaders refused to take action on many of the recommendations essential to the security of the American people. 
   The 9/11 Commissioners have routinely given the Bush Administration and Congress failing grades on implementing the recommendations and taking actions to protect Americans. 
   So it is important that we pass this legislation. 
   This bill includes many provisions to improve homeland security, including steps to prevent terrorist attacks by speeding up the installation of explosive detection systems to monitor passengers and baggage at airports, requiring 100 percent inspection of air cargo over the next 3 years and 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound shipping containers over the next 5 years.  
   These steps are especially important to the people I represent in the Inland Empire of California because our region is an important transportation route for cargo arriving in the United States at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and at LAX airport. 
   We must make sure that dangerous weapons or chemicals or other hazardous material are not brought into our country and then traveling on highways or railroad tracks or stored in warehouses in the San Bernardino area. 
   With this legislation, we are also creating a grant program to help first responders have the equipment they need and make sure they can communicate with one another in an emergency. 
   These are just some of the important and necessary ways we are making Americans safer by passing this legislation.

   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of overriding the President's veto of the SCHIP bill, H.R. 3963. 
   In the face of job loss and a foreclosure crisis I rise again to fight for SCHIP. There are more families going hungry in my district each day, and the number of uninsured children is skyrocketing out of control. 
   As a parent and grandparent, I understand the despair we all feel when a child falls asleep crying in your arms and all you can do is reassure them. 
   I ask President Bush, how will you answer the pleas of help from these parents? 
   Parents are struggling. Local newspapers in my District report a 6.2 percent unemployment rate, which is much higher than the national average of 5.0 percent. 
   This loss of jobs translates to fewer parents covered by employment-based health insurance, which means more uninsured children. 
   This week we celebrated the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. Let us remember him as we fight today to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens, our children! 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in rescuing health care for our children, and support this veto override.

And while only 27 years of age, he is already a licensed minister at the Christian Life Center Apostolic Church in Ontario, California. 
   In a world where too many of us have turned a blind eye to the problems of our neighbors, Minister Santos has led a life filled with service to others. And I say service to others. He is the founder and president of Affirming Community Initiatives, a nonprofit organization that provides food, clothing and youth programs to the underserved in our Inland communities. 
   Let us thank Minister Santos for serving as our guest House Chaplain today, and recognize him for the example he has set for many others to follow. He is truly a role model for us. We should all strive to live our lives in such a selfless and truly Christian manner, as he has done.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of hateful rhetoric surrounding the immigration debate on this floor. Some of my colleagues stand here and compare immigrants to terrorists and say that immigrants are lazy and are looking for a free ride, when in fact they have made many contributions to this country, positive contributions. 
   Let me tell you about an honorable immigrant family from Rialto. Corporal Jorge Gonzalez was one of the first soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq, and I say in Iraq, for this country. The wife and infant son were left behind to apply for special permission just so that their United States flag could be draped over his coffin. Jorge was willing to die to protect this country, willing to die to protect this country; but since he was an immigrant, there are some in this body who would call him a criminal. Immigrants are not criminals. They are soldiers. They are our friends. They are our students. They are our doctors. 
   It is time for Congress to recognize what is right. Stop this hateful rhetoric, stop the lies. Honor the sacrifices made by men like Jorge. 
   Lord, help us understand and pass real immigration.

   The headline from yesterday's San Bernardino Sun, my local paper, read ``Area Number 3 in Nation in Foreclosures.'' 
   Right now, one in 43 houses in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties are undergoing foreclosure. Our families are being torn apart by this crisis. The American Dream of homeownership has become a nightmare for them. 
   I had a town hall meeting in my district on foreclosures last weekend. I am glad that I did because we were able to assist a lot of families. These families are scared and need help. They feel hopeless, unless Congress addresses this issue. 
   Our families said that the teaser rate was resetting to a payment that was more than half of their income. Another said they had to take a second job just to afford the new payments after the rates were adjusted. It was clear that these families were steered into loans that they could not afford. 
   On the other hand, other constituents told me that the interest rate they received on the loans was higher than what they were told that they would receive. Too many consumers are victims of this type of predatory bait-and-switch practice. 
   This bill includes an amendment which I offered which requires additional disclosures to provide consumers information before signing. This will help put an end to the abusive practice and ensure that consumers have accurate information about the cost of their loan so that they know what they are buying. 
   H.R. 3915 will help put an end to predatory lending once and for all. And it prohibits prepayment penalties, outlaws discriminatory steering practices and bans yield spread premiums. It also includes stronger underwriting standards to help stop predatory lenders in their tracks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, yesterday the House of Representatives, the State of California, and the Nation, lost a leader and a good friend of ours, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. We certainly will miss her. My wife, Barbara, and I extend a heartfelt condolence to her family, friends, staff, children, her five grandchildren and to Jim. 
   Today we pay tribute to a real trailblazer, a pioneer, the first African American woman to chair a committee, a positive role model, a person who created hope for many individuals, a person who was a well liked and well respected individual. 
   In a role as a public servant, she touched the lives of many individuals.  Here in the House, I have heard many individuals talk about how she was a nice person and how she was well liked. 
   As Chair of House Administration she worked closely with the Congressional TriCaucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in trying to obtain the fairness and equality for all of us. She was pleasant to work with. I have had the opportunity to work with Juanita and served with her in the California State Assembly prior to coming to Washington, DC. 
   She has always been a strong advocate for the poor, the disadvantaged and those that were underrepresented. I know that she spent much time going into my district and speaking to a lot of the poor and disadvantaged in San Bernardino, in the Inland Empire, because she cared about the poor, not only in that area, but she cared about equal representation. She wanted to ensure that we had the numbers or bodies of people who represent us here in Congress. She worked for me in my campaign when I first ran out there. 
   She worked with me also in a variety of areas, but one of those that has been mentioned tonight has been the Alameda Corridor. She really took it to heart because she knew the Alameda Corridor and what it meant was a lifeline to California, to Southern California, in the area of transportation, not only to the L.A. International Airport, but Ontario International Airport that is also affiliated with that area. 
   Juanita really believed, because she knew the infrastructure and the growth and the population in the area, and she put a high priority on transportation. She was a friend and a loyal supporter, and I am grateful. 
   As a friend, she will be deeply missed, but she will not be forgotten. She fought for justice, she fought for equality so that all individuals will not experience the prejudice and racism that most of us have experienced throughout our life, that she wanted life to be better for others. She is a strong voice for many. Juanita Millender-McDonald will be remembered for her dedication to public service, tireless work on behalf of her constituents, and standing for the rights of women and minorities, and, overall, her desire to make our country a better place. 
   We love you, Juanita Millender-McDonald.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. 
   Among large metro areas my district in the Inland Empire has the fourth highest rate of foreclosure filings in the Nation and was the hardest hit area in California through the first half of 2007. 
   In San Bernardino County alone there were 19,185 foreclosure filings during the first half of 2007, representing a staggering 345 percent increase from the previous year. Overall, there is one foreclosure filing for every 33 households in the Inland Empire. 
   These numbers go to show that the subprime crisis we are experiencing today is not an abstract issue. These are real people who are going through painful struggles to stay in their home and keep their families together. 
   Regrettably, when banks and loan servicers decide to help these families by forgiving a part of a loan, that debt is then treated as a source of income which in turn makes the forgiven amount subject to tax. 
   Families who are already facing foreclosure should not have to face the additional burden of paying tax on phantom income. 
   This bill restores fairness for homeowners who are financially and economically distressed by eliminating that requirement. It will play a central role in helping American families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Community Food Projects is a forward-thinking grant program that encourages innovative local efforts to expand the availability of affordable and healthful foods. This program is critical to those who live in both urban and rural areas who may not have regular access to nutritional foods needed to raise a healthy family. 
   I urge my colleagues to voice their support for healthy families and vote ``yes'' on S. 3597.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, the nutrition title in the Conference Report for the 2008 Farm Bill is a monumental achievement for the millions of Americans who struggle to put enough healthy, nutritious food on the table. I know it's not always easy to make ends meet and to put food on the table each day. I've walked in those shoes, and I've sat at that table. But with this bill we start to fulfill our responsibility to our neighbors. We have improved and strengthened food stamps and other important nutrition programs for our children and seniors. I want to take a few minutes to expand upon some of the accomplishments that are in this nutrition title. 
   First off, we have updated the name of the program. The new name will be SNAP: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. We needed a new name because there are no places left in this country where food stamps actually are ``stamps.'' Instead, like with other modern transactions, people swipe their cards at the store to access their benefits. This has been a huge success for reducing fraud and stigma in the program. We hope and expect that the new name and new image for the program will help us to continue to chip away at the stigma that keeps some proud people, especially senior citizens, from signing up for help in paying for their groceries and puts them at risk of hunger. 
   The name reflects the fact that the program provides a ``supplement'' to help people afford an adequate diet when their own resources are not quite enough. We also say ``nutrition,'' instead of ``food,'' because the program is about more than just food. It has got a vibrant nutrition education component to help our low-income population learn about healthy diets and make the choices that will improve their health status over their lifetimes. So I'm very proud of this new name for food stamps: an established program that is one of the best Government programs we've got. Let me be clear, however, that in changing the name and eliminating food stamp coupons we did not intend to make any other policy changes to the program. 
   I think the biggest single accomplishment in the nutrition title is to end the decades of erosion in the value of food stamp benefits. We're all aware of the rising gas and food prices of recent months and the bite they've taken out of the pocketbooks of most Americans. But for many low-income Americans the squeeze has been getting tighter for decades, as the value of their food stamps has been able to purchase less and less food with each passing year. Food stamp benefits average only $1  per person per day. It's not easy to purchase a healthy, nutritious diet on such a limited amount. 
   So in this bill we have addressed this problem. We made critical improvements, and, for the first time in the program's history, we have ensured that, in every aspect, the food stamp program keeps its purchasing power over time. We raise the standard deduction from $134 to $144 and index it for inflation. That is an important accomplishment. It helps about 10 million people afford more food--families, seniors, people with disabilities--all types of low-income food stamp recipients are helped by this change. We raise the minimum benefit, and index it for 
   inflation. We uncap the dependent care deduction so that families can deduct the full cost of the child care they so desperately depend on to hold down their jobs. And we index the asset limits. We don't know what the future will hold. Hopefully, the high inflation of the past months will shortly subside as the country gets back on track. But we now can rest assured, as never before, that if there is substantial inflation our low-income families and senior citizens won't lose out on food. 
   For me what this bill really is about is people. It's about our senior citizens who have worked hard their whole lives and deserve better than to face the fear of hunger in their last years. It's about children, who come home from school and look to their parents to put a nutritious meal on the table. 
   One of the groups that will be most helped are our Nation's senior citizens. We were able to increase the minimum benefit, which goes predominantly to senior citizens, from $10 to about $14 a month. This is the first increase in almost 30 years in the minimum benefit. I would have liked to have increased it even more, but this change will help make it worthwhile for some of our seniors who qualify for a low benefit to participate in the program. We did this by setting the minimum benefit at 8 percent of the thrifty food plan for a single person. Because USDA adjusts the thrifty food plan every year for increases in food prices, so too will the minimum benefit now adjust. In addition, because of higher food prices in some places, like Alaska, Hawaii, and some of the territories, seniors in these places will now also see a modestly higher minimum benefit. For example in some parts of Alaska, the minimum benefit will be as high as $25 per month. 
   In this bill we've also excluded retirement accounts from assets and indexed the asset limits to inflation. These changes will help seniors and working families to save for the future. It makes no sense to require people who fall on hard times to virtually liquidate all of the savings they've managed to put away in order to get help paying for groceries for themselves and their families. Our seniors, especially, may have no ability to replace these savings, and as a result, no cushion to deal with unexpected expenses. And a working family who is forced to spend down savings now will be that much closer to poverty in their older years. So this is an important change for the long-term ability of low-income individuals to move toward financial independence and for our senior citizens to be able to retain an ability to support themselves in their retirement. 
   But I also want to reaffirm that we did not take away, as President Bush proposed, the State option in the food stamp program to design a more appropriate asset test at the State level. In my home State of California the legislature and Governor have been working together to design an ``expanded categorical eligibility'' program that will revise the asset limit for many food stamp recipients and make it easier for them to save for the future. I hope that other States consider this option, and I urge USDA to work with other States to promote this important policy. 
   In another major improvement for senior citizens, we have expanded to seniors a State option from the 2002 farm bill that dramatically reduces paperwork requirements. This policy is known as ``simplified reporting'' and it will allow seniors to participate without filing paperwork for 12-month periods, unless they have a major increase in their income that makes them ineligible for food stamps. I urge USDA to make this option as simple and streamlined for seniors and States 
   as possible, and to find ways to insulate food stamp benefits from interactions with other programs that low-income seniors participate in, particularly Medicaid. 
   Finally, we have heard reports that despite the overwhelming success of the electronic benefits, some seniors can find the technology confusing. For those at the minimum benefit who receive maybe only $10 to $20 a month, we've heard concerns that if they don't use their benefits fast enough those benefits can be taken away--or moved ``offline''--sometimes in as short a period as 3 months, with the senior citizen not understanding why this has occurred. I don't think this is a very common problem, but it is understandable that a senior citizen might want to store up small benefits to use at one shopping trip every few months, rather than have to keep track of the card every month. This bill allows States to move benefits off-line after 6 months of inactivity, but requires them to notify the household and restore the benefits within 48 hours upon request. This benefit reinstatement should be a simple process, and States should aim to help seniors navigate it, so we don't have our seniors being bounced around an EBT call center trying to figure out what happened to their food stamp benefits. 
   For children and families, the biggest change we make is the increase and indexing of the standard deduction which will significantly boost the ability of low-wage workers to afford food for their families, especially over time. More than $5 billion of the nutrition title's 10-year investment go to this change, which primarily benefits families with children. 
   We also lift the limit on the dependent care deduction. This change will help about 100,000 families who pay out-of-pocket child care costs above $175 per child per month, or $200 for infants, by recognizing that money that is needed to pay for child care so that a parent can work is not available to purchase food. On average, families who are helped will receive an additional $40 a month, or $500 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The dependent care cap has not been raised since the early 1990s, despite the increases in the costs of safe, reliable child care. Families incur all types of costs in order to secure child care for their children, and USDA should continue to allow all of these expenses to count toward the deduction--such as transportation costs to and from day care and the cost of informal care. Finally, as States roll this out to the 100,000 families currently on the program, it is important that they make it easy for eligible families to claim the new deduction. Families shouldn't have to make extra trips to the food stamp office or be at risk of losing benefits if they fail to claim a new higher deduction. A household should never have its benefits cut or reduced because of a failure to document child care expenses, but should be given a full opportunity to receive the higher deduction if they have expenses above the current capped amounts. 
   We hear all the time that despite the importance and success of the food stamp program, for most families the benefits run out before the end of the month. That is why it is so important that we provide more than $1.2 billion in this farm bill for additional food purchases for emergency food organizations, like church food pantries and soup kitchens, to feed our families and seniors. We provide $50 million in additional funds this year to help meet food banks' needs in light of rising food costs. And, we increase the basic Emergency Food Assistance Program annual funding level to $250 million. That amount will be adjusted for inflation in future years to ensure that this program does not lose any of its food purchasing power. 
   Another important provision for our children is a provision that ensures that children who receive food stamps can automatically, or ``directly'' be certified as eligible for free meals. The eligibility rules for the two programs overlap: Virtually every child who receives food stamps is eligible for free meals. So making that connection in an automated way can save the family from falling through the cracks or from having to file duplicative paperwork. Unfortunately, too many States and schools don't currently make the connection adequately. So this bill requires USDA to report to Congress annually on each State's progress in directly certifying food stamp recipients for free school meals, and asks for USDA to report on best practices among the various States and school districts. This is a provision that is about good Government--there is no reason the Government can't make these connections, instead of requiring school administrators and families to be responsible for duplicative paperwork. 
   In addition to my role as Agriculture's Sub-committee Chair on Operations, Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry, I also have the great pleasure to assess this bill from the perspective of my role as the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. More than 5 million Latinos, or more than 10 percent of the Latino population, receive food stamps each month. Food stamps constitute 25 percent of total monthly income for a typical Latino family that participates in the Food Stamp Program. All of the changes that I have just described will benefit low-income Latinos who rely upon this program. 
   I must take one moment to express my deep personal disappointment that we were not able to restore food stamp benefits to all legal immigrants who are currently ineligible for the program. Keeping food assistance from hard-working immigrants with whom we live side by side is simply wrong and I will not stop fighting until we fully repeal the benefit cuts to legal immigrants enacted in 1996. 
   In spite of this major setback, we have achieved a number of important improvements for the Latino community. First, USDA will conduct a study on the possibility of bringing  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico back into the national Food Stamp Program. Since 1982 Puerto Rico has received a fixed block grant amount for food assistance, rather than be a part of the U.S. program like the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. This block grant does not take into account changes in economic or demographic conditions, such as unemployment or the number of people who are in need of food assistance. 
   The poverty rate in Puerto Rico, 45 percent, is more than three times the national poverty rate. However, because of the block grant, Puerto Rico cannot afford to provide benefits to all households poor enough to qualify for benefits using Food Stamp Program standards. Instead, they have been forced to impose rigid eligibility criteria. For example, a family of four with net income above about $600 a month, or 34 percent of the Federal poverty level, cannot get any food assistance in Puerto Rico. The same family living in California, or any other State on the mainland, could have almost three times as much income and still be eligible for food assistance. An elderly person living alone faces an income limit of $192 per month--just 23 percent of the poverty level. 
   Clearly, some of our most vulnerable American citizens are at risk of being denied food assistance they greatly need. It seems just plain wrong to knowingly leave some Americans with 
   insufficient food. With this study we hope to get a better understanding of what the local conditions are in Puerto Rico, in terms of food costs, poverty and other programmatic factors so that we can figure out how to address the issue in the next farm bill, or earlier if possible. 
   Another important achievement of the bill is to ensure that both Federal statute and regulations have the full force of law, ensuring that clients who do not receive adequate service under these rules and standards may bring suit. Recently, a district court in Ohio dismissed a case brought against the State to enforce the Department's regulations for serving people whose primary language is not English. I can't speak to whether the case had any merit, but my colleagues and I were surprised and disturbed to learn about the court's dismissal. We felt that it was critical to clarify in this bill that it has always been Congress's intent that the program's regulations should be fully enforceable and fully complied with to the same extent as the statute. The farm bill, therefore, clarifies that the Department's rules on serving non- and limited-English speaking people have the force of law and create rights for households. 
   Beyond the issue of bilingual access rules, this legislation makes clear that the Department's civil rights regulations are among those which have the full force of law and which households have the right to enforce. Discrimination is not acceptable in any form or at any point in the food stamp certification process. Households should not be assisted, or not assisted, approved or denied for any reason other than an individual assessment of their need for help or their eligibility by the state. I am pleased to be playing a role in making clear that the Committee and the Congress wish the program to be administered in compliance with the Food Stamp Act and its regulations. 
   I'd like to also talk about a somewhat related matter that we did not manage to agree to include in this farm bill, much to my disappointment. I worked hard to include in the House bill, and shepherd through the conference negotiations, a provision that would have strengthened the longstanding policy in the food stamp program that certification and eligibility decisions should be done by State employees, rather than private companies. We would have added to the traditional restrictions around merit systems and provided specific exceptions for certain activities, such as outreach. In recent years the Bush Administration has let two States, Texas and Indiana, experiment with using private companies to collect and review food stamp applications and conduct the sensitive eligibility interview. In my view, these projects are not consistent with current law or good sense. These experiments have been disastrous to the States' treasuries but, more importantly, to the vulnerable families and senior citizens who rely on food stamps and found their applications delayed or improperly denied. Some people even had their private, personal information shared inappropriately. The activities involved in determining eligibility--and ineligibility--for food stamps should be public functions and should not be governed by profit motive or a company's responsibility to its shareholders. 
   While the House voted to include this provision in the Conference agreement, the Senate did not because of opposition from the other party and a veto threat from President Bush, I regret this outcome and I am determined to not drop this issue until we have restored the proper balance to food stamp administration. 
   But I urge my colleagues to not forget, that separate from this ``privatization'' issue, in recent years States have been experimenting with a wide variety of changes to food stamp policies and practices that incorporate new technologies and modern business practices. For example, some States are using technology to create new pathways to apply for and retain benefits such as food stamps, health insurance, and child care, including online applications, online program redetermination or recertification, phone interviews, and call centers where changes in circumstances can be reported. 
   On the one hand, creating ways for families to participate in these programs without having to travel to a human service office can expand access and save time and money for States and families alike. In fact, in this bill we've created a new option for States to accept food stamp applications over the telephone. No doubt technology offers numerous opportunities for improved customer service and simpler application and retention processes. 
   On the other hand, if these processes are not well-designed, evaluated, and implemented, then families can face new access barriers. Moreover, some States are exploring these options at the same time that they are reducing human service staffing and closing local welfare offices. These steps can create new access barriers for certain groups of families and need to be carefully monitored. And I am concerned because neither States nor USDA appear to be asking the important questions about what has been the effect of these technological changes on access for food stamp households, particularly vulnerable populations like seniors, people with physical or mental disabilities, or people who do not speak English proficiently. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) last year published a report that found that USDA has not sufficiently monitored the States' ``modernization'' efforts in terms of their effects on program access, payment accuracy, or administrative costs. 
   So in this bill we have included several provisions to require that States that are eager to pursue modernized systems are pausing to ask the necessary questions about how to ensure that the new systems are designed in such a way that they are effective tools for connecting eligible families to benefits. In this bill we require USDA to establish standards for when States are making major changes in program operations and to monitor the effects on households, especially the types of households I just mentioned. I urge USDA to do this in a way that yields useful information so that States can refine and improve their systems to make them as accessible as possible to all clients. 
   Another provision requires States to adequately pilot test new computer systems before they go full-scale. This responds to situations where States have implemented new computer systems without adequate testing. This occurred even though some at USDA knew that there were weaknesses in the system and that serious benefit delays and errors were likely to occur. We also included a provision the Administration suggested to require States, instead of households, to repay any overissuances that occur because of one of these preventable major systems failures. 
   Finally, in light of all of the modernization changes and the potential access to sensitive information that new players may have, we strengthened the Act's privacy protections to ensure that anyone receiving confidential information for appropriate program purposes cannot then 
   share that information with a third party. In addition to our fears that too many people may have access to private food stamp information as a result of new technology, we were also concerned that clients have not been able to access their private records. We heard about clients in Texas who had their benefits cut off, or who never were able to obtain benefits, and could not get access to their case records in order to pursue claims against the State. That is unacceptable. We also clarified that despite all of the changes in how States are storing and maintaining client records, clients can access these records in litigation. These changes are not in conflict because confidential records would continue to be unavailable to the general public and others not having a legitimate reason relating to program administration. 
   Another concern I have is about two new provisions that would disqualify certain people from food stamps for misusing their benefits. One relates to situations where a recipient of food stamps intentionally uses food stamp benefits to buy a product, like water, that is in a disposable container that can be redeemed for cash, then discards the product and redeems the container in order to obtain the cash deposit. The other new disqualification addresses individuals who intentionally purchase food with food stamp benefits in order to resell the food for a cash profit. I agree that both of these practices are contrary to the purposes of the food stamp program in assisting people in obtaining an adequate diet and it's appropriate to address them in this bill. However, I caution USDA to implement them in a way that ensures that only those who intended  to defraud the system in these manners be disqualified. I do not want to see innocent people--who may simply have bought groceries for a neighbor or relative be caught up as somehow engaging in fraud under this provision. 
   My concerns here are not completely without precedent. In this bill we are revisiting and clarifying a different disqualification rule that was enacted in 1996, and that has, in fact, ensnared innocent people and denied food stamp benefits in inappropriate ways. The intent of the law was to aid law enforcement and prevent criminals who are fleeing to avoid prosecution from receiving food stamps. Unfortunately, in practice, the provision has disqualified innocent people who had their identities stolen, or who have outstanding warrants for minor infractions that are many years old and where the police have no interest in apprehending and prosecuting the case. 
   So in this bill we direct USDA to clarify that people should only be subject to disqualification if they are actively fleeing law enforcement authorities who are, in fact, interested in bringing them to justice. 
   In addition to the very important changes we have made to the food stamp program and new funding for food banks through TEFAP, the bill would expand and improve the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. This program has been receiving $9 million a year in mandatory funds and operates in 14 States. (Three Indian tribes also operate the program.) 
   Under the conference agreement, mandatory funding would increase to $40 million for the 2008-2009 school year and continue to grow. By 2012, the program would be funded at nearly eight times its current size: $150 million each year, with annual adjustments for inflation in years after that. 
   In addition to providing increased funding, the conference agreement takes important steps to target program funds to elementary schools with a significant share of low-income children. Our goal is to provide free fresh fruits and vegetables to all elementary schools in the country where more than half of the children are eligible for free or reduced price school meals. This program should expose a whole new generation of children to a healthy way of eating. 
   To sum up, I am extremely proud of the work that our Committee and our Congress have undertaken in the nutrition title of the farm bill. With these changes, we are building a healthier better fed population. As a result, we are taking a few important steps towards a stronger future for our children and our communities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 2358, the Native American One Dollar Coin Act. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Representative DALE KILDEE, for sponsoring this bill and for all his great work as head of the Native American Caucus. 
   I also would like to thank Chairman FRANK for his efforts in guiding this bill through the Financial Services Committee. 
   This bill honors the history of the American Indian culture by authorizing the Treasury Department to mint and distribute coins that commemorate the contributions of Native Americans. 
   By annually changing the design on the reverse side of the Sacagawea coin, Americans  everywhere will be exposed to more of the unique histories of our country's native inhabitants. 
   At the same time, this legislation ensures we still pay tribute to Sacagawea, the young woman who bravely guided Lewis and Clark on their expedition to the Pacific coast. 
   The Native American one dollar coin is a fitting way to pay tribute to Native Americans while also educating current and future generations on their many contributions to the United States. 
   I urge my colleagues to support increased appreciation of the Native American culture, and cast a vote in favor of H.R. 2358.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. 
   My top priorities are the patients and their families from my District. 
   Over the past several months, I've received several phone calls from hard-working families. These families are worried whether the Medicare physician payment cuts will prevent them from being able to see their doctor. 
   These families are worried about their ability to receive life saving medicines and medical supplies in the mail next time they run out. 
   These families are worried about their local pharmacy's ability to offer discounts on medicines. 
   For these families, I stand here in support of H.R. 6331. 
   This bill delays physician payment cuts, protecting our seniors from facing difficulty in accessing needed healthcare. In these times of skyrocketing gas prices, this bill improves low-income assistance programs for Medicare beneficiaries. Many working families from the Inland Empire, in California, are faced with putting food on the table or paying for medicines. 
   Furthermore, my constituents will face a unique situation when the competitive bidding process rolls out on July 1st. This bill delays this process; preventing any possible harmful interruptions in the shipment of medical supplies to patients. 
   Time is quickly running out, these deadlines are approaching and we must not stand by and watch. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 6331, our working families are counting on us.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support for this farm bill. Let me say that clearly this bill does not increase taxes. As chair of the Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry, I want to say that I am especially proud of this farm bill, what it does for the nutrition of minorities, seniors, disabled, single parents and for our veterans. 
   Right now there are 38 million Americans who do not have enough to eat. Eleven percent of the population are going hungry. Today in the Latino community and the African American community, that rate is double. 
   This farm bill fights hunger in America by making an historic investment in nutrition. Our nutrition title will benefit over 13 million American families. 
   Currently the average food stamp recipient receives only $21 a week. That is unacceptable. This farm bill will make food stamps keep up with the cost of living. Gas, health care, housing and grocery bills have gone up, but food stamps haven't kept up. We are going to change that. 
   This is going to help working families, our disabled, our senior citizens, our veterans and our single parents. Most importantly, it is going to help our children. Fifty percent of food stamp recipients are kids. That is what this farm bill is about: feeding our children; leaving no child behind. This farm bill will ensure that children will have access to fresh fruits and vegetables in all schools by expanding the USDA snack program to all 50 States. 
   This farm bill ensures that senior citizens and disabled adults have enough to eat by continuing the Commodity Foods Supplemental Program and expanding access to farmers' markets. 
   What it will also do is help military families. For the first time, this bill exempts military combat pay from being counted against the income of men and women who are fighting for us.  
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. It is an excellent bill that meets needs across America and helps all of us.  
   We're also going to make it easier for them to handle their paperwork processing by allowing telephone signatures. 
   And what about our military families? This is the first Farm Bill to exempt Special Military Combat pay from being counted against our military families who are trying to make ends meet while their loved ones are serving in places like Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   We have fought to ensure that Food Stamps cannot be privatized--and we have taken an extra step in this Farm Bill to remove the stigma in the Food Stamp program. 
   We are going to eliminate embarrassing coupons, transition everyone to EBT cards and change the name of the program to the Secure Supplemental Nutrition Access Program, or SSNAP. 
   Now our working families will be able to go to the store, swipe their SSNAP cards and bring food home to their children with dignity. 
   We also help support our food banks and soup kitchens by giving large increases to The Emergency Food Assistance Program. 
   The ``TEE-FAP'' not only serves our homeless, but provides life-saving assistance to our families after natural disasters, like Hurricane Katrina. 
   Simply put, this Farm Bill strengthens our Nutrition safety net like no other firm bill has ever done before! 
   This farm bill is also historic in its commitment to diversity in Agriculture. 
   This bill increases agriculture opportunities for underserved communities such as African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian-Pacific Islanders. 
   We give $150 million dollars in mandatory funding for outreach to small and socially disadvantaged farmers. 
   This bill also requires an annual report to Congress to see if our outreach to minority farmers is working. 
   The Farm Bill also creates an Advisory Board to deal with civil rights violations. 
   We require that 10 percent of conservation funding go to our small and disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. 
   The Farm Bill also creates new programs and increases funding for minority serving institutions and tribal colleges. 
   In addition--we have preserved the Davis-Bacon provision to ensure workers in rural America earn a decent wage. 
   We have worked hard to create a Reform Farm Bill that includes all of us--farmers, working families, minorities, urban communities, rural America. 
   This bill is a good bill that will ensure that all Americans get a fair shot. 
   It makes a historic investment in nutrition and increases opportunities for traditionally underserved communities. I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (PAYING TRIBUTE TO REVEREND WAITSTILL SHARP AND MARTHA SHARP FOR THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS TO SAVE JEWS DURING THE HOLOCAUST -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 52, legislation paying tribute to Reverend Waitstill and Martha Sharp, an American couple who left the comfort and safety of their home in Massachusetts to save the lives of Jews in danger of being killed during the Holocaust. 
   Waitstill Sharp was a Unitarian minister and his wife Martha was a social worker. 
   In the late 1930s, amid the horrors of the Holocaust and a refugee crisis in Europe, the American Unitarian Association asked numerous ministers to cross the Atlantic and offer assistance. The Sharps agreed, despite the dangers and despite having young children at home whom they would have to leave behind in the care of friends and neighbors and members of their congregation. 
   In February 1939, the Sharps arrived in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where one of the world's largest Unitarian congregations was assisting Jewish refugees and others who opposed the Nazis, including trade unionists and political dissenters. A month later, the Germans occupied Prague, increasing the urgency of the Sharps' mission but also the risk. They remained in Prague almost six months. 
   Through their courage, creativity and persistence they were able to lead hundreds of people, likely thousands, to safety. 
   They again heeded the call to action, returning to Europe in 1940, this time based in Marseilles, France, where they helped smuggle people across the Pyrenees into neutral Portugal. The escape routes that they established enabled hundreds of refugees to survive. 
   Among those whom the Sharps saved from persecution and slaughter at the hands of the Nazis were many children, including Jewish children who are now elderly, living freely in America, and remember with gratitude the couple who saved their lives almost 70 years ago. 
   I should note that the Sharps and others who worked to save Jews not only had to worry about the Nazis and the Gestapo, Vichy officials, collaborators and informers but also had to overcome bureaucracy and anti-Semitism even among the U.S. State Department. Historians have documented that inaction, indifferences, failures and even outright hostility by American officials resulted in the tragic death of Jews during the Holocaust. 
   But today we do not dwell on this; instead we honor the Sharps for persevering despite such obstacles and adversity. 
   Some of the Sharps' surviving relatives and admirers claim they were merely ordinary people who did what anyone would have done in the face of suffering. While I would like to believe that all people of compassion would come to the aid of people in need, especially when lives are at stake, sadly I know that is not the case. It was not true during the Holocaust, and it is not true today as millions of people in America and around the world suffer poverty, hunger, disease and even genocide and yet still not enough is being done to help them. 
   The special and extraordinary nature of the Sharps' actions is clear by the rare and high honors they have deservedly received. 
   In June 2006, the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel honored Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha Sharp posthumously as ``Righteous Among the Nations'' for risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. 
   And in September 2006, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. honored the Sharps. 
   There were definitely other brave, compassionate people who were inspired by their faith, values or their sense of right and wrong and therefore took steps, both small and large, to help Jews during the Holocaust. Some provided food and shelter, some refused to inform on their neighbors or cooperate with authorities enforcing murderous policies, some actively resisted against the Nazis, and some helped transport Jews to safety. But this was not the norm in Europe during the Holocaust. And we know the tragic, horrific results: over 6 million Jewish men, women and children perished. 
   So today we acknowledge the Sharps as American heroes, and I would add as heroes of humanity. Martha Sharp is the first American woman--and she and Waitstill are only the second and third Americans--to be added to the honor roll of 21,000 ``righteous'' gentiles, or non-Jews, whose efforts saved countless lives during the Holocaust. 
   We also commend the Unitarian Universality Service Committee. UUSC was founded to  support the Sharps' work and helped rescue Jews and other refugees from Nazi persecution. The organization has continued to do good work in support of human rights all over the world and is actively engaged in efforts to stop the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. 
   As we honor the Sharps, let us be inspired by their heroic example and let us all commit ourselves to doing what we can--and what we must--to bring an end to human suffering.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in support of H. Res 51, a resolution that honors the contributions of Catholic schools. 
   As we get ready to celebrate Catholic Schools week, it's important to highlight and celebrate the contributions of the nearly 8,000 Catholic schools that exist in our Nation. 
   Catholic education has long been characterized by a commitment to high and appropriate standards in all aspects of its educational mission. 
   The history of Catholic schooling embodies a constant effort to promote academic excellence for a diverse group of students in an environment permeated by religious values and beliefs. 
   Aside from America's Catholic schools being internationally acclaimed for their academic excellence, catholic school students also learn responsibility, and how to become persons of character and integrity. 
   Father William Davis of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said, ``High achievement rates, high retention rates, high moral values and high student and parent satisfaction are the distinctive marks of a Catholic school.'' 
   In my district and the surrounding areas, Catholic education is rather prevalent. The San Bernardino diocese contains at least 32 Elementary schools and 2 High schools. A new Preparatory high school is also in the works for the Coachella Valley area. 
   Catholic schools foster a sense of community. They encourage their students to be loving family members; and to be responsible adults within the workplace, as leaders of the world and as inhibitors of their communities. 
   I commend Catholic schools for holding high educational standards, instilling good moral values, and community sentiments. 
   Let us recognize and honor the valuable traits Catholic schools possess. 
   I urge the rest of Congress to stand with me, and support H. Res. 51.

   Later, as the only Holocaust survivor to ever serve in Congress, he used this experience to work against the forces of oppression, intolerance, and genocide. 
   Representative LANTOS was also known as a dedicated family man. He and his dear wife Annette were usually inseparable--and all of my colleagues in the House knew of his dedication to his 17 grandchildren.

   I want to thank my friend, Congresswoman Hilda Solis, for sponsoring this bill and championing this cause which is of great significance to so many Americans, myself included. 
   Cesar Chavez provided hope for thousands of people. Perhaps best known for founding and leading the United Farm Workers of America, Chavez used non-violent tactics that included boycotts, fasts, and strikes to bring attention to the dangerous working conditions in the field. His efforts helped to produce the first industry-wide labor contracts in the history of American agriculture. 
   Cesar Chavez' legacy has empowered, encouraged and motivated countless individuals. He is a continuing example that with hard work, dedication and love, change can happen and oppression can be conquered. His famous words, ``Si se puede'' (Yes you can), still inspire us today. 
   I cannot think of anything more American than standing up for one's right to justice, fairness, and equality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. 
   I voted against this war 5 years ago and believe we should never have gone into Iraq. 
   But as a veteran, I stand by our troops and am committed to supporting all of our troops--before, during and after service. 
   There are 32,000 wounded soldiers from the Iraq conflict alone and they need medical attention and assistance to get back on their feet. 
   However, our veteran healthcare system that is in shambles. Internal reports, the media, and Congressional hearings are revealing the same kind of problems across the board--chronic under-funding, neglect, improper conduct, and lack of accountability. 
   There will be hundreds of thousands of veterans who will need care over the next decade as they return from Iraq, Afghanistan and other fronts in the Global War on Terror. 
   And our military and veterans healthcare systems are not prepared. Unless we act now, the situation will fall apart. 
   The recent tragedies at Walter Reed Army Medical Center underscore the urgency of the issue and the hardships faced by our military families across the country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I recently visited our returning veterans at Walter Reed Medical Center and as I spoke to these men and women and listened to their stories, I was almost brought to tears. 
   They told me of doctors who weren't giving them the attention they needed. Others shared how they had to prove to the medical staff that they were really injured. 
   One wounded soldier and his father in particular really struck a chord in me. This young man is from my home state of California and he told me how his father completely shut down his business, packed his things, and flew 3,000 miles across the country to make sure his son got the proper support and attention. 
   As if this brave soldier's sacrifice wasn't enough. Now his family has to put their lives on hold to ensure that he recuperates fully from his battle wounds. 
   After my visit, I took a long time to think and reflect on what I had seen. And really at the end of the day, all could think was that it just wasn't fair. 
   This young man is one of the lucky ones. His family could afford to make that sacrifice. 
   But what about the countless military families who are barely making ends meet and simply can't afford to quit their jobs? 
   Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is the American people shouldn't have to do these things. 
   We're fighting all over the world to spread democracy and peace at the expense of these young men and women and their families. 
   And yet what kind of example are we setting for the rest of world when we don't honor those who bear the scars of battle? 
   Veterans and military healthcare is one of the most neglected programs in this country. 
   It is immoral, it is embarrassing, and it is just plain irresponsible. 
   We have a duty as a government to take care of each and every soldier who has been injured in the line of duty in defense of our great Nation. 
   H.R. 1538 takes a step in the right direction by comprehensively examining the cracks in military healthcare and fixing them. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act reduces the caseloads of our medical case managers so service members and their families get help when they need it. 
   It also creates a system of patient advocates for outpatient wounded service members so that they get the right treatment. 
   The bill also establishes a toll-free hot line so that service members and their families have someplace to turn to when they see neglect or improper conduct. 
   We're also going to look at the training all of our military healthcare employees get from top to bottom. We're going to make sure the people who are treating and working with our troops and veterans have the right tools and information to give them the best service possible. 
   The bill also creates an Army Wounded Warrior Battalion pilot program to track active-duty soldiers in ``outpatient status'' who still require medical care. 
   H.R. 1538 will also look at overhauling the disability evaluation process. Average disability claims take a year and appeals are taking about two years to process. We have an enormous backlog of claims within the VA system and we need to fix the problem immediately. 
   Finally, we're going to help our troops better transition from military healthcare systems to veterans' healthcare systems. The transition will include an official handoff between the two systems with the electronic transfer of all medical and personnel records before the member leaves active duty so that there are no gaps in coverage or service. 
   The American people have already paid too high a price for this war. 3,233 soldiers have died in Iraq, including 10 men from my own district. 
   We need this bill to ensure that we honor the sacrifices of all our troops and their families by at the very least providing quality, timely healthcare. 
   That's why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1538.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 80th birthday of an American hero, the late C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez. 
   For 7 years, I have fought for a national holiday to honor C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, a man who not only carried the torch for justice and freedom, but was the hope of thousands of impoverished people. C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez believed in ``la causa,'' the cause; and he believed in ``la huelga,'' the struggle. 
   As we approach his birthday, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 76, a resolution that educates our youth about his heroic life, celebrates his accomplishments and honors him with a national holiday. 
   The battle for social justice is far from over. But in the words of C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, ``si se puede.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3963. 
   This bill is not about politics. It is about hardworking families, the poorest amongst us. It's about 10 million children who will benefit, 10 million children that we have to put a face on. Our children. 
   As Christians, as humanitarians, we must think of the individuals who need help, children like Kristofer and Felecity Famutimi from San Bernardino County who were hospitalized because they needed sickle cell anemia care. Their families were financially strapped. SCHIP is the only reason that they were able to pull through. 
   For a month now, SCHIP has been under attack in the news. Enough is enough. Our children must come first. Our children must come first. 
   We have worked hard on a bipartisan basis to include provisions by the other side. We have included language to minimize substitution of employer-sponsored coverage with SCHIP and phase out childless adults after 1 year and even clarify that CHIP is only for U.S. citizens. Only for U.S. citizens. They are trying to use scare tactics by saying that undocumented children will be able to receive it. It is only for U.S. citizens. 
   This bill is not perfect, but we have done our part to work out the differences. Let's get our priorities straight. We spent a lot of money on the war, a war we should have never been in. Now we are talking about our children right here in the United States who need help. It is our responsibility. Our children deserve it. We must do better. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bill. It is important for the poorest children. Support H.R. 3963.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, the rising cost of prescription drugs has become a serious problem for millions of our national seniors. Forty-three million are enrolled in Medicare. In fact, more than 20 percent of seniors in Medicare are minorities: 3.9 million are African Americans, 3.1 million are Latinos, and 1.7 million are other racial and ethnic minorities. Many of them are already  on fixed income. Many of these high prices are forcing them to choose between medicine and paying for their rent or doing without something else. 
   What Republicans pushed through in the Medicare drug program promised to bring the drug prices down. Yet they have gone up. Yet they plan to protect the rich drug companies' profits and do not go far enough to lower these expenses that are affecting a lot of our minorities. I know firsthand because I have experienced that. 
   It is clear that this legislation has failed to bring down the drug prices. Giving the Secretary the authority to bargain with the drug manufacturers will result in lower costs for 22 million Medicare enrollees in part D. I ask that we support H.R. 4. This is commonsense legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. 
   I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   Last year, this Congress took a first step in our promise to lower education costs and increase opportunities for American families. 
   This bill is about keeping that promise by strengthening higher education and increasing access to college for low income students. 
   This is especially important for the Latino community here in the United States where too many don't even apply to college because of the high costs. And the number of Latino students graduating with a degree does not compare with their white counterparts. 
   This year only 25 percent of college-age Latinos were actually enrolled in college. Only 25 percent. 
   This bill will help to eliminate this gap. It increases financial aid, strengthens college prep programs for low income students, and makes historic investments at minority serving institutions. 
   When we provide low-income students with access to college, we strengthen the middle class and make America stronger. 
   One thing I'd like to work with the Committee on is the student loan debt burden on teachers. Right now they can only get student repayment for their direct loans. But we really should help them pay back all of their student loans, including their private ones. They provide an important service to our Nation so that is the least we can do. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4137.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. I want to thank my colleague for yielding. I rise also to support the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007. 
   I want to thank my good friend from California, Chairman MAXINE WATERS, for sponsoring this vital legislation. 
   I also want to thank our chair, Chairman Frank, for his leadership and guidance in this committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, in 2004, when the administration decided to change the funding formula for section 8 vouchers, drastic cuts were made to the number of vouchers available. These cuts hurt needy families throughout the Nation and throughout my district. We are talking about seniors, low-income families, disabled, the poor, the disadvantaged. 
   In my district alone, section 8 housing vouchers, public housing units, provide affordable housing for more than 32,000 people. Can you imagine, 32,000 people right now, children and others, that would not have a home, not have a place to rent, that would be homeless if it hadn't been for section 8? This bill reverses the cut and adds an additional 20,000 vouchers so that families are not forced to choose between paying for food, their medication or rent. 
   We are talking about people that can't afford housing, even right now, with the inflation and the cost that is going on right now. We have got to make sure that they have a home, they have stability, and they have a roof over their head, especially for our children. 
   I appreciate my colleague on the other side, GARY MILLER, supporting this legislation as well. We worked on some of the amendments. I appreciate that very much. 
   It also contains key provisions that strengthen section 8 programs, including protection for individuals with limited English proficiency and the expansion to Moving To Work programs. I  urge my colleagues to support this most vulnerable program that helps us, and especially as it pertains to helping the poor, the disadvantaged. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a veteran who served in the 101st and 82nd Airborne Division in support of H.R. 2956, the Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act. 
   This war is a failure, and it's time to bring back our troops. We can no longer stay the course. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President's policy has been a complete failure. We have lost too many lives. There are too many wounded who will never have normal lives. 
   We're proud of our troops and the service they have provided to our country. But our troops are now trapped in the middle of a civil war that we cannot end. 
   This is something that the Iraqi people must do for themselves. Our military presence in Iraq is not making our country safer. Instead, the war has taken the lives of 3,610 soldiers. 
   In my district alone, we have lost 13 brave men and women, and when I see their faces and their families that have to deal with these individuals that have lost their lives, we're proud of them, but they've lost their lives, and the families who continue to suffer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. I appreciate the comments by Mr. Dreier. I appreciate his leadership on this important issue of water. It is critical to the Inland Empire. This is one that needs to be addressed, and he has constantly addressed the issues of water in the Inland Empire, not only now, but in the past. And I rise in support of H.R. 122, the Inland Empire recycling project. 
   And I appreciate Grace Napolitano's leadership in this endeavor because this is a bipartisan effort for the Inland Empire and its region in the area. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, but an issue that pertains to water and water that is important to a lot of us in that region and throughout the State of California. 
   This project is important for my district. And he not only mentioned his district that covers Upland and Rancho Cucamonga, but it is important for my district and across Southern California because it would help solve California's state-wide water shortage. 
   We all have been warned about global warming and the impact it is going to have in terms of the future and the possibility of the lack of water. Well, this addresses some of that. By recycling the water in our region, we will be able to increase the local water supply and reduce our dependence on imported water from San Francisco Bay delta area.     
   The Bureau of Reclamation has ranked this project as one of the most cost-effective new water supply projects in California; I state, the most effective, cost-effective water supply projects in California. And it is also endorsed by all cities, including Fontana and Ontario, as well as community groups and business groups, and environmental leader groups, and I state, environmental groups and leaders throughout the Inland Empire. 
   I rise to give my full support, and I urge my colleagues to do the same on this important issue on water that impacts not only the Inland Empire but the State of California, and I ask full support.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee for his leadership on this, and for including the provision that deals with counseling that I support, and I submit my statement for the Record.  
   First let me thank the gentleman for his hard work on this legislation and his dedication to helping homeowners in need. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to talk about the importance of housing counseling and how to make these dollars more effective. Statistics show that 8,500 homeowners are foreclosing each day and 2.5 million are expected to lose their homes by the end of this year. Some States require that homeowners be notified in person if they are about to foreclosure. But many States such as California and Texas do not. These States just send letters in the mail. 
   The bill before us today includes an important provision that requires the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to give consideration to counseling agencies that provide in-  person contact and in-person housing counseling to borrowers in need when awarding their grants. Statistics show that when homeowners are notified in person that counseling is available, a large percentage can save their homes. 
   For those States that just send default and foreclosure notices through the mail, we hope that federally chartered and regulated institutions doing business in those States will use every effort to notify homeowners in person that counseling is available. This is important because when borrowers go 30 or 60 days late on paying their mortgages, they often stop answering the telephone or opening mail from their lender. They give into despair, and believe there is no hope. 
   Fifty percent of homeowners in default never contact their lenders. What I find most troubling is that according to a Freddie Mac study, 56 percent don't know counseling is available. The money is there, but the counseling is not getting to the people that need it. This will promote partnerships between counseling agencies and lenders to improve outreach to borrowers, whether in person or through other means, to advise them that help is available. And second, it encourages in person counseling so that counselors can advise homeowners individually to help them work through their options and prevent foreclosure. 
   I also want to thank Mrs. McCarthy of New York and Mr. Mahoney of Florida who co-sponsored this language. As you know, our amendments passed the Committee on Financial Services under unanimous consent and with bipartisan support. And I thank the Republicans on our committee for their support and especially thank Chairman Frank for his leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACA. (THE ROLE IMMIGRANTS HAVE SERVED IN SERVING OUR ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, immigrants have served in our Armed Forces with courage and dignity since the Revolutionary War. Even today, they continue to defend our country's freedom. They've even earned the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest military decoration. For example, Alfred Rascon, an undocumented immigrant during his service in the Vietnam War received the Medal of Honor for his courage and dedication to America. 
   Immigrants have also reached the highest ranks in the U.S. military. General John Shalikashvili, an immigrant from Poland who came to the United States after World War II, was a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   From 2002 to 2005, over 15,000 immigrants have served in our armed services and later completed their naturalization process. There are thousands of other success stories that we should honor. We cannot ignore these positive contributions and the unique and valuable functions that immigrants perform. 
   I urge my colleagues to support a comprehensive immigration reform on behalf of those servicemen and women and their families.

   Mr. BACA. Mr. Speaker, I speak on behalf of the 12 to 14 million immigrants who otherwise would not have a voice. 
   America was founded by the sweat and tears of immigrants and hardworking families. The strong work ethic of immigrants has always been the cornerstone of this country. Today  there are many immigrant families that continue to live by and reinforce America's tradition of hard work. 
   These immigrant families day after day sacrifice to make ends meet. At a time of skyrocketing gas and food prices, we must recognize these sacrifices. 
   These are the same sacrifices made by many other families in America. History is full of examples of how immigrant groups unjustly were seen as popular targets. Why are we repeating these same cruel mistakes? What about love thy neighbor? 
   We cannot let anti-immigration rhetoric rule our actions. I urge my colleagues to join me in comprehensive immigration reform for the immigrant families who love America and continue to sacrifice.
