<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I thank my friend from Florida, and I rise in support of this rule. 
   Since its inception, Democrats have been the party to keep Medicare working for America's seniors and disabled. Contrast that with Republicans when they were in charge. During their majority, Medicare funding increased dramatically so they could shower their pals in the insurance industry with higher reimbursements than regular Medicare, all in an effort to privatize the program. 
   Republicans are willing to look past all of that, pat themselves on the back and call themselves the party of fiscal responsibility because of some arbitrary policy that they inserted into the Medicare Modernization Act that pretends to address Medicare financing. This provision is more about smoke and mirrors than it is about ensuring Medicare remains intact. 
   Republicans say it is about cost containment; I say it is about cost shifting. The sad truth is that the 45 percent trigger is designed to reduce the obligation of the Federal Government to fund part of Medicare, thereby shifting more costs to beneficiaries. 
   Since taking control of Congress, Democrats have set out to put Medicare on a sustainable track. During our first year in charge, the House passed the CHAMP Act which would have extended Medicare solvency by 2 years by reducing wasteful overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans. And just a couple of weeks ago, we enacted the Medicare Improvements for Patient and Providers of 2008 against the President's objections. 
   According to the CBO, under that bill the 45 percent threshold would be first crossed in fiscal year 2014, 1 year later than under the prior law. So I say contrary to what my friends on the other side of the aisle are saying, the fact of the matter is that Democrats are being fiscally responsible. Democrats are confronting Medicare's challenges, and we don't need an arbitrary policy that is a relic of the previous majority in order to do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree more with what Mr. Dingell said, but I do also want to point out to the minority leader that this is about kids. 
   In fact, many adults smoke, and I'm sure they're very much aware of what they're doing. I suppose you could argue that, if people want to kill themselves and they're adults, then let them do so, but every day, approximately 4,000 kids, children, try a cigarette for the first time, of which 1,140 become new daily smokers. 
   According to my calculations, this means that since 1996 almost 5 million children have become tobacco addicts and that one-third of those kids will end up dying prematurely from tobacco-related illnesses. 
   So I say to the minority leader: Forget about the adults for the time being. We've got to stop the kids who are not aware and who don't understand the dangers of tobacco. They shouldn't start smoking. I think that's really what this is all about. This is a very important day, and I do resent the fact that the minority leader is belittling it by saying this is a boneheaded idea. 
   I want to thank Mr. Waxman. He has been at this for I don't know how many years--12, 15, 20 years. 
   Twelve years after the FDA first published a comprehensive rule that would protect children from the harmful effects of tobacco, we are finally one step closer to actually implementing its provisions and protecting millions of Americans, and particularly the children, from a lifetime of addiction and of poor health. 
   Madam Speaker, it's hard to believe that tobacco products are exempt from the basic health and safety regulations that apply to other consumer products, but in fact, they are. Presently, the FDA is prohibited from regulating tobacco products, one of the most dangerous products available to consumers, and that's why we have to act today. Imagine that the FDA regulates toothpaste but not cigarettes. They monitor cereal but not chewing tobacco. Ironically, the FDA regulates both over-the-counter and prescription medications to help people quit smoking; yet it has no authority over the cause of the addiction. By passing this bill today, we're one step closer to changing all of that. 
   In closing, I just want to say that this is a very important bill, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   I just want to stress in closing that this really is a bipartisan bill that is supported overwhelmingly by both sides of the aisle. I have had the opportunity under the auspices of Tobacco-Free Kids, which is one of the big supporters of this bill, to go to an elementary school in my district one day recently. And I found out that the kids there were all from fifth grade down. It was incredible to me to realize that some of them had already started to smoke and they were very much unaware of the fact of the dangers of tobacco. 
   That was really a revelation for me that day, to realize that there are a lot of children at a very young age that start smoking that are unaware of the dangers, even with all the declarations and disclaimers that are out there. 
   So I really think that this legislation that we are passing today is for the kids. It for those children who will stop or never, hopefully, have the opportunity or think about smoking because they will realize how dangerous it is because it's now regulated by the FDA. 
   I just want to thank Mr. Waxman; I know he has worked for many years on this, and Mr. Dingell and so many on both sides of the aisle because I think they recognize while it may be true that a lot of adults know what they are doing when they smoke, and they do it regardless of the health impact, that really what we need to address are those kids that start smoking at a young age, that become addicted, that are not aware of the perils, and then later just simply can't stop. 
   So I would urge all of my colleagues. This is a very historic day. This is a very important piece of legislation. Let's pass it overwhelmingly today on a bipartisan basis.

   Mr. PALLONE. While Americans suffer pain at the pump, Republicans and President Bush insist on the same old energy policies that put us on this dangerous path to record high gas prices. Instead of looking towards the past, Democrats have been exploring both immediate and long-term solutions to America's energy crisis. 
   To help consumers suffering right now, this House has passed legislation cracking down on price fixing and price gouging by retailers. We also forced the President to suspend sending oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This week, House Democrats will bring a bill to the floor that will end rampant speculation that is driving up gas prices by closing the Enron loophole. These are all solutions that should help lower prices today. 
   But we have also passed landmark legislation that will lead to more efficient vehicles when we enacted the first new vehicle fuel efficiency standards in 32 years. These new standards will help drivers with up to $1,000 a year in gas when it's fully enacted. 
   Madam Speaker, House Democrats are proposing both short- and long-term solutions to high gas prices, and it's time for congressional Republicans to join us in our efforts.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Michelle's Law was introduced by my colleague from New Hampshire, Representative Paul HODES, in honor of Michelle Morse, a 20-year-old student who was attending Plymouth State University when she was diagnosed with colon cancer in December of 2003. 
   Michelle's doctors recommended that she leave school temporarily so she could undergo surgery and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, if Michelle followed her doctors' advice and dropped out of school to receive treatment, she would no longer be eligible for health coverage under her mother's policy. 
   The truth of the matter, Mr. Speaker, is that most college-aged students are only able to keep their parents' health insurance if they attend classes full time. Under most health care plans, when a student becomes seriously ill or injured, he or she is unfortunately left with very few options. Students are forced into the difficult decision of continuing with a full-time course load while they try to seek treatment, or withdrawing and losing health care eligibility. No American should be faced with such a choice, in my opinion. 
   Unfortunately, Michelle had to choose. Michelle and her family decided that she would remain in school full time while she received treatment for her cancer. After enduring a rigorous course load and successfully graduating, Michelle lost her battle with cancer in November of 2005. 
   After Michelle's passing, her mother decided that no other family should have to make the same tough decision. Thanks to her efforts, New Hampshire passed a law that allows students to take a 1-year medical leave of absence while maintaining their dependency status. The bill before us today would afford the same protections for students nationwide. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for this important piece of legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 296, which designates August 2008 as National Heat Stroke Awareness Month for the purpose of raising awareness and encouraging prevention of heat stroke. 
   As we approach the hottest days of the year, it is important that we take the time now to recognize the serious dangers of heat stroke. Whether it is a child who will participate in preseason camps to prepare for the fall athletic season, or seniors who take a walk outside, the threat of heat stroke is high. We need to make sure everyone is properly hydrated. This is particularly true for our students, as approximately 70 percent of student athletes arrive on the field already dehydrated. 
   Heat stroke is extremely preventible, yet about half of those who contact it will die from it. This resolution before us aims to increase awareness of this deadly condition. It urges national and community organizations, the media, coaches, student athletes and others to widely disseminate information on heat stroke. 
   This resolution also recognizes and applauds the Kendrick Fincher Memorial Foundation for its hard work and commitment to educating the public on the fatal effects of heat stroke. The foundation is named in honor of 13-year-old Kendrick Fincher, a child who died tragically of heat stroke while attending football practice. In an effort to prevent the reoccurrence of such a tragedy, the foundation has dispensed over 130,000 water bottles and informational pamphlets to children and athletes throughout the United States. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Boozman, for his hard work in bringing this resolution to the floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H. Con. Res. 296.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (ANIMAL DRUG USER FEE AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Prior to 2003, the FDA's review of animal drug submissions was taking over a year and a half to be completed. This obviously led to serious concerns that new and innovative pharmaceutical products were not making their way onto the marketplace in order to treat our Nation's pets, as well as food animals that help sustain the Nation's food supply. 
   Accordingly, in 2003, Congress enacted the Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA) which was modeled after the successful user fee programs for the review of human drug and medical device submissions. Like the user fee programs that preceded it, ADUFA authorized the FDA to collect fees to help ensure that the agency had the resources it needed to provide a timely review of animal drug applications. 
   The legislation before us today would reauthorize the ADUFA program for another 5 years. Under this legislation, the amount of fees collected for the review of animal drug submissions would increase from $15 million to $24 million over 5 years, for a total of $98 million. Revenues would be derived from a mix of application, product, establishment and sponsor fees. 
   The legislation would also improve the uniform collection and reporting of data to FDA on the sales about animal drugs that contain an antibiotic ingredient. 
   During the debate on reauthorization of ADUFA, we heard many concerns about the use of antibiotics in animal populations for non-therapeutic purposes and the threat that these practices pose to human health. This bill includes language that would enhance FDA's current data collection by creating a new antimicrobial animal drug use data report for all food-producing animals. The report puts critical information in one place for FDA; otherwise, the agency would have to search through warehouses of multiple paper reports. 
   In addition to the reauthorization of ADUFA, this legislation would establish a new animal generic drug user fee. According to FDA, the average review time of an animal generic drug submission was 570 days in Fiscal Year 2007, in spite of a 180-day statutory requirement. At the end of last year there was a recorded backlog of 446 submissions waiting for review and agency action. 
   Accordingly, the bill before us would provide for the collection of user fees increasing annually from $4.8 million to $6 million over 5 years, for a total of $27 million. And these additional revenues are designed to help speed up the review process. By Year 5 of the authorization period, most reviews of generic animal drug submissions should occur in 270 days or less, a substantial improvement over the time it is now taking FDA to conduct such reviews. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that the generic drug industry and FDA have been able to work out this agreement. If enacted, AGDUFA will speed lower cost animal drugs to the marketplace and bring significant savings to ranchers, farmers and pet owners. While that is an important and noteworthy goal, I also think it is equally, if not more important, to ensure for the timely review of generic human drug applications. 
   There is a provision in this bill that would improve the speed in which FDA reviews generic drug applications, and that provision makes a technical correction to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 as it relates to the application process for obtaining FDA approval of certain new generic drugs. 
   Citizen petitions can be submitted to FDA to raise issues about drugs that are being considered in the application process. At the time of negotiations on the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, an agreed-upon sentence was inadvertently dropped from our final version of that bill. The sentence makes clear that consideration of a citizen petition regarding a drug is to be separate and apart from review and approval of any application for the drug. The language included in the bill we are considering today restores that sentence. 
   There is another correction to the FDA Amendments Act that is included in the bill before us. This change concerns the types of information to be included in the clinical trials data bank established under that law. More specifically, the issue is adverse event information on drugs and on medical devices. 
   Adverse event information was clearly intended to be included in the data  bank for both drugs and devices. Express specific requirements to that effect were included in multiple drafts of the legislation. In negotiations, however, it was agreed that rather than the bill itself including express specific requirements regarding adverse event information, the FDA would issue regulations that would set the specific requirements. In drafting the ``regulations'' approach, the reference to medical devices was inadvertently dropped, and that was a simple mistake. So the bill before us today corrects that mistake. 
   In closing, I want to thank my Republican colleagues for working for us in a bipartisan fashion to move this bill forward. Mr. Deal, Mr. Barton and of course Mr. Dingell all worked together, so this is, in fact, a bipartisan bill, and a very important bill as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 896, a resolution expressing support for Primary Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month, and for the need to pursue research on this debilitating disease. 
   Primary lateral sclerosis, or PLS, is a rare neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle spasms and weakness. As many as 2,000 Americans suffer from PLS, which usually affects adults during midlife. The causes of PLS are unknown and the disease currently has no cure. However, some individuals with PLS can increase their comfort level and ability to function through therapy and treatment. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal motor neuron disease within the same family of disorders. 
   H. Res. 896 encourages Congress to continue support for further work on PLS. It would promote further research into the causes, treatment, and eventual cure for PLS, and seek to increase awareness about the disease. 
   Earlier in the session of the 110th Congress, the House passed H.R. 2295, the ALS Registry Act, and this bill would help to establish a central registry for ALS and other motor neuron disorders like PLS, so that research efforts are timely and targeted. 
   Finally, this resolution, Mr. Speaker, recognizes those who have already made efforts to support individuals who suffer from PLS. One such individual is Hardy L. Brown, co-publisher of the Black Voice News, who has personally dedicated himself to raising funds for ALS research and has now been diagnosed with PLS himself. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Baca, for his hard work in bringing this resolution before us today, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H. Res. 896.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, President Bush says progress is being made in Iraq, but many of the examples he pointed to in the nationally televised speech last week were overestimated or overly optimistic. Let me just cite a couple examples. 
   First, President Bush said, ``Iraq's national leaders are getting some things done, such as sharing oil revenues with the provinces.'' But according to the Washington Post, the President's statement ignored the fact that U.S. officials have been frustrated that none of these actions have become law and that a possible compromise has collapsed. 
   The President also thanked ``the 36 nations who have troops on the ground in Iraq.'' But if he had checked with his own State Department, he would have realized that only 25 countries are still involved in the war, supplying only 11,600 troops. Now, that is less than 7 percent of the size of the U.S. forces still on the ground. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is nothing new. The President has been painting rosy scenarios for the situation in Iraq from the very beginning. Time and time again they have been proven wrong. The status quo simply can't continue. It is time to change course.

   Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important day for American consumers. Thanks to the legislation the House is about to pass, the Food and Drug Administration will have the financial resources and authorities necessary to ensure patients have timely access to safe and effective therapies. 
   First and foremost, this bill is about drug safety. In order to empower the FDA to protect the public from harmful drugs, we are giving the agency new authority to compel important labeling changes. This is a significant improvement over current policy, where FDA must haggle with drug companies and protracted negotiations that put patients and consumers at risk. 
   Under this bill, FDA will also be better equipped to force drug manufacturers to fulfill their responsibility to the American public and complete postmarket study commitments which are critical to ensuring a drug is safe. 
   In addition to these important new authorities, this bill authorizes the collection of $225 million in new user fees, a significant increase in the amount of funds dedicated for the use of drug safety activities. 
   The FDA Revitalization Act also provides for commonsense improvements to our Nation's food safety system, such as more stringent ingredient and labeling standards, establishment of an adulterated food registry, and improvements in public notifications. 
   Patients will be happy to know that the bill before us also requires greater transparency of drug makers by calling for clinical trials to be registered in a database monitored by the National Institutes of Health, along with basic results data. As we saw with the case of Avandia, making this information available to patients, providers and researchers is critical to uncovering potential harmful effects of a drug. And under this legislation, the public will also have greater access to internal documents that FDA used in its review of a drug application. 
   We also secure FDA scientists' right to publish by requiring the Secretary to establish clear policies on the timely clearance of articles written by FDA employees. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, this bill would make significant progress in reducing the number of conflicted experts who serve on advisory committees. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to say that this bill reauthorizes two very important programs for our Nation's children, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research and Equity Act. These programs have been crucial in the successful cultivation of important research used by doctors and parents to better determine what kinds of drug therapy is safest and most appropriate for a child patient. 
   In addition to the two existing programs, we're creating a new program that would help provide device manufacturers with greater incentives to conduct research and development of pediatric devices. Combined, these three bills will strengthen the research being done on pediatric uses of drugs and devices, and will make sure that our Nation's children have access to the medicines and therapies they need to grow up healthy and strong. 
   And finally, this bill reauthorizes two critically important user fee agreements with respect to prescription drugs and medical devices. These programs provide FDA with the necessary resources to review applications in a timely manner so patients who rely on new and improved drugs and devices don't have to go without. In addition to reauthorizing these existing user fee programs, this bill would establish a new user fee for the specific purpose of reviewing direct-to-consumer advertising. 
   I just want to commend Mr. Dingell, our ranking member Mr. Barton, Mr. Deal, and all of the members here, Mr. Waxman, Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Markey. Their leadership on these issues has been unwavering. It is to their credit that we have a bill on the floor today. 
   This is a great victory for American consumers that will make tremendous strides in empowering the FDA and restoring public confidence in its ability to protect the public health, and I would urge my colleagues to vigorously support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to say that my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Andrews, is the Speaker this afternoon. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this afternoon to congratulate the Rutgers Scarlet Knights on their recent victory over Kansas State in the Texas Bowl. Last Thursday the Scarlet Knights cruised to a 37-10 victory over the Kansas State Wildcats, capping their memorable season with the first bowl win in school history. 
   Running back Ray Rice led the winning effort with 170 yards rushing and a touchdown. Wide receiver Tim Brown scored two touchdowns, which, combined with Rutgers' stifling defense, was more than enough to put away Kansas State. The defense held Kansas State under 200 total yards and did not allow an offensive touchdown. 
   Coach Greg Schiano led his team to an 11-win season this year for only the second time in Rutgers' history. In his five short years since becoming head coach at Rutgers, Coach Schiano has turned the program around from a 2-9  record in the basement of the Big East to an elite football program near the top of the BCS standings. And Coach Schiano has received national recognition as the coach of the year, as well as Big East honors as coach of the year. 
   Mr. Speaker, also deserving of recognition are university president Richard McCormick and Rutgers athletic director Bob Mulcahy. During their tenure, Rutgers athletics, particularly the football program, has reached a high standard athletically and academically. The American Football Coaches Association has recognized Rutgers football for a high level of academic achievement among student athletes. Additionally, Rutgers student athletes have played a large role in the community by becoming involved with toy drives, hospital visits, and blood drives. 
   Mr. Speaker, the hard work, dedication, and teamwork exhibited by the Rutgers football program embodies the highest traditions of scholar athletes and serves as an inspiration to all New Jerseyans. 
   And once again I would like to congratulate the entire Rutgers athletic program and the university as a whole for this remarkable achievement. I look forward to cheering them to even greater success in the future ``in that noisy college town on the banks of the old Raritan.''

   Last week for the fifth month in a row, we learned that the Bush economy had lost more jobs than it created. This unimpressive economic record is once again drawing comparisons to that of another Republican President, Herbert Hoover. President Bush has the worst job creation record since Herbert Hoover, who presided over the stock market crash and led our economy into the Great Depression. 
   And just like Herbert Hoover, President Bush refuses to take the necessary action and begin to turn this economy around and to help those who are suffering the most. 
   Madam Speaker, history is not going to be too kind to President Bush when it comes to his handling of our Nation's economy. But this week, he has the opportunity to work on that record by supporting our efforts to extend unemployment benefits to millions of our Nation's workers. And it is the right thing to do.

   It does pain me a great deal, though, to hear my Republican colleagues, and specifically the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, basically advocate for the President's veto of this legislation. And I say that because I know that 10 years ago, when we established the SCHIP program, it was bipartisan, President Clinton, Speaker Gingrich. And the fact of the matter is it was done for practical reasons because we knew there were kids, as was said by the gentleman from Louisiana, who were not getting health care on the job, but whose incomes, because their parents were working, were too high to be eligible for Medicaid. 
   Now, all we're doing today is being as practical as we were 10 years ago. We know that there are 6 million kids, almost twice who were enrolled in the program, who are eligible for this program under the same eligibility requirements as 10 years ago who are not enrolled in the program because we don't have enough money to pay for it and we haven't had enough outreach to get them enrolled. 
   There is nothing new here. This is the same block grant that Speaker Gingrich and President Clinton advocated 10 years ago. But practically speaking, we know that for the first time in the last 2 years the number of uninsured kids is now going up instead of going down, so we have to do something about it. And we sat down with the Republicans in the Senate, with the Democrats in the Senate and the Democrats here in the House, and we came up with a solution, which was the tobacco tax. Now, this is fully funded. And the tobacco tax is a great way to pay for it because if you tax people who are smoking and they smoke less, then we have less health problems, and it's directly related to trying to provide health insurance. So don't tell me it's not paid for. It is paid for. It's paid for in a good way. There is no change in eligibility here. We are simply trying to cover the same kids that are eligible but not enrolled. 
   And if you go along with the President's veto of this legislation, what you're saying is that not only the kids that are not enrolled, but even those who are now in the program won't be able to get their health insurance. Shame on you for that.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE CHILDHOOD CANCER AWARENESS, TREATMENT, AND RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise today to express my strong support for House Resolution 470, supporting efforts to increase childhood cancer awareness, treatment, and research. I am proud to join my colleagues across the aisle and throughout this body in support of this resolution. 
   September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, marking the time when we raise awareness of childhood cancer and the lives affected. Although cancer in children is rare, it is estimated that this year alone more than 12,000 children will be diagnosed with cancer and nearly one-fifth will die, making cancer the leading cause of disease-related deaths for children under the age of 15. 
   House Resolution 470 reminds us that cancer occurring during childhood has harmful repercussions for a child's future well-being. Cancer compromises a child's natural defenses against other types of illnesses and destroys organs and bones. Cancer disrupts a child's life at a time when he or she should be otherwise more concerned with exploring the world and making new discoveries instead of undergoing chemotherapy or medical therapies. 
   House Resolution 470 reminds us that more must be done to fight this devastating disease. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of those children and their families attempting to deal with such a terrible disease. 
   I want to thank in particular the sponsor of this legislation, Representative Pryce of Ohio, because I know that she has worked so hard on this in trying to push it to the floor today. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution concerns two errors in the bill, H.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007. The bill has passed both the House and Senate and is currently in the process of being enrolled for delivery to the President. 
   The resolution directs the Clerk of the House to correct two errors, both of which were made in drafting and inadvertently occurred as we all worked under pressure to complete the drafting of H.R. 3580. 
   We were under pressure to complete that bill, as you know, before the expiration date on September 30 of PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The failure to reauthorize PDUFA in time would have caused the Food and Drug Administration to send out notice of employee layoffs. 
   I'm aware of no objection to passage of the resolution, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday gas prices hit an average of $4.04 a gallon, a new historic high. While Democrats are taking action to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and lower prices, Republicans continue to repeat the same old rhetoric, continue drilling in ANWR, even though the President's own Energy Department has concluded that opening up the Arctic for drilling would not reduce the price of gasoline for another 20 years, and then it would only go down by about 1 penny per gallon. That's not an energy plan to be proud of. 
   From day one this Democratic Congress has been fighting to reduce our independence on foreign oil, bring down record gas prices and launch a cleaner and smarter energy future. We passed bills holding OPEC and oil companies accountable for price fixing, investing in renewable energy for green jobs and cracking down on price gouging by oil companies. 
   The only problem is that we are not getting enough support from either House Republicans or from President Bush. How high are prices going to actually have to get before Republicans support these important bills?

   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we're here today to consider H.R. 1553, the Caroline Pryce Walker Cancer Act of 2008. 
   Between infancy and 15 years of age, cancer is the leading cause of death by disease among children in the United States. In 2007, approximately 10,000 new cases of pediatric cancer were diagnosed in children ages 0 to 14 years. 
   Although the incidents of invasive cancer has increased slightly over the past 30 years, mortality has declined dramatically for many childhood cancers. Despite these advances, treatments for some childhood cancers are inadequate. Negative effects resulting from current pediatric cancer therapies indicate a need to strengthen Federal support for activities leading to an enhanced understanding of childhood cancers and treatments that are less toxic and more effective. 
   H.R. 1553 would strengthen the Federal investment in pediatric cancer research and reassert Congress's commitment to conquering childhood cancer. This legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue to enhance, expand, and intensify pediatric cancer research and other activities related to pediatric cancer. Furthermore, this legislation directs HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enhance and expand infrastructure to track the epidemiology of pediatric cancer into a comprehensive nationwide registry of actual occurrences of pediatric cancer. 
   I want to thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for working together in a bipartisan fashion to get this important legislation to the floor today. I would also like to commend, in particular, Representative Chris Van Hollen and also Representative Deborah Pryce, whose diligent work and commitment to this issue are the reason we're here today. 
   This legislation, Madam Speaker, is named in memory of Representative Pryce's 9-year-old daughter Caroline who tragically lost her valiant battle against a rare form of cancer, neuroblastoma, on September 4, 1999. I can't think of a more fitting tribute to Caroline Pryce Walker than to see her mother's legislation overwhelmingly pass the House floor today. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues in the support of this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, democracy is based on the free exchange of ideas, debating issues to find a solution reasonable people can agree upon. However, when it comes to discussing the most important issue facing our Nation, the Senate Republican leadership is more concerned with giving the President political cover than engaging in a democratic debate of ideas. 
   The Republican Senate leadership is even blocking the voices in their own party by filibustering debate on any resolution dealing with the war in Iraq, including the McCain-Graham resolution supporting the President's troop surge and the Warner-Levin resolution in opposition to it. The consideration of these resolutions, especially the bipartisan Warner-Levin resolution, would serve as the basis for the first real debate on the President's flawed Iraq war policy since the war began nearly 4 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve a democratic discussion of ideas on the issue that is most important to them. Next week we will have a debate here in the House that will allow each of us to speak our minds on the President's plan, and I would hope that the Senate leadership would allow the same debate over in the other Chamber.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, this evening I am joined by some of my colleagues who are new Members, and we are going to talk about the President's health care proposals and also what he articulated both in his State of the Union Address, and more recently last Monday when he gave us his budget message. 
   And my concern, as always, is that President Bush has prioritized, or says he wants to prioritize, health care as an issue and particularly deal with the problem of the uninsured. And we certainly recognize that under his watch as President for the last 6 or 7 years that the problem of the uninsured has grown greater in this country. There are more uninsured than ever. But at the same time the proposals that the President puts forward, in particular the amount of money that has been allocated in his budget for some of these health care needs, does not go along, essentially, with the rhetoric that he has been using, saying that he wants to cover the uninsured and prioritize the concerns of the uninsured. 
   And, again, I always say my effort is not to chastise the President. I appreciate the fact that President Bush is prioritizing health care and talking about it, because he has the bully pulpit, and to the extent that he is out there talking about health care, it gives us an opportunity in the Congress to address the issue.     
   But it is unfortunate that the proposals in the budget that he proposes  do not really go along with any kind of concerted effort that would be meaningful to address those health care concerns, and particularly the problems of the uninsured. 
   Before I begin, I wanted to yield to my colleague from Colorado. I know he and I were both watching the debate by our Republican colleagues in the last hour. I know he would like to address some of those concerns. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. This does directly relate to the health care debate, because if you are in a State where your deficit continues to climb, as we face now under the years of the Republican majority, it is very difficult to address any unmet needs, whether it be health care or whatever, because of the deficit and the constant having to pay back on the debt. 
   I wanted to say something about what you mentioned in response to our Republican colleagues. I have been here a long time, almost 20 years now, I am in my 19th year. When I first started in 1988, the Democrats were in the majority. 
   There were a group of Republicans who used to come down every night doing special orders, just like we are, and they would have the pages bring this huge digital clock that literally was the whole length of the well, from this chart over to where my colleague from Colorado is, and there would be two or three pages that would bring this big digital clock down. They would go on and rail about the deficit and the deficit was going up so much a day. This literally went on for like 6 years while I was down here, from when I first started in 1988 until 1994. 
   In 1994, the Republicans took the majority under Newt Gingrich. The digital clock disappeared, and all we heard were constant spending and going deeper into debt, and nobody in the Republican Party ever mentioned the deficit again as it continued to climb in those years, and particularly now under President Bush. For the life of me, I don't understand where this whole traditional Republican philosophy, which was to care how you spent the money and you didn't want to go into debt, just disappeared from their ideology. 
   In fact, I have to say, in the last campaign, because you mentioned it, President Clinton was actually at an event that I attended in New Jersey, and I am not sure I can repeat exactly what he said. But essentially he said that he watched the Republican party under their congressional majority in the 12 years or so that they were in the majority go from this party of principles that was worried about not getting involved in wars that were not in the interest of the United States, worrying about the debt and spending money, to a party that just abandoned all these ideals. 
   He actually said, right now, the Democrats cover both the left and right ideologically, because we are still concerned about the problems of the average person in that we want to cover people who don't have health insurance. We want to make sure people can afford to send their kids to college. But at the same time, we have covered the area where we don't want to get involved in foreign wars or foreign entanglements that are not in our interest. And, most importantly, we are the ones most worried about the debt and trying to make sure we are not spending a lot of money. 
   Now, all of a sudden, we are in the majority, and they are starting to talk about the deficit that they have grown so much in the last 12 years. It is unbelievable. 
   When you talk about the health care debate, this goes to the heart of it, because the bottom line is, if you want to expand and deal with the problem of the uninsured, some of them are people that are not going to be able to afford to buy their own health insurance. If you don't have any money because you just keep racking up this huge debt, you are not going to be able to cover the people. So it directly relates. 
   I just wanted to give these statistics about where we have been in the last few years. If you look at this, the point I have been trying to make is under the President's watch for the last 6 or 7 years, not only have the number of uninsured gone up, but the cost of health care and health insurance keeps rising. Therefore, it has just become unaffordable for a lot of Americans. 
   This chart says that workers are now paying an average of $1,094 more in annual health care premiums for their families than they did in the year 2000. You can see the problem with the affordability of health care. 
   Then the next chart has the number of uninsured in 2001, 41.2 million, and the number of uninsured in 2006, 47 million. One million more Americans become uninsured each year under the President's watch. 
   The chart over there, I will leave to the gentleman to explain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Just briefly, I want to yield to the gentlewoman, and I have my colleague from the Virgin Islands here, too. The problem with what the President has proposed, both in the State of the Union and the budget message on Monday, there are really two major ways to cover more of these uninsured. One is, you do something with the employer-based system, which is traditionally the way most people get their insurance, on the job, so it is easier for employers to provide health insurance and for their employees to contribute to it. 
   The other, of course, is to build on existing Federal programs, whether it be Medicaid or Medicare or SCHIP, the program for kids, to expand eligibility  and make it so more people can sign up for them. 
   The problem that I wanted to point out tonight, and we will get into it more, is that between the State of the Union address and the budget message, what the President has proposed totally really does nothing to affect either of those areas. He is basically talking about taxing employer-sponsored benefits, group plans, if they are a good plan, and sending people into the individual market with some kind of a tax break. Generally speaking, that is not very helpful because it is going to penalize the people who have a good employer-sponsored plan and at the same time push people into the individual market where they probably cannot afford to buy a good policy. Then with the budget message on Monday, we got all these cuts in Medicaid, SCHIP, the government programs that we would like to see expanded to cover more of the uninsured. 
   So, between the two, he is addressing the problem but coming with proposals that, in my opinion, actually make it worse. 
   I yield now to the gentlewoman from Florida. I am glad she is with us tonight.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's remarks. You brought it home. It is hard sometimes to talk about the budget. The budget at the Federal level is a very complex thing. But we have to give an explanation, I think, about what the President's proposal is doing, which is really the opposite. It is not going to make it easier to cover the uninsured, it is going to make it more difficult. 
   I now yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, who is a physician and who has been very active in the whole health care issue for a number of years here in the Congress, particularly on the whole health care disparities issue, which is another thing that we haven't really talked about so much in this Congress, but has to be addressed.     
   I thank my colleague for yielding, and I want to thank Congressman Pallone for his leadership on health care for a number of years. And we are really happy that you are going to be chairing the Health Subcommittee, and we look forward to addressing all these issues with you. 
   But certainly, as you were saying, as we look at how we can expand access to health care and bring more Americans under coverage, we can't start by cutting what has been the backbone of health care, Medicare and Medicaid, SCHIP. Those need to be really strengthened. 
   As we look at the President's budget, which is very disappointing and one fairy tale that is not going to end, ``and they lived happily ever after,'' because the cuts that we are seeing are leaving our seniors, our disabled, and our children and pregnant women who are about to bring children into the world without the access to the kind of health care that they need. 
   Beyond that, as we look at health disparities for people of color, African Americans, Latino Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, there is nothing in the budget that addresses the gaps in health care for these populations. And certainly, if we are ever going to reduce the skyrocketing cost of health care, we need to focus on prevention and comprehensive systems of care that help people to stay healthy. And we also have to look at the social determinants of health care. You can't live in rundown housing and polluted neighborhoods and be healthy. So we have a lot of things to address. 
   And going beyond the cuts that you have already talked about in Medicare and Medicaid and SCHIP, there are so many other areas that are being cut as well that further undermines what we need to do to provide good quality comprehensive health care for people in this country. Some of them, funding for training: In the President's budget, again, nursing training is cut $88 million; the National Health Service Corps is cut; health profession training programs that bring some of the underrepresented minorities to serve our increasingly diverse population are cut $135 million, and it has already been cut in 2006; $143 million for children's vaccines is cut, vaccines, one of the bulwarks of prevention in this country; mental health programs cut $159 million; rural health cut $143 million. 
   So instead of helping, and you rightly point out that the proposal, the only proposal that we have heard with respect to health care in this country, the President's proposal and tax credits does more to harm the system than help the system. And then, in addition to that, undermining the safety net of Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP, as well as cutting some of the programs that provide the services that would be there to keep people healthy. 
   So this budget is a terrible budget. I know that we are under very, very tight fiscal constraints with huge unprecedented deficits, huge debts, but somehow the people are counting on us to improve health care in this country. And improving health care in this country really improves productivity. It keeps our country strong, and it is a matter of national security. And the health of our people is the health of our Nation, and we have to find a way to restore these cuts in the budget and close the gaps in health care, expand access to more Americans; and in doing so, we really will be helping our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments, and I know how much you have worked on this issue  and, in particular, the disparities issues. I could go on, too, with some of these things. We have worked a lot on health care for American Indians and the Indian Health Service. Now, there is a slight increase for the Indian Health Service, but he took out the whole urban Indian issue. And we find a lot of American Indians now gravitating toward urban areas, and he just cut out the whole program for them. 
   I want to yield to some of the other Members. But if we could just, because it is hard to explain this whole thing with the President's tax initiatives, but I think we should spend a little time on it. In his State of the Union Address, what he basically said is that, for the people who are in employer-sponsored health insurance, which still most Americans get their health insurance that way, a lot of them either through their union or individually with their employers have bargained, if you will, to have a very good health care package that is comprehensive; and what basically he is saying is, if it is too good, I will call it the Cadillac proposal, then we are going to tax you because you don't need such great health coverage. And then, at the same time, whatever money we are going to save on that, we are going to use by giving a tax break for those who go and try to buy insurance through the individual market. But the problem with that is, you know, the individual market is very volatile, very insecure, no guarantee that you can even buy a policy. So most of these people that are uninsured are not in a position to buy a policy in the individual market. So even if they get a break, it is probably not going to mean that much to them that they would actually be able to buy a good policy. So why would you sacrifice people who have a good policy and tax them to pay for people to go into the individual market, which is one that you may not be able to even get into anyway because it is expensive or there are all kinds of problems with eligibility. So that is the biggest concern. I don't know if anybody wants to talk about that, but that is why I think his proposal for employer sponsored care just makes no sense. If anybody wants to address that, otherwise, I will yield to you, and you talk about whatever you would like. The gentleman from Wisconsin.

   Mr. PALLONE. If you could just yield to me for a second. I really appreciate you bringing this up because I think it is so much on point. And I know there is a lot of confusion. 
   We have a fiscal year that goes from October to October. Last year, when the Republicans were in the majority, they didn't deal with the budget at all. They literally left at the end of the session in their lame duck in December and said, we can't pass the budget, we can't deal with the appropriations, so we are going to go home, and we will leave it to the next Congress. So literally last week, we had to adopt the budget of the appropriations of the previous year that had already began October 1st, and it was level funding. In other words, it was basically a continuing resolution that didn't add any money and used the previous year's budget as a baseline. And even with that, we were able to increase money for veterans' health, for Ryan White, which deals with HIV, for global AIDS, for the National Institutes of Health. The emphasis and the priority was on trying to provide more money for health care even as we were cutting other things, and we did that. 
   The reality is that President Bush's budget that we got this week, which is for next year, because the last year's budget has not been passed in the Senate and gone to his desk yet, didn't even take into consideration, and in many of the cases, those health care items that he put in this budget are less than what we adopted in that continuing resolution. 
   So here we are trying to make everything right, and we are not getting any help either from the Republicans last year when they were in the majority or now from the President and the Republicans on the other side. And for them to even come down here tonight and talk about the budget or the deficit is absurd given their record. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate your comments. And I really think it is important that we keep stressing how we want to prioritize these health care needs, and there are so many, whether it is veterans or children or whatever it is. 
   I just want to give you a couple statistics. And I know it gets so bureaucratic to say, what is he doing up here with these statistics?     
   When we talk about the uninsured, the biggest groups still are the kids, and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands knows how much over the years what this SCHIP or kid care program, that we have tried to prioritize that, send the money back to the States, use their help to try to insure a lot of these kids. 
   I just use my State, but you could use any State. In my State right now for this SCHIP or kid care program, we have more kids that are eligible, meaning that they could theoretically sign up, or their parents could sign up, for this program than are currently enrolled, even though the program has been around for a while, and that is true in almost every State. 
   What we were hoping was that the President, in saying he wanted to deal with the uninsured, and knowing that the biggest group of uninsured is children, believe it or not, that he would simply provide funding to at least enroll those kids that are not enrolled who are currently eligible for the program. I am not even talking about expanding eligibility to kids who would not be eligible right now. 
   We got some statistics because we had a hearing with the Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this week, and the number of children, if you want to just enroll those who are currently eligible, we figure it would take about $12- to $14 billion over 5 years to keep up with medical inflation to prevent current enrolled children from losing their coverage. I am talking about the ones that are now in the SCHIP program, $12- to $14 billion over 5 years just to make sure that they are still funded, those that are in it, and then at least another $35- to $45 billion over 5 years to reach eligible but uninsured children. These are the ones that could enroll, but they just have not for some reason. Their parents do not know about the program, the application is difficult, who knows. 
   So you are talking about what, maybe $60 billion over the next 5 years if you want to keep, to keep those that are in the program and expand it to those who are eligible, and we are not even talking about expanding eligibility. 
   He comes in, the President, in his budget with $5 billion. That would not even allow us to keep up with the kids that are currently in the program. These are not kids that are really poor and the parents are not working. These are working parents. I think the eligibility is up to like $38,000 for a family of four. They are working, but they cannot get health insurance on the job. We went into that before, and so they try to tap into this Federal program. 
   Well, the Secretary said, well, we think $5 billion is enough, and if it is not, well, then the States will have to take care of it. You know, the States are not in a position, I mean, they already have a hard enough time coming up with the money under the current match without having to go beyond that. So I just use that as an example. 
   The SCHIP, the kids health care program, is for those kids whose parents are working and who are making a little more money and are not eligible for Medicaid, which is for kids that are actually at the poverty level, like less than $20,000 for a family of four.

   I just wanted to mention one more thing. The President in his budget message highlighted this SCHIP program, this kid care program, saying they are going to get another $5 billion, which, as I said, is not enough to keep up with the kids currently in the program. 
   But at the same time the Medicaid program, which deals with those who really are in poverty and whose parents probably are not working because they are disabled or whatever their situation is, covers even more kids than the SCHIP, because SCHIP was put in place to try to supplement Medicaid. 
   So I asked this question of the Secretary. I did not even get a response, because in the President's budget Medicaid, which covers 23 million children, SCHIP only covers 6.6-. So Medicaid covers 23-, SCHIP covers 6.6-. They herald the fact that they are giving $5 billion in extra dollars to SCHIP which does not even keep up with inflation, but in the same time over the 5 years, they cut Federal funding for Medicaid by $25.7 billion, and Medicaid covers, what did we say, five times as many kids and five times the cut. So we are not even talking about the poor kids here. He is just saying, well, forget them. I mean, I am not even addressing the problem of the poor kids and what happens to them. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. PALLONE. Can I just ask you, because I know you are a physician, when we talk about some of these programs like Medicaid, SCHIP, Medicare, and I know the gentlewoman from Florida brought it up. I know it is hard a lot of times when you are on the floor and you talk about doctors and they are not getting enough money for Medicare. They will say the doctors are all making a lot of money; why are you bringing that up? 
   The reality is we are getting to a crisis now where many physicians simply will not accept payment from some of these programs because the reimbursement rate has gotten so low. 
   Now, you mentioned Medicare, because that is the big one for seniors and the disabled, and how a lot of doctors now are not even looking to take Medicare, but when you talk about Medicaid, which I mentioned before, that has gotten to the point of no return. 
   Could I yield to you? Do doctors even take Medicaid in Wisconsin anymore?

   Mr. PALLONE. Well, the one thing that I keep hearing, of course, with the hospitals is their ability to care for what they call uncompensated care. One of the things that the President proposed both in the State of the Union and his budget was to take money from the hospitals that get what they call disproportionate share, DSH. I hate to use these acronyms because it gets so bureaucratic, but your hospitals that have a disproportionate share of people that do not have health insurance, the uncompensated care. 
   Over the years, we have provided more funding for those hospitals through Medicare and other Federal programs so that they can cover the uninsured. Again, the President says we will give the States more money by cutting the payments to these disproportionate share hospitals. 
   In my home State of New Jersey, I mean, that is absurd. We have State legislators and the Governor now that are talking about trying to provide some kind of comprehensive health insurance so nobody in New Jersey goes without health insurance. The only way to do that is if the Federal Government provides some additional help in some of the ways we discussed tonight, but if you start cutting back on the funding that is going to these hospitals that cover all these uninsured people, it is like robbing Peter to pay Paul, I guess is the expression. It just does not work. 
   So I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. PALLONE. You are absolutely right. I appreciate the fact that you talk about how, by covering kids or even adults, you save money in the emergency room or in hospitalization or whatever it is. But also, you mentioned the outreach, because I talked earlier about how you have more kids that are eligible for this children's health care program than are even in it. The reason is because a lot of States have cut back on outreach, so they don't tell people that they can apply. They don't even know about it. Some States may even be doing it on purpose because they want to save money in the short run. So that is why we talk about reauthorizing this and expanding it. You even need money for the outreach, which is clearly not in the budget. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.

   Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate your comments, because I know, as a physician and someone so caring, that you really understand how these problems relate to individuals. 
   I also appreciate the fact that you brought up the issue of priorities, because when we spend so much on the war in Iraq, as you say, we don't have the money, and the gentleman from Colorado talked about the deficit. The fact of the matter is that the President and the Republicans built up this deficit for so long, and now it makes it more difficult for us to find the funds to pay to cover the uninsured in the same way that we are spending all this  money in Iraq, and it means that we don't have the money left. 
   If I could just conclude, because I know we are running out of time, I do appreciate the fact that, in his State of the Union Address and also in the budget message, that the President was prioritizing health care and pointing out that we have a big problem with the uninsured. 
   But unless the solutions and the money are there to lead us down the path of covering the uninsured or lowering health care costs, then it is not going to be good enough to just say that is a problem. 
   I think, as you say, when we talk about going in a new direction, it means that the Democrats and the Democratic majority are determined to not only highlight that these problems exist and that we need to cover the uninsured to reduce cost, but to come up with solutions that practically are going to make a difference. That is why I am so happy that not only are you both here tonight speaking, but just that you are here, because all the new Members and particularly the new Democratic Members, I think, are going to make it possible to address these problems in a practical way. 
   I would conclude, again, by thanking both of you and everyone who joined us tonight, because we are moving in a new direction, and it is going to make a difference. Thank you.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we introduced the CHAMP Act, an essential package that addresses the health care needs of our children and seniors while also meeting the needs of our doctors. I am particularly proud of our efforts to ensure that 11 million children receive the health care coverage they need to lead healthier lives. 
   Today, we are at a crossroads on children's health. Studies show that if we ensure that children receive preventative health care in their formative years, they will lead healthier lives. But over the last year, the number of uninsured children has increased for the first time in a decade. That is why it is so important to strengthen SCHIP. 
   This is not an expansion of the program. Today we are reaching 6 million children. Under the CHAMP Act, we will reach an additional 5 million children who are already eligible. 
   Over the past 10 years, SCHIP has received strong bipartisan support because it serves as a lifeline to those most vulnerable among us, our children. It has always received strong bipartisan support. At a time when the number of uninsured is increasing, I would hope Republicans would join us in passing this legislation.

   This week alone, the new Democratic Congress has provided critical oversight of the administration's unacceptable neglect of our wounded soldiers. At a hearing earlier this week, some of my Republican colleagues said they have known about some of the treatment for several years, but they didn't realize it was this bad. And that is what oversight hearings are for. If you know there is a problem, you haul the Pentagon up to Capitol Hill to get answers. 
   The old Republican Congress simply ignored these problems. That is not happening in the Democratic Congress. This week, we held four different oversight hearings so that we can find solutions quickly to ensure that what happened at Walter Reed never happens again. 
   This Democratic House has also held its first hearing this week on the scandal at the U.S. Attorney's Office, where politics once again trumps competence in the Bush administration. Eight U.S. attorneys were fired so the Bush administration could pad the resumes of other attorneys.

   In the first 3 weeks of the new Congress, we have not disappointed. Democrats have delivered on all six promises. During 100 hours we have increased the minimum wage, implemented the 9/11 Commission recommendations, cut student loan interest rates in half, repealed preposterous welfare handouts to Big Oil, approved Federal funding for promising stem cell research, and provided our government the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for America's seniors. 
   Six major pieces of legislation passed by this House within the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, an influential Republican voice on foreign affairs admitted that the war in Iraq is doing more harm than good and that, I quote, ``Our course in Iraq has lost contact with our vital national security interests in the Middle East and beyond.'' 
   Those are the words of Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, who went to the Senate floor last night to say that changes in strategy need to be made before September. Lugar's comments should be listened to very carefully by my Republican colleagues who continue to hold out hope that the President's troop escalation strategy can work. 
   Senator Lugar is just the latest to admit that the President's plan is not working and that a new strategy is needed in Iraq. Last week, General Petraeus himself said that we will not meet the target of seeing any positive results from the troop escalation plan by September. 
   Now, Senator Lugar's realistic assessment of the war in Iraq is commendable, but words are simply not enough. If Lugar is convinced that the war in Iraq is no longer in our Nation's best interest, he must join us in finding an alternative that begins to bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (SRI LANKA'S CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to bring attention to the full blown violence taking place in Sri Lanka. The last round of talks in Geneva ended up in a failure, and there are no signs of new negotiations. There is no peaceful solution in sight, and it is the civilians who are desperately suffering. 
   Since 1983, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been in a military confrontation with the Government of Sri Lanka to win a separate ethnic minority Tamil state. Since last April, more than 200,000 people have been displaced from their homes by the escalation in violence and insecurity. And this is in addition to more than 310,000 people who were displaced previously due to the conflict. 
   Now, because of this violence, the main highway connecting the two major areas in the north and east region of the country is closed, forcing civilians to use tortuous routes to reach safety. In recent months about 20,000 people have fled through jungles and treacherous waterways towards the government-controlled territory. 
   Thousands who have not fled are trapped in eastern Sri Lanka and caught between the intense crossfire. Every day there are more news stories highlighting the increasing casualties among the civilian populations, especially children and young adults. Violence continues in other parts of the island nation as well. And many civilians have been killed in air raids and bus bombings in recent weeks. Families live in constant fear, anxiously hoping for their security. 
   Now, meanwhile, Madam Speaker, access for humanitarian agencies has been a growing problem over the past year. Civilians in Jaffna in the north and in the affected districts of the east have had great difficulty obtaining necessary food and medical supplies. 
   Both the government and the Tigers should commit to providing humanitarian agencies with unregulated access and full support. 
   Madam Speaker, the army says the civilians are being used as human shields by the Tamil Tigers. The Tigers deny this claim and accuse the army of targeting civilians to facilitate their forthcoming offensive. And regardless of blame, innocent civilians are dying. 
   After nearly 25 years of violence, it is clear: there can be no military solution to the conflict. A negotiated political settlement must be reached, and that one will have to be fair to all of the ethnic communities living in the country of Sri Lanka. 
   I am deeply troubled by the worsening situation in Sri Lanka, Madam Speaker, and it must be addressed by the United States. I commend the commitment by the Bush administration to provide funding for refugees, but I strongly urge President Bush to further U.S. involvement to help secure a lasting peace. 
   Last week I added my name to a letter urging President Bush to appoint a special envoy for Sri Lanka. The letter is being circulated by my friend from New Jersey, Mr. Rush Holt. And I urge my colleagues to also sign on. By naming a special envoy, the U.S. can create a personal monitoring presence in the country and make recommendations for steps to lead to peace. Sri Lanka, more than ever before, needs U.S. engagement.

I want to say, Mr. Speaker, it really concerns me that some of the Republicans on the other side this morning talked about this debate as silly and tried to trivialize a debate that involves our troops who are fighting, some of whom are dying in Iraq. 
   Our own intelligence agencies released a report earlier this month saying that the war in Iraq is not a civil war, it is worse, with numerous groups killing each other to gain the upper hand. Four times before, the President has sent thousands of additional troops to Iraq, and each time the situation on the ground either remained the same or grew even more dangerous. Could that be why our generals concluded, before being let go by this President, that sending more troops to Iraq simply will not help the situation?

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I rise this morning to share my concerns regarding the Turkish government's threats to retaliate against our country if the U.S. Congress adopts a resolution affirming the Armenian genocide. These shocking threats have been issued in response to the recent introduction of the Armenian genocide resolution, H. Res. 106. This measure seeks to affirm the U.S. record on the Armenian genocide by recognizing it as a historical fact. It also praises the American record of opposition to this tragedy which is marked by courageous diplomatic protests and unprecedented American relief efforts for the survivors of this crime. 
   Senior Turkish government officials have warned that if Congress ever considers this resolution, they will cut off supply access for our forces serving in Iraq. In fact, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told Vice President Dick Cheney that the U.S. must, and I quote, calculate the costs of losing Turkey. 
   Such a brazen threat to interfere in U.S. military operations is absolutely unacceptable. I am outraged that the Turkish government would put the lives of soldiers at risk in the pursuit of its desperate campaign to deny the systematic slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians. This extremist behavior is known as blackmail in my book and it should be publicly and forcefully rejected as such. Clearly, Turkey is no friend of the United States. 
   As an American, I am deeply offended that another country is seeking to dictate where our Nation stands on core moral issues. Especially a country that claims to embrace democracy, yet has a longstanding history of abusing minorities, intellectuals and the principle of freedom of expression. As a Member of Congress, it is extremely troubling that a foreign government is meddling in our Nation's legislative process through threats and intimidation. This is the most dramatic intervention of a foreign government in U.S. congressional affairs and it has been going on for much too long. 
   Mr. Speaker, senior Bush administration officials, rather than outright rejecting these outrageous intimations by the Turkish government, are passing them on to Members of Congress as justification for not supporting the Armenian genocide resolution. The Bush administration is showing no courage on this issue, instead giving Turkey a free pass on their efforts to deliberately reject the truth. They seem to go to any lengths, including having soldiers call into their Representatives in fear of their lives, to deny the Armenian genocide simply because Turkey demands that they do so. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Armenian genocide resolution already has 175 cosponsors. I am certain that if Members of this House were given the opportunity to vote on this resolution, we would pass it overwhelmingly. Congress should be allowed to reaffirm what we all believe and know to be fact, and that is that genocide was orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 to exterminate its Armenian citizens. 
   Reaffirming the Armenian genocide is a matter of conscience. It is my hope that this Congress will rebuke any warnings against the United States by Turkey and consider legislation on the Armenian genocide.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the debate taking place here in the House this week is long overdue. We are approaching our fifth year of this war, and this is the first time Congress is debating the strategy President Bush wants to implement in Iraq. 
   Congress can no longer stand on the sidelines, and the President has to know that to escalate the war in Iraq is simply not acceptable. We have lost too many American lives, seen too many soldiers seriously injured and spent too much of our hard-earned taxpayer money for no good reason. I am proud of my vote against the initial Iraq war resolution, and see this resolution before us tonight as the beginning of the end to U.S. military involvement in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to commend our troops for the valiant work they have done over the last 5 years. I am thinking of them when I voice my strong opposition to the President's plan to send 21,500 additional troops to Iraq. 
   The President hopes this troop escalation plan will secure Baghdad and reduce the sectarian violence that is ripping the country apart. But there is no evidence to support those hopes. 
   In fact, on four different occasions the President increased troop levels in Iraq, and every time these plans failed to calm the violence in Iraq. Last summer the President moved more troops into Baghdad and said that he hoped to see some results in a matter of months. By October, General William Caldwell had publicly stated that the surge was a failure and the operations had ``not met our overall expectations of sustaining a reduction in the levels of violence.'' 
   Additional troops are not going to make a difference because there simply is not a military solution to the war in Iraq. The devastating sectarian violence is going to continue, but our troops should no longer be asked to serve as referees in a battle between religious sects that have been fighting for centuries. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that if you speak out against the President's proposal, you are not supporting our troops, and this is nonsense. And if they listened to the troops, they would know that not even a majority of our troops support the President's plan. According to a poll conducted by Army Times, a weekly newspaper popular with Active Duty and retired Army personnel, only 41 percent of our troops support the President's plan. But they will do whatever is asked of them, regardless of whether or not they agree with the command. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of the war, our troops fought without the body armor they needed to protect themselves against improvised electronic devices. It now appears that the military doesn't have the protective equipment needed to properly outfit the troops the President plans to send to Iraq. According to the Army, it lacks not only armor kits for soldiers, but also trucks and vehicles needed to accommodate any escalation in troop levels. Lieutenant General Steven Speaks, the Army's deputy chief of staff for force development, said any additional units of troops sent to Iraq would have to share the trucks assigned to the units now there. 
   Do supporters of this plan really believe this Congress should allow the President to move ahead without properly investigating whether or not our troops will have all the necessary protective equipment they need? 
   Mr. Speaker, we also need to realistically look at the distraction that the Iraq war is causing in the overall war against terror. While the administration and the Pentagon focus their attention on Iraq, the war in Afghanistan has been forgotten. The Taliban has significantly grown in strength in Afghanistan, and America needs to focus its attention there, the source of the attacks on 9/11. 
   Mr. Speaker, I opposed this war from the very beginning, and want to see our troops home. The President should be putting forth a plan for withdrawal from Iraq, not escalation. I am willing to vote to cut off funding for the escalation. I have voted against the Iraq supplemental appropriation bills to send a message that we need to end U.S. military involvement in Iraq. With this resolution, we begin the process of getting out of a place where we should never have been from the beginning.

   The status quo simply cannot continue. It is time this Congress seriously level with the Iraqi Government that it must meet the benchmarks the President himself outlined earlier this year. And if they cannot meet those benchmarks, it is time to start bringing our troops home. 
   It is time the Iraqi Government is held accountable for its actions. The Maliki government must realize that it has to meet political, economic and diplomatic benchmarks in the region, and that if serious improvements are not seen in the coming months, then we will begin the process of redeploying our troops out of Iraq. 
   This week, we will have an opportunity to exert pressure on the Iraqi Government to meet the President's own benchmarks. If the Iraqi Government continues to believe that our involvement there is indefinite, what kind of pressure are they going to have to make the necessary reforms? They are not, and that's why this change in direction is much needed at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Kansas and, of course, my colleague, the gentlewoman from New York, for introducing this resolution. 
   I was here on the floor doing 1-minutes, and then I started to listen to the debate, and I think it is very important that this resolution be introduced for a number of reasons, but I also wanted to relate it, if I could, to my family. 
   I think that many of the exploits of veterans during World War II, including Air Force veterans, and I know the Army Air Force, that is what they were called then, are kind of unsung. People are not aware of it. People are not necessarily aware of the different units and how they served, and including the Air Force. 
   I notice that in the resolution she particularly mentions that not only are we honoring the service and sacrifice of the glider pilots, but we are also urging the people of the United States to remember and teach future generations about the contributions and sacrifices that glider pilots and all veterans have made to and for the United States, and I have to relate a story with my own dad. 
   My father was in the Army Air Force during World War II. He served in the Pacific, and he was a tail gunner with the reconnaissance forces, the planes that came in and took the pictures before I guess the other missions with bombs and other things took place. And for a long time, he is 83 now, for a long time when I was growing up, he would never talk about it, and I could never really understand why. In fact, he would never even want to take an airplane. He apparently served in the Pacific, came back, and went across the country by train instead of using an airplane to get back. 
   One day, we were down in Washington, and we went to the Air and Space Museum with my son, who is now 11 years old, but then maybe he was 6 or 7 years old. My father all of the sudden started to tell the story about his time during World War II because he saw some of the planes in the Air and Space Museum that were involved in some of those combat operations. It was such a tremendous experience for my son to hear my father talk about his experience during the war with reconnaissance planes and also as a tail gunner. He never told about it in a heroic way; although everyone knows that was a very difficult position. Most of the tail gunners never came back. The majority actually were killed in action, even those that were involved in reconnaissance. 
   It was such a valuable experience for my son to hear his grandfather talk about that experience in the Army Air Force during World War II.     
   But I think a lot of the veterans simply don't tell the story. I don't really know why. I really think that when you draw attention to this, in this case the glider pilots, but there are others, when you draw attention to it and you make it a point that we need to follow up with our veterans and have them tell the story, it really is a very important thing, a lot more than I think a lot of people realize.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight to talk about the President's health plan that he discussed or brought forth in the State of the Union address last week, but I couldn't help after listening to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the continuing resolution that is going to come to the floor tomorrow to just spend one minute before I get into my health care Special Order just mentioning why I think what they said is so wrong. 
   I of course have been in Congress for a number of years now, and last year which was the last Republican majority Congress that we have had, I guess, or that we are going to have, the Republican leadership passed a budget that was so unrealistic that they were unable to complete work on nine of the 11 annual appropriation bills. So I think everyone needs to understand, Mr. Speaker, that whatever the Democrats do tomorrow is simply cleaning up the mess that the Republican leadership left us. They didn't do their job; they didn't do their work. 
   Most people would say that the main purpose of the Congress is to pass a budget and pass the appropriations bills so that the government can continue to operate, and they simply did not do that. They left here in December with only two of the 11 appropriations bills. Those dealing with defense and the military were passed. The other nine were just left, and they passed their own CR, or continuing resolution, to take us through I guess February 15, and basically said, okay, we are getting out of town and we leave this mess to the Democrats. So back in December, Senator Byrd and Congressman Obey announced a plan to wrap up the bills in a joint funding resolution, and that CR is coming to the floor tomorrow. 
   But I will stress, and I don't know how many times I can keep saying the same thing: there are no earmarks in that continuing resolution. None whatsoever. In fact, there is even language in the continuing resolution, and I will reference in title I, section 12 that says: ``Any language specifying an earmark in the committee report or statement of managers accompanying the appropriations act for this fiscal year or for the last fiscal year shall have no legal effect with respect to funds appropriated by this division.'' 
   So essentially what that says is: we are not allowing any earmarks. But even if one of the bills in the committee report or in the statement of managers, which are not binding under the law, even if one of those suggests an earmark, that the Federal agency responsible for administering that program has no obligation under the law to implement it. 
   I don't know how more emphatic we could be in saying no earmarks, no suggestions of earmarks. Don't pay any attention to anybody who tries to suggest an earmark. That is essentially what this language says. 
   So this whole effort to say that somehow there are earmarks in this is just fabrication. And beyond that, the fact of the matter is that we have no choice but to adopt this continuing resolution because they left us this mess and we have to move on to the next budget year. So I just wanted to point that out, and then I would like to move on to the real issue that I came here tonight to discuss, which is the President's health insurance proposal. 
   I was glad to see that in his State of the Union address that the President prioritized health care, and he said that he wanted to solve the problems of the current system both in dealing with the large number of uninsured and also with the fact that costs, the costs of the health care system continue to rise. So I will give him credit for prioritizing this issue, because he has not done so in the past. 
   But I have to be critical and say for the last 6 years President Bush and the Republican Congresses have ignored our Nation's health care problems. Because of that neglect, we have seen health care premiums skyrocket over the last 6 years since he has been President and the number of uninsured increase after we witnessed reductions in the number of uninsured in the late 1990s. When President Clinton was in office in the last couple years of his Presidency, for the first time in a generation the number of uninsured actually went down because of his policies. But ever since President Bush took office, the number of uninsured has gone up. And I just want to give some statistics on the President's record. 
   Here is the information on the uninsured: when he took office in 2001, there were 41.2 million Americans who were uninsured. Five years later, in 2006, the number had grown to 47 million. That is an increase, Mr. Speaker, of 1 million Americans every year on the President's watch. That is the first and I think most significant statistic. 
   And then the next poster I wanted to show has a map of the United States. And I think a lot of times when you give numbers, people don't necessarily respond to them or they just sound like a lot of bureaucracy. But forgetting the numbers for the moment, what this map shows is that the number of uninsured now exceeds the cumulative population of 24 States and the District of Columbia that we have outlined in the shade of red or orange here. So that is a lot of uninsured. That is the number of people that live in those 24 States and in the District of Columbia that are now uninsured. 
   And then the third thing is in terms of the premiums, because again the  President has said that he wants to address not only the problem of the uninsured but also the problem of costs for health care. So if you look at this chart, you can see that workers are now paying an average of 1,094 more in annual health care premiums for their families than they did in 2000. 
   So that is essentially what has happened while the President was in office. And this is based on information from the National Coalition of Health Care: workers are now paying on the average $1,094 more in annual health premiums for their families than they did in 2000. 
   Now, again, I appreciate the fact that President Bush highlighted this issue and suggested it needs to be prioritized, and hopefully his statement during the State of the Union address would suggest that he wants to work with the Democratic Congress to try to address these two problems, but his proposals have essentially been a nonstarter because they don't address the actual problems that he is seeking to highlight. 
   Essentially what he has done, and this is the one thing that I think is the most incredulous, is he is talking about a tax increase, and many of you know that President Bush repeatedly said he would never support a tax increase. It has been sort of the hallmark of his 6 or 7 years in office now, that he didn't want tax increases. But he actually said that he would effectuate a tax increase on a lot of people through his health insurance plan, because what he does is basically take those people who have a very good comprehensive policy, what you might call a Cadillac or a gold-plated insurance policy, well, they are going to be taxed. And the way that he is going to pay for the program is essentially to say, I will tax the people who have very good insurance coverage in order to give a break, a tax break, if you 
   will, to those people who don't, and I'll encourage people to go into the individual market because we will give them the tax break paid for by a tax increase for the first time on people that have a very good policy. Now, I know it gets a little complicated there, but I think it is very important for everyone to understand that he is actually proposing a tax increase on those people that have very good insurance coverage right now. 
   Now, I could talk for a lot longer on this, but I see that I have been joined by some of my colleagues. So rather just talking myself for the next 5 or 10 minutes, I would like to hear from some of them. I will start by yielding to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
   If I could just mention that both of my colleagues that are here tonight, one from Pennsylvania, one from Tennessee are new Members, and I particularly appreciate your coming down to discuss this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. If I could just ask the gentleman to yield back. I just want to give an example of exactly what you were talking about. 
   Under the President's tax plan, a low-income person who was previously uninsured would receive about a $1,200 tax break. That is assuming that they are paying taxes. At a time when the average cost of coverage for a family is around $11,000 a year, a $1,200 tax break is not going to be enough to get that person insured. In contrast, the higher-income person who was previously uninsured would receive nearly $6,000. So the problem is, the person who is more likely to benefit from this is the higher-income person who doesn't have a very good plan. If their plan is good, then they are even going to get taxed on it. 
   So your point I think is very well taken, how is that little bit of a tax break going to get that person to be able to go out into the individual market and buy a health insurance policy? It is simply not the case. 
   I yield back to you.

   Mr. PALLONE. I would just ask the gentleman, my question, isn't it also possible under the scenario you laid out that under the President's plan that the employer has an incentive to essentially drop insurance coverage all together and say, Okay, well, now that you have this tax deduction, why don't you just go out and buy insurance on your own. And doesn't even offer the health insurance anymore. It actually could even make the situation worse in terms of the uninsured, because he says, Okay, you go out now and buy the insurance on your own.

   Mr. PALLONE. The other thing that bothers me is that a lot of people will either individually negotiate with their employer, or if they are part of a union, negotiate through their union, a better health package, and call it a Cadillac or gold-plated package. They trade that for not having a salary increase or some other benefit because they want that health care benefit for themselves or their family. 
   So why should they be penalized by having to pay an extra tax because they have made that decision? These are the kinds of life decisions that people make depending on their circumstances.

   Mr. PALLONE. Because they were the do-nothing Congress, essentially. That was their hallmark. 
   Today is January 30. We have met the majority of the business days this month. We have been in session. We passed bills during the 100 hours that affect so many things: negotiated prices for prescription drugs, cutting the interest rate for student loans in half, and the list goes on. 
   They met once in the previous session in January. The way the process works, and I know you are familiar with it, is that your appropriations bills are supposed to be passed in both the House and Senate by, say, June or July at the latest, and then you have conferences. And before October 1, which is the beginning of the fiscal year, you come back with the conference reports in September and you pass them before October 1, which is the end of the fiscal year. 
   They did none of that. They only passed those bills and sent them to the President in two cases: defense and military construction bills, both defense-oriented. Everything else was neglected. I don't believe the Senate passed a single bill. In the House we passed some, didn't pass others. 
   And when they had the lame duck session after the election, they simply went out of business. They passed a CR which just continues current levels of funding until February 15 and said, Okay, you guys won the election, you deal with it. 
   Normally, in January, we start the next fiscal year, having hearings and putting together the budget, and the President delivers it by the end of the month or the beginning of February. If we didn't pass the continuing resolution to get this year done quickly in the fashion we are going to tomorrow, or in the next couple of days or weeks, we would be having to deal with last year's budget left to us by them, this mess, and we wouldn't even have time to move on to the next fiscal year. 
   They just left this mess. The amazing thing is it has no earmarks, which is a reform, and yet they keep talking about it as if it does.

   Mr. PALLONE. I don't know the specifics in terms of each line item. It is a 400-page bill. But I would point out, we have that language in the bill that I read before that specifically says that any suggestion that there be an earmark, even if it is just in a committee report or even suggested by the managers, should be simply ignored by the agencies that are involved. 
   Imagine that, as Democrats in the majority, we are telling the agencies that are controlled by the Republican President, pay no attention to any suggestion of an earmark, do what you think is best. What can be more bipartisan than that? And yet they are saying it is filled with all of these earmarks.

   Mr. PALLONE. I am glad you mentioned that. I think that is a very important point. 
   The President is very much aware of the fact that many States, and there are getting to be more and more--in my State in April there is going to be a proposal to have universal coverage in New Jersey. Many States are trying to cover everyone and get rid of all of the uninsured. 
   What the President said in the State of the Union address was, we will take money from disproportionate-share hospitals, and these are hospitals that are getting Federal dollars because they have a high number of charity care cases, people who have no insurance; he is saying we will cut back and we will give that to States, to the governors, so they can help deal with the problem of the uninsured. 
   Well, in many States, including my own, that will only aggravate the problem. They are getting that money to cover people who have no insurance. So it is like, what is the expression, robbing Peter to pay Paul. That 
   is essentially what it is. We will take the money that is now being used to cover people, and we will cut that and give it back to you so you can cover them. It makes no sense.

   Mr. PALLONE. The President talks about health care costs, but in my opinion the biggest thing that could be done or one of the major accomplishments would be if he would simply go along with what we passed in the first 100 hours, which is negotiated prices for prescription drugs. Imagine the amount of money we could save with that. 
   It passed the House and it is over in the Senate, but he has said he is opposed to it. I am hoping that we can pass something in the Senate and we can get something to his desk that he will sign. 
   It is sort of hypocrisy on the one hand to talk about increasing costs, and this would be one of the easiest ways to save money, and we did it as Democrats, with all the new Members' help in the first 100 hours, and I hope that he would reconsider his opposition to it.

   Mr. PALLONE. I would just say, you know, a lot of people will say, well, why would the President want to do this? Why does he privatize? Why does he give money to the HMOs? What is the reason? Because you would like to think he would make the right decisions and do the right things. 
   There are two things I have to point out: one is that he is often driven by ideology, and I think it is a mistake. You have to be practical. You have to look at what actually works and not just look and say, well, government is not good and privatizing is better. Sometimes government is better. Sometimes privatizing is better. But just do not be stuck in this ideology that it is always better to privatize. 
   The other thing, unfortunately, is the special interests. I mean, the bottom line is that the drug companies traditionally gave a lot of money to the Republican candidates and his own campaign, and the same with the HMOs. The HMOs were always the darling of the Republicans and the President, and they contributed a lot to their campaigns. So there is a special interest reason here, as well as an ideological reason unfortunately.

   Mr. PALLONE. I want to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, but I would say if you were going to use the tax policy or the tax system as a way of addressing this in some meaningful way, it would be a lot more meaningful to a low-income person if it was a refundable tax credit than as a tax deduction, simply because they really cannot take advantage of the tax deduction. 
   At some point, I think we should also talk in the next 20 minutes or so about some of the alternatives that we would like to see instead of the President's plan, but I did not give the gentleman from Pennsylvania an opportunity. So I go back to him at this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate your comments because I think it is very important and I know it is a little detailed, but the fact of the matter is these points need to be made. 
   I just wanted to lead us, if I could, we have about 15, 20 minutes left, maybe not quite 20, into what we would do as an alternative. As I said, if you wanted to use tax policy as a way of trying to address the problems here, and I am not saying that that is the most effective way to do it, but if you did, certainly a refundable tax credit would be more useful to that lower-income person than this deduction that may not even be able to take advantage of. 
   But I just wanted to also point out that if you look at the problem with the uninsured right now, first is the employer-sponsored insurance which increasingly fewer and fewer people are able to take advantage of, even though they are working, because the employer simply does not provide either any coverage or a meaningful coverage that they can afford with their copayment. 
   What employers tell me is that we have to provide some sort of incentive for them if they are going to cover those people that work for them that they do not cover now, and that either means, again, if you are going to use tax policy, some kind of tax benefit to them or, alternatively, getting rid of some of the cost of the coverage. 
   For example, when Senator Kerry was running for President, he had proposed taking catastrophic insurance off the table. In other words, having the government in some way provide for catastrophic coverage because that is a big part of the cost and so the employers, if they did not have to pay for catastrophic coverage because the government was subsidizing that in some way, they would be a lot more likely to offer a health insurance plan with a relatively low copayment.     
   This is something the President hasn't mentioned. 
   The other thing, I think, and even more important, is that you have to realize there are a lot of people that are just never going to get employer-sponsored coverage, either because of the situation with their employment, whether it is full-time or part-time, or because they are not working and they are not, for some reason, eligible for existing government programs. 
   We also need to look at the government programs which the President completely ignores, whether it be, you know, Medicaid or Medicare or the SCHIP, you know, program for kids, and look at ways to expand eligibility and provide funding for those programs to sort of take up the gap. 
   I just want to throw those out as the types of things that the Democrats will be looking at in addition to the tax policy. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida.

   Mr. PALLONE. I appreciate your comments. I think they are right on point. We, in our Health Subcommittee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, in about 2 weeks, are going to have hearings on the SCHIP, the kid care program. One of the things we will be looking at is how we can get kids, now eligible, enrolled, because there are too many barriers. 
   I mean, in my home State of New Jersey, I really believe in our State we have been doing everything we can to try to get kids enrolled who are eligible. But we still have the majority, we have more kids that are eligible for SCHIP that are not enrolled than we had kids that are actually enrolled. 
   So something has to be done, whether it is outreach, whether it is getting rid of the bureaucracy, streamlining the application process. These are some of the things that we as Democrats are going to take up here, because this is a major way of covering the uninsured. 
   The biggest group of uninsured continues to be children, so I appreciate the gentleman's comment.

   Mr. PALLONE. I wanted to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I think we have about 7 minutes left, but I did want to mention one other thing. I know the gentleman from Florida brought up community health centers and that type of thing. That has got to be an important part of this as well. 
   It is unfortunate, because a few years ago in his budget message or State of the Union, the President actually said he wanted to prioritize community health centers and create a lot more, but he never provided the funding to do that, which is often the case. We get the rhetoric, but we don't get the funding. 
   To the extent that you can, take a lot of the people who are uninsured and who will go to an emergency room, and become part of that uncompensated care that is a big burden on the hospital, and you can, instead, set up community health centers, whether in a fixed place or in a mobile van or whatever, and have people go there as they would go to a doctor, as you said, and get the preventive care they would get from a doctor, as opposed to an emergency room later. That is a big factor in this, as well, that we have to look at. I wanted to commend the gentlewoman for what she said in that regard. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania again.

   Nothing short of a full public inquiry, without the limitations imposed by the British Inquiries Act, will enable the Finucane family to determine what actually happened when Pat was gunned down in his home on February 12, 1989. 
   This House and numerous international groups have consistently called for a full public inquiry to settle the troubling allegations of collusion surrounding this murder. A recent report of the Northern Ireland police ombudsman concluded that there was a disturbing level of collusion between the RUC Special Branch and loyalist paramilitaries, making this inquiry more important than ever. 
   Madam Speaker, ensuring a lasting peace in Northern Ireland requires us to continue the fight for justice that people like Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson, and others carried on throughout their lives, and that is why again I want to commend everyone and particularly our sponsor, my colleague from New Jersey, for introducing this resolution and urge its passage as quickly as possible so that we can actually see an independent, full inquiry.

   It seems everywhere you turn, the ``Coalition of the Willing'' is concluding it is time to get out of Iraq, while the Bush administration wants to send 21,500 more U.S. troops. 
   Just last week our biggest ally in the Iraq war, Britain, announced that it was withdrawing 1,600 troops from Iraq in the coming months. The same day Denmark said it, too, would pull out all of its 460 troops by the end of the summer. And then South Korea decided that 1,100 of its 2,300 troops would be withdrawn from Iraq in April, with the rest following later this year. 
   With this news, the ``Coalition of the Willing'' is no longer so willing, dwindling to about 10,000 troops. What is it that these countries know that the Bush administration still can't figure out? 
   Could it be that they see the writing on the wall; that they have concluded, as many others have here in the United States, that the Iraq war can no longer be won militarily?

All year President Bush has stubbornly said that he will not sign any appropriations bill that was higher than his budget request. So after months of working with our Republican colleagues, we approved an omnibus spending bill last night that fits into the President's funding levels, but addresses important Democratic priorities. 
   At a time when crime rates are increasing all around our country, we invest $1.2 billion over the President's budget to help local communities make their neighborhoods safer. At a time when significant infrastructure improvements are needed to prevent more bridges from collapsing, we invest $1 billion to make our bridges safer. And as Americans continue to pay record prices at the pump, we invest an additional $486 million in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to voice my support for an emergency supplemental bill that will produce a significant change in the way the war in Iraq is being waged. This is not an easy decision on my part. Back in 2002, I opposed giving President Bush the authority to wage the Iraq war, and ever since, I have opposed every supplemental bill that has come to this floor to pay for the war in Iraq. 
   During each supplemental debate, I voiced concern that Congress was essentially giving President Bush a blank check to wage the war as he saw fit. I voiced frustration that the Bush administration was unwilling to face the realities on the ground in Iraq and that Republican Congresses refused to provide proper oversight of billions of dollars that were handed out to contractors like Halliburton. 
   Last November, the American people sent a clear message that the status quo in Iraq was no longer acceptable.  They entrusted Congress to Democrats in the hopes that we would help take our Iraq policy in a new direction so that we could bring our troops home soon. 
   Mr. Speaker, the emergency supplemental addresses the concerns of the American people. It is a serious piece of legislation that brings together into one bill the recommendations of the nonpartisan Iraq Study Group, military generals, the Pentagon, and even the President himself. It provides us the first real opportunity to change course, and therefore it deserves the support of anyone who believes the status quo is no longer acceptable. 
   The supplemental takes into consideration the views of military generals and military experts who have said for months now that there is no longer a military solution possible in Iraq. Instead, they say the only way to end the civil war that is raging in Iraq is through political and diplomatic means. 
   Tomorrow this House will have the opportunity to send the President a strong message that the war in Iraq will not continue indefinitely. The legislation states that American troops will be out of Iraq no later than August 31, 2008, and if the Iraqi Government does not meet certain benchmarks in the coming months, our troops will be home by the end of this year. 
   With this legislation, the fate of Iraq now truly belongs to the Iraqis themselves. It is time the Iraqi Government stepped forward and takes some responsibility. The Maliki government must realize that it has to meet political, economic and diplomatic benchmarks that the President himself set, and that if serious improvements are not seen in the coming months, then we will begin the process of redeploying our troops out of Iraq. 
   This only makes sense, Mr. Speaker. If the Iraqi Government continues to believe that U.S. involvement there is indefinite, what kind of pressure are they going to have to make the necessary political reforms? They are not, and that is why both this pressure and a date certain for responsible redeployment are so important. 
   This legislation also begins the process of redirecting the Bush administration's attention to the forgotten war in Afghanistan by adding $1 billion to the Defense Department's request for military activities there. This increase supports our efforts to suppress a likely spring offensive by the Taliban. In addition, it will reinforce our humanitarian efforts in that war-torn country. We must work to give poor farmers an alternative to the illicit opium trade that is rampant throughout Afghanistan. 
   Finally, the legislation provides more money than the Pentagon requested for critical health care needs for veterans and wounded soldiers. Specifically, the legislation provides $1.7 billion more for defense health care and $1.7 billion more for veterans' health care in the hope that we can eliminate the horrific conditions and the treatment our wounded soldiers receive at Walter Reed. The brave men and women who fought on behalf of this country should not now have to endure bureaucratic delays in order to receive the health care services that they were promised. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week we entered the fifth year of this unfortunate war. Tomorrow we must step forward and support a bill that brings our troops home within the next 18 months, exerts pressure on the Iraqi Government, prioritizes the forgotten war in Afghanistan and provides additional funds for veterans and military health care. 
   Tomorrow we have the opportunity to change the direction of the war in Iraq, and we should certainly take it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, the chairman of the subcommittee, for this colloquy.  
   Mr. Chairman, in New Jersey, and all over the country, certain waste handlers and railroad companies have tried to exploit a supposed loophole in Federal law in order to set up unregulated waste transfer facilities. 
   Under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, the Surface Transportation Board, or STB, has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and the ability to grant Federal preemption over other laws at any level, local, State or Federal, that might impede such transportation. But Congress intended such authority to extend only to transportation by rail, not to the operation of facilities that are merely sited next to rail operations or have a business connection to a rail company. 
   Unfortunately, certain companies have exploited this loophole to build or plan waste transfer stations next to rail lines and avoid any regulation from State or local authorities. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Senate's efforts to close this loophole. They have passed an amendment in their version of the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, and I wanted to thank your subcommittee for recognizing this important issue in this bill's report language. 
   I had intended to offer an amendment, which I will not offer at this time, that would take the STB out of the waste management business by ensuring that funding for any decisions relating to waste transfer stations be eliminated. Again, you have dealt with this in the bill's report language, so it is not necessary to move this amendment at this time. But it is important that States and local municipalities have some say in this process.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (ARMENIAN GENOCIDE--THE WAR TRIBUNALS -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, the denial of the Armenian genocide is an absurdity. Looking at the history of this catastrophic event from 1915 to 1918, it is impossible to deny that this was indeed genocide on all accounts. 
   One way to bear witness to the truth is to make reference to the war trials that took place immediately following the end of World War I. Looking at the substantial evidence and testimony gathered during these war trials proves that this was an indisputable genocide aimed at destroying a race of people. 
   Following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I, a new government formed and accused its predecessor, Young Turk regime, of serious crimes. These accusations led to the court-martialing of the leadership of the Committee on Union and Progress, the party that had seized and held power since 1908. 
   Nearly 400 of the key government officials implicated in the atrocities committed against the Armenians were arrested. They were deported to Malta, where they were held while searches were made of archives in Istanbul, London, Paris, and Washington to investigate their actions. The charges included the unconstitutional seizure of power, wartime profiteering, and the massacre of Armenians. 
   At least six regional courts convened in provincial cities where massacres had occurred. The first recorded trial took place in Yozgat, charging three officials, including the governor, of mass murder of the Armenians of Ankara. 
   Testimony revealed Major Tevfik Bey, commander of the Yozgat military police, had almost completely wiped out the Armenian population of Yozgat. It confirmed that the deportation of the Armenians was ``a policy of extermination,'' and that the people were marched off with ``arms and hands tied up'' and later killed with ``axes, spades, swords, knives and hatchets.'' Meanwhile, Governor Kemal told the captain that he had ``made a vow on the honor of the prophet: I shall not leave a single Armenian alive in the sanjak of Yozgat.'' 
   The most famous trial took place in Istanbul in April 1919. There, 12 defendants, all members of the Committee on Union and Progress leadership and former ministers, were tried. Seven key figures, including Talat Pasha, Minister of Interior; Enver Pasha, Minister of War; and Cemal Pasha, Governor of Aleppo, had fled and they were tried in absentia. One authenticated secret telegram from July 17, 1915, quoted orders from Pasha that quoted: ``The salvation of the country requires the elimination of the Armenians.'' 
   Even more evidence against these top officials was delivered in the key indictment which included 42 incriminating documents that had been gathered by the Mazhar Commission. These documents, such as telegrams, memos, statements, and depositions all confirmed that the campaign to exterminate the Armenians was premeditated and deliberate. 
   Some of the accused were found guilty of the charges. There were three hangings and numerous convictions. Most significantly, the ruling triumvirate of Young Turks consisting of Mehmed Talaat, Ismail Enver, and Ahmed Djemal, were condemned to death. They, however, eluded justice by fleeing abroad. Many more of the convicted did not serve out their prison sentences, and a majority of the perpetrators escaped punishment after a prisoner exchange deal. To this day, there is still no justice for the victims of the Armenian genocide. 
   Madam Speaker, I wish to express my support for swift passage of House Resolution 106, which reaffirms the Armenian genocide. It now has 224 cosponsors, a majority of the House. As the first genocide of the 20th century, it is morally imperative that we remember this atrocity and collectively demand reaffirmation of this crime against humanity. 
   We must stand up and recognize the tragic events that began in 1915 for what they were, the systematic elimination of the people. By recognizing these actions as genocide, we can renew our commitment to prevent such atrocities from ever occurring again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, today the House must act decisively and in a bipartisan fashion to begin the process of rescuing an economy that has been spiraling downward for some time. Without action, we are warned the credit markets will freeze up, preventing families from getting car and home loans, students from qualifying for college loans, and small businesses from being able to pay their employees or purchase new products. 
   Over the last couple of days, we have heard that traffic in automobile dealerships is down 50 percent in the last month because people can't get the credit to purchase a new car. We have heard about college students not being able to pay for their classes or their books because they can't get the loan to attend school. 
   If we don't act today, credit markets will freeze and Main Street will suffer. Families living from paycheck to paycheck will see their credit card limits slashed and interest rates increased. This is something we simply can't allow to happen. I hope that we can come together in strong bipartisan fashion to pass this economic rescue package today.

Here are just a few of the editorial examples in papers from around the Nation. 
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that, ``The President's assertion that our country is in more danger of an attack is patently ridiculous.'' The Miami Herald writes that, ``Once again, the administration has claimed that if it doesn't get its way, the terrorists win. Unfortunately, the administration is resorting to exaggeration and hyperbole to make its case.'' The Syracuse Post Standard concluded that ``Congress should take the time to get this legislation right.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Congressional Democrats are serious about passing a strong FISA law that gives our intelligence community the legal tools necessary to protect our national security, and that is why bicameral negotiations continue. But, unfortunately, Republicans refuse a seat at that table.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to support the passage of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, a comprehensive bill which will establish full mental health and addiction care parity. My colleagues, Representative PATRICK KENNEDY and Representative JIM RAMSTAD, have worked exhaustively to complete the mission that Congress embarked upon more than 10 years ago through the passage of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. That 1996 act authorized for 5 years partial parity by mandating that the annual and lifetime dollar limit for mental health treatment under group health plans offering mental health coverage be no less than that for physical illnesses. 
   H.R. 1424, introduced by Representatives KENNEDY and RAMSTAD, will fully ensure equity in coverage for mental illness and substance abuse disorders by requiring that group health plans with mental health coverage offer that coverage without the imposition of discriminatory financial requirements or discriminatory treatment limitations. The bill also protects against discrimination by diagnosis and requires plans to cover all mental health and substance abuse disorders. 
   Mental illnesses are biologically based disorders, and there is no reason we should affirmatively provide protections to a student with depression or a young adult with schizophrenia, but not a child with autism or an elderly person with dementia. The bill also requires equality in out-of-network coverage. Again, a plan need not offer out-of-network coverage, but if it does for medical conditions, it should for mental illnesses as well. There are many good actors that already offer equity in care. However, some try and create a phantom network of providers, where doctors in the network have long waiting lists or are not appropriate to treat certain illnesses. 
   Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the United States for individuals between the ages of 15 and 44. But many health disorders are very treatable illnesses. H.R. 1424 would allow those individuals and families struggling to cope with the diverse array of illnesses which fall under the category of mental illness to have greater access to affordable care in order to alleviate the tremendous burden that these conditions can cause. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 1424 will help to allow individuals that have been disabled by mental health and addiction disorders to acquire the treatment that they need in order to once again become productive members of society. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the passage of this important legislation which will ensure the equitable treatment of very serious diseases. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to also thank the two sponsors of this legislation, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad. If any of you had been in Trenton, New Jersey, the day when Mr. Kennedy held a hearing, to see the compassion that he brought to the hearing, to hear him tell his personal story, to see those who are advocates for the bill in my State to show up and basically explain why the type of discrimination that exists now with regard to mental health coverage should not continue. 
   I think Mr. Kennedy said on the floor today that this is a civil rights issue, and that is true. People may doubt that a lot of discrimination continues to exist about mental illness, and certainly we have come a long way, there is no question about that, but the fact of the matter is that the discrimination continues. And although we have made some progress in terms of the Federal law, and even different States have passed legislation that is somewhat similar to this, the bottom line is  that we don't have absolute equality or equity at this point, and we need to make sure that if there is going to be mental health coverage, it covers all types of mental health illnesses as well as substance addiction. In addition to that, we want to make sure that the same is true, whether you are in or out of the health care network. 
   These two gentlemen, my colleagues Mr. Ramstad and Mr. Kennedy, have been working on this bill for such a long time, and it really is a tribute to them and to Paul Wellstone that we are about to pass this bill. We commit, myself and the other chairmen of our respective committees, that we will not only pass this, but we will make sure that we do a bill that we can conference between the two Houses and get it to the President and hopefully get him to sign it before the end of this session.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. She makes the point that this physician self-referral provision in the bill actually serves two purposes. On the one hand, it is about half of the pay-for for the cost of the legislation. The physicians self-referral basically generates about $2.4 billion over 10 years, which is about half of the pay-for in this bill.     
   But beyond that, in addressing the gentleman from Washington's concerns, it is actually a good thing. It is a good government proposal. And what it does, it ends the ability of physicians to self-refer to a hospital in which they have ownership. This change is consistent with the original intent of the physicians self-referral laws. The loophole for whole hospital ownership was only there because of tiny rural hospitals that were then owned by one doctor who practiced there. 
   Now that structure is no longer commonplace and that is why the hospital associations all endorse our bill. The bill does provide a grandfather for hospitals that currently have physician ownership and had a provider agreement with Medicare as of July 2007, the date of introduction of the bill. Within 18 months of enactment, they need to meet a standard that no physician owned more than 2 percent of the facility individually and that aggregate physician ownership was 40 percent or less. 
   So it is possible for the hospital in the State of Washington to reconfigure and meet this provision. But I just want to understand why we are doing this. These physician-owned hospitals essentially are a problem because they are being overutilized. There is overutilization. In other words, physicians are referring patients to these hospitals in many cases for unnecessary procedures. The reason why CBO scores this and uses it as a pay-for is because we know that these unnecessary procedures or overutilization takes place and is not basically a good thing. So we are trying to end this practice of self-referral. We are not completely precluding a hospital from reconfiguring itself and staying open, but, generally speaking, we need to end the practice.

   Mr. PALLONE. I've been trying to explain that the reason that the money is saved pursuant to this provision is because physician self-referrals inherently are not a good thing. We are trying to discourage it as much as possible and not having it be the case in the future. Now there are some hospitals that, as you said, historically had this configuration. But we don't want to encourage it. We want to discourage it. That's why we're saying that we'll have a standard with the 40 percent and the 2 percent and we'll even allow some of them to grow if they meet certain standards. But we're not looking to have this continue because it inherently is not a good thing.

   I'm wondering if they'll show similar outrage over statements made yesterday by conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Yesterday, Limbaugh called servicemembers who support a withdrawal from Iraq ``phony soldiers.'' 
   Is Limbaugh serious? Is a soldier who is honorably serving our Nation in Iraq any less a soldier if he questions what appears to be a never-ending war? 
   Last month, seven soldiers from the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division wrote an op-ed in the New York Times questioning our continued war efforts, but also stating: ``We need not talk about our morale. As committed soldiers we will see this mission through.'' 
   Now, since publication of that op-ed, two of the soldiers have died. As this op-ed shows, soldiers may question the war, but that does not mean that they're any less committed to their mission. 
   And now I wonder if Republicans who showed so much outrage towards MoveOn yesterday will hold Rush Limbaugh to the same standard. And I wouldn't hold your breath.

   Despite all that prep time, the Attorney General could still not remember why most of the prosecutors had been fired by him in the first place. Worse yet, Gonzales said he could not recall attending a meeting where the discussion of the fate of these prosecutors was debated. 
   Democratic and Republican senators alike grew increasingly frustrated throughout the day as the Attorney General answered ``I do not recall'' to more than 70 questions. It was so bad that conservative Republican Senator  Jeff Sessions said that he was concerned about Gonzales' recollection, considering that these events only took place last December. 
   Either the Attorney General is deceiving the Senate about what he remembers or he is so lacking that he can sit through discussions about the potential firing of eight U.S. Attorneys and simply not remember being there. Neither bodes well for Gonzales. It's time the President sets aside his friendship and asks his Attorney General to step aside.

   This Democratic House is concerned that too many children are growing up without health insurance, making it impossible for them to receive the regular checkups that they need to live long and healthy lives. The CHAMP Act would strengthen the CHIP program, a popular Federal-State health care partnership so we can reach nearly all of the children who are currently eligible for the program. 
   The price tag is an additional $50 billion over 5 years. Again, the President says it is simply too much money. Yet, he has no problem asking this Congress to rubber-stamp a new Iraq war emergency funding bill that press reports say could be as high as $50 billion and that would only last about 5 months.

   But instead what we saw was a concerted effort by the Republican minority to delay every one of these appropriations bills: the Homeland Security bill that deals with our local responders, in response to 9/11, and in the case of the Military Construction and Veterans bill, they constantly delayed our efforts to move a bill that was going to increase funding and benefits for our veterans. 
   It really is awful to see what they've been doing all week in trying to delay and delay. If you go back to when the Republicans were in the majority, they weren't even able to pass the appropriations bills. They weren't even able to get their work done because they constantly delayed until they actually lost the election and never finished the bills. 
   At the same time, they keep talking about spending. Well, every year when they were in the majority the amount of Federal spending continued to go up. The Democrats finally have gotten spending under control and at the same time trying to address the fact that we have this huge Federal debt, a legacy of the Republican majority over the last 12 years.

   Mr. PALLONE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I thank my good friend from California (Mr. Thompson) for sponsoring it. This legislation is necessary to ensure that our Nation's doctors, who are brave enough to serve their country in a time of war, have a medical practice to serve in when they come home. 
   Currently, Medicare allows for a physician who is ordered to active duty as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces to enter into a 60-day billing arrangement with another physician. These arrangements allow for physicians to maintain their practices while they go off to take care of our soldiers in combat. 
   Unfortunately, what we are finding is that they are often away longer than 60 days, which puts them at odds with the current Medicare antifraud rules. This legislation fixes that problem by lifting the 60-day limit currently in place, and allowing a physician who is called to active duty to find a substitute physician to watch over his patients for as long as he or she is deployed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to discuss a contract recently awarded by the U.S. Government to Lockheed Martin for 18 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods, or ATPs, to be sold to the Government of Pakistan. Sniper ATPs allow aircrews to perform intelligence, targeting, surveillance and reconnaissance missions from extended standoff ranges. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe it is irresponsible for the U.S. Government to sell high-grade weapons technology to Pakistan, a nation that has turned a blind eye to the increasingly dangerous Taliban insurgency in the western region of its country. 
   Numerous press accounts in recent months have discussed the growing presence of Taliban training camps and bases in the tribal regions of western Pakistan that border Afghanistan. Just last week, in the port city of Karachi, over 40 people were killed, with even more injured during 2 days of gun battles and mayhem in response to an antigovernment rally. Most reports claim that this violence against protesters was perpetrated by the Muttahida Quami Movement, or MQM, which is an ethnically based Mafia allied with Pakistani President Musharraf. 
   In a country that claims to be somewhat democratic, the actions of the MQM and President Musharraf seem to be just the opposite. Coupled with the Pakistani President's refusal to put forth a good-faith effort to root out Taliban insurgents in his country, it hardly seems like a good idea for the United States to be selling arms to the Government of Pakistan. 
   Earlier this year, Democrats passed H.R. 1, which implemented the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Included in this bill was language that would end U.S. military assistance and arms sales licensing to Pakistan in the 2008 fiscal year unless Pakistani President Musharraf certifies that the Islamabad government is ``making all possible efforts to end Taliban activities on Pakistani soil.'' 
   I believe that the U.S. should live up to this commitment by ceasing the sale of arms to the Government of Pakistan. I fear that if we do, in fact, provide these weapons technologies to countries in unstable regions, such as Pakistan, they could be used against U.S. allies, such as India. 
   This U.S. policy of military sales to Pakistan will contribute to increasing security concerns throughout South Asia. The U.S. has no way of knowing if these technologies will be used against al Qaeda and the Taliban, and not against India or other peaceful nations. In fact, the government has simply watched while terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, or LET, committed terrorist acts in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India. The actions within its own country prove themselves not fit for, in this case Pakistan, for receiving these weapons. 
   Mr. Speaker, although Pakistan has claimed to be an ally in the global war on terror, it clearly has not taken the necessary steps to end terrorism in its own backyard. I strongly believe that economic assistance is necessary to support economic restructuring that will stop Pakistan from becoming a breeding ground for terrorists. 
   At the time after 9/11, when we decided that we would allow economic assistance to Pakistan and development assistance, I was all for it because I think it makes sense; that's the way to lead to a democratic and stable Pakistan. But military assistance is another matter. Allowing this sale sends the wrong message, I think, particularly in the climate that we live in here today, and what Pakistan has been doing in not living up to its part of the deal in fighting the Taliban.

   Are my Republican colleagues serious? Do they actually believe, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that this Attorney General can continue to serve as the Nation's leading law enforcement officer? 
   Let's not forget that Gonzales still does not remember why he fired eight U.S. attorneys last year. Nor should we forget that Gonzales tried to pressure then-Attorney General Ashcroft into signing off on the secret telephone surveillance program while Ashcroft sat in a hospital bed preparing for surgery. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats are restoring real accountability to Washington, but it would be nice if we could get a little help from our Republican friends.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, last November Democrats listened to the American people. But, unfortunately, President Bush continues to ignore them. Democrats promised to take our Nation in a new direction, and in many ways we have. We increased the minimum wage for the first time in a decade. We made Americans safer by fully implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We also restored PAYGO rules so that Congress lives within its means. 
   We are proud of our accomplishments, but an intransigent President is blocking our efforts to do more. Lifesaving cures to debilitating diseases remain out of reach because President Bush vetoed stem cell research legislation. Our soldiers continue to referee a civil war in Iraq because President Bush vetoed a bill that would have brought our troops home next year. And millions of children cannot see the doctor of their choice because President Bush vetoed bipartisan legislation that would provide health insurance to 4 million more kids. 
   Madam Speaker, while it is frustrating to deal with a President who continues to ignore the results of last year's elections, congressional Democrats will continue to move America in a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding that this Congress take action to responsibly end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home safely. If the results of last November's election were not clear enough, a poll released last week indicates that a majority of Americans look to Congress and not the President to extricate ourselves from this dangerous mess. Day after day we hear about Republicans ``questioning'' the President's stay-the-course strategy. 
   But mere words that grab headlines will not guarantee the responsible disengagement of our troops. Congressional action can and will. 
   Earlier this month, the House passed the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act, a plan that would bring our troops home by April of next year. Sadly, the measure received just four Republican votes. Rather than join our efforts, most Republicans continue to block meaningful attempts to end this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to raise questions, but actions speak louder than words. This week Republicans get another chance. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to listen to the American people; take action now and bring our troops home.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, President Bush and congressional Republicans are playing politics with our national security. 
   After slowing down the process of withholding key documents in the Senate, President Bush and congressional Republicans are demanding the House take immediate action on a Senate FISA bill that just passed the Senate yesterday. 
   The Protect America Act is a law that was pushed by the President, and yet today he says that he will oppose any attempts by Congress to extend that law for 3 additional weeks. 
   The House has passed its own bill, the RESTORE Act, that will modernize FISA by giving the intelligence community the tools it needs to track terrorists while protecting the constitutional rights of innocent Americans. 
   If Congress does not extend the Protect America Act, the intelligence community will still have all the tools it needs to continue current surveillance and begin new surveillance on any terrorist threat.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (TALIBAN RESURGENCE IN AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to once again discuss the mounting problems and increasing violence by Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan. My concern is that the President continues to escalate the wrong war in Iraq while the war in Afghanistan is forgotten. I fear, as do many others, if the United States and NATO do not prioritize Afghanistan, the Taliban will reach a level of strength it has not had since prior to the inception of the United States mission in Afghanistan. This could lead to an impending offensive by the Taliban in Afghanistan which would drastically undermine the United States mission in this war-torn nation. 
   Over the weekend, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and other Members of the House leadership visited Afghanistan and Pakistan on a fact-finding mission in order to witness first hand the escalating problems facing those countries. 
   I was glad to see that the Speaker coupled her trip to Iraq with a visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Speaker Pelosi's trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan comes as President Bush announces his plan to ask Congress for $10.6 billion in aid for Afghanistan.     
   $8.6 billion of this aid money will go towards training and equipping Afghan security forces, as well as increasing the size of Afghanistan's national army. The remaining $2 billion will be provided for investment in Afghani infrastructure. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President has stated that he will make a formal request for these funds next month, and I am pleased to see that he is finally realizing that the threat of the Taliban and al Qaeda remains in Afghanistan and that we need to do more. 
   The ongoing war on terror should focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, not on Iraq. The United States must be committed to fighting terrorism in those areas in order to protect our country because that is where the war on terrorism and the attacks on our country began. 
   Earlier this month, Democrats took a significant step toward this goal by passing H.R. 1 which implemented the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Included in this bill was language that would end U.S. military assistance and arms sales licensing to Pakistan in the 2008 fiscal year unless Pakistani President Musharraf certifies that the Islamabad government is making all possible efforts to end Taliban activities on Pakistani soil. 
   It seems that President Musharraf is paying the United States lip service by claiming to be supportive of the global war on terror, yet failing to take action against Taliban fighters that have set up training camps in the western region of his country. It is my hope that, coupled with international pressure, the language in H.R. 1 will convince President Musharraf to take immediate action against the Taliban militants in his country. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the Taliban continues to gain strength in Afghanistan and western Pakistan, it has also been leading an effort to win support of the people of Afghanistan by opening its own schools or madrasas in southern Afghanistan. The intentions of the Taliban are obviously to distract from their regime of terror, not to provide educational opportunities for the children of Afghanistan. Last year alone, the Taliban destroyed 200 schools and killed 20 teachers. It is more likely that the Taliban will use these madrasas not only to trick the people of Afghanistan into believing that they are advocating the expansion of education but also to recruit new Taliban fighters. 
   This is all part of the al Qaeda's growing propaganda operation. As Sahab, the TV production arm of al Qaeda, last year produced 58 videos, more than tripling its number from 2005, it is clear that the Taliban and al Qaeda are regrouping and working hard to win over the people of Afghanistan.  
   Mr. Speaker, it is very important for the United States to continue to funnel resources into Afghanistan. We must also ensure that none of our troops in Afghanistan are redeployed to bolster the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq. We cannot let ourselves forget where the real war on terror started and continues to this day.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1157, the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act, legislation introduced by Representatives NITA LOWEY and SUE MYRICK. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer in women. Each  year in America, approximately 182,000 women are diagnosed of breast cancer, of which nearly 41,000 lose their lives. 
   While improved access to screening and treatment services have helped reduced breast cancer death rates over the past couple of decades, significant challenges still remain. For example, we are still unsure about what causes breast cancer or how to prevent it. While there have been a number of studies that have looked at various risk factors, we have not been able to draw any solid conclusions about what specifically causes breast cancer or what are the linkages between breast cancer and environmental factors. 
   This legislation would help address, help facilitate and help coordinate research efforts on the links between breast cancer and environmental factors in the hopes that one day we might find a cure. 
   Let me acknowledge the work of my colleagues, Mrs. Lowey and Mrs. Myrick, who have been tireless advocates on behalf of this legislation. They have been working nonstop over the past several months to develop the compromise legislation before us today. 
   I would also like to commend the chairman of our committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, as well as his staff, for their hard work on this legislation.

   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1382, the ALS Registry Act. ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 5,600 Americans each year. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have ALS at any given time, with an average life expectancy of 2 to 5 years from time of diagnosis. 
   Today, no single national patient registry collects and stores information on the prevalence and incidence of ALS. 
   The ALS Registry Act would create a nationwide registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for ALS and other related motor neuron disorders. The patient registry would collect data which is urgently needed for ALS research, disease management, and the development of standards of care. This will allow us to make real progress in better understanding ALS, and to develop measures for prevention, treatment, and eventually a cure for this dreaded disease. 
   I would like to thank my dear friend and colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee Representative Eliot Engel for his dedication to bringing this bill before us today. Eliot and I, along with Nita Lowey, started the same time in Congress, which is about 20 years now. I remember when we had the hearing on this. Mr. Engel is from New York and talked a little about Lou Gehrig. I had actually been to a Yankees' game just a few days before, and I saw so many people wearing Lou Gehrig shirts, and I was amazed after so many years that that would still be the case. 
   On October 16 of last year, we overwhelmingly passed the House companion to S. 1382, and I strongly urge us to pass this bill by the same margin. Please join me in enacting this important legislation.

   Pulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder in which the blood pressure in the pulmonary artery rises far above normal levels, usually with no apparent reason. Symptoms include chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pains, palpitations, and fainting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2002 there were 15,668 deaths and 260,000 hospital visits among persons with pulmonary hypertension. 
   The number of hospitalizations related to pulmonary hypertension has been increasing in recent years, especially among women. This measure would help improve current research efforts on pulmonary hypertension, as well as increased public awareness. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Brady and Mrs. Capps for their work on this legislation. 
   I also want to recognize my colleague, Mr. Lantos, who passed away earlier this year. Passage of today's bill is a fitting tribute to Representative Lantos and his work in raising awareness about pulmonary hypertension and thousands of patients who suffer from it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida, and I certainly associate myself with her remarks with regard to this very important stimulus bill. 
   I want to rise in strong support of the rule allowing for H.R. 7110 to be considered, but I would particularly like to focus on the FMAP, or the Medicaid provisions of the bill, which would provide important financial assistance to cash-strapped States in order to maintain their Medicaid programs. 
   Medicaid provides over 61 million Americans with access to medical care and specialized support and services. It protects our most vulnerable populations, our poor and disabled. 
   Unfortunately, as State economies face growing fiscal pressures, the Medicaid programs in many States are threatened and millions of American citizens are in danger of losing access to the health care coverage that they desperately need. These cuts affect not only those already on Medicaid, but also those who will come to need it as the economy continues to plummet. As people lose their jobs, they also lose access to employer-sponsored health care coverage, forcing more people to turn to Medicaid for their health care needs. 
   A study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that increasing the national unemployment rate by 1 percentage point increases Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment by 1 million. At a time when States are already struggling to balance their budgets, this type of change in unemployment rates would increase State spending by approximately $1.4 billion. 
   H.R. 7110 will provide a temporary FMAP increase to help avert cuts to State Medicaid programs. In effect, we are increasing the Federal share. This is a proven strategy for stimulating the economy. A similar provision was passed in 2003 by the Republican Congress and signed into law by President Bush as part of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. So I essentially consider this a bipartisan effort. Studies have shown that the temporary increase then provided the funding needed to successfully avert or limit cuts to State Medicaid programs and helped stimulate the economies of the States back in 2003. 
   Mr. Speaker, the FMAP provision included in H.R. 7110 is an important measure that will help provide much-needed fiscal relief to our States and help protect access to health care services for some of our most vulnerable citizens. And it is an economic stimulus. It basically means that more money would be available to the States to cover more people, and that means more jobs. It means the actual delivery of health care services serves as a major stimulator of the economy. 
   I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support the rule, as well as the underlying bill.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I beg to disagree with my colleague from Massachusetts for several reasons. First of all, this is not about Iran. India's entire history with regard to nuclear weapons has been defensive, completely defensive, not offensive in the way Iran speaks and its President speaks. 
   In addition, India is very much like the United States. We know it's a democracy. We know there has always been very strict civilian control of its nuclear weapons. This is really not about nuclear weapons at all. It's about a civilian nuclear agreement between the United States and India. 
   And we know very much that India is similar to the United States; it seeks energy independence, it does not want to be dependent upon Mid East oil and the Mid East countries in the same way that we are. 
   By putting this agreement together, by passing this agreement tomorrow, basically we will be making India part of our partnership and saying that we will share civilian nuclear purposes. We will strengthen not only our own independence from Mid East oil, we will also strengthen India's. 
   And the bottom line is that there is only a history of cooperation between the United States and India. India has a strong record--and I heard some of my colleagues say to the contrary, it simply is not true--India has a strong record of trying to create a situation of nuclear nonproliferation. It has been a leader, in fact, on that. And this agreement is simply going to strengthen that even more. 
   I think that we can trust India in the way that we can trust our own leaders. And the fact that we are going to work and have this agreement passed tomorrow--and I know that it will pass and it will pass on a bipartisan basis--will simply strengthen the alliance between our two countries, which is so important to both countries' future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, tonight I join some of my colleagues on the House floor to remember a horrific act taken by Turkey against the citizens of Cyprus 30 years ago. On July 20, 1974, the nation of Turkey violated international law when it brutally invaded the sovereign Republic of Cyprus. Following the Turkish invasion, 200,000 people were forcibly displaced from their homes, and a large number of Cypriots, who were captured during the invasion, are still missing today. 
   Until 3 years ago, both Democratic and Republican administrations here in the U.S. consistently condemned the Turkish government for its illegal occupation and pressured the government to come to the negotiating table in an attempt to finally reunify Cyprus. 
   Past administrations understood that the invading nation of Turkey was to blame for the division and should therefore be punished accordingly. As a result, past administration specifically forbid trade with the illegal government of the occupied north. Our government also prohibited direct flights into the occupied north. As long as Turkey continued its intransigence and refused to leave Cyprus, U.S. administrations correctly believed they should not be rewarded. 
   While this has been consistent U.S. policy, I have grown increasingly concerned that over the past 3 years we have witnessed a blatant shift in Cypriot policy from the Bush administration, specifically from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The Bush administration is punishing Cyprus for overwhelmingly voting in a democratic election against the United Nations Annan Plan.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that 70 percent of Americans support withdrawing almost all U.S. troops from Iraq by April, and despite a growing number of retired generals and senior Republican Senators joining Democrats in calling for a new strategy in Iraq, many House Republicans remain staunchly in favor of the President's failed Iraq policy. In fact, just last week, the leader of the House Republicans referred to the Senate Republicans who have spoken out against President Bush's failed policy as ``wimps.'' And it begs the question, doesn't the minority leader believe 70 percent of Americans and numerous retired generals are wimps as well? 
   It's a much easier thing to toe the line and keep rubber-stamping the President's failed Iraq policy, as many Republicans in this body continue to do. It's a lot easier to do that than break from your party and the will of our President to take a principled stand for what you believe. Those Republicans who are against the President's policies are the true patriots. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite the name calling, Democrats will continue to push for a responsible redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq, and we hope that some of our Republican colleagues here in the House will join with us.

I mean, obviously we should be funding programs that are authorized, not those that are not. 
   But beyond that, the bottom line is that the NASPER program mandates that States participate in the program. We only have about 22 States now that are participating, so I would certainly argue that the status quo with this alternative Justice Department program simply is not working. If we want more States to get involved, we need to fund the authorized program. 
   During the time since August of 2005 when this became law and has not been funded, during this time since then prescription drug abuse has reached an all-time high, with an estimated 9 million Americans using prescription drugs for nonmedical purposes. Most disturbing is the fact that there is an epidemic of prescription drug abuse among teenagers. So if the argument is that the existing Justice Department program is working and we don't need to fund this authorized program, I think the facts show very much the opposite. 
   NASPER will ensure that prescription drugs are only being used for medical purposes. With better monitoring and tracking systems, people will not be able to seek multiple prescriptions or cross State lines to get prescriptions filled without their provider knowing. NASPER reaches across State lines, with timetables and benchmarks aimed at eliminating the problem of prescription drug abuse. It's a public health program in the Department of Health and Human Services, where it belongs, not in the Justice Department. And most important, it is the only statutorily authorized program to assist States in combating prescription drug use. 
   Right now, a lot of the program is with doctors. The Justice Department program doesn't really help doctors prevent this epidemic. Also, the Justice Department program is totally focused on enforcement, not on trying to get people more involved in the States at a preventive level dealing with the doctors. We have enforcement as well, but it's not the only thing. 
   I would simply say that we've made this pledge a couple of times. My understanding is that this amendment is going to be withdrawn. But I just need to ask the appropriators, please consider the fact that in the future we need to address this. This needs to be  affected. The other program that's in effect now is not doing the job. We simply ask that you collectively take a look at this and figure out how to do it so we can get funding for the NASPER program, which is the one that the Congress authorized and which will address this epidemic effectively. We're not having an effective response right now. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I would yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (COMMEMORATING THE RUTGERS UNIVERSITY SCARLET KNIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I came here tonight to talk about the Rutgers Women's basketball team, which I am so proud of, and I will. But I have to respond to the previous speaker. 
   I am very proud of the fact that Speaker Pelosi went to Syria. It is very important for us to have a dialogue with Syria. The fact of the matter is that the Iraq Study Group recommended that we have a dialogue with both Syria and Iran, and certainly we need a new direction with regard to the war in Iraq. And an effort to reach out and have dialogue is a good thing. 
   And there is such hypocrisy on the part of the other side of the aisle. I mean, the President and the White House criticized the Speaker. But a week before, a couple of days before, there were Republican Members of Congress that went to Syria. So this is just total hypocrisy. 
   It was a good thing that she went to Syria. It is the very type of dialogue that we need. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I came here this evening to honor the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights women's basketball team and applaud their character and integrity. These remarkable young  women are a class act, and I am proud to represent them and Rutgers University here in Congress. 
   After outrageous comments were made about the team by Don Imus on his CBS radio and MSNBC show, the team showed great courage in choosing to meet with him so he could see firsthand how wrong his sexist and racist comments were. During this emotionally and mentally exhausting ordeal, these remarkable young women were graceful and poised as they became media headlines for controversy. 
   And I strongly denounce Don Imus' divisive comments. They were disgusting, and they have no place in our everyday language, let alone on a nationally televised radio and television program. His comments not only affected these players, but resonated with women and African Americans across the Nation. 
   These were innocent student athletes living out their basketball dreams. They did not deserve to be his target. And MSNBC's decision to pull his television broadcast and CBS' firing of him displayed great moral character, and I support their choices. 
   His comments, Imus' comments, deprived these women of fully enjoying their accomplishments of being crowned Big East champions, going to the Final Four, and making history as the first athletic team from Rutgers to play for a national championship. All-Met Division I Player of the Year Kia Vaughn said it best when she said, ``Our moment was stolen from us.'' 
   I want to talk about this team, Mr. Speaker. Rutgers had a Cinderella season that saw them come back from some devastating early season losses, including a 40-point loss to Duke. Under head coach C. Vivian Stringer, the Scarlet Knights finished their amazing season with a 27-9 record. The team fought improbable odds to reach the pinnacle NCAA title game, and maintained enormous composure when nasty comments overshadowed their record-breaking season. 
   I am immensely proud of this extraordinary team. Last week the Nation had an opportunity see a group of outstanding student athletes who were striving to reach lifetime goals, both on and off the basketball court. By excelling in academics, music and community service, they are great role models for student athletes across the Nation. 
   The Scarlet Knights women basketball players are excellent representatives of Rutgers University and the State of New Jersey, and they should be honored for their hard work, dedication, and heart. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I introduced a resolution commending the Scarlet Knights women's basketball team for their record-breaking season and their outstanding achievement off the basketball court. I am hopeful Congress will recognize these fine women by passing this resolution tomorrow.

   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, last Friday President Bush traveled to my home county in New Jersey to encourage residents to seek free credit counseling if they faced the threat of losing their homes. And while the credit counseling is good advice, the President's actions were simply too little and too late. 
   For months, the President has known that the housing and subprime mortgage crisis could force more than 2 million people to lose their homes over the next 5 years. Until yesterday, the President was unwilling to address this crisis in any way. And that is nothing new. For 7 years now, the Bush administration has taken a hands-off approach to Wall Street, allowing the corporations responsible for much of this mortgage crisis to work under the radar without any government oversight or regulation. Finally, the administration recognized yesterday that the President's credit counseling advice was not going to be enough. Treasury Secretary Paulson announced a proposal that finally calls for the regulation of these financial institutes. But, again, this is too little and too late. 
   Madam Speaker, this House has already acted and will continue to pass legislation that will help homeowners today, and I would hope the President would support our efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (ARMENIAN GENOCIDE--HENRY MORGENTHAU -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the Armenian genocide that was orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1918 is an irrefutable fact. Looking at the history of this catastrophic event, it is impossible to deny that this was genocide on all accounts. 
   Now, one way to bear witness to the truth is to make reference to firsthand accounts which were made at the time that the Armenian genocide occurred. Henry Morgenthau served with dignity as U.S. ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916. In the wake of surging nationalism in Turkey and alarmed at reports of the Armenian genocide, he repeatedly appealed to the U.S. Government to intervene, without success. Morgenthau addressed the genocide of the Armenians in a 1915 dispatch to the State Department in which he warned that ``a campaign of race extermination is in progress.'' 
   He then appealed to Ottoman rulers, also without result, and finally, he published his opinions in his 1918 book of memoirs, ``Ambassador  Morgenthau's Story,'' which documented his experiences while in Turkey, including his vivid views of the Armenian genocide. 
   Morgenthau wrote, ``When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to the whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact. I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no terrible episode as this.'' 
   In one of his addresses, Morgenthau commented on the U.S. efforts during the Armenian genocide. ``If America is to condone these offenses, if she is going to permit to continue conditions that threaten and permit their repetition, she is party to the crime. These people must be freed from the agony and danger of such horrors. They must not only be saved for the present but they must be given assurance that they will be free in peace and that no harm can come to them.'' 
   At great personal risk and sacrifice, Ambassador Morgenthau chose to intervene on behalf of the Armenians and even managed to help rescue an unknown number of Armenians. Of course, in the end, his efforts were unsuccessful. Drained by his efforts to avert this disaster, Morgenthau returned to the United States in 1916 and, for the remainder of World War I, dedicated himself to raising funds for the surviving Armenians. He is considered a hero in Armenia and an American man of courage and character. 
   Mr. Speaker, if America is going to live up to the standards we have set for ourselves and continue to lead the world in affirming human rights everywhere, we need to follow Ambassador Morgenthau's example. We must stand up and recognize the tragic events that began in 1915 for what they were, the systematic elimination of a people. By recognizing these actions as genocide, we can renew our commitment to prevent such atrocities from occurring again. 
   I'm here this evening because I want to give a firsthand account that the Armenian genocide occurred. I wish to express my support for swift passage of H. Res. 106, which reaffirms the Armenian genocide. We now have a majority of the House of Representatives, both Democrats and Republicans, as cosponsors of this bill. It's time that it was brought to floor. As the first genocide of the 20th century, it is morally imperative that we remember this atrocity and collectively demand reaffirmation of this crime against humanity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I am extremely proud to say that the bill before us is a product of a bipartisan effort to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the authority and resources it needs to ensure that American consumers have timely access to safe and effective prescription drugs and medical devices. 
   This bill accomplishes a number of important goals. First and foremost, the legislation will empower the FDA to protect patients from potentially harmful prescription drugs. Over the past few years, it has become clear that consumers have been placed in harm's way due to the failing of our current drug safety system. The legislation we are passing today will lay the groundwork for restoring public confidence in the FDA by giving it the tools it needs to safeguard the public health. 
   There are many other significant measures included in the bill before us, such as the reauthorization of two important user-fee programs that will provide the FDA with the financial resources it needs to approve applications for new drugs and devices to be marketed. In addition to new funding for the pre-market review activities of FDA, this bill includes a substantial amount of new funding for post-market safety activities. 
   The bill will also reauthorize two important programs that will help encourage drug makers to conduct research into the appropriate use of prescription drugs in pediatric populations. Similarly, we are providing new incentives to device manufacturers to develop products that are specifically designed for use in children. Finally, this bill establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation, which will help build public-private partnerships designed to advance the mission of the FDA. 
   I would like to thank all the Members who devoted so many hours and days to developing this bill. Specifically, I would like to thank Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, Mr. Deal, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Markey, Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Rogers and Dr. Burgess, as well, all of them, for their hard work and devoted staff, as well, because of all the support that the staff did in their efforts in making this bill possible. 
   In closing, I would just like to reiterate that this bill has strong bipartisan support as well as support from the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and a number of consumer advocacy organizations. Few times in the past do I recall that we have  achieved such a wide-ranging consensus on a bill of this size or importance. I strongly urge my colleagues to support its passage.

   I also wish to take a moment to recognize the efforts of the staff who worked long hours in ensuring we produced a quality piece of legislation. In particular, I thank Warren Burke and Ellen Sutherland, professional staff with the Office of Legislative Counsel, for their outstanding service. 
   I also want to thank the staff of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I'm not going to mention the Republicans, not because they didn't do as much work, because they certainly did, but I don't remember all their names. I don't want to eliminate anybody. 
   As far as the Democratic staff is concerned, I do want to specifically mention John Ford, Pete Goodloe, Jack Maniko, Melissa Sidman, Jessica McNiece, Bob Clark and Virgil Miller. And from Mr. Waxman's staff, because Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey played a major role in this bill and Mr. Waxman's staff in particular, Karen Nelson, Rachel Sher and Stephen Cha.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, a week does not go by without at least one or two Republican Senators coming forward and saying what many of us have known for months, that the President's Iraq strategy has failed. First it was Senators Lugar and Voinovich. Then last week Senator Domenici joined them in saying that a serious change in course is needed. And then on Monday Senator Snowe told NBC News that the time has come for binding legislation to bring home most of our troops. 
   The Senate Republican comments are welcome, but actions speak louder than words. Senate Republicans can't just say that a change in direction is needed; they have to actually help us change the course of the war. 
   And where exactly are the House Republicans? Does their silence indicate that they will once again rubber-stamp the President's failed Iraq policy? 
   If they won't listen to us, they should at least listen to respected members of their own party who are saying that we simply cannot continue on this same failed course.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I want to thank my colleague from Florida, first of all, for being here tonight and for being here for so many nights for so many years now. I know they call them the ``30-Something,'' but it's several years now that you've been doing this on a regular basis, and drawing attention to what the Democrats are doing, and of course when we were in the minority, pointing out the contrasts between ourselves and the Republican majority. 
   I don't want to give a course in history here tonight, but I have to take issue with what my colleagues from Tennessee and Georgia just said with regard to the children's health initiative. 
   First of all, I think it's really important, and I know you say this all the time, that we're not here as ideologues. I'm not here because I'm a liberal or a conservative or because I want a government-run program or a privately run program. As far as I'm concerned, if everybody could get health care under some kind of privately run insurance program and it was all affordable and we could cover everybody, that would be fine with me. The only reason that the SCHIP or the children's health program was set up about 10 years ago, and I was there and I was part of it at the time, and it was done on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats supported it, was because we realized that there were more and more children in this country that were going without health care. 
   And we did not set up an entitlement. I heard my colleagues from Tennessee and Georgia on the Republican side repeatedly refer to this as an entitlement program. 
   It is not an entitlement program. It is a program that simply gives money in a block grant. I mean, nothing could be less of an entitlement than a block grant, to States like Georgia and Tennessee that they match to try to cover children that don't have health insurance. 
   Now, let me stress this is for parents who work who have children. We have a Medicaid program for people who are very low income. But what we found 10 years ago, and again, on a bipartisan basis, just as many Republicans as Democrats, what we found 10 years ago was there are a lot of people who work for a living, but they don't get health insurance on the job and they cannot afford to go out in the individual market privately and buy it. I mean, that could cost you $12,000-$15,000 a year if you have to go out for a family of four and buy health insurance. If you're making 20, 30, $40,000 a year, you can't afford to pay $12,000-$15,000 a year for health insurance for yourself and your children. 
   So the Federal Government decided, let's give some money to the States. They will match it, and they can help cover these children of working parents whose income is a little too high so they don't qualify for Medicaid, but they can't get health care on the job because their employer doesn't offer it, and they can't afford to go out and buy it on the individual market. 
   Now, what is wrong with that? There is nothing wrong with that. I cannot understand how anyone on the other side of the aisle, including my two Republican colleagues that just spoke, would come out and say that we don't want kids to have health insurance. I mean, what are they talking about? There is no alternative for these people other than to go to the emergency room or the hospital. They can't get it on their job. They can't afford to buy it privately on the individual market. They have no alternative. And that is simply all we offer to do. 
   And now my colleagues on the Republican side are talking about entitlements, raising socialism. I mean, this is not an ideological issue. This is just a practical way of trying to deal with a problem. 
   Now, let me tell you something. You already made reference, my colleague, to the fact that some States this year ran out of money to pay for this children's health initiative very earlier, and the State that came here crying first was the State of Georgia.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Well, I just want to follow up on what you said. You know, this money that we give to States to help cover these kids in the last few years has run out very early for a lot of States. And, again, it was the gentleman from Georgia's own State, it  was State representatives, Secretary of Health and Human Services, whatever they call that person in the State, came down here in February. And they were over in the Speaker's office, and I was asked to come. And there were Republicans and Democratic Congressmen in that room. Now, I can't say for sure that the gentleman who spoke tonight was there, but there were other Republicans. He may have been, but I don't want to say for sure because I don't remember. But there definitely were Republican Congressmen from the State of Georgia in that room over in the Speaker's office, along with Democrats. And they said, you've got to pass an emergency supplemental bill to give us more money for SCHIP because we're going to run out of our yearly allotment on March 1; two months into the year. So they said, please, do something. Well, what we did is we attached that to the emergency 
   supplemental bill. Some people know that as the Iraq supplemental, but it really covered a lot of different things. 
   And as you say, we put $750 million just to cover Georgia and other States to the end of this year. And you know how difficult it was. The President threatened to veto it three or four times. We finally got it passed. And every month I would get calls or letters from the Georgia delegation saying, when are you going to pass this money because we're going to have to tell these kids that they don't have any health insurance. 
   So I don't understand how they come down here on the Republican side and complain about this program that they helped start, that their State is asking for money. Most of the people in that room from the State of Georgia were Republican, not Democrats, okay. And we're just practically saying, okay, look, we don't want to have to run out of this money every year because obviously this program is growing because the number of uninsured kids, again, from working families, keeps getting bigger every year. It's up to something like nine million children nationally that don't have any health insurance. Okay. And what we're saying is, let's come up with a larger pot of money over the next 5 years to pay for these kids so that, there is about six million of those nine million that are eligible for the children's health SCHIP program right now, eligible under the current law. There is about 6.7 that are covered, there are another 6 million that are eligible under the current law that President Bush and the Republicans have been supporting for the last 10 years, and there just isn't enough money to cover them. 
   So all we're saying is, let's take some money, in this case over 5 years it would cost about maybe $50 billion to cover these kids that are already eligible for this SCHIP program. 
   Now, how in the world the Democratic initiative to simply pay for kids that are already eligible for this program that's already on the books becomes socialism or entitlements or some kind of radical procedure here. For the life of me, I simply do not understand. I mean, there is nothing here that's new. There is nothing new here. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. PALLONE. Exactly. And where do these kids go? They have no place to go. The only place they go is if they get sick or they need attention, they have to go to the hospital emergency room. And what kind of a way is that to operate a health care system where you have to take your kid to the hospital emergency room because they can't see a doctor on a regular basis. 
   Now, one of them said community health centers. I'm all for community health centers. I think it would be wonderful if every town in the country had a community health center and you could go there and get free care, but that's not the reality. In my district, we have maybe three or four of these community health centers. I represent about 650,000 people, and we have maybe three or four of these federally sponsored community health centers. There is no way in the world that these parents that take their kids, all who are uninsured, to these community health centers. There is absolutely no way that that's going to happen.

   When I hear my colleagues on the Republican side, instead of being practical and looking at what is going to accomplish something, to start making it ideological and talk about entitlements and socialism and the whole thing, we don't need that. We don't need that rhetoric here. We as Democrats are trying to accomplish things in a practical way, without ideology, without right or left and all this jargon that we are hearing from the other side.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, first let me say how happy I am to see our Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey, who I would mention to my colleagues was the Speaker of the General Assembly in the State of New Jersey, so he certainly knows what to do in the Speaker's chair. Great to see you up there this evening. 
   I come to the floor this evening to once again call on Dr. Ian Paisley and the Democratic Unionist Party to support peace and justice in Northern Ireland and not get in the way of creating a truly devolved government. I call on my colleagues to support the ``New Beginning'' policy envisioned in the Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent Patten Report, even as Northern Ireland tackles the controversial issue of setting up a fair and effective criminal justice system. 
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called Sinn Fein's leadership under President Gerry Adams ``remarkable,'' and I certainly agree. Despite a long history of unfair treatment and attacks by unionist paramilitaries and others, Sinn Fein is moving down the path to devolution by supporting the Police Service of Northern Ireland and working with the criminal justice system. 
   In order for the citizens of Northern Ireland to have a police force they can respect and cooperate with, they need to be assured that power sharing will be restored and officials will ensure sufficient accountability to prevent the types of abuses that have plagued the Catholic community in the north for so long. 
   Mr. Speaker, the community of Northern Ireland and all of the political parties must be involved in the process to create a New Beginning to Policing. Since the Patten Commission Report in September 1999, much progress has been made in terms of increased recruiting of Catholic officers, establishment of district policing boards, and increased oversight and accountability of the police service. The St. Andrews Agreement, issued this past year, showed that the path to restoring critical political institutions should include support for and devolution of policing. 
   Sinn Fein has taken the bold step of moving forward to support the policing institutions, and now Dr. Paisley seems to want to stay in the past instead of recognizing that it is time to move forward with a police service and a government that respects and represents all the people of Northern Ireland. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again commend Gerry Adams, the leadership of Sinn Fein, Prime Minister Blair, and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahearn, for all their hard work and courage in moving the peace process forward. It will not be easy to overcome the troubling history of discrimination and distrust between communities in Northern Ireland. I hope, however, that Dr. Paisley and the membership of the Democratic Unionist Party will put aside the politics of the past and become a partner in moving towards a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland.

   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, 2007 has been the deadliest year for American troops in Iraq. No doubt that a change of direction is needed, but President Bush refuses to change course. He envisions a world where our troops will still be on the ground in Iraq 10 years from now. 
   This Democratic Congress rejects such a plan. And this week we will once again consider legislation that will require President Bush to redeploy our troops out of Iraq while providing our troops in harm's way with the resources that they need. 
   President Bush has asked Congress for an additional $200 billion for Iraq. This House will instead vote on a $50 billion package that will require the immediate start of the redeployment of U.S. forces out of Iraq. The legislation sets a goal of having nearly every troop out of Iraq by the end of next year. That is a significant change in the course of the war, and it is a change that will finally hold Iraq accountable for its future course. 
   Madam Speaker, this Congress will continue to fight to change President Bush's 10-year, trillion-dollar war. We are committed to bringing our troops home soon, repairing the readiness of our military, and refocusing our efforts to fight terrorism around the world.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1532, the Comprehensive Tuberculosis Elimination Act--a bill to amend and reauthorize the preventative health services regarding tuberculosis. 
   Tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other infectious disease caused by a single microorganism with approximately 1.6 million people worldwide succumbing to the disease each year. While the U.S. has done well in combating the disease in the past, the global burden continues to be high, and the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis has added a new level of difficulty to the problem. 
   The bill before us recognizes these issues by creating a Federal tuberculosis task force, by modifying the structure and duties of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis and by encouraging the director of the National Institutes of Health to expand, intensify and coordinate research and development activities with respect to tuberculosis.     
   All of these efforts will steer us closer to the final goal of the elimination of tuberculosis. 
   I want to acknowledge my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Gene Green of Texas, for his leadership on this issue. This bill was negotiated in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion. I am proud to support it. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (NATIONAL PAIN CARE POLICY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2994, the National Pain Care Policy Act of 2007, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to pain care. All of us have probably experienced pain resulting from an illness or disease in our lives. Some people are fortunate enough to be able to access drugs and other treatments to relieve pain and suffering. 
   However, millions are not able to obtain that relief and suffer from acute pain. The National Center for Health Statistics estimates that one in every four Americans has suffered from pain that lasts longer than 24 hours. Pain can impact every aspect of our daily lives, from an inability to work, to being unable to spend time with family and friends. 
   This bill would do much to help us better manage pain. H.R. 2994 would encourage the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine to convene a conference on pain, encourage the Director of the National Institutes of Health to expand a research program on the causes of and potential treatment for pain, establish an interagency pain research coordinating committee within HHS, allow the HHS Secretary to award grants to public and private entities for the development of programs to provide education and training to health care professionals in pain care, and require the HHS Secretary to establish and implement a national pain care education outreach and awareness campaign. 
   Pain is the leading reason Americans come into contact with the health care system, and it's also a huge contributor to the growing costs of health care. We must do a better job of helping to alleviate that suffering, and I believe this bill would go a long way towards achieving that end. 
   I want to thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, particularly Congresswoman Capps and Congressman Rogers, for their leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for adoption of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in support of H.R. 2583, the Physician Workforce Enhancement Act of 2008. This legislation seeks to address shortages in the physician workforce by creating a loan program for rural and  urban hospitals to start residency training programs. 
   Demand for primary care has grown due to an increase in the number of people living with chronic diseases and due to the long-term care needs of an aging population. However, recent trends show that the growth in the physician workforce is not keeping pace with the growth of the general population. In fact, there has been a decline in the number of medical students and training opportunities for primary care in certain areas of practice, including pediatrics, which are expected to have more critical shortages in the future. 
   H.R. 2583 seeks to address the physician shortage by establishing a loan program for eligible hospitals to establish residency training programs in allopathic and osteopathic medicine with a preference for hospitals located in rural areas. 
   Residency training programs are an integral way for rural and small urban communities to attract physicians as it encourage doctors to put down roots in the community where they completed their residency. 
   One important source of funding for residency training programs is Medicare. However, the Medicare program caps the number of residents and fellows eligible for Medicare reimbursement.     
   This can narrow the number of resources available to some smaller hospitals that have the greater need for residents that will later serve the community as physicians. That cap was implemented at the time when it appeared that the physician workforce would enjoy surpluses for some time, and that the use of managed care services would reduce the demand of medical services. But both trends have significantly reversed in recent years, precipitating the need for a new strategy to improve the health and vitality of the U.S. physician workforce. 
   H.R. 2583 provides such a strategy. This legislation will make great strides in attracting new physicians to serve in rural and small urban districts that need them most. 
   I want to urge my colleagues to support the passage of this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in support of H.R. 6901, the Meth Free Families and Communities Act. Despite recent Federal efforts to curb abuse, meth addiction remains a national epidemic. In 2006, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 1.9 million Americans age 12 and older had abused meth at least once in the year prior to being surveyed. Recent trends suggest that meth use is up among women, including pregnant women and women of child-bearing age. 
   H.R. 6901 would amend the Public Health Service Act to improve prevention and treatment programs for meth addiction. The bill expands grants available for student-driven meth awareness programs, and prioritizes grants that are intended to reach areas lacking in mental health professionals and substance abuse treatment options. 
   This legislation seeks to improve treatment for meth addiction to pregnant and parenting women, and aims to help professionals recognize vulnerable populations for the purpose of preventing and treating addiction. 
   H.R. 6901 also provides information and educational materials to employers and employees about drug testing policies and programs. 
   H.R. 6901 helps our communities battle meth addiction by providing targeted education and treatment programs to the areas and people that need it most. It is the result of the very hard work of Representatives Hooley and Cubin. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the bill. 
   I want to particularly thank Representative Hooley for her work on this legislation. As many of you know, she will not be with us after this session and I very much regret that because of all she has contributed as a congresswoman over the years. But passage of this bill is important to her legacy and important for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6353, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008. This legislation addresses serious concerns about the purchase of controlled substances through online pharmacies. 
   According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, nearly seven million Americans are abusing prescription drugs, more than the number who are abusing cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy and inhalants combined. 
   Prescription pain relievers are new drug users' drug of choice. Nearly one in 10 high school seniors admits to abusing powerful prescription pain relievers. And prescription pain relievers appear to be among the drugs most heavily dispensed by certain Internet pharmacies using prescriptions that are issued based on online questionnaires. Most times, the doctor providing the prescription has never seen the patient or even had a conversation with them. This practice has sometimes been abused by rogue sites and it has led to instances of addiction, overdose and death. 
   H.R. 6353 will go a long way in combating this harmful practice. The bill prohibits the delivery, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances over the Internet without a valid prescription. A valid prescription is defined as a prescription that is issued for a legitimate purpose by a practitioner who has conducted at least one in-person medical evaluation of the patient. 
   H.R. 6353 also imposes new registration and reporting requirements for online pharmacies. The legislation before us also increases criminal penalties involving controlled substances in Schedules II, IV and V of the Controlled Substances Act. 
   H.R. 6353 is named after Ryan Haight, a young man who unfortunately was the victim of illegal sales of pharmaceuticals through the Internet. Ryan died on February 12, 2001 at the age of 18 from an overdose of prescription drugs he had purchased on the Internet. Ryan was prescribed the drugs by a doctor whom he never saw and was never examined by, and an Internet pharmacy delivered them to his home. 
   H.R. 6353 is the result of the leadership of Representative BART STUPAK  and the hard work and cooperation of the Democratic and Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee. 
   The bill is a bipartisan product. It enjoys the support of the administration and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. 
   I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote to prevent another needless death similar to that of Ryan Haight and vote for the passage of this bill.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in support of H. Res. 988 designating the month of March 2008 as MRSA Awareness Month. 
   MRSA is a type of infection that is resistant to treatment with regular antibiotics. While healthy individuals can acquire MRSA as well, it is most likely to occur among parts of our population least equipped to deal with its  effects such as those individuals in hospitals and health care facilities who have weakened immune systems. 
   The latest information regarding MRSA is disconcerting. Infections are on the rise as hospitalizations associated with MRSA more than tripled from 1999 to 2005. We must do more to raise awareness and stem the tide of this infection. 
   The resolution before us recognizes the need to continue research to find the best ways of preventing hospital and community-acquired MRSA. As a community, we must be careful to prevent overuse of antibiotics and to create hygienic and sanitary conditions in our hospitals and other health care facilities. 
   This resolution also lends support to advocates, health care practitioners, and others on the front line in the battle against MRSA. Through a unified effort, we can provide hope for those who are personally affected by this infection. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Matheson of Utah, for his hard work in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of its adoption.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2008, introduced by my good friend and colleague from Connecticut, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and I know she's been working long and hard on this legislation. I am very pleased that we're bringing it up this evening. 
   This legislation is very important. It would provide protections for women across America who suffer from breast cancer. 
   Under the bill, doctors, in consultation with their patients, would decide the length of time the patient should remain in the hospital after having a mastectomy and other types of related procedures, and not the insurance company. 
   This legislation does not mandate hospitalization, but instead, restores the right of patients to consult with their physicians and decide how long she should be hospitalized, based on medical appropriateness. 
   Presently, 20 States have implemented minimum stay requirements to varying degrees. As a result, some people may question why this legislation is necessary. This bill is not for the women who live in States or have insurance policies that provide these protections. It is for the women who do not. For these women, a Federal remedy is their only hope. Having access to appropriate medical care should not be dependent on the State that you live in. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the thousands of American women diagnosed with breast cancer each year, this bill would help put an end to what has come to be known as drive-through mastectomies. 
   In addition, the bill clarifies existing law on when a health insurer can or cannot issue a decision of non-renewal, discontinue or rescind a health insurance policy. The bill would also create a new consumer protection by setting up a new independent review process for consumers in the individual health insurance market in the event of a non-renewal, discontinuation or rescission of a health insurance policy. Insurers would be required to continue coverage under such policy until completion of the independent review. 
   Once again, I want to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on both of these bills, particularly Ms. DeLauro, the bill's sponsor; and I also want to thank the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, who championed this cause during the patient's bill of rights debate, which some may remember--I certainly do. I also want to thank our friends in the minority, particularly Mr. Barton and Mr. Deal, for working across party lines to strengthen this bill. This is a very important bill, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1014, the Heart Disease Education, Analysis Research, and Treatment (HEART) for Women Act. This  legislation will go a long way in improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women. 
   Heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease are the leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability. More than 850,000 people die of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. annually, representing nearly 36 percent of all U.S. deaths. 
   Although heart disease is sometimes thought of as ``man's disease,'' one in three American women die of heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases, making it the leading cause of death for both women and men in the United States. Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women aged 65 years and older and is the second and third leading cause of death among women aged 45 to 64 years, and women aged 25 to 44 years respectively. 
   H.R. 1014 proposes to reduce the cardiovascular disease death rate for women through improved health education, gender-specific analysis and research, and increased access to screening for women. H.R. 1014 authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to educate health care professionals and older women about unique aspects of care in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of women with heart disease and stroke. 
   H.R. 1014 requires clinical data that is already being reported to the Federal Government by drug and advice manufacturers to be gender-specific. Additionally, the bill before us authorizes the expansion of the CDC's Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program. This program, currently available in only 20 States, provides free cardiovascular screenings to low-income uninsured women. 
   H.R. 1014 is the result of the leadership of Representative Lois Capps and Barbara Cubin and the hard work and cooperation of the Democratic and Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill enjoys the support of a majority of the House of Representatives and numerous public health organizations, including the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association, the Society for Women's Health Research, and WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease. 
   I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote to improve the health of women by passing this bill.

   Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy, DBMD, is a combined spectrum of a genetic disorder. DBMD is usually diagnosed when the child is 3 to 6 years of age. Early signs include delays in walking and frequent falling. As the child grows older, muscle deterioration continues to progress until, finally, the disease reaches a fatal conclusion in the teen years. 
   Enacting H.R. 5265 would make a number of improvements to current programs at the NIH and CDC. It would allow the interagency coordinating committee for muscular dystrophy to give special consideration to enhancing the clinical research infrastructure required to test emerging therapies for the various forms of muscular dystrophy, require the director of the CDC to report on muscular dystrophy surveillance, tracking, and research network data collection and provide for respective health outcome data on the health and survival of people with muscular dystrophy and require the director of the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to evaluate the available scientific evidence to develop and issue an initial set of care considerations for DBMD and provide ongoing review and updates. All of the above coordinated research and tracking efforts will continue to lead us down a path towards one day finding a cure for this tragic condition. 
   I want to thank my colleague on the Commerce Committee, Congressman Engel of New York, for his leadership on this legislation. He has been working on this bill for a long time, and I appreciate his efforts to craft a strong bipartisan product.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 393, a resolution expressing support for the goals and ideals of National Sudden Cardiac Arrest Awareness Month. 
   While many of us are aware of the importance of maintaining a healthy diet in order to mitigate the risk of heart attacks, there is much less information concerning the risk of cardiac arrest. However, the dangers to the public are no less severe. It's estimated that more than 250,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac arrest. 
   Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops functioning properly, usually as a result of an irregular heart rhythm. Any type of heart disease can lead to cardiac arrest.     
   Often, though, two or more major coronary arteries are narrowed due to fatty buildups. 
   H. Con. Res. 393 recognizes October as an appropriate month to support National Sudden Cardiac Heart Awareness. This resolution would support efforts to educate the American public about cardiac arrest and raise awareness regarding prevention and warning signs. 
   It's especially important that warning signs are recognized immediately because death can occur in as little as 6 minutes after experiencing cardiac arrest. Moreover, women and African Americans need to make themselves particularly familiar with this health problem as they are at a higher risk than other populations. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Pickering, for his work in bringing this resolution to the floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H. Con. Res. 393.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6908, the Health Insurance Source of Injury Clarification Act of 2008. This bill would prohibit health insurers from restricting or denying benefits to plan participants if they are injured while engaging in legal recreational activities like riding a motorcycle, skiing, snowmobiling or horseback riding unless such restrictions were made explicitly clear by the plan to the person before he or she enrolled. 
   Mr. Speaker, this change is necessary because of a 2001 rule that was issued in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.     
   While that 1996 rule prohibits employer health plans and insurers from denying coverage to individuals who engage in legal recreational activities, the rule ironically allows the denial of health care benefits for injuries sustained while participating in such recreational activities. If I could explain that again, you can't deny coverage, but you can deny benefits, which obviously makes no sense. 
   Accordingly, the rule in its current form will allow insurance companies to treat health care benefits coverage arbitrarily and capriciously. Under the current rule, a plan could for example deny coverage for someone who has broken an arm through skiing or riding a motorcycle but would cover someone who sustained a similar injury from drinking and driving. What is worse is that a person might not even know that their health care coverage was even subject to such limitations until after they were actually injured. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this is an important consumer protection for millions of Americans who participate in recreational activities every day by providing greater transparency for plan participants. When we enacted the rule in 1996, we did not intend that people would be allowed to purchase health insurance only to find out after the fact that they had no coverage for an injury resulting from a common recreational activity. This bill simply clarifies that point. 
   I want to thank Mr. Stupak and Dr. Burgess who have worked very hard on this legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   At a time when our health care costs are rising exponentially, it's important now more than ever for us to prioritize public health spending. Spending on chronic diseases is particularly egregious as these diseases are the leading cause of preventible death and disability costing the Nation approximately $1 billion a year. If we can better manage this type of disease, we can dramatically reduce the costs of health care spending. 
   We know from our past efforts with screenings and vaccines that prevention has proven to work to reduce incidences of illness. Accordingly, any step that we can undertake to prevent the spread of illness and disease needs to be implemented.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES ORGAN TRANSPLANT AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 6469, the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Organ Transplant Authorization Act of 2008. This legislation would provide important new funding for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. 
   Nearly 100,000 people are on the U.S. organ transplant waiting list, and 19 people in the U.S. die every day because a lifesaving organ does not become available to them. 
   The Organ Procurement and Transportation Network, OPTN, performs the critical functions of maintaining the Nation's organ transplant waiting list and facilitating the matching of deceased donor organs with individuals in need of a transplant. It also develops policies and procedures for organ recovery, distribution and transportation, collects data about organ donation and transplantation and provides professional and public education about organ donation and transplantation. 
   Since its creation in 1984, authorization levels for the OPTN have stagnated at no more than $2 million annually. Today the projected cost of operating the OPTN is approximately $27 million. Over the years, both the demand for transplantation and the responsibilities of the OPTN have increased, yet funding levels have obviously not followed suit. This legislation provides a much-needed increase in the authorization of appropriations for OPTN from $2 million to $7 million annually. 
   The bill is aptly named in honor of Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones, our Democrat of Ohio who died on August 20, 2008, from a brain aneurysm. Representative Tubbs Jones was a strong and vocal advocate for organ donation during her life and donated her organs upon her passing. It is estimated that as many as 58 people will benefit from her donation. When enacted, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will provide critical funding to ensure the OPTN has resources it needs to continue to perform its valuable services to our Nation. 
   I would particularly like to thank Representative DIANA DEGETTE for all her hard work on ensuring passage of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1042, supporting the We Don't Serve Teens Campaign. 
   Underage drinking is an ongoing problem in our country, as over half of high school seniors drink alcoholic beverages, while more than a quarter of them engage in binge drinking. Binge drinking at a young age is an especially troubling activity, as those teens are more susceptible to both alcohol addiction and dependence. 
   Besides binge drinking, teens who drink are more likely to engage in other risky behavior, including smoking, having sex without birth control, and drinking and driving. This last behavior should be a particular concern to everyone as the combination of inexperience behind the wheel and alcohol often results in a deadly conclusion. 
   Currently, car crashes rank as the leading cause of death among individuals ages 15 to 20. We must all work to prevent such tragedies from occurring. 
   The resolution before us supports the goals and ideals of campaigns working to improve long-term health, encourages Americans to use resources to help combat underage drinking, and commends organizations that are already working to reduce underage drinking. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Bono Mack, for her leadership on this resolution. It's an important issue to address. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, as we begin the third week of this new Congress, it is important that the American people know what we have accomplished so far on their behalf. 
   During our first week in session, we changed the rules on how this institution works, cutting ties between lobbyists and lawmakers, and reinstituting commonsense pay-as-you-go budget rules. 
   Last week we began our 100-hour agenda, passing four pieces of legislation that will help the American people live better and healthier lives. We increased the minimum wage for the first time in 9 years. We passed legislation giving the government the ability to fund promising stem cell research. We passed a bill that allows the government to negotiate better prescription drug prices for American seniors. We passed long overdue legislation instituting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission that should make our Nation safer. And we are not finished yet. 
   This week we will make college more affordable by cutting interest rates in half on student loans and investing in biofuels by repealing unnecessary tax breaks to Big Oil. 
   Democrats are delivering on the promises we made to the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (AFGHANISTAN AND THE WAR ON TERROR -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I did not support the resolution authorizing the Iraq war, and I continue to believe it was a mistake, and that we should redeploy our armed forces out of Iraq as quickly as possible. Needless to say, I adamantly oppose the President's latest proposal to escalate the war, the so-called ``surge.'' 
   Now, part of my concern over the Iraq war is that it continues to distract U.S. policy, both foreign and domestic, from more important concerns. The threat of international terrorism is real, and it came home to us vividly after 9/11, but the focal point of our war against terrorism should be Afghanistan, not Iraq. 
   While our soldiers continue to die in Baghdad and we spend hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq, we are neglecting the situation in Afghanistan and its environs, particularly Pakistan, where bin Laden, al Qaeda and the Taliban grow stronger every day. 
   Mr. Speaker, last Saturday the New York Times did a front page story on the NATO struggle in Afghanistan, which stressed how the Taliban were coming back. The likelihood is there will be a new spring offensive by the Taliban as early as February, next month. The article went on to say that corrupt and ineffective leadership have turned people against the central government and its U.S. allies, and that U.S. reconstruction efforts are a failure. 
   Mr. Speaker, if there is any place where the United States should be stepping up its efforts, both in terms of resources and manpower, and where we would have international support, again, in terms of other countries' troops as well as other countries' resources and money, it would certainly be Afghanistan. The U.S. was directly attacked from there by bin Laden and al Qaeda operatives, and they were of course harbored by the Taliban. 
   So you might ask, Mr. Speaker, why does President Bush get on national TV last week and stress the need for a surge in Baghdad and reconstruction dollars for Iraq, and not prioritize Afghanistan instead? 
   In addition, President Bush continues to appease the military dictatorship in Pakistan, which effectively encourages and provides safe harbor in its frontier territories to the Taliban. 
   President Bush talks about democracy in Iraq, but what about democracy in Pakistan, which is much more likely to achieve democracy if the U.S. did not prop up the Musharraf dictatorship. 
   The media, Mr. Speaker, has reported many times that al Qaeda and the Taliban operate freely out of Pakistan where they maintain training camps and receive the support of Pakistan's ISI, the equivalent of the American CIA. 
   Last fall, the Pakistan government entered into an agreement with the Taliban. In return for not conducting raids into Afghanistan, they were guaranteed effective control of certain frontier regions of Pakistan. However, the incursions by the Taliban into Afghanistan continue while the Musharraf government left the Taliban alone in these areas of Pakistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that the U.S. has the opportunity for nation-building in Afghanistan that will continue to elude us in Iraq. Afghanistan's economy is increasingly dependent on drugs; in other words, the opium crop which has expanded while the normal economy falters. Afghanistan needs a major infusion of resources from the United States and its allies to prevent a Taliban resurgence. 
   I simply ask, Mr. Speaker, as we debate President Bush's surge in Baghdad over the next few weeks, think about the alternative in Afghanistan. Let's not forget where the real U.S. and global threat of terrorism both started and continues this day.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (PROVIDING NEW EFFECTIVE DATE FOR APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF LAW -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Georgia for those very kind words. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which already passed the House by voice vote last November and was well on its way to becoming law until it was held up in the other body. 
   I have reintroduced the bill with Mr. Frank of Massachusetts, who is, of course, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Sires) who is also here to speak on the bill, and also Mr. Frelinghuysen. It is a very simple  bill, designed to provide the Edison Memorial Tower Corporation additional time to raise funds to match a Federal grant. 
   The Edison Memorial Tower is a 131-foot tower built in 1937 on the exact spot where Thomas Edison's original Menlo Park laboratory was located in New Jersey. It was built to commemorate Edison's work and is connected to a museum displaying many of the inventor's creations. 
   Unfortunately, the tower has suffered more than $3 million worth of water damage. The Edison Memorial Tower Corporation, which oversees the tower, was designated as a recipient of Federal funds under the Thomas Alva Edison Commemorative Coin Act, which we passed in 1998. 
   That funding became available at the beginning of last year but required a non-Federal match. After reading a document published by the Mint, the Tower Corporation originally thought that they could use State funds to pay for the match. Unfortunately, they were informed recently by the U.S. Mint that they could only use funds raised from private sources. 
   Once they realized this, the Tower Corporation approached me for help since they were faced with the need to raise more than $300,000 by the end of 2006 to reach the statutory deadline for applying for the Federal funding. That is why I introduced the legislation to extend that deadline by 6 months, to give them adequate time to raise private funds. 
   I would point out that the board of the Tower Corporation has assured me and the Committee on Financial Services that they will be able to raise the necessary funds in 6 months and that they would not request another extension. 
   We all know that Thomas Edison's contributions to our society are too numerous to count, but by creating the modern light bulb at this location he is one of America's most recognized thinkers and inventors. The Memorial Tower helps celebrate his achievements and salutes the spirit of innovation that he fostered. We need to pass this to ensure that the Memorial Tower can be repaired and serve not only as a memorial to a great man, but also as a symbol of America's potential for technological innovation and achievement. 
   Lastly, Madam Speaker, I just would like to thank sincerely my colleagues, first of all Chairman Frank, and, of course, Ranking Member Bachus, for their willingness to move this bill, and the leadership on both sides of the aisle for putting it on the suspension calendar so early in this new Congress.     
   I want to thank, again, first of all, Eric Gordon, my staff person sitting to my left, who worked so hard on this, and also the hard work of Jamie Lizarraga on the Democratic staff of the Financial Services Committee which has been critical to moving the legislation. Joe Pinder of the Republican committee staff has also been quite helpful, and I thank him as well. 
   I thank my two colleagues, both the gentleman from Georgia and my Republican colleague, for the statements they made today. 
   This bill will go a long way towards ensuring that we can preserve an important landmark saluting a great American, and I ask my colleagues for their support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will have a chance to move the Iraq war in a new direction: one that holds the Iraqi Government accountable for meeting benchmarks that they have already promised they could make. 
   In contrast, the President's only answer is an open-ended commitment to what even his own Pentagon now admits is a civil war. Military leaders across the board have already told the President that there is no military solution to the war, and yet he continues with the status quo. 
   Lieutenant General Peter Chiarelli said in December: ``The proper political pieces must be in place in order for any of the military, economic or social initiatives to take hold and flourish.'' 
   Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno said: ``It is clear you cannot solve this problem militarily.'' 
   And just last month, Major General Paul Eaton said: ``Time and again, they have shown a tendency to focus almost exclusively on military solutions to problems without leveraging the full economic, political and diplomatic solutions to problems.'' 
   These military leaders are correct. Iraqis must step forward and make critical political reforms if they really want to begin to stem the violence. But unlike the President, Democrats will finally demand some accountability from the Iraqi Government this week.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my colleagues this evening to support House Resolution 106, a resolution that reaffirms the Armenian genocide. 
   I also wish to express my support for its swift passage in the House of Representatives. As the first genocide of the 20th century, it is morally imperative that we remember this atrocity and collectively demand reaffirmation of this crime against humanity. 
   The resolution, which I introduced with Representatives SCHIFF, RADANOVICH and KNOLLENBERG, has over 180 cosponsors. It's also the exact same resolution that passed the International Affairs Committee last Congress by an overwhelming majority. 
   I strongly believe it is important for Members to understand that this is a matter of historical fact. Many Turkish deniers have been meeting with Members of Congress and sending correspondence, discouraging this resolution. They are claiming that passage of such a resolution would be untimely and counterproductive. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 92 years this has not been reaffirmed here in this Congress. I think 92 years is far too long for a proper recognition to be made, and its reaffirmation is a matter of conscience. 
   In the meantime, the Turkish Government has threatened to close supply routes to U.S. troops in Iraq if this resolution is considered. It's appalling that a country who claims to be our ally would put the lives of soldiers at risk in the pursuit of its desperate campaign to deny the systematic slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians. 
   The highly reputable International Association of Genocide Scholars recently wrote to Members of Congress urging support for the Armenian genocide resolution, and I request permission to insert their letter in the Record.

This Democratic Congress today is passing a veterans bill prioritizing veterans by fully funding the Veterans Administration. We recognize the changing needs of our new veterans by allocating funding to address conditions like PTSD, and we supported a pay raise for military families that this President, who has no trouble sending our troops and billions of dollars into Iraq, called unnecessary. 
   Now, today, we are going to finally pass this Veterans appropriations bill. We are going to keep the promise we made to service men and women when they volunteered to serve our Nation overseas by taking care of them when they come home. This is the largest veterans increase for health care in history. This is the commitment of the Democratic prompt of the Democratic Congress, and we are going to make sure it happens today, regardless of what the President decides to do, if he vetoes it or not. 
   We will just come back again and again and again regardless of his veto. We are tired of the fact that this President gets up and says that he supports these initiatives but then vetoes them.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (EXTENDING PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to urge support for this bill which was developed jointly by the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor Committee. This bill would extend the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, the first-ever Federal parity law. 
   Over 10 years ago, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law legislation that required partial parity by mandating that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health treatment under group health plans offering mental health coverage be no less than that for physical illnesses. This legislation was authorized for 5 years, and has been extended every year with bipartisan support since its initial authorization expired. The bill before us would extend the Mental Health Parity Act for another year. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, let me also say that while the 1996 law was a good first step, we clearly have much further to go before we can achieve full mental health parity. That is why it is imperative that we pass H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, introduced by my colleagues Representative Patrick Kennedy and Representative Jim Ramstad. I want to congratulate and thank both of them. Mr. Kennedy will be speaking shortly in favor of his legislation. 
   In spite of the 1996 law and widespread recognition that mental illness and substance abuse are treatable illnesses, there still exist glaring inequities between health insurance coverage for mental health and that for other medical conditions. As we all know, these inequities can have dire consequences for friends, families and society in general. H.R. 1424 will take our Nation one step further to ensuring that every American can access the mental health, substance abuse and addiction treatment that they need to live healthy, happy and productive lives. 
   Madam Speaker, by putting mental health on par with medical and surgical benefits, we will be improving the availability and affordability of health care for those who suffer from mental health illnesses and addiction diseases. This will not only reduce the pain and anguish of many of our constituents and their families, but will benefit our Nation as a whole. So let's extend the good work that has already been done and work together to build upon the framework so that we can improve the lives of millions of Americans. 
   I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.

   I was listening to the previous speaker, my colleague on the Republican side, and I have to say all we are really saying with this bill is we should have options and that those options should be allowed to proceed. 
   I believe strongly, regardless of your ethics or your theology, that the way this bill has been crafted by the gentlewoman from Colorado there is no reason why anyone here should not support it, regardless of how they are thinking of this theologically or from an ethical point of view. 
   Each day we wait to lift the ban that President Bush has placed on advancing embryonic stem cell research is another day that we waste in discovering new cures for the chronic diseases and medical conditions that so many of our friends and families suffer from. 
   Instead of embracing the potential embryonic stem cell research holds in developing new life-saving and life-enhancing therapies, the President has chosen to cater to the fringe of his party and has continually blocked this important legislation from becoming law. 
   This misguided policy has significantly impeded scientific progress over the years and needlessly placed American lives at risk. As a result, States like my own, New Jersey, are moving forward with their own initiatives to advance embryonic stem cell research. The State legislature in New Jersey and the Governor recently signed legislation setting up stem cell research institutes in my town, in my district, New Brunswick, and in two other parts of the State. 
   But the State should not have to go it alone. We need to leverage Federal, State and private dollars in order to unlock the potential of embryonic stem cells in the quickest fashion possible and bring new life-saving therapies to the patients who need them. 
   An overwhelming majority of Americans support embryonic stem cell research and their representatives in this Congress should do so as well. The time has come to put an end to these absurd restrictions. There shouldn't be restrictions. Today, let's vote for hope for millions of Americans and pass H.R. 3.

It was a Republican Congress that continued to put this country further and further into debt.

   They couldn't pass a budget in the last Congress. They couldn't pass the appropriations bills before they lost control. They increased spending every year. Don't believe their rhetoric. 
   When Democrats took control, we vowed to do things differently. We vowed to pass a budget, and we did that earlier this year. We also vowed to pass every appropriations bill in a timely fashion, and that's what we're trying to do.

   While traveling in the Middle East, Defense Secretary Gates said yesterday, and I am quoting, ``The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is limited. The strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably have had a positive impact in terms of communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.'' 
   And that is what Democratic Members of this House have been saying for weeks. It is time to hold the Iraqi Government accountable and pressure them to meet the President's own guidelines.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Donald Payne for the introduction and for the comments that he made. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to be the sponsor of this resolution honoring the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights women's basketball team, and I applaud their character and integrity. These remarkable young women are a class act, and I am proud to represent them and Rutgers University here in Congress. 
   Rutgers had a Cinderella season that saw them come back from some devastating early season losses, including a 40-point loss to Duke University. In fact, after losing four of their first six games, the Scarlet Knights refused to give up and spent their winter break in the gym honing their skills and working to become a better team for the rest of the season. 
   Under head coach V. Vivian Stringer, the Scarlet Knights finished their extraordinary season with a 27-9 record. To cap it off, Rutgers upset top-seeded University of Connecticut for their first ever Big East championship title. They had lost to UConn twice in the regular season. 
   During the NCAA tournament, they upset top-seeded Duke University in the second round and remained poised with wins against teams playing in their home States. The team brought excitement to the tournament and captured the hearts of basketball fans throughout New Jersey and across the Nation. Through hard work and determination, this young team fought through improbable odds to reach their first ever NCAA title game. 
   A day after their loss, outrageous comments were made about the team by Don Imus on his CBS radio and MSNBC show. Afterwards, the team showed great courage in choosing to meet with him so he could see firsthand how wrong his sexist and racist comments were. During this emotionally and mentally exhausting ordeal, these remarkable young women maintained enormous composure as they became media headlines for controversy. 
   The Scarlet Knights women basketball players are excellent representatives of Rutgers University and of the State of New Jersey. By striving to reach lifetime goals, both on and off the basketball court, they are great role models for student athletes across the Nation. Even with a grueling sports schedule, the players have managed their priorities well. They have maintained academic excellence with a combined B-plus grade point average and are actively involved in the community. 
   Mr. Speaker, these women are the future leaders of tomorrow. Last week, when faced with adversity, they proved their promise when they stood in front of the entire Nation with dignity and grace. 
   I think I can speak for Rutgers students, alumni, faculty and staff along with my colleagues here and countless New Jerseyans when I say, we are immensely proud of this team. They deserve to be honored for their hard work, dedication and heart. 
   I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize these fine women by passing this resolution today.

Rather than working with us to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Republicans insist that this House simply rubber-stamp a bill that passed the Senate earlier this year. 
   House Democrats refuse to do that.

   We believe this approach produces the best results for our intelligence community, and that is why we refuse to simply rubber-stamp the Senate bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, when House Republicans allowed the President's Protect America Act to expire last month, they did so knowing that all of the authorities granted the intelligence community in that act would be in place until this summer.

   We spent 18 hours in our committee where they wouldn't let the bill come up. The substitute that they had in the committee would put so many barriers in the program that, in effect, the program would die. 
   Don't believe them. They don't want to provide the additional funds. They know that this expires on September 30, and it will if we don't do something today; that there will be a million kids that will automatically not have their health insurance. 
   We're not changing any of the eligibility today. It's they that want to change the eligibility. 
   The fact of the matter is CBO tells us, and I have it right here, that this bill would cover another 5 million children who are currently uninsured. 
   Now, my colleagues on the other side know that the States have run out of money. Georgia ran out of money in March. They came to us and begged us for more money. States ran out each month of money. We had to put money in the supplemental appropriations bill because the States ran out of money. 
   We need a lot more money to make sure that these 5 million kids are covered. They want to stop that. They're not proposing to cover any additional kids. They want to cut that. 
   There's no illegal aliens covered in this bill. There never were. There's no language in here that says that. 
   This is not an entitlement. It's a block grant set up by Newt Gingrich. Newt Gingrich was the guy who set it up as a block grant, giving the States flexibility. The States want flexibility. Some of them want to go a little higher. Well, it's George Bush, the President of the United States, that granted the waiver so they could have some adults or kids at higher incomes. 
   Who are you kidding? This is a Republican program, but you are now walking away from it. You don't want to fund it. You want to deny eligibility. You want to kill the program. That's what you're all about here today. 
   And don't let anybody kid you. Eighteen hours we had to listen while the bill was being read. Today, they want to delay. They're kidding no one saying that they want an SCHIP program. Don't believe what they say. It's simply not true. 
   You vote for this bill today to expand this program to provide more kids, not more eligibility. And if you don't, this will die and those kids are not going to have health insurance. 
   We have health insurance for our kids as Members of Congress. That's okay for our own kids but not for the rest of these poor kids.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, at a time when there are serious problems in our health care system, the Children's Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP, has a proven track record. Over the last decade, as the number of uninsured Americans has increased, the number of children living without health insurance has actually decreased, and thanks to the CHIP program, we have experienced a 60-percent drop in the number of uninsured children. 
   This week, the House plans to reauthorize the CHIP program. Congress must act on this legislation now. In the past, CHIP has received strong bipartisan support. However, in an about-face, the President and some Republicans have abandoned their support of CHIP on supposed philosophical grounds. 
   If Congress refuses to act this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 1 million children will lose their health coverage. Democrats are simply not to get that to happen. We are going to pass the CHIP reauthorization today so that 11 million children have access to the health insurance they need to live healthy lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (U.N. RWANDA GENOCIDE EXHIBIT REVISION -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday what was supposed to be an important U.N. exhibit educating the world about the Rwandan genocide was turned into a farce thanks to the actions of the Turkish Government. Three weeks ago, when the Rwanda genocide exhibit was originally set to open, the Turkish Government did what the Turkish Government often does, denied historical facts and objected to the exhibit because it objected to Armenian genocide as an example of genocide. 
   It was bad enough that this important U.N. exhibit documenting the Rwanda genocide was delayed by 3 weeks because Turkey continued to deny the past, but I was appalled when the exhibit was opened yesterday at the U.N. with one major revision. 
   Gone was the citing of the systematic killing of 1.5 millions Armenians as genocide. Instead it was referred to as a mass killing in order to appease the Turkish Government. No serious historical dispute exists about the Armenian genocide. Sadly, an intensive and well-financed effort by the Turkish Government has succeeded in preventing the United States, and now the U.N., from any formal recognition of the Armenian genocide. 
   This is the warped Turkish version of history, and it's simply not acceptable. The Turkish objection to this exhibit is the latest example of their genocide denial. It's absolutely ludicrous that an exhibit dedicated to the education and prevention of genocide would include Armenia as an example, use the definition of the term ``genocide,'' but not use the word ``genocide'' to describe the events. 
   How, exactly, are you educating the public about genocide when you refuse to call the first genocide of the 20th century by its name? The word ``genocide'' was actually created as a way to describe the barbaric crimes inflicted against the Armenians between 1915 and 1923, but now the word cannot be used in an exhibit at the U.N. This is utterly ridiculous. 
   Would you ever have an exhibit on Christianity without mentioning the birth of Christ? The same type of absurdity has been used by President Bush during his annual statement commemorating the anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Year after year the Bush administration continues to play word games by not calling evil by its proper name. 
   If I could just end by saying, I don't think that the U.N. response to genocides should be denigrated to a level acceptable to the Turkish Government. It's about time that the Bush administration started dictating a policy for Americans, not for a foreign government like Turkey. This lack of honesty is simply not acceptable.  
   Turkey should be condemned for its policy of denying the Armenian genocide. As a global community we must collectively stand for historical truth and properly recognize the worst humanitarian crimes we have seen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act passed the House and the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. I would stress ``bipartisan'' because I listened to the gentleman from Louisiana. He neglects to mention that Republicans were at the table, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and certainly a large number of Republicans who voted for this as well in the House of Representatives. The bill also has overwhelming support with the American people. 
   Yet this is a bill that the President has been threatening to veto since this summer. I don't know what happened to the President's compassion or sense of social justice. I don't think he understands the negative impact his veto will have on the millions of children who would be denied regular visits to see the doctor because he refused to sign this bill into law. 
   Now, let's review who stands for what. Under the bipartisan bill that the President vetoed this morning, 4 million previously uninsured low-income children, many of whom are in working families, I know there was a reference to welfare from the gentleman from Louisiana. I don't think he was referencing these kids or their families because these are working families. But 4 million previously uninsured low-income children who are in working families would get health coverage under this bill. A total of 10 million children would have their health coverage secured. 
   Under the bipartisan bill, the vast majority of children covered are the lowest income children who are today uninsured. According to the CBO, under the bipartisan bill, about 84 percent of the uninsured children who would benefit live in families with incomes below $40,000 a year. In addition,  1.7 million uninsured children who are eligible for Medicaid but otherwise would be uninsured would gain coverage under the agreement. Most of these would likely be children living in families with incomes below $20,000 a year. Under the bipartisan bill, States would have new tools to conduct outreach and enrollments. States could use express-lane, one-stop-shopping at places like schools, community centers and hospitals to get children covered. 
   The President, while he recently put out a regulation that would actually block schools from helping to sign low-income, uninsured children up for coverage, he put out another regulation that would force children to go an entire year, that is one whole year, without insurance coverage before their parents could sign them up for CHIP. That is 1 year of earaches, strep throat, asthma, diabetes and toothaches that would be treated in emergency rooms rather than the doctor's office. The President talked about how kids can go to the emergency room. Well, has he been to an emergency room lately? I was at one in my district last weekend. It is not a great place for a kid to visit. It is a scene of trauma. People who have overdosed on alcohol and drugs. Most emergency rooms are overwhelmed with real emergencies and have few resources to treat people who need regular family care. 
   The President makes $400,000 a year. He is guaranteed health care for life. He has a government doctor that is at his immediate call. Yet today this President has denied millions of low-income children and working families the opportunity to get even basic health care. Working Americans understand the struggle families have to make ends meet and afford health care coverage for their children. But the President and very few, because I am not talking about all Republicans, but very few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to be the only people in America who do not understand the challenges these families face or the importance of securing affordable coverage for their children. 
   It is a sad day, Madam Speaker, for America that the President vetoed this bill. But there is an opportunity over the next 2 weeks, because I want everyone to support this motion, but in about a week or two, we are going to have a vote on the floor. I would urge all those on the other side of the aisle who did not vote for this bill to use that time to reconsider and think about these kids when they go and cast their vote and vote to override this veto by the President. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I listened to my colleague from Texas, and he talks about process. The fact of the matter here, this is not a process issue. These are the kids that are not insured, are eligible, and we need to cover them. 
   The President of the United States and my colleague on the Republican side does not want to spend and provide the extra money to cover these kids that need insurance. If anything, the President's proposal and his directive would actually put more roadblocks and bureaucracy in the way with his directive that says that kids have to stay uninsured for a year, for example, before they can even get into the program. 
   Let there be no mistake about what the President and the Republicans on the House side are trying to do today. They don't want these kids to be covered. They don't want to provide the money for them to be covered. They want to put roadblocks in the way and say they have to be out of insurance for a year. 
   I remember back in the spring when some of my colleagues on the other side from Georgia came here with their representatives from the Georgia government, and they said that they didn't have enough money to cover the kids, that we needed more money for this program. I don't understand how any of you can come here today and say you are trying to help. You're not. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote for this motion.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, for a decade now the Children's Health Insurance Program has provided 6 million children access to private health insurance. Thanks to CHIP, every year over the last decade, the number of uninsured children fell. That is until the last 2 years. 
   Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the number of American children living without health insurance increased from 8 million in 2005 to 8.7 million in 2006. This is simply unacceptable. 
   I would hope President Bush saw these troubling numbers and finally realized we cannot afford to ignore them any longer. Last month, this Democratic House acted by passing the CHAMP Act, legislation that will allow us to reach an additional 5 million children who are already eligible for the CHIP program. 
   When CHIP was created back in 1997, it was supported by both Democrats and Republicans. But today, both the White House and the House Republican leadership oppose the CHAMP Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Census Bureau report should serve as a wake-up call to the President to reconsider his veto threat of the CHAMP Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, let me say it really pains me to listen to the minority leader say that no attempt has been made to resolve the differences on this legislation. I can't think of a single bill in this Congress where the Democratic leadership has been reaching out to the Republican side of the aisle on a daily basis. There have been so many meetings. I mean, there have literally been hundreds of meetings trying to reach out to the Republican side in the House to try to reconcile differences on this bill and come up with a consensus piece of legislation. The Republicans in the Senate have always been willing. They have been out there to meet. Some Republicans here in the House have been as well. But the leadership on the Republican side has not been. So I think it is very unfortunate that, as stated today, that that has not been the case. We have been reaching out constantly, and I defy anyone to say differently. 
   Madam Speaker, today for the second time this year President Bush turned his back on the health care needs of 10 million children. It was just 2 months ago when the President vetoed the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which had passed both the House and the Senate with overwhelmingly bipartisan support. 
   After that first veto we came together once again, Democrats and Republicans, and wrote a different bill that addresses many of the President's concerns, including enrolling lower income children first. Today, President Bush vetoed the second effort, saying that it was almost identical to the first bill. And I would say it was not, and the President knows better.     
   The President's second veto of CHIP legislation is a slap in the face not only to this Congress but to the millions of children who, without this bill, continue to be uninsured, or worse, basically lose the insurance they currently have. 
   Every day the parents of more than 9 million children worry when their kids have an earache, toothache, asthma, all this before they finally have to take them to the hospital emergency room. And the President seems satisfied with the status quo. In fact, in the past he has stated that every American has access to health care because they can always go to the emergency room. 
   Let me tell my colleagues, this fall I visited an emergency room in my district and it was not a great place for a kid to visit. It is the scene of trauma. Children are forced to share space with people who have overdosed on alcohol or drugs. Most emergency rooms are overwhelmed with real emergencies and have few resources to treat people who need regular family care. 
   The beauty of CHIP is that children get to see a doctor on a regular basis. And the President is deluding himself if he doesn't think this veto is going to hurt millions of children. And those Members voting to sustain the President's veto are just as guilty of turning their backs on millions of children who will be denied regular visits to see a doctor. 
   I urge my Republican colleagues to vote their conscience. Let's override the President's veto so that we can ensure that 10 million children receive the health care they need to grow up healthy and strong. This is the right thing to do for our country. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I just want to reiterate and contradict some of the things that the President said in his veto message today. 
   He said that this is the same bill that we sent him that he previously vetoed. And it's simply not true. We made substantial changes to it to allay concerns about higher income families enrolling, adults being enrolled, or even undocumented immigrants being enrolled. I just want to point out some of the flaws with the President's message in closing. 
   First, the President says that our goal should be to move kids into private coverage and not into public programs. That is exactly what the CHIP program does, Mr. President. CHIP provides money to States, which in turn contract with private insurance companies to provide insurance coverage to kids. It's not socialized medicine, it's not government-run health care, and the President should know that. 
   Second, the President says his proposal to reauthorize CHIP would increase funding by 20 percent. What he doesn't tell you is that his plan would not help provide coverage to the 6 million kids who are uninsured and eligible to enroll in either CHIP or Medicaid. I would point out that the Senate Finance Committee in July received a letter from the CBO where they said that they estimate between 5 million and 6 million children who are uninsured are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. So there are a lot of kids out there, almost twice as many that are in the program now, that could be insured. 
   And then the President said that we allow adult coverage. Well, let me say our bill phases out adult coverage faster than the President would do by just disapproving his waiver renewals. 
   Fourth, the President says we don't focus on the lowest income kids, and that's not true. We provide financial resources for States to go out and find the lowest income kids first. 
   Finally, the President has said he's been willing to work with us to reauthorize SCHIP, and the Republicans in the House said the same thing. Well, the fact of the matter is that, as our majority leader said, we have reached out. We have had hundreds of hours of meetings. We have reached out to the  President. It's simply not true that we haven't reach out, and the fact of the matter is that the President has been unwilling to budge even 1 inch from where he wants to go with the SCHIP legislation. Instead of working with us to provide health insurance to 10 million kids, he's given us two vetoes now. 
   All I can say, Mr. President, the holiday season is upon us, but you are basically becoming the Grinch who stole Christmas from these 10 million kids, in this case at least 5 or 6 million, that don't have health insurance. It's a shame that we have come to this position today, and I would urge my colleagues to cast a vote to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (NORTHERN IRELAND -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in amazement at what can only be described as the utter inflexibility of the Reverend Ian Paisley. Mr. Paisley's dislike of the Catholic population in the north of Ireland is well documented and needs no repeating on the floor of this body. Suffice it to say that John Hume's observation ``if the word `no' was removed from the English language, Ian Paisley would be speechless'' is an accurate description of Mr. Paisley's ability for thoughtful negotiation and compromise. 
   What does deserve recounting here, however, are the remarkable strides that have been taken by Sinn Fein in the quest for a just and lasting peace for all the people of Northern Ireland, as well as the hard work and dedication shown by the Taoiseach Bertie Ahearn and Prime Minister Tony Blair in this endeavor. 
   Prime Minister Blair has not always used the full force of his office to secure peace on the island of Ireland. However, he has shown himself to be a true friend to the Irish people and a strident negotiator for peace, and I am proud to commend him for that. His diligence and the pursuit of peace stands in stark contrast, however, to that of Mr. Paisley. 
   Mr. Speaker, heroic efforts have been put forth by all parties, republican, nationalist and unionists alike, to address this situation. It began with the signing of the Good Friday Accords in 1998 and the commitment of the IRA to end its armed campaign and commit to the development of purely political and exclusively peaceful means. The IRA then went on to put their arms completely and verifiably beyond use, which was confirmed by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. 
   Then, most recently, Sinn Fein voted in its extraordinary Ard Fheis, or political convention, to support the policing institutions. This includes a police service that has been shown by the independent Police Ombudsman to have engaged in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries, resulting in the death of at least 10 people, both Catholic and Protestant. 
   Despite all of this, Mr. Paisley has refused to enter into government with Sinn Fein and put the needs of his constituency and that of the citizens of Northern Ireland above those of his own petty hatred and extremist allies. 
   Mr. Paisley cannot continue to stand in the way of peace and justice for the people of Northern Ireland. The people of the North have waited far too long and sacrificed far too much for him to continue to be a roadblock to peace. Responsible leadership is needed on the unionist side of the North to show that extremism, bigotry and hatred will not be tolerated. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have taken to this floor many times in the last few years to talk about the situation in Northern Ireland. The progress which has been made is nothing short of remarkable, considering the violence that has plagued this area literally for centuries. But the one constant that those of us who care about a just and lasting peace have seen is Mr. Paisley, increasingly out of touch, afraid of losing his grip on power, and more interested in living with the past than embracing the promise of tomorrow. 
   It is well past time that Reverend Ian Paisley move along and let the people of Northern Ireland get on with their lives.

   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 493, of which I am a cosponsor. As science continues to make rapid advancement in the area of genetics, I cannot stress how important this bill is to every American citizen. 
   Genetic testing has increasingly become an integral part of the American health care system, providing the possibility to develop better therapies that are more effective against disease and allow individuals to take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. However, as knowledge of the human genome expands, a greater proportion of the population will likely be identified as carriers of mutations associated with a greater risk of certain diseases, indicating that virtually all people are potentially victims of genetic discrimination in health insurance.  
   Along with the increasing prevalence of genetic testing comes the growing fear of the potential misuse of this information by way of discrimination in health insurance and employment. Accordingly, we need to strengthen current laws at both the Federal and State level in order to protect against the possibility of genetic discrimination. This bill will go a long way in making sure that this highly private information cannot be misused or abused. 
   In closing, I want to thank the primary sponsors of this legislation, particularly Ms. Slaughter, I know how long she has worked on this, along with Ms. Eshoo and others. We finally came together in a bipartisan fashion to bring up what I think is a bipartisan bill. They should all be commended, all of us should be commended for our efforts. I think that this could serve as a model for bipartisan cooperation on other bills.

Eighty-four thousand Americans lost their jobs last month, and the number of unemployed Americans is the highest it has been since 1992. Congress responded quickly to the White House's call for a financial rescue package, but the White House should now join us in supporting a solid package for Main Street. 
   On Friday, the House passed legislation to boost our economy, to create jobs and to help provide additional relief to families who are struggling. The economic recovery bill will grow our economy and will create jobs through investment in our Nation's infrastructure, will extend unemployment benefits for the growing number of Americans looking for work and will ensure Americans do not lose health coverage as a result of State budget crises. 
   Mr. Speaker, the majority of House Republicans oppose this Main Street economic recovery package, and I hope President Bush chooses a different course. We have to have the economic stimulus package not only pass the House but pass the Senate and go to the President and have him sign it. This is just as important as the Wall Street bailout.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (TIME TO REFOCUS EFFORTS IN THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, my intention this morning was to come here and talk about the need to refocus our efforts in the war against terrorism out of Iraq and towards Afghanistan, because, after all, when we were attacked on 9/11, those who attacked us came from Afghanistan, not from Iraq. And President Bush in the very beginning and even now continues to confuse the American people by suggesting that the Iraq war had something to do with 9/11, which it did not. 
   However, I just listened to my colleague on the Republican side and I have to respond to him somewhat before I move on to the issue of Afghanistan. I want to commend the Speaker and commend the Democratic leadership for the supplemental appropriation bill that they are putting together and that will likely come to the floor next week. It was clear in the November election that the American people want a new direction in Iraq. They realize that the war in Iraq was begun for the wrong reasons, that it was not a response to 9/11, that a lot of the information that was provided to this Congress when the vote was taken to authorize the war was misleading and inaccurate. The fact of the matter is that Congress does have the power to declare war and Congress also has the decision as to whether to fund the war. And this is a supplemental appropriations bill that is going to fund the war and provide the funding for the troops. But at the same time Congress needs to point out that this war needs to move in a new direction and that it is not acceptable to simply give the President a blank check and say, okay, you can move ahead with your surge and essentially escalate the war. 
   We had a majority in this Congress, including a significant number of Republicans, who just a couple of weeks ago voted on a resolution that said that the escalation and the surge was a mistake, that we are opposed to that. And so there has to be some effort in this spending bill, which is our prerogative, to indicate why the war has gone in the wrong direction and what needs to be done to end it and ultimately get our troops out of there. That is what we are doing as Democrats and I believe we will have a consensus to achieve that and I think that it will lead in a very short period of time to us getting out of Iraq and leaving the Iraqis to decide their own fate. It is time for that at this time. We shouldn't be sending the resources and we shouldn't be sending our soldiers into a situation where they no longer belong. 
   My intention today was to come to the floor and talk about, rather than sending our soldiers to Iraq and all the resources we are sending to Iraq, that we should be focusing more on Afghanistan, because that's where the Taliban were and they continue to be. That is where al Qaeda began and continues to exist, including those who were in charge of al Qaeda. And we are not doing enough in Afghanistan. There is a new offensive now on the part of the Taliban which began last month in February and we are trying to counteract that. But we're not focusing on that because we're spending too much time focusing on Iraq in terms of our resources and our troops. 
   Now, the President finally came to the realization a few weeks ago that this was the case and he started to talk more about what we needed to do in Afghanistan. He sent Vice President Cheney there. Vice President Cheney made the point. He also went to Pakistan because Pakistan has this border area where we believe al Qaeda and the Taliban are headquartered and where they simply hide out and regroup before they begin their attacks from Pakistan into Afghanistan. Vice President Cheney went to Pakistan as well and made the point to President Musharraf that this is unacceptable, you cannot continue to harbor these terrorists, you have to do something to make sure that they are driven out of Pakistan and that they are not being supported by those local authorities or those within the intelligence service in Afghanistan that seem to be providing support to al Qaeda and to the Taliban. 
   But we need to focus on the issue of Afghanistan in terms of our resources, not only in terms of our troops but also in terms of reconstruction efforts. The Taliban are essentially being financed by increased production of opium and ultimately, of course, heroin. That's how they are financed. We need to deal with local reconstruction projects that will allow the Afghanis and particularly the farmers to do things that are not related to the opium trade so they can grow crops other than opium and sustain themselves. This is a major effort that we have to concentrate on and not enough is happening. 
   I would point out that in the supplemental appropriations bill, we do provide more money for this effort, because the Democratic leadership, as Speaker Pelosi realized, that we are neglecting the war in Afghanistan where the terrorists began. Let's refocus on that. But this supplemental bill is the answer to the problem and it brings us in a new direction.

   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, we are fast approaching the 1-year anniversary of the November elections when the American people went to the polls demanding to take our Nation in a new direction. 
   Over the last 10 months, the new Democratic Congress has produced real results that are now making a real difference in millions of Americans' lives. For 10 years, Republican Congresses have refused to increase the minimum wage for nearly 6 million hardworking Americans. Democrats thought that was unacceptable, and one of our first actions was to ensure that these workers finally got a much-deserved and long overdue pay raise. 
   Democrats also realize it is difficult for middle-class parents to send their children to college. Over the last 6 years as wages have stagnated, college costs have increased 40 percent above inflation. This Democratic Congress passed and the President signed into law legislation that provides the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill, and this new law will allow more Americans to live the American Dream. 
   Madam Speaker, congressional Democrats are proud of these accomplishments, but they are only the beginning as we continue to move America in a new direction.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the economic recession has been particularly hard on lower- and middle-income families. But over the last month, this House has passed important legislation that will make a real difference in their lives. These families were already having trouble squeezing enough money out of their monthly paychecks to pay for the basic necessities. Now imagine how much more difficult that is with the dramatic increases in the cost of foods like bread, milk and eggs. 
   Last week, in strong bipartisan fashion, this House passed a final farm bill that invests an additional $10.4 billion in nutrition programs so that 38 million American families do not have to go hungry. Our constituents are also rightfully concerned about their jobs. Over the last 4 months alone, 260,000 jobs have been lost. Finding a new job is not necessarily easy in today's economy. That is why this House passed an extension of unemployment benefits last week, giving unemployed workers an additional 13 weeks to find a job. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Democratic House is delivering results that will benefit families that have been forgotten for far too long.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, last week, Congress sent to the President a commonsense proposal that passed both Chambers with strong bipartisan support. The bill that we sent to President Bush was a balanced approach that would keep Medicare working for America's seniors, doctors and taxpayers. 
   This bill makes a number of improvements to Medicare that have been long overdue. The bill expands access to services for beneficiaries and provides additional financial assistance for low-income seniors. This bill also staves off the 10.6 percent cut to physicians' payments that are being implemented right now by CMS. 
   What this bill does not do is make drastic cuts to Medicare Advantage; it makes very modest and sensible reforms to the program. Now, do I think that we should do more to reform Medicare Advantage? The answer is yes. Because the Bush administration has created a bias in favor of Medicare Advantage. 
   I would like to make reference to yesterday's New York Times editorial called Medicare's Bias. It says, ``Many of the private plans that participate in the huge government-sponsored health insurance program for older Americans have become a far too costly drain on Medicare's overstretched budget.'' 
   ``These private plans--that now cover a fifth of the total Medicare population--receive large subsidies to deliver services that traditional Medicare provides more cheaply and more efficiently by paying hospitals and doctors directly. Congress was right--for reasons of equity and of fiscal sanity--to pass a bill that would at least begin to remove some of these subsidies.'' 
   Madam Speaker, now is the time to vote to protect health care for the elderly and disabled. Now is the time to vote to protect fair reimbursements for our Nation's doctors and pharmacists. And now is the time to vote to protect Medicare. Now is the time to vote to override the President's misguided veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (OPIUM TRAFFICKING IN AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, as this body plans to debate tomorrow the ongoing war in Iraq, I come to the floor this evening to discuss what I feel is the forgotten war, the United States' war on terror in Afghanistan. 
   I have stressed on numerous occasions the importance of the United States not losing sight of the real front in the war on terror in Afghanistan. Too often, the Bush administration has placed all of its efforts into fighting the war in Iraq while the Taliban and al Qaeda increased their presence in Afghanistan and western Pakistan. 
   It was promising to see Secretary of State Robert Gates visit Pakistan this weekend to meet with Pakistani President Musharraf. Unfortunately, Secretary Gates stated that the meeting was, and I quote, not aimed at securing the assurance of action from Pakistan. As I have stated before, assurances of action are exactly what the United States must demand from Pakistan at this time. 
   President Musharraf has acknowledged that his country's Frontier Guards have allowed insurgents to pass freely at the border shared by Afghanistan and Pakistan. If the Pakistani President is fully aware of Taliban insurgents crossing the border, why is he not taking the necessary steps to bring an end to these violations? 
   Mr. Speaker, in Afghanistan the Taliban seems to be ramping up its efforts and possibly planning a spring offensive. Last week in a speech on the House floor, I mentioned a town in southern Afghanistan, Musa Qala, which has been overrun by forces despite a peace deal brokered between local leaders and NATO-led forces. This deal called for the local leaders to take control of the town and ensure that Taliban fighters not create a stronghold in the area. 
   Unfortunately, these deals failed, and this week it has been reported that roughly 1,500 families have fled Musa Qala and, as an anonymous Taliban commander has claimed, there are thousands of Taliban in the region preparing for a possible attack by United States or NATO forces. 
   Now, it is extremely important for the United States to step up its efforts in this deteriorating country. Of particular significance is the alarming rate at which the opium trade is growing in Afghanistan. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, opium poppy production reached a record 6,100 metric tons last year, and this is 49 percent greater than the total in 2005. 
   Corruption is rampant within the opium trade, and the Taliban not only profit by selling and trading the opium, but also through providing protection to opium farmers and traders. Corruption is so pervasive that police chief posts in poppy-growing districts are auctioned off for as much as $100,000 for a 6-month appointment. 
   While these police chiefs will only make $60 a month, they know the kickbacks they will receive from working with the opium farmers and the Taliban will be extremely financially rewarding. Now, some claim that the U.S. and NATO should simply fly over Afghanistan and spray chemicals over all the opium fields to destroy the crops; but not only will this cause environmental and health damage, but it will also raise the price of opium and drive farmers towards the Taliban insurgents. 
   What the U.S. should do instead is use the additional aid that it plans to send to Afghanistan this year to bolster rural development in poppy-growing areas. This money must also be used to create new rural industries so the farmers will have options other than growing poppy and participating in the illicit opium trade. 
   The main goal of U.S. efforts to eradicate the illicit opium trade should  be to target illegal drug traffickers and corrupt officials such as police chiefs. Our government must couple this with aid to the rural poor in Afghanistan in order to provide financial alternatives to the illicit opium trade. 
   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues and I debate the merits of the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq, which I oppose, it is important for us not to forget where the real war on terror continues today in Afghanistan. The United States must intensify its redevelopment efforts in Afghanistan as an alternative to the opium trade, which is only providing further financial backing for the Taliban-led insurgency.

<TEXT>
    Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, many of us have elder parents, relatives, neighbors or colleagues who have experienced an unnecessary fall. Recently, Nancy Reagan and Senator Robert Byrd have both suffered from falls that have caused them to be hospitalized. 
    Falls among elderly Americans in fact are so commonplace that one in three Americans over the age of 65 each year experiences a debilitating fall. As a result, it is the leading cause of injury-related deaths for older Americans. 
    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimates that fall-related medical expenses cost Americans more than $20 billion annually. Projections are that those expenses will climb to more than $40 billion over the next 15 years, posing additional burdens on already strapped Medicare and Medicaid funding. 
    Effective demonstration tests and comprehensive public information and education campaigns can help reduce and mitigate these avoidable and frequently disabling injuries. 
    To that end, I introduced H.R. 3701, the ``Keeping Seniors Safe from Falls Act of 2007'' with my good friend Representative Ralph Hall, which is the House companion to S. 845, the bill we are debating today. If enacted, this legislation would launch a comprehensive preventive care program and educational campaign to reduce the number and severity of falls to the elderly. 
    In closing I want to acknowledge all the hard work that went into this bill, including the work of my colleagues both here in the House and the Senate, as well as the Falls Free Coalition working group, which has been advocating for this legislation for sometime. 
    Madam Speaker, falls among the elderly are clearly an issue that affect and potentially imperil us all. This legislation offers a national approach to reducing these tragic events I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (STROKE TREATMENT AND ONGOING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 477, the Stroke Treatment and Ongoing Prevention Act, amends the Public Health Service Act to strengthen education, prevention and treatment programs to improve health outcomes for stroke patients. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in America and a major contributor to long-term disability. The American Heart Association reports that approximately 700,000 Americans suffer from a stroke each year and that more than 150,000 die annually. The AHA estimates that someone dies of a stroke every 3 minutes. 
   H.R. 477 would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to engage in activities designed to increase knowledge and awareness of stroke prevention and treatment. This legislation would require the Secretary to conduct educational campaigns, maintain a national stroke registry and establish an information clearinghouse related to stroke. 
   The bill would authorize the Secretary to make grants to public and nonprofit entities for the purpose of planning, developing and enhancing improved residency training programs and other professional training for appropriate health professions in emergency medicine, including emergency medical service professionals, to improve stroke and traumatic injury prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. 
   Finally, the bill would authorize the Secretary to make grants to States and public and other private entities to make medical professional training programs and telehealth networks that seek to coordinate stroke care and improve patient outcomes. 
   The legislation has 86 cosponsors and is supported by the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association, the American Physical Therapy Association and the STOP Stroke Coalition. 
   I would like to personally thank Representative Capps and Representative Pickering for all their hard work on this life-saving legislation. I particularly want to thank Representative Capps. I know how hard she has worked on this. I know, because of her background as a nurse, she brings to our attention on the subcommittee so  many bills and so many issues that are really important. I would thank her not only for this bill but for so many other initiatives. 
   I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 477. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I just wanted to mention, Mr. Speaker, that screening for, and early detection of, breast and cervical cancer reduces death rates and greatly improves cancer patients' survival. Sadly, there is a low rate of screening among women of certain racial and ethnic minorities and among under- or uninsured women, which creates disparities in health outcomes. 
   Since 1991, this program has served more than 2.5 million women nationwide, provided more than 5.8 million screening examinations, and diagnosed more than 22,000 breast cancers, 76,000 precursor cervical lesions, and 1,500 cervical cancers. 
   This bill reauthorizes a program vital to the health and well-being of women nationwide. I just want to thank again Representatives BALDWIN and MYRICK for their hard work on this legislation and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1132.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I'd be very pleased to do that. And if I could, maybe I'll talk; first of all, let me thank you for doing this hour tonight and for everyone who's joining you, because it is really important. And maybe I'll talk about three things, and then I'll turn it back; and that is, one, how we came about with the SCHIP program because I think that relates to the whole bipartisan nature of it, which is what you stressed and is so important. And then maybe I can talk a little bit about the preventative nature of it because you talked about the emergency room and the President's comments about using the emergency room. And then I'll give you my one story. 
   I'm glad you're here, in part because last week we had some of my Republican colleagues, including some on the Health Subcommittee that I chair, who were talking about this program as if it was an entitlement, as if it was almost socialism, you know, sort of raising the specter that we wanted the government to run the health care system. And nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, first of all, you know they neglected to mention that this was bipartisan. And remember, when we're talking 10 years ago, this was the Gingrich Congress. This was the Republican majority that hadn't been the majority for very long. I mean, they were on the crest of this conservative right wing wave and in the midst of that were willing to adopt this bipartisan measure. 
   And the reason was because, in fact it wasn't an entitlement; it wasn't government control. It was just a practical solution to the problems that we faced at the time and still face. I mean, we all know that if people are very poor and likely not working, then they're eligible for Medicaid. And we have a lot of kids, and we have a lot of adults and, you know, people who find themselves because they're not working and their income is very low, having to use the Medicaid program, which is a very legitimate program and covers a lot of people very successfully. 
   But what we found 10 years ago was that there were a lot of other people who, because they were working, for the most part, were above the Medicaid guidelines. Their income was too high. But what were they making? Maybe 20,000 a year, 30,000, in some cases maybe 40,000 a year and they still had kids. And because they were working in jobs where there wasn't a health insurance option available to them, the employer just didn't offer it, or when they went out in the private market, you know, the costs were so prohibitive for them to buy insurance on the private market, which, you know, in New Jersey you might be paying $12,000 if you want to go out and buy insurance on the private market for a family of four, today that they simply couldn't get health insurance. 
   And so there wasn't any ideology involved here. In fact, it was a block grant. It was set up as a block grant which, I don't know if you guys remember because you haven't been here as long as me, but that was like the Republican mantra at the time; that everything should be block granted, all Federal Government programs should be block granted; this shouldn't be an entitlement. And that's what we did. We said, okay, fine. You want to make it a block grant. You know, President Clinton was the President, so we had a divided Congress, and we said, that's fine. Send the money to the States. We'll set up certain guidelines that, you know, you had to be up to 200 percent of poverty. And then if the States wanted to, they could go get waivers and go to 300 percent or higher.     
   And we will give the money to the States. They will match it, and we will cover these kids. 
   Now, the second point I wanted to make is this is a preventative measure, as you pointed out. For President Bush to say people can always use the emergency, that's not the point. The point is we want people to have health insurance so that they go to the doctor on a regular basis, so they take preventative measures, and they don't get so sick, particularly if they are kids, that they have to go to an emergency room to get care. As you said, that is not the way to operate. So we save money because through prevention, and everyone will tell you, any doctor or medical professional will tell you, that the most important thing for a person is to get health care in those first 4 or 5 years of their life. If they are properly cared for and they have the type of preventative care and regular doctor care and dental care that you mentioned in those formative years, then they are likely to be healthy for the rest of their life because that is the most important time. So it makes sense; right? 
   And then I will tell you my story. My story is that before this was enacted, about maybe 11 years ago, I don't go there as much anymore, but I used to go to a luncheon place that was like a diner, but not a New Jersey, but more of a luncheonette, we used to call it then. It is like an old-fashioned word, I guess. And there was a waitress there who I knew for a long time, and she had young children. And she would always say that her husband worked and she worked as a waitress but she was never able to afford health insurance for her kids. She wasn't eligible for Medicaid. She and her husband were both working. I don't know how much they made. But she had tried repeatedly and asked me about getting private insurance. I even gave her some ideas about how whom to contact. And they couldn't afford it. 
   The day that we passed SCHIP, I went back there. I forget how long it was going to be enacted, maybe a couple months from then, and the President signed it. And I said, We are going to have this program now. You can go sign up for it. I went back there whenever it went into effect, and she had signed up her children, and it was the nicest thing that could ever happen. 
   You know how we always say we want to do things for people but a lot of times we are not able to? For me to be able to go back there and have lunch and have her say, Well, now my kids are covered through this program, it was such a wonderful thing. 
   And I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania said that right now there are about 6.7 million kids that are covered by SCHIP. There are about 6 million that are eligible and not enrolled. And the reason they are not enrolled, in part, is because the States have run out of money. Some of them ran out of money in March of this year, and we had to do a supplemental appropriation. So we are not talking about all this extra money in a vacuum. We are talking about needing it in order to try to cover as many of these kids as possible. And our reauthorization will not only include more money but also ways of getting them enrolled. One stop so that they sign up for one Federal program. They can get this so that they don't get dropped. This is a streamlined application. These are all the things that we are doing in addition to the dollars in order to try to cover as many kids as possible. 
   I am staying but I will yield back to the gentlewoman.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. You know, when you relate your own experiences, I can relate so much to it myself. 
   I have to say, I was thinking back about 10 years ago when we first started the program. Of course, my wife and I were just starting to have kids. My oldest daughter now is 13, so she was three at the time. And I guess I had my son at the time, he was only one. And we were starting to realize at the time about the fact that, first of all, as parents, the idea of kids not having health insurance, you know, young kids at that age was really an awful thing. And that's why we got involved. I say ``we'' because my wife got involved in the whole issue as well. And to think about the fact that you have children and they can't have health insurance or you have to take them to an emergency room is just an awful thing. 
   I worry myself even now because a lot of times your health insurance doesn't cover everything. Like I was faced with the orthodontist bill a couple years ago. And I suddenly realized our insurance doesn't cover orthodontistry. And that was upsetting, but to think of parents that can't even take their kids to the doctor is just an awful thing. 
   One of the things that my wife would always say to me that she observed was that many times government officials, and I don't want to speak about ourselves because I don't want to be critical, but a lot of times politicians don't think about kids because of the fact that they don't vote. And I would almost kind of differ with the gentleman from Maine when he says that, you know, one of the things that we found and one of the reasons why States like Connecticut and New Jersey have covered some of the parents is because they have noticed that a lot of times the parents wouldn't enroll the kids unless they were eligible themselves to be enrolled in the program. And I again go back to, this is really a very practical thing. If some States have found that the parents won't enroll the kids unless they're enrolled, they actually allow the parents to enroll as an incentive to get the kids enrolled. 
   Because you can be cynical. I mean, you have to say that unfortunately sometimes parents don't care or sometimes politicians don't care. And the fact that we were able to do this and basically do a kids' health initiative program and get the political support for it in some ways was an amazing thing. You would say, well, gee, that's a basic thing, why wouldn't that happen? But it wasn't that easy. And we're going to have to continue to fight to expand it today. 
   I just wanted to answer your question, because I know that the gentleman from Maine did, but you said, what would happen if we don't reauthorize? 
   Well, I will just say, first of all, essentially this has happened in some fashion in the last few years. States have run out of money because there wasn't enough money as early as March in a given calendar year. Georgia ran out of money this March. And my own State started to run out of money by May. So we had to actually do a supplemental appropriation. The world knows it as the ``Iraq supplemental,'' but actually it was the supplemental that included the funding for Iraq, and it included about $750 million for SCHIP because States, in fact, were running out of money. 
   In my own State of New Jersey a couple of years had to cut back on the program and actually lower the eligibility and eliminate parents because of the fact that they started to run out of money. So we have experience of what actually happens if we don't provide the additional funds. 
   The other thing, too, is that until last year, every year for the first 9 years of the program, the number of uninsured kids in the country was going down. But last year, for the first time, the number of uninsured kids went up. So this is a crisis. I mean, if we're going to get to those extra kids, we really have to do something.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. If I could point out one thing, too, because I know there is some debate about this. The 
   States don't get any more money because they cover kids at a higher percentage of poverty or because they cover the adults, and I think there has been some debate about that. Remember, as I said before, this is a block grant, and the money that goes to the States is dependent upon the number of children that they have. So the fact of the matter is that if a State decides, like Connecticut did, that they're going to cover the adults, they just have to stretch out the Federal funds and contribute more State dollars to pay for it. They don't get additional money. I know that this sounds like such a bureaucratic comment, but some Members are worried, well, is my State going to get more because they cover kids at a higher level of poverty or another State covers adults. They don't. It's just a question of usually they're providing more State dollars and having the flexibility to include the parents so that they can cover the kids.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I just think the President has been very inconsistent. You talk about his experience as governor of Texas. But keep in mind that for the last 6 or 7 years, he has actually been granting the waivers. For example, right now the law says 200 percent of poverty, is what the law says in terms of eligibility. But it allows for waivers, and he has given waivers for so many States, I think as many as around 15 States, to go to 300 percent of poverty, to allow adults in some cases. His administration had to approve all those. 
   So I was very surprised in the early part of this year when he said that he wanted to keep it at 200 percent, he didn't want to cover any of the adults, because he has allowed that flexibility during his administration. 
   One of the things that the National Governors Association said unanimously was that they wanted States to have the flexibility. Again, I point out, this is a block grant. The States don't get any more money because they cover adults or go to higher levels of poverty or lesser levels. There is also flexibility, and some States don't count assets in determining that 100 percent or the 300 percent. 
   I think it really makes sense, and the National Governors Association said it makes sense to leave it to the States to have that flexibility, and the President historically has been in favor of that kind of flexibility. So I really don't understand where he is coming from. 
   The other thing I wanted to mention is we were talking about alternatives. When I listened last week to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, some of them were saying, well, people can go to community health centers. That was another thing that I heard. Well, the President talked about emergency rooms and some of our colleagues on the Republican said, well, they can go to community health centers. 
   Well, I am all in favor of expanding community health centers, but in my district I think we have maybe four Federally sponsored, maybe 5, community health centers. There is absolutely no way that the kids and the parents are going to line up. They don't have the ability to handle all the kids. 
   So what you said is true. They are going to end up being in an emergency room. They are part of charity care whose responsibility is on the rest of the taxpayers. 
   Then I heard another one of our Republican colleagues say, well, what we really need is, and I wrote it down, competition in the marketplace. And I was saying, what are we talking about here? Again, this is people who are working, who can't afford health insurance. What competition? They can't go out and buy it on the individual market. 
   So we hear a lot of inconsistencies. I don't want to be so critical of our Republican colleagues, because I want them to join us on this. But some of the statements that have been made by the President in the last few days. 
   I would point out in the Senate, as you know, the Republicans and Democrats came together and they are about to pass a bipartisan SCHIP expansion. So the Republicans in the Senate hopefully can talk to the President and the Republicans in the House and say, what are you doing? We want to continue with this on a bipartisan basis.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (ARMENIAN GENOCIDE--PERSONAL ACCOUNT -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the irrefutable fact of the Armenian genocide. Looking at the history of this catastrophic event from 1915 to 1918 and the impact it had on the Armenian people, it is impossible to deny that this was indeed genocide by all accounts. But one way, Mr. Speaker, to bear witness to the truth is to make reference to personal accounts when the genocide occurred at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. 
   Thousands of Armenians have their own account of the horrific events their families had to endure, but tonight I would like to tell the story of one person, Mrs. Haigoohi Hanessian, from Syracuse, New York. 
   Mrs. Hanessian was born in 1906 in Taurus, Turkey. In 1909, her family fled from their home after receiving word that the Turks were leading a massacre on all Armenians in the area. They took refuge in an institution, and I should say they took refuge, Mr. Speaker, in an American institution, and finally returned to their home only to find it burned to the ground. After traveling and staying with family in different areas, they eventually moved back to Taurus, Turkey. 
   Yet, again, in 1915, the Armenians were being exiled. Her family was forced to board a train with an unknown destination. With thousands of others, they were herded into these trains, confined in small boxcars for days with no food and no water. Mrs. Hanessian recalls that if someone died on the train, they were simply thrown off the train and were left on the side of the tracks. 
   When they finally arrived at their destination, they were placed in barracks. She speaks of the sentiments towards the Armenians at the time, stating, ``They wanted all the Armenians to vanish from the Earth. Instead of killing them, they suffered and died.'' 
   The Armenians were then marched through desert towards Syria in extreme heat, again with no food and no water. On the way, many died and were left to rot. After they reached a small  village in Syria, they stayed until they were told to move again. She remembers, ``An order came from all the General Headquarters that all Armenians either be killed or deny their religion and become Muslims.'' Many people converted to save their lives, while others died to preserve their faith. 
   The Armenians were forced to relocate from village to village. They were left with no money and no supplies, and had to find ways to survive. She said, ``You couldn't get in touch with anybody. You didn't know what to do. We were hungry. It was terrible. We were all dying. We were just skeletons, no food, no nothing.'' 
   Unlike much of Mrs. Hanessian's family who died or disappeared in the genocide, she survived and was able to relocate to the United States and rebuild her life in Syracuse, New York. She has since passed away, but not before she left her story behind, and I am proud to be able to retell her memories, which must never be forgotten. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my support this evening for swift passage of H. Resolution 106, reaffirming the Armenian Genocide. The resolution now has a majority of the Members of the House as cosponsors on a bipartisan basis. 
   As the first genocide of the 20th century, it is morally imperative that we remember this atrocity and collectively demand reaffirmation of this crime against humanity. By properly affirming the Armenian genocide, we can also help ensure its legacy and rightfully honor its victims and survivors like Mrs. Hanessian.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, securing the safety of the American people is our number one priority as elected officials. To do this we must look at all facets of homeland security and take all necessary precautions seriously. Democrats have pledged to address the matter of homeland security comprehensively by implementing the recommendations of the independent, bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Of their 41 recommendations made over 2 years ago, many have been only partially implemented and others have not been implemented at all. 
   Because of this delay in addressing the Commission's recommendations, we still have major holes in our homeland security system. More than 5 years after 9/11, only 5 percent of containers entering U.S. ports are screened. In addition, most air cargo is not screened at all, and our first responders are still unable to communicate with each other during an emergency.  
   Mr. Speaker, Congress can no longer ignore the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. This week we will have an opportunity to better secure our Nation by beginning the process of approving these recommendations.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (NO ESCALATION OF TROOPS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to voice my strong opposition to President Bush's apparent decision to send up to 20,000 more troops to Iraq. Tomorrow evening the President will try to persuade a very skeptical public that more troops are needed in Iraq. But regardless of the number he suggests tomorrow night, I will oppose any efforts to escalate the war by sending additional American troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, it appears President Bush has learned nothing from the results of the 2006 election, nor has he listened to the suggestions of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group or his own Joint Chiefs of Staff who said as late as last month that they saw no reason to send more troops to Iraq. 
   Instead, President Bush has chosen to stick his head in the sand, not listen to anyone and continue on a course that is not going to make Iraq any safer for either our brave troops or for the Iraqis themselves. 
   It is time to bring an end to the war in Iraq. President Bush has lost the support of the American people who have grown frustrated by the continuing loss of American troops. They are rightfully asking the question, why must our troops continue to serve as referees in a civil conflict between Sunnis and Shias?  
   Mr. Speaker, there was a new Washington Post ABC news poll released this morning. And only 17 percent of Americans support sending more troops to Iraq; 17 percent is not a mandate for anything, in my opinion. And it is time for President Bush to finally listen to the American people. 
   Many of us woke up on New Year's Day to the headline of ``3,000'' bannered across our newspapers. We have now lost more than 3,000 soldiers in Iraq. Now, how many more are going to have to die before the President realizes that there is no possible U.S. military solution in Iraq? 
   Some supporters of the President's plan are going to claim that if we bring our troops home now, the more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers that have died over the past 3 years will have done so in vain. But I could not disagree more. These men and women fought admirably for our country and will certainly be remembered as heroes. But the question now is whether or not we want to risk thousands more American lives for a war that we so obviously cannot win. 
   Since the inception of this war, we have seen little evidence of progress in Iraq. In fact, the violence has only intensified to the point that a report released from the President's own Pentagon concluded that violence in Iraq was at an all time high just last month. And last month was the third deadliest month for American troops since the start of the war with insurgents claiming 111 soldiers lives. 
   Now, our troops know that the situation in Iraq is getting worse every day. They are speaking about IEDs, the improvised explosive devices used by the insurgents, which are now bigger and more complex. 
   The Bush Administration has tried troop escalation before, but it has never worked. Last summer, the President touted a plan that sent more troops into Baghdad, similar to what is expected to be proposed by him tomorrow. But while the violence subsided for a couple of weeks, by the end of August last year, violence was again on the rise, and it continued to escalate for the remainder of the year. 
   Based on these facts on the ground, why would the President even consider sending more troops to Iraq? Why would you put more American lives in harm's way when we know that previous troop escalations have not been successful in reducing violence and decreasing the number of insurgents? 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to begin to bring our troops home. The President has said that increasing troops is a sacrifice we have to make to win this war. But I think truly it is time for him to admit that risking more American lives for this failed war is a monumental mistake.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH INTO HYDROCEPHALUS -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 74, expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the need for additional research into the chronic neurological condition hydrocephalus. 
   Hydrocephalus simply means water on the brain. The term ``hydrocephalus'' defines a condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain. This buildup of fluid inside the skull causes the brain to swell, infections of the nervous system, lesions or tumors of the brain or spinal cord, and decreased mental function among other symptoms. 
   The causes of hydrocephalus are not all well understood. It may result from genetic inheritance or developmental disorders. Other possible causes include complications of premature birth, diseases or infections caught before birth, and injury before, during or after childbirth. 
   Hydrocephalus is believed to affect approximately one in every 500 children. At present, most of these cases are diagnosed prenatally, at the time of delivery, or in early childhood. Advances in diagnostic imaging technology allow more accurate diagnoses in individuals with atypical presentations, including adults with conditions such as normal pressure hydrocephalus. 
   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, a part of the National Institutes of Health, is the leading support of research on hydrocephalus within the Federal Government. NINDS works collaboratively with other institutes at NIH to further research on the influence of hydrocephalus on development and on the more general issue of the effect of early brain injury. The knowledge gained from this research will foster hope for new methods to treat and prevent developmental brain disorders such as hydrocephalus. 
   I would like to thank Congressman MIKE THOMPSON of California for his work to bring this resolution before us today, and I would urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 74. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 52 supporting the goals and ideals of American Heart Month. February is American Heart Month, and each year since 1963 Congress has charged the President to claim February American Heart Month. 
   The goal of American Heart Month is to raise funds, conduct research, and promote education about heart disease and stroke. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and the major cause of disability. The most common heart disease in the U.S. is coronary heart disease, which often first appears as a heart attack. Almost 1.2 million people in the U.S. will have a heart attack and about 700,000 people die of heart disease annually. 
   Each of us should continue to take steps to prevent and control factors that put us at greater risk. Prevention measures certainly help to reduce the risks for heart disease and its effects. Additionally, knowing the signs and symptoms of heart attack are crucial to the most positive outcomes after having a heart attack. Recognizing and responding quickly to symptoms and receiving appropriate care can limit heart damage. People who have survived a heart attack can also work to reduce their risk of another heart attack or a stroke in the future. Research has shown a healthy diet and life style are the best weapons you have to fight heart disease. 
   I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald) for her work on this issue. I certainly urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 52. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (U.S. MUST FOCUS EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to discuss more recent developments regarding the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban and al Qaeda seem to be growing in strength, and the evidence shows that they are in the planning stages for a spring offensive. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have spoken on the floor many times about the forgotten war in Afghanistan. It was promising to see the Bush administration finally wake up and bring the issue to the forefront this weekend with Vice President Dick Cheney making a trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan. I was relieved to hear that Vice President Cheney was not hurt after a deadly suicide bombing took place near the U.S. military base he was visiting in Afghanistan. 
   A few hours after the attack, a Taliban official took credit for the tragic bombing and claimed that it was an attack on the Vice President, and this incident only underscores the recent resurgence the Taliban and al Qaeda have seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   The details of Vice President Cheney's trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan were kept extremely classified. This is in contrast with last year, when President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice both visited Pakistan with far less secrecy. The increased level of confidentiality for Vice President Cheney's trip illustrates the growing strength of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan and shows that the administration is obviously aware of the increased dangers that al Qaeda poses in the region. 
   During his trip to Pakistan, the Vice President apparently delivered a stiff message, as he said, to Pakistani President Musharraf. The administration will not provide details of the encounter between the two leaders, but reports claim that the Vice President warned President Musharraf that American aid to Pakistan could be in jeopardy. 
   The Vice President is obviously referencing provisions in H.R. 1, a bill crafted by Democrats in Congress, that implements the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. These provisions will end U.S. military assistance and armed sales licensing to Pakistan unless the Pakistani President certifies that the Islamabad Government makes all possible efforts to end Taliban activities in Pakistan. 
   Now, President Musharraf responded to these comments from Vice President Cheney by claiming that ``Pakistan does not accept dictation from any side or any source.''     
   It is unacceptable though, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, for the Pakistani President to completely disregard the numerous accounts that show al Qaeda training camps flourishing in the western region of his country. 
   The Pakistani President seems to forget that the U.S. has sent over $10 billion in aid to Pakistan over the last 5 years alone. It is my opinion that unless President Musharraf takes necessary steps to eradicate al Qaeda training camps in Pakistan, this aid should be put to an end. 
   It is encouraging to see the Bush administration increase the focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, but more needs to be done to ensure the Taliban doesn't reach the level of power it achieved prior to the U.S. invasion in 2001. Taliban commanders are already claiming that they have 10,000 fighters and thousands of suicide bombers at their disposal.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   I am just amazed at what's going on here on the Republican side of the aisle because I know how difficult it's going to be to get the votes to override the President's veto. 
   Last year at this time, we had all the State health officers coming here, many of them from Republican States, you know, where the Governor was Republican, demanding the fact that we needed to provide more money for SCHIP in order to expand coverage because they did haven't the funds. They were taking kids off the rolls, and so we responded. 
   We put together this bill to try to increase the number of kids to 10 million at a cost and paid for it with what I consider a very reasonable way to go about funding the program. 
   Now, a year later, we're still hearing Republicans on the other side saying, well, we don't need this; it's not necessary. And the situation is only getting worse. The economy's on a downturn. I'm hearing more and more every day from my Governors, my Governor and Governors on both sides of the aisle, about what the economic downturn is going to mean that more people are unemployed. They need Medicaid, they need SCHIP, because they're not going to have health insurance for their kids. So the demand is even greater. 
   Whatever problem existed last year that we were trying to address with this legislation, and it was dire, is going to be aggravated even more over the next few months and the next year.     
   So, I do not understand those who object to this legislation. 
   In addition to that, the administration issued this directive in August, August 17, that makes it even more difficult to enroll kids and for States to have flexibility. In that directive, the President actually says you have to be off health insurance for a year before you can apply and get on the SCHIP program. So, here we have the Republican administration making it more difficult for States to cover children as at the same time that the need becomes greater every day. 
   It is an absolute disgrace, in my opinion, that this bill was vetoed. It should pass today because of the need. And I call upon the administration to stop this negative effort to continue to make it more difficult for kids to get coverage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, last week this House passed a final veterans funding bill that provides the largest investment in veterans health care in the 77-year history of the VA. Congress initially passed this legislation over the opposition of President Bush and his administration. 
   Now, back in June, then Bush budget director, Rob Portman, said that the Bush administration would veto the Homeland Security measure as well as an even more generous bill funding veterans health programs and construction at military bases. 
   One week later, when this House was about to vote on the legislation, the White House sent over a letter saying that planned increases to veterans were excessive. 
   And then in August, the President directed his VA Secretary to send Congress a letter letting them know that veterans didn't really need $3.7 billion we had included over the President's request. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's clear that, until recently, President Bush and his administration did not believe we should fulfill our promises to our Nation's veterans. The President's paper trail is clear, and had it not been for this Democratic Congress, our veterans would not now be one step closer to the historic funding increase.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (HEALTH CARE ISSUES AFFECTING MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Thank you. I want to thank my colleague from California and also my colleague from Guam. I know that for a number of years now they have both been involved in the health care disparities issue, and have actually put together legislation that we have tried to get passed for several years. It was a little difficult with the Republican majority. And hopefully now with the Democratic majority, we can address those health disparities and concerns. 
   I would like to talk about the Native American aspect of this. And I also want to mention that addressing the concerns of minority health care is important in my district because we do have many Asian Americans. We have the largest number of Indian Americans of any congressional district, and by that I mean Asian Indian Americans, and also a large Latino and African American population in my district. 
   I just know when I go and visit some of the hospitals or community health centers, many times the issue is brought to my attention, whether it is data collection which has already been mentioned tonight, or it is the need for more minority health care professionals, be they doctors, nurses or whatever, or even that more research attention needs to be paid to diseases or afflictions that basically impact the minority communities in disproportionate ways. 
   It is very important that we address this and we need legislation, and we will move forward with the health care disparities legislation that my colleagues have really championed over the last few years. 
   I want to talk about Native Americans. I actually don't have any federally enrolled Native American tribes in my district or even in New Jersey. We have quite a few, we just don't have any recognized tribes at a Federal level. We have five that are State recognized. Unless you are federally recognized and enrolled with the Department of the Interior, you are not for the most part eligible for the health service. 
   American Indians are a little unique in that unlike most Americans, they have a right pursuant to their treaties and the Constitution to health care. When they gave their lands up to the Federal Government by treaty, they were given the right to health care. That, of course, doesn't necessarily mean they can all access it because a lot of them don't necessarily live on the reservation, and that is one of the reasons why we have urban health centers around the country, including several in California, because many Native Americans now do live in L.A. and in some of the larger cities, and don't necessarily live on their homelands on the reservations. 
   So we need to address their concerns in not only providing hospitals and clinics in their homelands, on the reservations, but also in the urban areas where many now reside. 
   Unfortunately, in the last few years, and I know I sound so partisan and I don't mean to be, but the amount of money that was made available in the last 12 years under the Republican Congress was really not sufficient. There is a need for a lot more dollars. This year we did budget significantly more for the Indian Health Service, but we also need to reauthorize the Indian Health Service because it hasn't been reauthorized since 2000. 
   I have sponsored legislation called the Indian Health Care Improvement Act which will be marked up in the Resources Committee this year and will come to the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Health Subcommittee, and we will try to get it passed in this Congress. 
   When you talk about Native Americans and the disparities, the disparities are just incredible. When we had a hearing on the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in the Resources Committee a few weeks ago, I asked a question about how many American Indian or Native American doctors there were in the United States. I could not believe the number. There are less than 500, somewhere between 400 and 500 Native American physicians for a Native American population that is probably over 2 million. I don't know what that works out to percentage-wise, but there is clearly a need for scholarship and grant and loan programs that would specifically target the Native American community so we can have not 400 doctors but at least 4,000 or maybe 40,000 when you talk about a community that has over 2 million people. 
   And the same is true, and I don't have the statistics for nurses or other health care professionals, but there are really very few Native American health care providers, and we need to boost those numbers up and allow for opportunities to get more health care professionals. 
   With regard to actual treatment, if they are not on the reservation and able to access the Indian health care hospital or clinic, it is very difficult. There is a huge unemployment rate. Even if you are on a reservation, sometimes distances are great because many Native Americans live in rural areas where health care is simply not available. 
   We also have the phenomenon of diseases or aflictions that target that community. The incidence of diabetes, juvenile or type 2 diabetes, is for many tribes over 50 percent. I have been to some where the numbers are over 60 percent. We need a lot more research into the reasons why, in the example of diabetes, but I could talk about other diseases or health care problems, why the incidence is so high and what could be done. 
   For example, there has been some effort to look at nutrition as an answer, the feeling that many Native Americans, for example, used to live on a subsistence diet. If they were a desert people, they would eat foods that they gathered in a desert. Or they may have lived on a ranch or in a situation where they were getting a lot more natural foods, and now as those opportunities have eased to exist and they are eating processed foods, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that is a major reason  for diabetes. This is the type of thing we need. We need research into those kinds of afflictions as to what is causing a better than 60 percent diabetes situation for a number of tribes. 
   Even transportation needs are there because of many of the problems that are in rural areas. 
   So I just wanted to say when you talk about the Native American population in this country, the disparities problem is so great that it has actually gotten to the point of crisis, in my opinion; and that is why we need legislation to deal with these disparity issues, and we need to reauthorize the Indian Health Service through the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. 
   And to the extent that we are looking at this from the Asian population, the Latino population, or whatever population, this type of initiative is very important. I just want to commend my colleagues again for being here tonight and speaking out because I do think we need to speak out. In many cases we are talking about people who don't have people to speak out for them other than a few of us. Thank you again.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (NINETY-SECOND COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the Republican side for agreeing to let me reclaim the time. I will try to limit my time to less than 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to commemorate the 92nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide. As the first genocide of the 20th century, it is morally imperative that we remember this atrocity and collectively demand reaffirmation of this crime against humanity. 
   On April 24, 1915, 92 years ago tomorrow, that day marked the beginning of the systematic and deliberate campaign of genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire. Over the following 8 years, 1 1/2 million Armenians were tortured and murdered, and more than one-half million were forced from their homeland into exile. These facts are indisputable, but to this day the U.S. Congress has never properly recognized the Armenian genocide. 
   The historical record, Mr. Speaker, on the Armenian genocide is unambiguous and well-documented with overwhelming evidence. The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time, Henry Morgenthau, protested the slaughter of the Armenians to the Ottoman leaders. In a cable to the U.S. State Department on July 16, 1915, Ambassador Morgenthau stated that, ``A campaign of race extermination is in progress.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if America is going to live up to the standards we set for ourselves, and continue to lead the world in affirming human rights everywhere, we need to finally stand up and recognize the tragic events that began in 1915 for what they were: the systematic elimination of a people. 
   Despite pleas by Members of Congress and the Armenian-American community and recognition by much of the international community, President Bush continues to avoid any clear references to the Armenian genocide, while consistently opposing legislation marking this crime against humanity. Instead, he has chosen to succumb to shameless threats by the Government of Turkey. I strongly believe that Turkey's policy of denying the Armenian genocide gives warrant to those who perpetrate genocide everywhere, because denial is the last stage of genocide. If the cycle is to end, there must be accountability. And just as we would not permit denying the Holocaust, we cannot accept Turkey's falsification of the facts of 1915. 
   Mr. Speaker, I must say that in the last few months the Turkish Government has made every effort to try to prevent the Armenian genocide resolution from coming to the floor of the House of Representatives. But I just want to show why denial is such a bad thing in a sense. Last week, I came to the floor and I pointed out that when the U.N. wanted to do a project or an exhibit at the United Nations headquarters talking about the genocide in Rwanda, because the Turkish Government protested the inclusion of the Armenian genocide, the Rwandan genocide never took place. There again, if you deny one genocide, you end up denying or impacting the other. 
   And the fact of the matter is that when some of my colleagues say to me, ``Well, why do you need to bring up something that occurred 92 years ago,'' I say, ``Because by denying this, the Turkish Government continues to perpetrate genocide or oppression of its minorities. 
   Just a few weeks ago, there was something in the New York Times about how the Turkish Government continues to persecute the Kurdish minority. Many Kurds have been killed, driven from their homelands in the same way Armenians were. The Kurds happen to be a Muslim people, not a Christian people. That doesn't matter. The Turkish Government consistently oppresses minorities. They refuse also to open their borders with Armenia. They have actually had a blockade of Armenia in placed for several years, which contributes to the economic instability of Armenia. 
   So this is something that must be done. It must be accomplished, that we recognize this genocide if it continues in various ways in Turkey today. 
   The second thing I would point out is that the Turkish Government has been basically hiring lobbyists for millions of dollars to go around and tell Members of Congress that if they pass the genocide resolution, there will be dire consequences: Turkey will not allow supplies to go to U.S. troops in Iraq.     
   They have actually taken to having Members of Congress called and told that their own soldiers in Iraq might be threatened if they pass the genocide resolution. 
   Well, again, this is the type of bullying that we, as a free government, should not allow because bullying is essentially the same thing that takes place when genocide takes place. Why should we give in to the threats of a country that tries to bully our country over such an important issue as the genocide? 
   Now, let me just mention, Mr. Speaker, to wrap up, that tomorrow evening at 6:30 the Armenian Caucus, which I cochair, will host an Armenian genocide commemoration event with the Armenian embassy, and I hope that many of the Members will attend this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, as the first quarter of 2008 ended, it was clear that things are not getting any better for American families struggling to make ends meet. Americans continue to face higher costs for basic necessities, millions of families have lost their homes due to the troubled real estate market, and several million more Americans are uninsured. 
   Last week, we also learned that April was the fourth month in a row that our economy lost jobs. With 20,000 jobs lost last month, our economy has now shed 260,000 jobs so far this year. That's particularly troublesome considering that experts say the economy must create 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with the number of Americans entering the job market. 
   All of these red flags show why it is so important that we worked together in a bipartisan fashion earlier this year to pass the economic stimulus package. As a result of that action, 150 million taxpayers began receiving rebate checks last week. That was a good start, but more needs to be done. 
   Madam Speaker, with so many Americans struggling and the bad economic news continuing to mount, we urge the President and the Republicans to join us to pass a second economic stimulus package.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, when this Congress was first gaveled into session by Speaker Pelosi, she declared it the Children's Congress. With that in mind, we set out to enact an ambitious agenda that included legislation to provide health care to 10 million low-income American children. But we were forced to go it alone. Instead of working with us, the President and his Republican foot soldiers in Congress chose to fight us tooth and nail. 
   We were not deterred by the President or the opposition that we faced from congressional Republicans. Earlier this summer, the House passed the CHAMP Act, which would have strengthened the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, and helped secure health care coverage for 10 million American children, 4 million of which are presently uninsured and come from hardworking families. 
   The CHAMP Act also included dramatic improvements for beneficiaries and providers under Medicare, which, if enacted, would have put the program on a more stable financial footing and ensured that seniors have access to the medical care they need and deserve. The CHAMP Act would have also protected Medicaid from harmful regulations which are now about to go into effect and will cut billions of dollars in critical services for low-income and disabled citizens of all ages. 
   Now, some may see the defeat of the CHAMP Act this year as a great victory for the President and his Republican allies in Congress. But they may have succeeded in being nothing more than obstructionists. No one has gained anything from these actions by the President or my Republican colleagues, least of all the people who rely on these programs for their health care. 
   This year, we had a chance to strengthen our Nation's health care safety net and improve the lives of our most vulnerable citizens, the elderly, the young, the poor and the disabled. Instead, both the administration and congressional Republicans are content on leaving here this year with doing the bare minimum on CHIP and Medicare when we could have accomplished so much more to improve the health of millions of Americans. 
   So now, Madam Speaker, we are left with a package that addresses the most immediate concerns, but leaves any real health care improvements for another day, and I think that is very unfortunate. But with the current President and the current Senate, sadly, this is the best we can do. But I will say, Madam Speaker, the Democrats  are determined in the next year to revive the CHAMP Act and the provisions that we care so much about, because we know that that is the best for the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, this bill is the result of Republican intransigence. This is a Band-Aid. And I would remind my Republican colleagues who seem to think that this is good legislation, that every day that goes by, more kids are going to get off SCHIP. 
   They put out that directive of August 17 that says that if a kid's parents lose their job, they would have to wait 1 year before they could get SCHIP coverage. 
   So the bottom line is more kids are going to go off SCHIP. We're just barely paying for the kids that are on it now. 
   They're not willing to do anything. They said that they were willing to negotiate. Well, we had negotiations, our majority leader said, for over 100 hours, and they still could not come up with an agreement.     
   The President refuses to fund anything. He won't pay through a tobacco increase, the only tax increase. The only thing he says he will do is cut programs to pay for expanded SCHIP that would even make it harder, like cutting Medicare. 
   So the fact of the matter is we are stuck with this lousy bill that was negotiated between the White House and the Republicans in the Senate. We don't like it. It's simply a temporary measure, and we as Democrats are committed to the fact that in the beginning of next year we're going to take up SCHIP again. We're going to take up the issue of Medicare to try to prevent the privatization that takes place under the current program. We're determined to correct these programs. 
   But it won't happen if the Republicans continue their intransigence, both at the White House and here in the House of Representatives. There is no reason to believe, based on what they've done in the last 6 months, that this Republican minority wants to work with us to achieve a better result. 
   So we are stuck with this bill today. It is a Band-Aid approach. We have to pass it so we can continue with the existing programs. But every day that goes by, Medicare suffers because fewer and fewer doctors are likely to take Medicare and fewer and fewer kids are going to get coverage because they're going to have to go to the emergency room because they can't see a doctor on a regular basis. That's not the way to operate. And I have to say that it's totally due to the fault, in my opinion, of the President and the Republicans here in the House of Representatives. I hope this changes in the next year.

Madam Speaker, today is the last day of this year of the session of Congress, and I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank my press secretary, Heather Lasher Todd, who is actually leaving today and going back to St. Louis, where she is from, with her husband. Both of them used to work for Congressman Carnahan, who was here before on the floor. 
   Many of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle see Heather on a daily basis when she is down here with me trying to get Members to do 1-minutes and other message opportunities, and also worked very hard to have our weekly message meetings and come up with timely topics and people who would speak. 
   I am going to sorely miss her. I know that many of my colleagues will as well. I just want to wish her and her husband a great future back in St. Louis where they are from.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (QI PROGRAM SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3560, the QI Program Supplemental Funding Act of 2008, introduced by my Senate colleague, Senator MAX BAUCUS.  
   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a number of technical, but important, changes that will improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This legislation also contains an important provision that will help incentivize the development of new antibiotics. 
   Earlier this summer, Congress passed H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, which extended the Qualifying Individual, or QI, program to December of 2009. The QI program provides important financial assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Unfortunately, when we passed H.R. 6331, we did not include enough money in the QI program to fully cover the level of need. We need an additional $45 million in order to fully cover the cost of the program through the end of next year. Otherwise, vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries may be disenrolled and lose access to important health services, and we certainly can't allow this to happen. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation also contains a provision that would encourage and incentivize drug manufacturers to research and develop antibiotics. Presently, there's too little research being done to develop new and innovative antibiotics therapies. That is particularly troubling at a time when antibiotic resistance is a growing problem. 
   According to the Infectious Disease Society of America, about 2 million people acquire bacterial infections in U.S. hospitals each year, and 90,000 die as a result. Approximately 70 percent of these infections are resistant to at least one drug. 
   Mr. Speaker, the R&D pipeline for antibiotics is drying up. Major pharmaceutical companies simply are not investing in the development of new antibiotics because it's not as profitable as drugs that treat chronic conditions. This is an important provision that I believe will help reverse that trend and lead to new breakthroughs and help protect the public health. 
   Mr. Speaker, in addition to these two provisions, the bill before us contains several other technical changes that would improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs and generate savings. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Well, as I've discussed with the gentleman, because we have actually talked about this on several occasions, I believe we are now doing what we call consent bills, in other words, bills that have the consent, meaning are basically agreed to not only by the Democrats and Republicans, but also by the members of the subcommittee and the Members of the House in general, because as you know, you have to have a two-thirds vote to pass these bills or do them by unanimous consent. 
   We do not have anything near consensus on that legislation. It would have to go through regular order, have a hearing, go through subcommittee. The problem is that many, probably the majority, but I won't venture to say whether it's majority or minority, but many people do not agree with the protocol, if you will, that is suggested, if not mandated, by that legislation. 
   In other words, right now, the majority of the doctors treat Lyme disease, you know, in a certain fashion. Those who advocate for that legislation suggest a different protocol, and frankly, I have tried very hard as chairman of the Health Subcommittee not to mandate or make decisions for physicians as to what kind of protocols they use. In this case, the protocol is very different from the overwhelming majority of the doctors, and so it's a very controversial issue that needs to have a lot of debate. 
   So there's absolutely no way that we could do something like that on a consent calendar because many of the Members simply don't support it.

   I would just point out that on this and so many other issues it is amazing to me that the gentleman, who was in the majority for so many years and had so many opportunities to raise this and other issues, is somehow now suggesting that the Democrats are boxing it up. You know, Lyme has been around for a long time. The people concerned about this issue have been trying to address it for a long time. The bottom line, as the gentleman knows, it's a very controversial issue. We will certainly raise it, but he had ample opportunity, the many years that he was in the majority, to raise it and it just didn't happen.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have no intention of yielding to the gentleman because of the disrespect that he has shown. 
   Now, secondly, let me also say this: I do appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) has, on several occasions, come up to me in the last few months and talked to me about this legislation. And we've had very reasoned conversations about the legislation. But I will also point out that the gentleman from New Jersey has not. The gentleman from New Jersey has not spoken to me at all about this legislation, and certainly not, in my recollection, in the last year. So if he felt it was so important, the way the gentleman from Virginia did, and has, he certainly had many opportunities to come up to me and talk to me about it. He has not. And I see the gentleman from New Jersey all the time--on the floor, at home, on various occasions. He has not spoken to me. 
   So I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for at least saying that he has taken the time, had some reasoned discussions about it. That is not true of my colleague from New Jersey, which is why I deeply resent the fact that he's on the floor here today talking about it because it is the first time I recollect him ever talking to me about it. 
   Now, let me say a few other things. First of all, as far as the science is concerned, the science is in the Infectious Diseases Society and the CDC, not with the Attorney General and some political grandstanding that he's doing in Connecticut, nor with my colleague from New Jersey who is grandstanding here today. 
   I am very concerned about Lyme disease. I have been working with the CDC to address the issue. We are awaiting answers from the agency on how best to address this. I have, in fact, talked to many of my constituents about this, even though my own colleague hasn't talked to me about it from New Jersey. 
   And I also would like to say this: As far as the Infectious Diseases Association, they basically are the majority opinion. Many doctors, including my neighbors who are physicians in my hometown, very much agree with the Infectious Diseases Society and don't think that this should be treated with these antibiotics for a long period of time because they're concerned about the impact on people and whether they would be seriously injured or even die from the antibiotics. 
   There is a lot of controversy that involves this issue. It is very involved and it is very controversial. It shouldn't be considered today on a consent calendar. And that was the only point I was trying to make for my colleague from Virginia, that we need to have hearings. And we will have hearings on the issue in general, and we can include this bill as part of that in the next session. But to bring this up today on the consent calendar when they know very well that there is not agreement on this and we couldn't possibly get a UC or have this on the suspension calendar, it's really very upsetting, and particularly coming from my colleague from New Jersey, who has never talked to me about this at all.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (SOCCER DIPLOMACY BETWEEN ARMENIA AND TURKEY -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to congratulate Armenia and its President on the historic soccer match between Armenia and Turkey this past weekend. On July 9, President Serge Sargisian and the ``Wall Street Journal,'' Europe edition took a surprising and historic step by inviting President Gul of Turkey to sit with him and watch the two nations play the World Cup qualifier match in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. 
   In an effort to warm relations between the two countries, President Sargisian wrote, ``Just as the people of China and the United States shared enthusiasm for ping pong before their governments fully normalized relations, the people of Armenia and Turkey are united in their love for football.'' 
   President Gul accepted the offer, and on Saturday, September 6, he became the first Turkish leader to visit Armenia. 
   Armenia initiated soccer diplomacy with Turkey despite nearly a century of Turkish genocide denial and 15 years of an economic blockade. For years, Armenia has been ready to establish relations with Turkey without preconditions, and President Sargisian's recent efforts reinforced this commitment. President Gul must also be commended for his efforts to see past the opposition of some in his country by attending the match. 
   With the recent violence between Russia and Georgia, further steps to promote stability in the Caucasus must be taken, and strengthening Armenian and Turkish relations is essential to these efforts. 
   Turkey can strengthen its relationship with Armenia by ending its policy of genocide denial, a policy that is imposed both globally and domestically. Turkey should lift all restrictions imposed by section 301 of the Turkish Penal Code on individuals who study, discuss, or recognize the Armenian genocide. Silencing academics and writers limits freedom of speech and makes any serious discussion of the Armenian genocide within Turkey taboo. 
   To improve relations, Turkey must also lift its stifling economic blockade on Armenia. The State Department estimates that the blockade inflates Armenia by 30 to 35 percent. Removing the blockade will enable the development of immediate infrastructure projects and regional communications, energy, and transportation in the Caucasus. The removal of the blockade would also do much to catalyze global investment in Turkey and Armenia. 
   With the recent conflict between Russia and Georgia, Armenia proved itself to be a constructive partner to Georgia. The Armenian government provided safe transit for U.S. and international officials and thousands of Georgia nationals and nongovernmental organization representatives. 
   But Armenia experienced significant economic distress due to the conflict between Georgia and Russia. The country lost an estimated $650 million and shortages in fuel and wheat were rampant. With renewed volatility in the Caucasus, Armenia can no longer afford to suffer from dual blockades. 
   President Sargisian's initiation of soccer diplomacy and President Gul's reciprocal invitation to watch a game next year in Turkey is a positive breakthrough in a region of historic violence and tense emotions. 
   As President Sargisian wrote, ``A more prosperous, mutually beneficial future for Armenia and Turkey, and the opening up of a historic East-West corridor for Europe, the Caspian region and the rest of the world, are goals that we can and must achieve.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just say as a Congressman and speaking for all Members of Congress, we must do all that we can to support these efforts to bring Armenia and Turkey together. It may seem that a soccer match is not that significant, but it is very significant. No Turkish leader has ever visited Armenia before. So I want to commend this occasion and hope that it leads to more of further developments and relations between the two countries.  
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, later this week will mark the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack on our Nation. In the days after 9/11, Washington and the world united to respond to that attack by going after al Qaeda in Afghanistan. It was a success. But rather than continue that quest, President Bush chose to turn his attention and the attention of our military to Iraq. 
   This was a huge foreign policy mistake that has stretched our military dangerously thin, left us unprepared for possible threats, damaged our credibility around the world, and allowed al Qaeda to regroup and become stronger along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Rather than focus on the greatest threat of terrorism along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the Bush administration has consistently diverted resources to Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we remember the 9/11 attack this week, it's important that we recognize the foreign policy failures of the last 8 years so that we don't repeat them in the future. We must also recommit ourselves to going after the terrorists where they are, and that is the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, not Iraq.

These represent the highest numbers for the Pew Research Center survey since the question was first asked in 1964. 
   Economic uncertainty within the middle class is a result of President Bush's economic policies. For 6 years, Republicans have offered tax cuts to the wealthy, refused to close corporate tax loopholes, and even defended multi-billion dollar tax subsidies for big oil companies. 
   House Democrats reject an economic policy that showers billions of dollars on unnecessary tax breaks to corporate interests and to millionaires, while middle-class families are ignored. This year's Democratic budget makes middle class tax relief a priority by calling for the extension of middle-income tax cuts, such as the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief. 
   Democrats have also been working hard to close corporate tax loopholes and end costly waste, fraud and abuse. Madam Speaker, Democrats are fighting to put the Tax Code back on the side of the working family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to once again call upon Pakistani President Musharraf to take action against Taliban fighters in the western region of his country. President Musharraf continues to deny that Taliban leaders are hiding in Pakistan and that the Taliban are regrouping there, despite numerous international press accounts describing otherwise. 
   President Musharraf claims that securing the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is not the sole responsibility of his country. He has admitted that border guards at the tactical level often, quote, turn a blind eye when insurgents cross the border into Pakistan. Yet he still shirks the responsibility his country must take in dealing with the situation. 
   In Musa Qala, a town in southern Afghanistan where a peace deal last year was signed by NATO-led troops and local elders, government officials confirmed that Taliban forces had taken partial control of the town in the last few days. The Taliban's movement into Musa Qala completely disregards the peace agreement and goes against the wishes of the Afghani citizens living in the town. 
   A similar deal was developed last year in North Waziristan, a region in western Pakistan. As was the case in Musa Qala, Taliban fighters disregarded this deal and have taken partial control of the region. Yet President Musharraf continues to defend this peace deal, despite the fact that the Taliban seemed to have created a stronghold in the region where they can likely plan future offensives against U.S. forces and the citizens of Afghanistan. 
   If the Pakistani President truly wishes to defend this peace deal, he must take the necessary steps towards eliminating Taliban forces, not only in North Waziristan, but throughout his country. President Musharraf has also scaled back plans to enforce and patrol the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. If Musharraf actually wishes to eliminate Taliban forces in Pakistan, he must work to control this border in a safe and diplomatic manner. 
   Madam Speaker, last week I came to the floor to highlight H.R. 1, a bill that implements the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. This is part of our first 100 hours. Included in H.R. 1 is language that would end U.S. military assistance and armed sales licensing to Pakistan unless it is certified that the Islamabad government is, I quote, making all possible efforts to end Taliban activities on Pakistani soil. 
   It is my hope that once this law is passed, the bill will finally force President Musharraf to crack down on Taliban training camps and leaders within his country. The Bush administration, however, has already signaled its opposition to this language in H.R. 1. Last week, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John Gastright assured Musharraf's government that the administration opposed any end to military assistance to Pakistan. 
   I believe it is absolutely unacceptable for President Bush to oppose these actions against the Pakistani government. The language in H.R. 1 places appropriate pressure on President Musharraf to finally take suitable action against the Taliban forces currently plotting within his country's borders. 
   The Bush administration claims that it deals with President Musharraf regardless of his actions, because it believes the Pakistani President is better than the Islamic extremist and anti-Western alternatives in Pakistan. 
   However, there are Democratic alternatives in Pakistan. According to a recent poll by the International Republican Institute, the second most popular leader in Pakistan is former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Now, Mrs. Bhutto's party, the Pakistani People's Party, has joined with the Muslim League Party to form the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy and hopes to restore democratic government to Pakistan in the near future. 
   Madam Speaker, it is essential for the United States to increase pressure on President Musharraf to step up his commitment to eliminate Taliban fighters in training hubs in his country. A significant step towards applying this pressure came with the language in H.R. 1, which we passed in the first 100 hours, ending military aid to Pakistan unless the Pakistani President takes steps towards this goal of routing out Taliban forces. It is imperative for President Bush to realize the importance of the language in this bill and support the provisions outlined in H.R. 1.

   The Republican solution is to open up more of our pristine land and our ocean to oil drilling. They neglect to say that Big Oil already has leases for 68 million acres that, for whatever reason, Big Oil refuses to explore. Experts estimate that these 68 million acres of leased land could produce about 4.8 million barrels of oil which would nearly double our Nation's total production. 
   Why should we give Big Oil access to more of our land and water when they refuse to drill on 68 million acres they already have? And if drilling is indeed the answer to high gas prices, as my Republican friends always claim, why aren't they demanding that Big Oil start drilling on these lands? 
   Mr. Speaker, this week House Republicans will have an opportunity to act on their rhetoric by supporting Democratic legislation that tells Big Oil to either use it or lose it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day on November 11 of this month, I want to say a few words about why I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 60 which, as you know, expresses support for the goals of Veterans Educate Today's Students Day, or VETS Day. 
   Throughout our Nation's history, millions of men and women have served the U.S. in times of need as members of the armed services, and these veterans and their families have made sacrifices that should not be forgotten with the passage of time. In the U.S., hundreds of memorials and monuments stand to honor those who have served in the armed services. While these tributes help remind Americans of the great sacrifices that were made to protect our freedoms, they can't educate today's youth the way actual veterans can. 
   The VETS Day essentially would urge teachers and civic leaders to organize events and forums where students can interact with America's veterans. 
   H. Con. Res. 60 would encourage schools to set aside a portion of the day in November to allow veterans to answer students' questions while conveying important stories and lessons about their service. I actually have participated in these kinds of programs in my own district, Mr. Speaker; and I know how valuable they can be. 
   At a time when the men and women of our armed services are in harm's way, we should be educating today's students on the sacrifices these brave men and women make every day. The children of our Nation will benefit from programs that provide education about veterans and instill a patriotic appreciation of the sacrifices made by veterans to defend freedom and protect the interests of our Nation. 
   Again, I think the most important thing is hearing firsthand accounts from veterans themselves, and that is the best way that students can better understand veterans' service and sacrifice. Again, I want to thank the chairman for his assistance and urge swift passage of this resolution.

In August, the Bush administration pushed through Congress a last-minute bill that gave it the authority to go after Americans without warrants, a direct violation of our Nation's Constitution. The administration's bill included ambiguous language that could be read by some as authorizing warrantless domestic searches. 
   The RESTORE Act clarifies this language and specifically prohibits warrantless surveillance of Americans and requires a court order before targeting American's phone calls or e-mails. It also includes strong new audit and reporting requirements so that Congress knows whose conversations are being captured. We include all these protections, but we also ensure intelligence officials have the ability to conduct responsible surveillance under the law. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Member of Congress is committed to strengthening our intelligence community and ensuring they have tools they need to keep our country safe. But the RESTORE Act finds the proper balance and should receive strong bipartisan support today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment will exclude solid waste rail transfer facilities from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board and provide that laws outlining the STB's jurisdiction would not preempt the authority of State and local governments to regulate such facilities. 
   In New Jersey, and all over the country, certain waste handlers and railroad companies have tried to exploit a supposed loophole in Federal law in order to set up unregulated waste transfer facilities. 
   Under the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, the STB has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and the ability to grant Federal preemption over other laws at any level, local, State or Federal, that might impede such transportation. 
   But Congress intended such authority to extend only transportation by rail, not to the operation of facilities that are merely sited next to rail operations or have a business connection to a rail company. 
   Unfortunately, certain companies have exploited this loophole to build or plan waste transfer stations next to rail lines and avoid any regulation from the State or local authorities. 
   It's my hope that this amendment will take the STB out of the waste management business by ensuring that State and local governments have the right to regulate solid waste transfer stations. 
   We must ensure that solid waste facilities follow the rules and do not pollute pristine open space, and do all that we can to protect our environment from unregulated facilities. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (ENERGY AND OIL COMPANY PROFITS -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, last week ExxonMobil, the biggest of Big Oil companies, announced that its profits for 2006 totaled $39.5 billion, the highest annual profits ever recorded for an American corporation. 
   Now I don't begrudge the right of any company to make profits, and certainly ExxonMobil has done quite a good job of doing so; but while they are out making money, it is our job here in Congress to ask what price we have all paid for those profits. The most obvious price has been the squeeze on working families. When gas prices hit $3 per gallon last summer, it was low- and middle-income families just trying to get to work that took the brunt of the impact and had to readjust tight household budgets. 
   Are ExxonMobil's profits worth that kind of cost to our society? Is it fair that the world's most profitable corporation gets even more profitable while everyday Americans struggle to get by and provide for their children? Certainly that does seem unfair to me, but maybe the problem is not entirely ExxonMobil's fault--after all, they are just feeding America's fossil fuel habit. As President Bush said last, America is addicted to oil. As long as this addiction persists, Big Oil gets richer and average Americans suffer more. 
   Despite the President's pronouncement, however, that addiction has gotten worse over the last 6 years, when the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress came up with new and clever ways to hand out goodies for oil and gas companies. That was no way to run an energy policy, and all we wound up with 6 years later is higher gas prices, greater dependence on countries that really don't like us, and the increasing threat of global warming. 
   That is probably one reason why during last year's elections the American people clearly chose a new direction for America, and the new Democratic majority in the House responded. 
   During the first 100 hours of this Congress, we repealed massive tax breaks for Big Oil and funneled the money into a fund to promote clean and efficient energy technologies. It will go a long way towards promoting the right kinds of energy sources. It also signaled that Democrats are willing to end outdated policies that do nothing more than worsen our addiction to fossil fuels. And that is certainly not the end of our efforts. 
   Madam Speaker, our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Majority Leader Hoyer are planning new efforts to get the House to focus on energy independence and combating global warming. Energy independence means diversifying our energy sources so that we can free ourselves from the national economic and environmental security concerns of being too dependent on oil, gas and coal. And that means keeping gasoline, electricity and natural gas prices stable to make sure American families aren't jolted by sudden high prices. 
   It means reducing our oil consumption to the point where our foreign policy isn't being held hostage because we need oil from some of the most unstable or unfriendly places in the world, including Iran and Venezuela. It also means making sharp reductions in greenhouse gas pollution so we can stave off the worst impacts of global warming. 
   I just want to reemphasize that last point because global warming is one of the most serious challenges we are facing in the 21st century. For a district like mine near the Jersey shore, it means dealing with rising sea levels, more frequent floods, and stronger storms. For the country as a whole, it is a security issue. 
   The more the Earth warms because of pollution from fossil fuels, the more American families and businesses will have to deal with bigger disasters, more unpredictable weather, and a completely different climate. 
   The bottom line is that working towards energy independence and fighting global warming are real security questions for the American people. Unfortunately, we have wasted the last 6 years spending more time helping ExxonMobil's bottom line than we have dealing with these serious questions. 
   So this new Congress means an opportunity to move in a new direction. When it comes to energy independence and global warming, the new direction means actually putting forward solutions that will move us towards a clean, sustainable, secure energy future. 
   We are going to raise the bar in this Congress. No longer should we be satisfied just to hear sound bites like ``addicted to oil'' and ``serious challenge of climate change'' that we heard in the President's State of the Union address. Now we can have a real dialogue about how to address these issues. 
   And I would just say, Madam Speaker, ExxonMobil may keep earning record profits, but this Congress, this Democratic majority Congress, has to keep its eyes on doing what is best for American families and for our environment.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (ELIMINATING POVERTY -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, last week, on the night of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, I attended a truly amazing event in the West Side Community Center in Asbury Park, New Jersey. 
   The city of Asbury Park is in my congressional district, and has been plagued in recent months by gang violence. It is a phenomenon shared by many New Jersey municipalities, including my hometown of Long Branch nearby, which recently witnessed several gang murders. 
   Mr. Speaker, redevelopment has come to Asbury Park, all the outward signs are of a seaside resort that is coming back big time. So why, you might ask, the gang violence? Why the murders? One of which took place right in front of the West Side Community Center where the Dr. King celebration took place. The truth is that the plight of the have-nots, that other America, has gotten worse in the last few years. 
   The event was organized by the Reverend Kevin Nunn, leader of Spirit of Truth World Vision Outreach in Asbury Park. More than 15 local clergy testified to the difficulty of young people in getting an education, avoiding drugs, and preventing a return to prison because of lack of economic opportunities. The recreation programs which had been the backbone of the West Side Community Center are at risk because of lack of funding. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the most important theme I can convey about Monday night's event was the message of hope. Dr. King was invoked as the example of love, peace and harmony among those of all races and creeds, and he was a symbol that pervaded the audience as the speakers talked about the need to vote, to go to church and unite as a committee. Reverend Nunn and most of the clergy who spoke at this meeting are directly involved in bringing shelter to the homeless, food to the needy, and promoting economic opportunity. 
   The people present Monday night are proud Americans, but they need help. They are certainly not looking to government to solve all their problems, but they believe that government can make a difference, and it is up to us as their representatives to make the changes necessary so they can continue to have hope. 
   Mr. Speaker, Senator BOB MENENDEZ and I will soon introduce legislation to address the issue of gang violence. The bills will have three main goals. Our first goal is to provide after-school programs for students so they have a place to go instead of joining a gang. The type of recreation and mentor programs that were discussed in Asbury Park at the community meeting I attended could benefit from the grant set up by this legislation. 
   The second goal is to prevent recidivism, the idea that people who leave jail don't get caught up in a gang once again because they have no job, no family or home to return to after jail. The legislation expands adult and juvenile offender demonstration projects to help with post-release housing and promote programs that hire former prisoners. 
   And last, the administration addresses better police enforcement as well as gang suppression initiatives. At the Asbury Park meeting, the cries of ``Stop the Violence'' came up repeatedly. The legislation will direct more resources to towns to create a new COPS grant program and put more police on the street. Penalties will increase for those convicted of gang crimes, and particularly those using firearms, and communities would be empowered to create their own task forces to implement antigang initiatives. 
   Now all of these ideas require more dollars, and on the day when President Bush is making his State of the Union address, I want to make one very serious point about Federal resources. We can't, as a nation, continue to escalate the war in Iraq with no positive consequences for America at a continued drain of hundreds of billions of dollars. President Bush needs to reverse course and redeploy our troops out of Iraq. The money and manpower are not only needed on the fight against terrorism elsewhere, for example, in Afghanistan, but also at home, to fight the criminals on our streets. The need is not only for more policemen, but for the housing, health care education and life support needs that will make it possible to get rid of the poverty that I saw on Martin Luther King Day in my community of Asbury Park.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, we must seriously begin to address the problem of the Nation's uninsured and the skyrocketing price of health insurance. 
   Unfortunately, the plan the President is expected to outline tonight will do nothing to cut down on the number of uninsured because a tax deduction simply is not going to be enough to make insurance affordable to low and middle-income workers. In most cases, individual health plans are more expensive to purchase and provide considerably less coverage, but the Bush administration is under the false impression that their tax deduction will provide enough of an incentive for uninsured workers to sign up. 
   At the same time, the Bush administration falsely believes they can begin to target the cost of health care premiums by taxing employee-based health benefits. This is nothing more than a tax increase on middle-class workers who have been lucky enough to secure good benefits through their job. Quality health benefits provided by employers should be the norm; and as policymakers, we should not discourage it. 
   The President's proposal is a non-starter for me, Madam Speaker. But I am hopeful that I can work with the Bush administration to begin to solve some of our health care problems.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (TALIBAN RESURGENCE IN PAKISTAN -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on the eve of President Bush's State of the Union speech, in which he will undoubtedly be searching for support for his plan to send additional troops to Iraq, I fear that the President and his administration are neglecting the real front in the war on terror, and that is Afghanistan. It is because of this neglect that the Taliban has made a resurgence in both Afghanistan and western Pakistan. 
   In October, President Bush said that ``al Qaeda is on the run'' and claimed that we are winning the war on terror. The fact is that attacks by jihadists have increased over the last 3 years. In addition to the tragic bombings in Madrid and London, violent incidents linked to al Qaeda have occurred in Iraq, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, and elsewhere in the Middle East. 
   Investigators discovered that the man behind the London bombings, Mohammed Siddique Khan, spent significant time in western Pakistan prior to the bombings. He was in the area of Pakistan that shares the border with Afghanistan, and this area has grown to be one of the most problematic regions in America's war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, the problem stems from late 2001, when American forces pushed al Qaeda out of Afghanistan. The group did not disappear, but rather jumped the border to western Pakistan, where it has set up a network of training camps. A former American intelligence official who worked in Pakistan has claimed that over 2,000 foreign fighters are currently in the region. 
   The details of insurgent attacks on the ground in Afghanistan are very disconcerting. Suicide attacks have increased from 27 in 2005 to an alarming 139 attacks in 2006. Instances of roadside bombs have more than doubled from 783 in 2005 to 1,677 in 2006. And, Mr. Speaker, we are hardly winning this war. 
   President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice must push Pakistani President Perves Musharraf to take action against Taliban militants in the western region of his nation. After the attacks of 9/11, President Musharraf offered his support to the United States by vowing to search for  Taliban fighters and Islamic extremists in western Pakistan. However, he has failed to live up to his promise, as reports show that Taliban fighters seem to be flourishing in western Pakistan. 
   And it appears that Pakistan's agencies, particularly the large and powerful ISI, have been promoting the Islamic insurgency. According to press reports, NATO has captured nearly 200 members of the Taliban, including Pakistanis, who have described in detail the ISI's support of the Taliban. 
   Last week Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte said that al Qaeda ``continues to plot attacks against our homeland from their leaders' secure hideout in Pakistan.'' President Bush must listen to Negroponte and others who see the realistic side of the war of terror, a war that we are not winning because the President is too focused on the failed war in Iraq. 
   By sending additional troops to Iraq, in a sense escalating the war, the President will continue to undermine the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. In fact, some reports have stated that a portion of the proposed 22,000 additional troops moving to Iraq will be pulled out of Afghanistan. It is simply unacceptable for the President to continue to risk American lives in Iraq in a war we cannot win while the real terror threat continues to grow in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the goal of the war on terror is to prevent future incidents of terrorism in the United States and abroad, President Bush must shift his focus away from Iraq and return it to Afghanistan and Pakistan. He must work with President Musharraf to eliminate extremist training camps in western Pakistan and acknowledge that the real epicenter of the war on terror is Afghanistan and not Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (UNITED NATIONS MUST BE LEADING VOICE AGAINST GENOCIDE -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am strongly disappointed that United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has given in to Turkey's demands and cancelled an exhibit commemorating the 13th anniversary of the Rwanda genocide.     
   Turkey, as usual, was offended by references in the exhibit to the Armenian genocide in Turkey during World War I. 
   As a representative of the international community, the United Nations must be the leading voice against genocide. That includes all genocides, including the Armenian genocide. Unless the United Nations takes a stand against Turkey's denial, its value to the international community is greatly undermined. 
   As the 92nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide approaches, Turkey's recent behavior is yet another example of why it is so important for Congress to reaffirm the Armenian genocide by  passing H. Res. 106. Over the past year, Turkey has pulled out of NATO exercises after France affirmed the Armenian genocide. They have threatened U.S. troops in Iraq if the U.S. reaffirms the Armenian genocide. And now they are preventing the U.N. from honoring the victims of the Rwandan genocide. Their denial has no limits. 
   The United States must never allow crimes against humanity to pass without remembrance and condemnation. As a society, we cannot effectively work to end crimes against humanity without recognizing those that have previously occurred. 
   Far too many times we have seen the horrible consequences of ignoring genocide. Even after unprecedented humanitarian efforts by Americans, the Armenian genocide had become the ``forgotten genocide,'' and in 1939 Adolf Hitler exclaimed to his generals to have no mercy by stating, and I quote, ``who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? 
   In 1994 world leaders witnessed the Hutu leaders of Rwanda kill 800,000 Rwandans, and did nothing. Today we sit idly by as militias massacre innocent citizens in Darfur; and, again, world leaders do virtually nothing. There are lessons to be learned by history. Unfortunately, Turkey has undermined the intent of the U.N. exhibit to help teach the lessons of genocide inaction. 
   Turkey's policy of denying the Armenian genocide gives cover to those who perpetrate genocide everywhere. If the cycle is to end, there must be accountability for genocide. Genocide denial is the last stage of genocide. 
   Mr. Speaker, when will today's world leaders stop letting Turkey deny its past? It is bad enough for Turkey to threaten and prosecute its own citizens for discussing these crimes, but to threaten to retaliate against countries that acknowledge the Armenian genocide is appalling and unacceptable. As a global community we must collectively stand for historical truth and recognize the worst humanitarian crimes that we have seen.

   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, we keep on hearing all of these doomsday scenarios from the White House and our Republican colleagues about the emergency supplemental bill. It would be nice if they would listen to the President's own defense Secretary, who said this week that our timelines are already creating positive results in Iraq. Yet the President threatens to veto the bill and says that the money is needed immediately. 
   I think it's time for a reality check. Fact: the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded last month that the Pentagon could maintain its wartime operations well into July with funds they have already been provided. 
   Another fact: As of today, it's only been 73 days since the President sent his funding request to the Capitol. Last year, the Republican-controlled Congress took 119 days to send the Iraq war supplemental to the President, and yet the President never attacked the Republican-controlled Congress for supposedly holding up funding for our troops. 
   President Bush should stop playing politics with this emergency funding bill so that we can finally move the war in Iraq in a new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (STATE DEPARTMENT'S HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, each year, the Department of State issues a report outlining the human rights practices of various Nations, and I object this evening to the inaccuracies in the Armenia section of the 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. 
   Originally, the State Department issued erroneous language about Armenia being an occupier of Azerbaijani territory and Nagorno-Karabakh, the report was substantively revised with more balanced, although still not fully accurate, wording and then revised again to restore the original inaccurate language. 
   I am deeply disturbed by the State Department's mischaracterization of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It is unprecedented and counterproductive to our government's goal of actively promoting constructive engagement in the peace negotiations of the region. It also sets a troubling example by allowing a foreign State, in this case Azerbaijan, to shape the assessments of our human rights report. 
   To assert that Nagorno-Karabakh is Azerbaijani territory or that Armenia occupies Nagorno-Karabakh and other territories is simply wrong. This version ignores the reality that the current conflict is about the self-determination of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   Like many other ethnic autonomous regions with the status of Oblast under  the Soviet Constitution, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh declared their independence. They then conducted a referendum as set forth in the same Soviet Constitution, and they are now an independent republic and should be recognized as a Nation, just like Azerbaijan, Armenia and any other former Soviet Republic. The situation has absolutely nothing to do with Armenia. The only role Armenia plays in this conflict is that country's part in peace negotiations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that Armenia is being characterized as an abuser of human rights in the region when it is Azerbaijan who continues to maintain a blockade of both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, and regularly threatens a new wave of violence against Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   Such misrepresentations will undermine our Nation's credibility as an impartial mediator and jeopardize prospects for successful peace negotiations. It could also have a negative impact on U.S.-Armenia relations. 
   Our common aim as a country should be to focus on workable diplomacy that brings parties together in the spirit of conflict resolution, not to cause additional tension by introducing new and controversial elements into an already complex negotiating process. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States has a long history of supporting Nagorno-Karabakh's democracy and its right to live in freedom and peace. The State Department has never made assertions in previous reports about Armenia being an occupier of Azerbaijani territory and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
   Last week, I sent a letter to Secretary Rice with my concerns over the State Department report's language, and I urged her to quickly reverse the State Department's mischaracterization.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the people of Armenia on the May 12 Parliamentary elections. This is the first positive assessment of an election in the former Soviet Republic since it gained independence in 1991. This encouraging outcome will most certainly enhance and deepen U.S./Armenia relations, while also elevating Armenia's reputation regionally and internationally. 
   Over the past few months, U.S. administration officials in Washington and Yerevan have stressed the importance of these elections and explained that substantial improvement must be made. Based on public preliminary reports, Armenia has fulfilled the test set forth by the administration and received a free and fair stamp of approval. 
   The International Election Observation Mission issued a statement which read, in part, and I quote, ``The election is assessed in line with OSCE and Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic elections and national legislation.'' 
   I'm especially pleased that the U.S. Embassy in Armenia joined the chorus of praise with its own assessment which reads, and again I quote, ``We  share the satisfaction of international observers that the election infrastructure, both legal and technical, has been greatly improved.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I join in sharing the pride of our embassy and the contributions we have helped make in advancing the course of democracy and the rule of law in Armenia. These results are the best evidence to date that our assistance to this fledgling Republic is indeed serving its intended purpose. Our shared values and the strong bonds between the United States and Armenia will no doubt continue to expand. In doing so, we will continue to foster democracy in Armenia and work towards stability in the South Caucus region. 
   Earlier this year, dozens of my colleagues joined me in sending a letter to the chairman of the House State, Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee calling for $75 million in assistance for Armenia in fiscal year 2008. As the appropriation process continues, I'd like to remind my colleagues of this request and renew it again today. This assistance demonstrates our commitment to Armenia, which is a friend and a supporter of U.S. policies for peace and security in that part of the world. 
   Armenia's achievement also addresses concerns expressed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation with respect to these elections. Armenia has met the necessary threshold, and I'm confident that the people and the Government of Armenia will only continue to improve upon their accomplishments in achieving the standards and norms of a democratic society. And accordingly, I urge the MCC to fully fund its compact with Armenia in an expeditious manner. 
   These elections are an historic step towards a fully democratic Armenia, a goal to which the nation has demonstrated its commitment and leadership in the region through democratic reform. I congratulate the people of Armenia for this remarkable accomplishment. 
   I would also like to enter into the Record a letter I sent with Congressman Knollenberg marking this achievement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Dingell. 
   I'm really pained when I listen to the last speaker and some of the comments that have been made on the other side, you know, calling this sincere effort by the Democrats, on a bipartisan basis with the Senate, to try to come up with something that we can get you on the other side of the aisle to support. You know, I heard words like ``baloney'' and ``bogus,'' and almost I think actual laughter. And it's a sad day when we laugh at this issue which is an issue of whether we're going to cover kids so that they don't have to go to an emergency room and can actually go to a doctor and get proper health care. 
   The Democrats, and this is again bipartisan where some Republicans and the Senate Republicans have gone out of their way to try to address the concerns that some of the Republicans have expressed, but the bottom line is that we can't change the fact that we want to cover additional kids, 10 million in total. 
   And when we know that the American people support this effort, what they support is covering more kids, those that are already eligible and not enrolled up to the tune of 10 million kids. Now, that's going to take $35 billion over 5 years. You can't get away from it. 
   And the President is saying, well, I can't support any new tobacco tax to pay for it; I'm going to pay for it out of the existing budget. Well, that's simply not possible. If you look at the budget, he's actually cutting Medicaid, and one of the things that this bill does is to stop those cuts in Medicaid so we can cover the kids that we have. 
   Now, we have tried very hard to address each of the three issues that the Republicans have raised, and the first one I'd like to talk about today is the issue of illegal aliens. There was never anything in this provision that allowed illegal aliens to be covered. We have made it absolutely clear in this new bill that that is the case and that they will not be covered. Anyone who suggests otherwise is just not being honest about this. 
   The second thing that we did, we tried to address the issue of adults. Single adults who are phased out after 2 years now under this bill will be phased out after 1 year, and even the parents, yes, they're also phased out I think over two or three years. So we're addressing that issue. 
   And then the third issue that was raised was the issue with regard to the income eligibility; and here, again, what we're saying is that if you go over 300 percent, okay, other than those that are already grandfathered into the program, you're no longer going to be able to cover those kids at that $82,000 or the other levels that they suggested. 
   Now, we've made an honest effort here to accomplish this, and all we're asking is that a few more of you come over to our side and join the Republicans in the Senate to vote for this legislation. This is an honest way to try to achieve a compromise that will allow us to cover these 10 million children. 
   Now, take this seriously. One of my colleagues said, well, this is Never, Neverland. This isn't Never, Neverland. We've had discussions with the Republicans. We've talked to you. Give us those votes so we can cover the kids.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I continue to be upset by the Republican characterizations of this bill as a ``pig'' or the effort to trivialize what we do here today. I think it's very unfortunate we have gotten to that point. 
   There have been a lot of distortions on the other side from the Republicans. But the one that I have to correct today is the continued mention of the fact that this bill is not going to cover 10 million children or that somehow the CBO has said it's not 10 million but it's 7.4 million. 
   What they have neglected to point out is that the difference are the kids that we are going to enroll under Medicaid, and CBO has emphasized that over and over again. There are 7.4 million covered by SCHIP, but the addition up to the 10 is essentially covered by Medicaid. And those are the lowest income kids of all. This bill does the best job of making sure that those low-income children who are eligible for Medicaid and not enrolled would, in fact, get insurance. 
   The Republicans continue to forget and eliminate the fact that this bill also addresses the Medicaid program. There are a lot of kids at the very lowest end, less than 100 percent of poverty, who are not enrolled in Medicaid because there hasn't been the proper outreach to get them enrolled. So what we are doing here is providing for that outreach. 
   So don't tell me we're not covering 10 million children. We are. And the ones you are not mentioning are the lowest income of all. 
   And then I heard my colleagues talk about the illegal aliens again. Once again, we have put in provisions here that you have to verify whether it's through the Social Security Administration or it's through documentation. Now, there is probably some person to come and misrepresent who they are. But the fact of the matter is that the CBO says in that letter that was introduced by the gentlewoman from Ohio into the Record that virtually no one that's on this program is an illegal alien. 
   The fact of the matter is that the Republicans continue these distortions. There are no illegal aliens. There are 10 million children covered.

   I just keep hearing inaccurate information on the other side of the aisle in an effort to try to sustain this veto, and it's simply not right. 
   First of all, this bill is totally paid for with a tobacco tax increase. Now, you may not like that if you don't like your tobacco taxed, but that's how it's paid for and it's a good way to pay for it. 
   Secondly, this idea that the President's alternative will not take kids off the rolls, that is simply not true. With the President's alternative, 800,000 children that are now covered by SCHIP will not have SCHIP anymore. 
   The President's veto of this bill was a slap in the face not only to this Congress but to the millions of children who, without this bill, will continue to be uninsured or, worse, lose the insurance they currently have. 
   And this is the truth about CHIP. Just listen up. The bipartisan CHIP proposal is supported by 72 percent of the American people, two-thirds of the Senate, the majority of the House, 43 State Governors, and more than 300 organizations nationwide. 
   The President is deluding himself if he doesn't think this veto is going to hurt millions of children; and unless we override, there are just going to be a lot of kids who simply cannot go to the doctor and would have to go to the emergency room. 
   What we sent to the President was a reasonable, bipartisan bill that would cover 4 million previously uninsured low-income children, most of whom are in working families, a total of 10 million. The vast majority of these kids are the very lowest income children who have no other options for care. 
   The President claims this bill covers rich kids, but it's not true. Senator Hatch who helped write this bill said 92 percent of the kids will be under 200 percent of the poverty level. 
   The President has also said that this bill opens the door to government-sponsored health care because it encourages families to drop their coverage. Simply not true. CBO said that that is not the case. 
   The best way to avoid crowd-out is to basically pass this bill. The problem is we continue to get inaccurate information from the other side of the aisle. 
   I would urge my Republican colleagues today to vote with their conscience, instead of with this misguided loyalty to the President who is out of touch with America's families. 
   Vote to override.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, a principal goal of this new Democratic majority is to make health care more affordable for all Americans, and that is the reason I rise in strong support of H.R. 4. This legislation will help lower prescription drug costs for our Nation's seniors and the disabled by simply repealing the provision inserted by the Republican majority into the 2003 law that prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating lower drug prices. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is a national embarrassment, in my opinion, that we have the tools to lower drug prices for America's seniors and the disabled and yet we do not utilize them. It is simply time for a new direction. This provision that we are repealing never made any sense, except to the pharmaceutical industry. 
   My colleague who is controlling the bill on the other side talked about reality and talked about irony. The reality is that this provision was inserted by the pharmaceutical industry, a special interest, because of their alliance  essentially with the Republican majority. And the irony is that that gentleman continues to talk about saving money when in reality we would save a tremendous amount of money by having this provision repealed. That savings, as Mrs. Emerson said, could actually be used to increase the quality of the program, perhaps by filling up the donut hole or doing other things that would make it possible for seniors to have even more access to prescription drugs at a lower cost. 
   Now, my Republican friends point to the fact that seniors may be receiving lower prices thanks to negotiations between private drug plans and drug manufacturers. But I will argue that significantly more savings could be achieved, and a majority of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, agree that the government should be given the choice to further lower drug costs through negotiations. 
   This is a no-brainer. Let us try it. It makes sense. Common sense alone tells us that the collective purchasing power of 43 million seniors will undoubtedly be a powerful bargaining tool in lowering drug costs. In their opposition to this legislation, Republicans and their special interest friends are using two arguments that are contradictory. First, they say price negotiations will have little impact in reducing drug costs; then they turn around and say we are killing innovation. 
   How can we kill innovation if our legislation has no chance of lowering drug costs? Both of these statements can't be true. In fact, both are false. The truth is these are the same worn-out scare tactics our Republican friends in Congress and the administration have used against us before. These scare tactics will no longer work in this House where the Democrats have the majority, and this new Democratic majority is moving forward with our promise to make health care more affordable and more accessible. 
   Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4. I know we have some Republicans joining us on this because it is simply common sense.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (OPPOSITION TO THE RENOMINATION OF ROBERT HOGLAND -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my concern this afternoon and my opposition, indeed, to the renomination of Robert Hogland by the Bush administration as U.S. Ambassador to Armenia. And I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, for his continued opposition to the nomination. 
   This makes no sense, Mr. Speaker. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee reviewed the nomination of Mr. Hogland, had hearings, asked extensive  written questions as followup in the last session of Congress, and it was clear that Mr. Hogland's nomination could not pass the Senate. In fact, could not even pass the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It was essentially sent back to the administration at the end of the lame duck session. And I am, frankly, surprised that the President has renominated Mr. Hogland under the circumstances. 
   The problem continues to be, on the one hand, that the administration has not offered any meaningful explanation of the reasons for firing the last U.S. ambassador to Armenia, John Evans. We all know the reason why Mr. Evans was terminated. It is because he articulated the fact that the Armenia genocide occurred. Historically. The U.S. policy has been to, basically, announce and accept the fact that the tragic events of the Armenian genocide occurred. But when anyone within the administration actually calls it genocide, immediately they are seen as a bad actor, and consequences follow from that. 
   And Ambassador Evans came to the United States. He was out in California. He was involved one afternoon or evening in a discussion about the tragic events that occurred between 1915 and afterwards, and he used the term ``genocide.'' It may sound like no big deal to anybody else, a historical fact that almost every government in the world recognizes, that the U.S. has historically acknowledged. But the very fact that he used that term incurred tremendous opposition from the Turkish Government. And from that day on, his days were numbered as the ambassador to Armenia, and eventually he was terminated and Mr. Hogland was nominated in his place. 
   Now, last session, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered Mr. Hogland's nomination. Mr. Hogland failed to adequately respond to the questions asked by the Senators and, I would add, this is on a bipartisan basis. This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue. This is on a bipartisan basis. The members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked him a number of questions and Mr. Hogland would not clarify the U.S. policies denial of the Armenian genocide. In many instances he did not respond to specific Senators' questions, and he diverted his answers by responding with what seemed like prepared talking points and went to extreme lengths to avoid using the term ``genocide.'' 
   Additionally, in response to a written inquiry from Senator John Kerry concerning Turkey's criminal prosecution of journalists for writing about the Armenian genocide, Mr. Hogland referred to these writings as allegations. 
   Now, let me say, the U.S. has historically taken a leadership role in preventing genocide and human rights. But the Bush administration continues to play word games by not calling evil by its proper name in this case. Instead, they refer to the mass killings of 1.5 million Armenians as tragic events. That term, Mr. Speaker, should not be substituted for genocide. The two words are simply not synonymous. There are historical documents that show that the genocide cannot be refuted. But somehow the Bush administration continues to ignore the truth in fear of offending the Turkish Government. 
   Now, again, I don't think that our Nation's response to genocide should be denigrated to a level acceptable to the Turkish Government. And it is about time that this administration started dictating a policy for Americans, not for a foreign government like Turkey. This lack of honesty, in my opinion, by the Bush administration is simply not acceptable. The American people and this Congress deserve a full and truthful account of the role of the Turkish Government in denying the Armenian genocide. 
   Now, let me just say one more thing before I conclude this afternoon, Mr. Speaker. There is no way, in my opinion, that Mr. Hogland is going to be confirmed because of his policy, because of the fact that he continues to articulate a policy of denial. And I fear, myself, that it would make no sense to send an ambassador from this country to Armenia who cannot articulate the genocide. So I simply ask that this nomination be opposed again in the Senate, and the Bush administration realize that it can't submit it, and that they simply withdraw the nomination.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (EXPANDING PROSPERITY BY PASSING THE COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, one of the best ways to expand prosperity for more Americans is to make college more affordable. Today, an education at a private university is close to $50,000 a year, and things aren't much better at public universities where prices have shot up 40 percent above inflation in the last 7 years alone. 
   This Democratic Congress has worked to eliminate some of the sticker shock. Last year we passed the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, which was the single largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill. But we are not done. 
   Today we will vote on the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, which will make college more affordable and accessible. The bill encourages colleges to rein in price increases and to provides consumers with helpful information so they can make the best decisions on which school to choose. 
   The legislation also simplifies the Federal student aid application process, expands college access and support for low-income and minority students, and increases aid for our veterans and military families. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's continue to strengthen our Nation's future by passing the College Opportunity and Affordability Act today.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (DEMOCRATS ARE WORKING TO ENSURE MORE CHILDREN HAVE HEALTH CARE; REPUBLICANS OBSTRUCT -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday both the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee began marking up a comprehensive bill that ensures that millions of vulnerable children have access to health insurance through the Children's Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP. Democrats are proud of this legislation because it allows us to cover almost every child now eligible for the program. 
   Since it was created a decade ago, CHIP has received strong bipartisan support here in Washington. But that all changed yesterday when Republicans in both committees used every tactic available to them to stall us from moving forward with this legislation. 
   It's sad that Republicans refuse to engage in a substantive discussion on the future of CHIP. If Republicans were serious about strengthening this important children's health program, they would stop playing games and would allow a constructive debate to occur. These delaying tactics show that Republicans have no interest in  ensuring our children have access to quality health care. 
   The record is clear. Democrats wants to cover kids; Republicans don't.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (IRAQ RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the debate taking place here in the House this week is long overdue. We are approaching our fifth year of this war. This is the first time Congress is debating the strategy President Bush wants to implement in Iraq. Congress can no longer stand on the sidelines, and the President has to know that to escalate the war in Iraq is not acceptable. 
   The President hopes this troop escalation plan will help secure Baghdad and reduce the sectarian violence that is ripping the country apart. But there is no evidence to support those hopes. In fact, on four different occasions, the President increased troop levels in Iraq, and every time these plans failed to calm the violence in Iraq. 
   Additional troops are not going to make a difference because there simply is not a military solution to the war in Iraq. The devastating sectarian violence is going to continue. But our troops should no longer be asked to serve as referees in a battle between religious sects that have been fighting for centuries.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (HONORING HRANT DINK -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Turkish Armenian journalist Hrant Dink. One year ago, Hrant Dink was brutally gunned down outside his office in Istanbul, Turkey by a self-proclaimed Turkish nationalist. The world lost a great human rights advocate and his tragic death was an attack on democratic ideals and values. 
   Dink was first charged with treason for upholding an irrefutable historical fact about the Armenian Genocide. He was convicted for his writings in 2005 for violating article 301, a law that makes it a crime to ``insult'' the Turkish state. This law continues today to be used to persecute, prosecute, and incarcerate those who attempt to exercise their universal human right of freedom of speech. 
   Mr. Speaker, Turkey uses intimidation to deny its citizens their right to freedom of expression. It lobbies for its so-called rightful role in the international community and a place in the European Union. Yet it does not live up to democratic principles and standards. 
   Hrant Dink is not the only one who has suffered from the consequences of this Turkish penal law. Anyone who refers to the events of 1915 for what they were, genocide, is targeted within Turkey. In addition, our own country is seeing the effects of this denial as Turkey continues to oppose human rights legislation condemning the Armenian Genocide here in this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I remain deeply concerned with Turkey's failure to adopt standards and practices of both domestic and international conduct that would reverse and overturn the climate of intolerance, prejudice, and repression, as exemplified by article 301 of the Turkish penal code. It was this penal code that precipitated Mr. Dink's murder.  
   Hrant Dink was guilty of nothing more than having the courage to defend freedom of the press and promote human rights and tolerance in Turkey. He was a man of conviction and principle who believed in democratic ideals and peaceful change. I urge Turkey to honor his name and repeal article 301.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. I thank the subcommittee Chair, the gentlewoman from Texas. 
   Let me say I appreciate the bipartisan support that this legislation has, and certainly the efforts, not only of Mr. Tim Bishop of New York, but of our chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the subcommittee Chair, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, for moving this legislation today. 
   Madam Chairman, our Nation's beaches are vital, not only to residents of our coastal States, but also for countless visitors who come to visit each year. America's beaches are a tremendous resource for those who come to enjoy them, and they are a huge economic engine for our coastal States. 
   In New Jersey alone, beaches are the primary driver of a tourism economy that provides nearly 500,000 jobs and generates nearly $36 billion in economic activities to the State each year. All summer long thousands of people flock to the beaches. 
   It's my intention to assure that these beachgoers that are there in New Jersey and elsewhere, that not only are they visiting clean beaches, but they are also swimming in safe waters. 
   Thanks to the BEACH Act, a law that I helped to author back in 2000, we have made major strides over the last 8 years. The BEACH Act of 2000 helped us improve water quality testing and monitoring of beaches across the country, which is critical to protecting the health of beachgoers. 
   The act has three provisions: one, requiring States to adopt certain EPA water quality criteria to protect beachgoers from getting sick; two, requiring the EPA to update these water quality criteria with new science and technologies to provide better, faster water testing; and, third, to provide grants to States to implement coastal water monitoring programs. 
   In New Jersey we used some of this grant money to become the first State in the Nation to launch a real-time Web site that notifies beachgoers of the state of our beaches. Essentially, this bill is a right-to-know piece of legislation. 
   Now, despite the actions New Jersey and other States have taken since the BEACH Act was signed earlier in the year 2000, this act must be improved. That's why I have introduced the Beach Protection Act of 2007. 
   This bill not only reauthorizes the grants to States for 2012 but adds to the annual grant levels from a total of $30 million to a new level of $40 million annually. 
   We also expand the scope of BEACH Act grants from water quality monitoring and notification to also include pollution source tracking efforts. The bill requires that beach water quality violations are disclosed not only to the public but all relevant State agencies with beach water quality authority. 
   I want to mention the rapid testing methods. This act calls for the use of rapid testing methods by requiring the EPA to approve the use of rapid testing methods that detect bathing water contamination in 6 hours or less. This is something that I have been advocating for the last couple of years. 
   Current water quality tests, like those used in New Jersey, only test for bacteria levels and take 24 to 48 hours to produce reliable results, during which time many beachgoers can be unknowingly exposed to harmful pathogens. More immediate results would prevent beaches from remaining open when high levels of bacteria are found. 
   The legislation also requires prompt communication with State environmental agencies by stating that all BEACH Act grant recipients make decisions about closures or advisories within 24 hours in order to ensure coordination in response to activities. 
   We are also requiring each State receiving grants to implement measures for tracking and IDing sources of pollution, creating a public online database for each beach with relevant pollution closure information posted, and ensuring the closures or advisories are issued shortly after the State finding that coastal waters are out of compliance, so, again, right to know, information to the public. 
   We are also holding States accountable by requiring the EPA administrator to do annual reviews of grantees' compliance with BEACH Act process requirements. The Beach Protection Act will strengthen current law by requiring States to use expedited testing. 
   This is a right to know for our beachgoers. It's very important, and I want to thank everyone on a bipartisan basis for supporting it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the crisis on Wall Street is a direct result of the Bush administration's refusal to properly regulate the financial industry. Unfortunately, Senator McCain is a strong supporter of deregulation. 
   In March, Senator McCain said, ``I am always for less regulation ..... I'd like to see a lot of the unnecessary government regulations eliminated.'' In May he told the Wall Street Journal, ``You are interviewing the greatest free trader you will ever interview, and the greatest deregulator you will ever interview.'' 
   Senator McCain even endorses extending the same kind of regulation that has created chaos in the financial industry to our health care system. In an opinion piece this month, the Senator writes, ``Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of State-based regulation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation can't afford another 4 years of Wall Street running amok. It's time for change, and that is not Senator McCain.

<DOCNO>Mr. PALLONE. (UNITED STATES-INDIA CIVIL NUCLEAR DEAL -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise to encourage my fellow Members of Congress to support the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Deal. Recently the 45 nations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group waived the ban on nuclear trade with India. This paved the way for Congress to act swiftly to pass the U.S.-Indian Civil Nuclear Deal into law. This agreement will reduce pressure on energy markets, benefits both nations' economies and strengthens the U.S.-India strategic global partnership. 
   It will bring positive benefits to both the United States and India. It will permit both countries to engage in shared civil nuclear research and development and commercial trade of technology and fuel while guaranteeing safeguards on all civil nuclear material. 
   Mr. Speaker, completion of this agreement will represent an important milestone in accelerating commercial and cultural ties between the American people and the people of India. But obstacles remain. We must work with the administration to ensure the agreement comes up for a final vote this year, before Congress adjourns. The United States has a significant strategic partnership with India. This civilian nuclear cooperation agreement is a critical component to building on that successful partnership. 
   The agreement strengthens energy security for the United States and India. By diversifying the energy markets and creating greater energy supply, the civil nuclear agreement promotes the development of stable and efficient energy markets in India. Expansion of U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation should, over time, lessen India's dependence on imported hydrocarbons, including those from Iran. 
   The nuclear agreement will also bolster both nations' economies. For the United States, the agreement opens up a major new market for technology exports and investment that is currently off limits. And it brings India into the global nuclear nonproliferation regime as a fully invested partner. India is committed to preventing proliferation from its civilian nuclear program and protecting against diversion of nuclear materials and technologies. 
   Finally, the civil nuclear agreement will provide the foundation of a promising U.S.-India alliance that will serve as a defense against terrorism and nuclear proliferation. The U.S. has an important stake in ensuring regional stability in South Asia, even as Pakistan continues to produce and test nuclear weapons without proper safeguards.  With uncertainty in Pakistan and the continuing influence of al Qaeda on the Afghanistan and Pakistan border, it is essential that India remain our strategic ally. 
   Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, I formed the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans in order to work for a stronger bilateral relationship between the United States and India. Today the world's two largest democracies have established a remarkable strategic partnership that can only be strengthened by civil nuclear cooperation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should all do everything we can to see that the U.S. civil nuclear agreement receives final approval in Washington so that the world can begin to benefit from its implementation and we can embark on a new era of U.S.-India relations.
