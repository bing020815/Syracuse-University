<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (EXTENSION OF PROGRAMS UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3352, a bill to temporarily extend programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. 
   We are at the final stages of completing the Higher Education Act, which we anticipate bringing to the floor for consideration of the conference report this week. 
   The bill under consideration today, S. 3352, will extend the programs under the Higher Education Act until August 15, 2008 to allow sufficient time for the Clerk to enroll the bill and send it to the President for his signature. 
   It has been nearly 10 years since the Higher Education Act was last authorized. I look forward to joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers in completing the work on the HEA on behalf of our Nation's hardworking families and students. 
   Let me take a moment to commend the leadership of the Education Committee on both sides of the Capitol and on both sides of the aisle and their staffs for working so hard and so diligently to bring this very important piece of legislation to the floor in a bipartisan fashion. 
   The conference report has virtually unanimous agreement, and it includes in it several very important areas that will move us forward on issues of access and affordability on behalf of our students. It simplifies the student financial aid application process. It strengthens the campus-based financial aid programs principally through strengthening the Perkins loan program. It improves access to higher education for veterans. It deals with the abuses that we all now know so much about in the student loan program by incorporating the provisions of the Student Loan Sunshine Act. It strengthens the role of creditors, cracks down on diploma mills, and it strengthens college prep programs such as the TRIO programs.     
   These are just some of the important and beneficial features of the Higher Education Act that are now working their way through the conference process. Once it reaches the floor, I urge my colleagues to support it and to participate in the speedy passage of this important legislation. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. We will hear today about how this bill will deny workers their fundamental right to a secret ballot. It sounds compelling but it's just not so. 
   Here is what the bill will deny: it will deny the employer the ability to veto a workforce's effort to form a union by virtue of majority sign up. Under current law, if a majority of workers sign cards indicating their support for a union, it is the employer, not the workers, who gets to choose if there is a secret ballot election. Under current law, therefore, if the employer doesn't like the result of the sign up process, he can, in effect, demand a do-over. How is this fair to workers? 
   Our bill places the power to choose to seek a union affiliation where it should be--with the workers, not with the management. If the majority of workers want a union--they get a union. 
   As a son of a union member, I witnessed firsthand the advantages of a unionized workforce. In fact I stand here today because of the protections my father's union afforded him, as they allowed him to provide for his family and send kids to college. 
   This bill will finally give workers the protection they need. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this straightforward legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I am joined in offering this amendment by Mr. Courtney and Ms. DeLauro of Connecticut. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Let me start by thanking Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for their work on this bill. I think it's a first-rate appropriations bill, and I particularly want to thank them for their efforts to fully fund Brookhaven Laboratory in my district. 
   This amendment is a very straightforward amendment. It would prohibit  any funds in this act from being used by FERC to advance the pending application of a floating storage and regasification unit known as Broadwater in the middle of Long Island Sound. 
   We offer this amendment for several reasons. Let me cite three. The first is that there are serious and debilitating environmental impacts associated with this project. Serious environmental concerns have been raised by the EPA, by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the United States Department of the Interior, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   The second is that there are significant safety and security concerns associated with this application, and even the Coast Guard, which would be charged with securing this facility, has indicated that a much more full public discussion needs to take place in order to determine who is going to provide that security and who will fund it. 
   Lastly, this is the only means available to me to represent my constituents. My constituents are overwhelmingly opposed to this application, to this facility, and yet current law vests in the FERC final authority to grant licensing for this project without any input from local government at all. 
   This is the only means by which I as a Member of Congress can exercise the will of the constituents I represent. 
   So I urge my colleagues to join me and Mr. Courtney and Ms. DeLauro in supporting this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to Mr. Courtney of Connecticut.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2768, the S-MINER Act. 
   Over the past year the Education and Labor Committee, of which I am a member, has held several hearings on the topic of mine safety. During those hearings, witness after witness asked that the Federal Government take stronger actions to protect the health and safety of miners. Hearing their call to action, we are here today to pass landmark legislation that will save the lives of countless miners. 
   H.R. 2768 builds upon the MINER Act to boost prevention efforts, improve emergency response and reduce health risks. The MINER Act, which passed during the last session of Congress in response to the Sago mining disaster, made important steps in protecting miners, but implementation has been slow, and more needs to be done. Sadly, since H.R. 2768 was introduced, miners have been seriously injured or killed while on the job. That is why it is crucial for this Congress to act now and pass this legislation. 
   This Congress has been entrusted with the responsibility to make sure that all workers are protected at their workplace. We take that responsibility seriously. And I am proud to support this bill which will take the necessary steps in safeguarding the health and safety of America's miners. 
   I want to thank and commend Chairman Miller for introducing this legislation and moving it so quickly to the floor. And I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2768.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank Congressman Israel for yielding, and I also thank him for organizing this special order, something I think that is long overdue. And let me also thank my friend and colleague from New York's Second Congressional District for his leadership role in the Center Aisle Caucus. 
   In a Congress that is, at times, bitterly divided along partisan lines, and that partisanship obscures the kind of discussion that we need to have on this issue as well as so many other issues, the Center Aisle Caucus stands for civility. It stands for honest and reasoned debate, and it stands for shared decision making. I say qualities that are often in short supply in this Chamber but qualities that are desperately needed, both in this Chamber and in our country. 
   Let me also start by offering my deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of Specialist James Lundin of Bellport in the First Congressional District, who also gave his life last week in Iraq. He represents, as you know, the 26th Long Islander to lose his or her life in the service of our great country in Iraq. His wake was today, and he will be buried tomorrow in Calverton National Cemetery. 
   And like you, Congressman Israel, I called his father on Monday, and I spoke with his father. And one of the things that struck me was the remarkable dignity with which he and his family were dealing with what has to be unspeakable pain. It is that kind of dignity that we need to honor in the way we do our jobs, and it is that kind of dignity that we need to bring to what will hopefully be a fruitful discussion of how we move forward in Iraq. 
   And, as I say, this kind of debate is a debate that must take place. It must be an honest debate; and it must be a debate that, above all, is absent in the often inflammatory and pejorative characterizations of those who offer differing views. And we all engage, at one time or another, in these inflammatory characterizations. 
   As you said, Congressman Israel, there is not a soul in this Chamber that does not support our troops. And, in fact, the evidence of that is over the course, the 4 1/2 year course of this conflict, the fact that with overwhelming bipartisan majorities we have consistently given the troops each and every dime that this administration has asked for them and in some cases increased the amounts of money that we will make available to them. 
   We all want us to succeed in Iraq, in Afghanistan. We may have differing versions or different interpretations of what constitutes success, but that, again, is the kind of debate that ought to take place in a healthy and vibrant democracy. 
   But the debate thus far has been compromised, as you and others well know, when those of us who think that a time line is something that we ought to seriously consider. When that time line is characterized as a surrender date, that obscures the kind of discussion that we need to have. 
   When those of us who believe that we must change course in Iraq, when that is characterized by the questioning of our patriotism, that obscures the kind of debate that we need to have. 
   When looking for time lines or looking for benchmarks or talking about the way in which we fund our troops is characterized as abandoning our troops, that's the kind of thing that obscures the kind of reasonable debate that we need to have. 
   And with respect to supporting our troops, my own view, and I think this view is shared by a great many in this Chamber, that the best way to support our troops is to put them in positions where they can succeed and get them out of positions in which they cannot succeed. And I think we all agree on both sides of the aisle that what has taken place thus far has put our troops in positions in which it has been very, very difficult for them to succeed. So that, if nothing else, motivates an impetus on the part of a great many of us to urge a change of course in Iraq. 
   I want to speak just for a second, Congressman Israel, about one of the shared principles. And, by the way, those shared principles are the kind of principles that all reasonable people should be able to embrace and support. But one is the issue of standing up the Iraqi security forces. It is a subject about which we have spoken in the past, and I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation that you have introduced, along with Chairman Skelton, that would create, in effect, a one-for-one exchange; that for each Iraqi brigade or battalion that we stand up, we would withdraw one of our own. 
   I think that that kind of approach has several advantages. One, it would be true to the goal that the President himself has set out, and I believe set it out as going as far back as January of 2004, that as the Iraqi stand up we will stand down. 
   Since January of '04, we have spent about $15 billion to train and equip and outfit Iraqi troops, and we have several hundred Iraqi troops right now in uniform under arms, and yet we continue to increase our own complement of troops. 
   I think it is a perfectly reasonable, sane, rational proposition that we impose obligations on the Iraqi troops; and as they step up to those obligations, we relieve our own troops of those obligations. 
   As I say, I think the legislation that you and Chairman Skelton have filed and that, as I say, I am proud to cosponsor, I think that that is very reasonable legislation. I hope to see that legislation receive the kind of debate and discussion and attention that it ought to. 
   We're not done yet. As you know, we have a report coming to us in September; and at that point the Congress is going to need to make another set of  decisions. Hopefully, that kind of reasoned response to a situation that none of us can support in terms of how it has gone thus far is the kind of direction in which we need to head. 
   So, with that, I'm happy to yield back to you.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I think it is, as I said before, a perfectly reasonable idea but also one that represents, I believe, an imperative. I think even the most ardent supporters of our presence in Iraq must recognize the enormous strain that a prolonged presence in Iraq has placed on our Armed Forces, and I believe the most ardent supporter must recognize that it will be enormously difficult, if not impossible, for us to maintain that presence at the current level or even at the presurge level. And thus if there is a chance of bringing order to Iraq, it must in the long term rest with Iraqi security forces as opposed to our own forces. 
   And as I say, we have spent $15 billion thus far, and I won't say we have little to show for it but we certainly don't have as much to show for it as I believe everyone in this Chamber would agree. So I think that of the shared principles, and I think they are all crucial and important, but I think this perhaps take prominence over all the others because if for no other reason, just the simple logistics of maintaining the troop presence we have given our current end strength is going to be enormously difficult, if not debilitating, on our Armed Forces.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank Mr. Israel for yielding. 
   I want to pick up on a comment that my friend from Connecticut just made with respect to how we should deal with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. You suggested that we bring those recommendations here and we discuss them and endorse them. And I think that the model is the 9/11 Commission. It was a bipartisan commission that issued a unanimous set of recommendations, which in the main we have acted upon here in this Chamber. The Iraq Study Group was a bipartisan group that issued a unanimous set of recommendations. And I believe that they are ones that we can galvanize around, and I believe that they make good sense. They perhaps don't give all of us everything that we would want on either side of the aisle, but they do represent a way to move forward. And I believe that if we were to bring those recommendations here, I believe they would attract majority support in this Chamber, and perhaps that could then be used as a means to moving with the administration, who I think now has also endorsed the recommendations of the Study Group. 
   Initially they seemed to reject them, or at least dismiss them, but I think now, as time has passed and as the situation on the ground has continued to evolve, they now recognize that they do have merit, that they do have legitimacy. And they also speak to several, if not all, of the shared principles that we are discussing here this evening that come out of the Center Aisle Caucus. So I thank you for making that suggestion, and hopefully we can carry forward with that.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I would certainly agree. And I think we all await General Petraeus' report. And I don't know General Petraeus, but I have been told that he is a man of absolutely rigorous and unimpeachable intellectual honesty and he will give us an honest, spin-free report, which I think is something that we all need and would value. But I also think sending that coalition of people, as you say, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, back to see on the ground conditions 9, 10 months after they wrote their report or 11 months after they wrote their report, I think would be enormously valuable and again perhaps would spur both the Congress and the administration to take their recommendations more seriously or give greater weight to them than we have thus far.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I just want to make two points. One, on the question of engaging Iran and others that we see as enemies or adversaries, you are quite right, Mr. Dent, that there is no guarantee of success if we do engage, but we can virtually guarantee no success if we don't engage. So it just seems to me that engagement is absolutely crucial. 
   I think I am quoting former Secretary of State Baker correctly when I quote him as saying that engaging in dialogue with our enemies is not appeasement. It is diplomacy and negotiation and dialogue, something I think we have had too little of. Hopefully we are moving in that direction now, and signs recently are that we are. 
   The second point I would make is that Iran has an awful lot at stake here. If, in fact, as a great many fear, Iraq becomes a haven for al Qaeda, I cannot imagine that Iran views an al Qaeda-Sunni dominated state on their borders as something that is in their best interests. So I think that they clearly do have in effect common interests with us in terms of bringing some order, some stability, to Iraq.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Country Reports on Terrorism  released by the State Department yesterday indicate that terrorist attacks increased by 25 percent last year, and more than 40 percent more people were killed. In these most dangerous times, this tells us we can't afford to take our focus off the global war on terror. Still, exactly 4 years after the President proclaimed mission accomplished aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, his failed Iraq policy persists in overextending our armed forces and in refusing to compel Iraq to take responsibility for their own security and future. 
   Today, when the President vetoes withdrawal provisions supported by a majority of Americans, he places another's obstacle in the way of what should be our priority mission, winning the global war on terror. We know the administration's stay-the-course policy in Iraq is a failure. We know it has taken our eye off the war on terror. 
   Now we have the numbers to back up that statement and the proof we need to stop the President from compounding this Nation's single greatest foreign policy mistakes. I encourage my colleagues to consider the hard and irrefutable evidence by the State Department, thereby advancing our withdrawal from Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (LIMITING USE OF FUNDS TO ESTABLISH ANY MILITARY INSTALLATION OR BASE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the H.R. 2929, which I voted for, and which overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives. This common-sense legislation limits the use of funds to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq or to exercise United States economic control over the oil resources of Iraq. 
   In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group released its recommendations for U.S. policy in Iraq. Included in those recommendations were two important provisions--the first advises the President against seeking permanent military bases in Iraq and the second encourages the Iraqi Government to take control of their own oil resources. 
   Accordingly, H.R. 2929 solidifies those recommendations and sends a very clear message to the Iraqi people that the United States is not an occupying force. The perception that the United States plans to keep a permanent military presence in Iraq and use its oil resources has only fueled the insurgency and violence against our troops. That has been exacerbated by President Bush's recent comments that our military presence in Iraq could extend 50 years into the future. In response, this legislation puts Congress on record opposing any permanent bases or attempts to control Iraq's oil revenues and helps take the target off our troops' backs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this war. I believe it is long past time to bring our troops home and end our involvement in this civil war. Although our withdrawal from Iraq will not happen tomorrow, this legislation is one way we can help put an end to our involvement today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act. I concede that the legislation we are voting on today is by no means perfect, but I do believe it is a step in the right direction and deserves the support of those Americans who want to bring this misguided and mismanaged war to a responsible and timely conclusion. 
   In an ideal world, we would bring our troops home today, but that doesn't match the reality of our struggle in Iraq. We have an even smaller chance of accomplishing that goal in the Senate. The bill before us represents the best opportunity to affect the conduct of this war. 
   The benchmarks established within the supplemental are the same as those proposed by the President in January, the Iraq Study Group, and endorsed by Iraqi leaders. They include real consequences for the Iraqi government and a definite timeline for a phased and deliberate redeployment of American combat forces from Iraq by no later than August 2008. The bill provides what is currently missing in the President's policies--a plan to redeploy our troops from a situation that cannot be improved by their continued presence. 
   It's unmistakable that our presence in Iraq has weakened our Armed Forces and jeopardized our standing in the world. It has also diverted valuable resources away from fighting al Qaeda in Afghanistan, tracking down Osama bin Laden, and preventing another terrorist attack against America. The supplemental not only provides a new direction in Iraq, but also redirects resources to fight the real global war on terrorism. 
   To all of those who argue that passage of this legislation would mean conceding defeat to the terrorists, I would say both that they are wrong, and that the alternative they endorse is unacceptable. For what they propose is simply ``stay the course,'' more of the same--more deaths, more life altering injuries, more destruction, more squandered opportunity, more debt, and more diminished standing in the world. This legislation is about sending a message to the President that he cannot pursue the same failed strategy of the past 4 years and receive a blank check from this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this war. I believe the decision to invade Iraq is the single most devastating and misguided foreign policy decision our Nation has ever made. I will vote for the supplemental because I believe it is the best course available to us at this time to bring our involvement in this misguided tragedy to an end.

   Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that our Commander in Chief is resigned to send another 21,500 of America's brave sons and daughters into battle again not ``with the Army you want but with the Army you have.'' 
   Although the Deputy Defense Secretary and Chief of Naval Operations told us in the Budget Committee last week that they will need another $5.5 billion just to fund the surge, apparently that is not enough to supply these troops with an adequate number of Humvees or training needed to achieve the mission. 
   Short-changing our heroes in the face of a relentless insurgency is unworthy of this Nation. If we cannot supply a surge, we must not escalate our presence. 
   Madam Speaker, let us resolve to make this year the year of transition out of Iraq that Americans have been waiting for. And let us make sure our policy never again falls short of measuring up to the valor and sacrifice of our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1142, which recognizes May 25, 2008, as the 26th National Missing Children's Day and urges everyone to do what they can to prevent the tragedy of a missing child. 
   In the late seventies, a succession of high-profile missing children's cases helped heighten the awareness and underline the seriousness of child victimization.     
   When Etan Patz went missing on his way to school in 1979, the first major national media campaign surrounding a missing child took place. The considerable media attention and comprehensive search helped highlight the problem of child abduction nationwide. 
   Etan's case and others helped expose a flaw in the system. At that time, there was no national response system in place to coordinate State and local cooperation or a central mechanism to support searching families. In 1983, May 25 was proclaimed National Missing Children's Day, and a nationwide movement was born. May 25 was chosen because it is the anniversary of Etan's disappearance. 
   More than 2,000 children are reported missing every day, but strides have been made to change this disturbing statistic. Programs such as the AMBER Alert Program, which notifies law enforcement officials and the public of child abduction cases, have done a lot to help return missing children to their families. To date, 329 children have been recovered because of the AMBER Alert Program. 
   Each May, we reflect on missing children and renew our efforts to reunite those young people with their families. National Missing Children's Day is an opportunity to remind families of the importance of maintaining up-to-date photographs of their children and to encourage everyone to give their full attention to the photographs and posters of missing children. Anyone can be a hero and offer the tip that helps return children to their families. 
   Protecting young children is one of our Nation's top priorities. On May 25 we will pause to remember the children whose lives have been lost, celebrate those who have been reunited with their families, and renew our efforts to continuing searching for children that are still missing. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for National Missing Children's Day, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to congratulate the Northern Kentucky University Norse women's basketball team for their victory in the NCAA 2008 Division II tournament. On March 29, women's basketball fans were treated to an exceptional game as Northern Kentucky University overcame a nine-point deficit, with 6 minutes remaining, to clinch its second national team title. The show-stopping 63-58 defeat over third-ranked North Dakota broke the Coyotes' 31-game winning streak. The Norse women's basketball team had been strong all season, but was unranked going into the tournament. By winning 10 of their last 11 games, they were able to prove that they should indeed be considered number one. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to coach Nancy Winstel, who returned to her alma mater to lead the team to an impressive 28-8 record in her 25th season as head coach. Coach Winstel has been involved with the women's basketball program for 30 years at NKU, and reached the 500-win plateau as a college coach 3 years ago. Assistant coaches Matt Schmidt, Danielle Zimmerman, and strength and conditioning coach Livey Birkenhauer round out the coaching team. 
   Congratulations are also in order for senior Angela Healy of Fort Thomas, Kentucky. Healy, a strong inside scorer and rebounder, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. During the final game she produced a double-double, scoring 14 points and grabbing 13 rebounds, to lead her team to victory. 
   The Northern Kentucky University women's basketball program is the only school in the State of Kentucky to win a national championship in a women's sport, and it now boasts two. The Norse women's basketball program is top notch, and the extraordinary achievement of this season is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the many  players, coaches, students, alumni, families, and fans that have cheered NKU along the way. 
   Winning the national championship and finishing the season with a 28-8 overall record has brought national acclaim to Northern Kentucky University. I know the fans of the university will revel in this accomplishment as they look forward to next season. 
   Mr. Speaker, I once again congratulate Northern Kentucky University for their success. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me begin, Mr. Speaker, by thanking Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for supporting this bill and helping to bring it to the floor so quickly. I have been proud to be the primary sponsor of this bill. I also want to thank Mr. McCotter of Michigan, who was the primary cosponsor of the bill on the Republican side. 
   The Family Medical Leave Act has been a great program for working families in this country since it was passed in 1993. No one can question the benefit it has provided for working women and men by being able to take time off from work to care for themselves or family members. 
   The original intent of the law was to provide for 12 weeks of unpaid leave if an employee has worked 60 percent of a full time schedule over the past year, which is about 1,250 hours. So in order to qualify for FMLA coverage, an employee has to have logged in 1,250 hours over 12 months to be eligible.     
   While 1,250 hours adequately reflects 60 percent of a full-time schedule for the vast majority of employees in this country, that equation does not work for flight attendants and pilots. Flight attendants and pilots work under the Railway Labor Act, rather than the Fair Labor Standards Act, which covers most nine to five workers. Time between flights, whether during the day or on overnights and layovers, is based on company scheduling requirements  and needs, but does not count towards crew member time at work. Flight attendants and pilots can spend up to four to five days a week away from home and family due to the nature of their job. However, all of those hours will not count towards qualification. 
   The courts have strictly interpreted the law and insisted that crew members must abide by the 1,250 hours for qualification, even though the intent of the law was 60 percent of a full-time schedule. Airline flight crews have been left out of what was intended to cover them. Therefore, a technical correction is needed to ensure that FMLA benefits are extended to these employees. This legislation seeks to clarify the intent of the law. 
   This legislation simply states that an airline crew member will be eligible for FMLA benefits if they have been paid for or completed 60 percent of their company's monthly hour or trip guarantee and have worked 504 hours. This brings these transportation workers in line with the intent of the original legislation and as promised when the law was passed. 
   Last month in our Education Committee we heard from Jennifer Hunt, a flight attendant for US Airways. Jennifer was denied FMLA coverage when she applied to take time off to care for her ill husband, an Iraq war vet. Jennifer, like many other flight attendants and pilots as well, unfortunately did not meet the hourly requirement. This bill corrects that oversight. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support and for bringing this legislation to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

I also want to thank the flight attendants for their tireless advocacy of their bill and the many long hours of work that they put in to secure approximately 240 cosponsors for this bill. I think the fact that we were able to generate so many cosponsors is a testament to the fact that this is a carefully and narrowly crafted bill that addresses an inequity that was never intended in the original law.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 3035, a bill to temporarily extend programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. At the beginning of February, the House took the next step in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in passing H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. Now we find ourselves in the final phase in completing the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act as we work towards a compromise bill with the Senate to ensure that the doors of college are truly open to all qualified students. 
   It is our goal to ensure that a final bill encompasses the major issues addressed in H.R. 4137, including skyrocketing college prices, a needlessly complicated student aid application process, and predatory tactics by student lenders. 
   The bill under consideration today, S. 3035, will extend the programs under the Higher Education Act until June 30, 2008, to allow sufficient time for final deliberations on the two bills reported out of the respective chambers. It has been nearly 10 years since the Higher Education Act was last reauthorized, and I believe Members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers are anxious to complete work on a compromise bill in this Congress, and we believe it can happen. 
   I look forward to joining my colleagues on the committee in completing this work with the respective members on behalf of our Nation's hardworking families and students. I urge my colleagues to support this extension. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week the White House recommended a veto of the defense authorization bill and said Congress wants to pay our troops too much for defending America. It is unconscionable to suggest our troops aren't worth a half percent more in pay, while many of their families scrape by on food stamps or pay for their own body armor. 
   Paying our troops what they deserve should go hand in hand with relieving them of taxes they don't deserve. That is why the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) and I introduced a bill last week to eliminate Federal taxation of student loan reimbursements to military personnel and Federal civilian employees. 
   Our bill, H.R. 2363, eliminates this tax and creates an incentive to help our Armed Forces compete with private sector recruitment and retention by lowering the soaring debt faced by college graduates. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we salute our troops and honor our fallen this Memorial Day, let's give them the pay raise they deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, HR 2831. Although women have made great strides towards income equality in the workplace, a gap still exists. According to the Census Bureau, women continue to make 77 cents to every dollar that their male counterparts earn. No one knows this fact better than Lilly Ledbetter. She worked hard at a Goodyear tire plant for 19 years. Initially, Ms. Ledbetter was paid the same as her male colleagues but over time her salary did not continue to rise at the same rate as male colleagues. However, like many employees, she was unaware of the discrepancy for years. By the time she discovered it, the Supreme Court said she was too late to receive justice, a finding that overturns 30 years of established case law. 
   The Supreme Court held, that the plaintiff must file suit within 180 days of the initial so called discrimination. This may seem like a reasonable amount of time, but for wage discrimination cases, this is often not feasible. Many employers forbid workers from discussing their salaries and employees are often not even aware that they have been discriminated against until after they leave their job. This finding stands in stark contrast with 30 years of case law, which has found that the 180 day ``clock'' starts anew with each discriminatory paycheck. This bill codifies by starting the clock for filing a discrimination charge starts when a discriminatory pay decision or practice is adopted, when a person becomes subject to the pay decision or practice, or when employees affected by the pay decision or practice, including whenever receive a discriminatory paycheck. 
   During her testimony in June at an Education and Labor Committee hearing, Lilly Ledbetter said:   
   What happened to me is not only an insult to my dignity, but it had real consequences for my ability to care for my family. Every paycheck I received, I got less than what I was entitled to under the law.   
   Sadly, Ms. Ledbetter's case is not unique, in fact from 2001-2006, some 40,000 wage discrimination cases were filed from workers, much like Lilly Ledbetter. This bill will finally give workers the ``what they are entitled to under the law''. 
   I thank Chairman Miller and my colleagues for bringing this legislation to the floor so quickly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Chairman, let me start by thanking both Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters and their staffs for working with us on this amendment. 
   Very simply, my amendment would make it easier for those who owned fixed-foundation homes on leased land to receive a reverse mortgage. Current law allows seniors who own fixed-foundation homes on leased land to receive a reverse mortgage only if the lease is for a term of not less than 99 years or if the lease is for a period of not less than 10 years beyond the maturity of the mortgage. While this language covers some seniors, many elderly Americans who own a permanent-foundation home in a senior community where the land is leased are not covered by either of these two categories of leases. 
   My amendment would remove the provision in the bill that allows for a reverse mortgage if the lease term is for 10 years beyond the maturity of the mortgage and replace it with language that both clarifies and expands eligibility. Specifically, my amendment would broaden eligibility to seniors who have a lease term that ends no earlier than a minimum number of years beyond their actuarial life expectancy. 
   This amendment is a commonsense solution to a problem that affects many seniors, both in my district and across the country; and I urge its adoption. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

I applaud our colleagues on the Energy & Water subcommittee for producing a bill that fully funds some of this nation's most important basic research under the Office of Science. 
   In particular, I commend chairmen Obey and Visclosky, ranking member Hobson, and my fellow Long Island colleague, Mr. Israel, for their tireless support of ground-breaking research conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
   I'm proud to represent BNL and the talented scientists who keep our nation at the cutting edge of basic research with projects like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which helps scientists unravel the big bang theory to explain the origins of our universe. 
   Fully funding this research will avert the same kind of uncertainty that threatened to derail it last year. Preserving BNL's status as a leading research institution will hopefully result in more decisions like yesterday's announcement that BNL will be the permanent home of the NSLS II, which uses intense light for x-ray imaging. 
   I also want to commend the committee for allocating $7 million for the Fire Island to Montauk Point project, which would protect 83 miles along Long Island's south shore.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have many good things to say about this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, but let me focus on a couple of quick things. 
   First, it is a long overdue and much-needed infusion of support for Federal need-based financial aid programs. It raises the Pell Grant maximum from $4,310 to $5,200 over a period of years. It increases the Federal capital contribution for the Perkins loan program, a program, by the way, that this administration seems intent on killing, and it increases loan limits so that students will have access to greater support. 
   In doing all of those things, we help students avoid what has become termed the ``wild west'' of student lending, that is, the private loan market. We have driven students to the private loan market because we have not properly supported the programs that currently exist. And with these increases, we will be properly supporting those programs. 
   And lastly, the reduction in the interest rates has been characterized by the other side as not affecting access or affordability and, in fact, it does. Students make decisions about the schools that they are going to attend by virtue of their anticipated indebtedness, and we address that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment of the ranking member, and I urge its defeat, and I urge our colleagues to vote in support of the underlying bill. I do so for several reasons; but before I talk about that, I would like to talk about some of the things that I have heard here today in the debate that disturbed me greatly and I think require being addressed. 
   First is that I believe the ranking member, I am going to paraphrase him, but I think correctly said that we just can't help ourselves; that if you give us an opportunity to spend money, we are going to spend it. And I would rephrase that, and I would say that, we just can't help ourselves. If you give us an opportunity to solve a problem, we are going to solve it, and we are going to do so in a fiscally responsible way. And the problem that we are trying to solve with this underlying bill is diminished access and affordability to higher education, a problem which, if we leave unaddressed, is going to have a very serious consequence in terms of our future and in terms of our security. And we are addressing this problem, as I say, in a fiscally responsible way. It will not cost the taxpayers one dime. 
   I have also heard a great deal of talk about how we are not addressing the issue of entitlement spending and how we are creating nine new entitlements. Our mandatory budget represents about 60 or 70 percent of the total expenditures of this Nation, and it includes a number of so-called entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the national debt. And I would point out that, of all these programs, only one is truly mandatory, and that is interest on the national debt. And that number has ballooned over the last 6 years under the watch of the then majority when they controlled every lever of power in this town. 
   Fiscal year 2001, interest on the national debt was $200 billion a year. Fiscal year 2007, interest on the national debt is $265 billion a year. And the total debt has grown by $3 trillion. 
   So I would simply say that it rings hollow to hear a lecture on fiscal responsibility and to be told that we are behaving in a way that is injurious to the American taxpayer when in fact our behavior is the antithesis of the behavior that has held sway this House for the last 6 years. 
   Now, with the amendment here is what we would not get if we were to pass Mr. McKeon's amendment: We would get no reduction in interest rates, a condition that would influence students' decisions to attend colleges. There would be no increase in the Federal capital contribution for the Perkins loan program. I will repeat; this is a loan program that this administration is trying earnestly to kill in what is a terribly ill-advised move. 
   There is this notion out there that the Federal capital contribution for Perkins will increase availability of Perkins loans. And to correct a common misperception, the Perkins loan program is not duplicative of the FFEL program or of the Direct Lending program. In fact, a great many students borrow from both programs. There would be no investment in cooperative education, a program that exposes students to the world of work and help enriches their college experience. There would be no investment in placing a highly qualified teacher in every classroom, something that we absolutely must do if we are going to make the advances on the K-12 level that we simply must make, the advances that were contemplated by the No Child Left Behind legislation, advances that we now have the opportunity to put in place. And there would be diminished opportunity for students who are needy to pursue careers in public service and in  not-for-profit. We cannot have a condition in which students choose their career based on their indebtedness, and this underlying legislation will address that. 
   So I believe that the College Cost Reduction Act is, as I said before, long overdue, much needed and will address some very serious concerns that currently confront college students and their families, and will do so in a fiscally responsible way. And I urge its passage, and I urge defeat of the amendment by Mr. McKeon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, during the most recent vote to extend the Higher Education Act, I stood in this very spot and expressed my hope that during the next session of Congress, under a new majority, we would again address the needs of America's college students and make it this time about increasing access and affordability. Madam Speaker, that hope is now being realized. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. This important legislation cuts interest rates for subsidized student loans in half, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over 5 years. In my home State of New York, students will save an average of $4,500 over the course of their loan once the 3.4 percent interest rate takes effect. This reduction of the student interest rate will save millions of college students thousands of dollars, and it will help the estimated 4.4 million high school graduates who will be prevented from attending college this year because of financial barriers. 
   It is important to note that all of the changes proposed here today are accomplished under this Congress' new PAYGO rules and are done without harming students' access to loans. In addition, all but one of the offsets included in the bill have been proposed by either the former Republican majority or by the President himself.  
   Madam Speaker, during the 109th Congress this Chamber chose to cut $12 billion out of the student loan program. These cuts, coupled with no increase in the Pell Grant maximum for 5 years, have sent a message to America's students that they are no longer among this Nation's top priorities. Today the message we send to students is loud and clear: We in this Congress are dedicated to helping you achieve the dream of a college education. 
   The changes we make here today are just a first step in a series of proposals that will make it easier for students and their families to afford college. As we move forward with the long overdue reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, I hope to see an increase in the maximum Pell Grant, simplification of the FAFSA, and an increased investment in campus-based aid programs. These changes are all part of an effort to narrow the expanding gap between the amount of available student aid compared with the cost of attaining a college education. 
   As a former college administrator, I know firsthand the beneficial impact this legislation will have for needy students and their families who are working to help their sons and daughters realize their slice of the American Dream.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act. 
   I represent part of Suffolk County, New York, where over 20 Head Start and three Early Head Start centers have been serving the community since 1966. I am also proud to say that my wife's first teaching job was as a Head Start teacher, and that she remains today an early childhood teacher. 
   Parents, teachers, and many of my colleagues can all agree that Head Start is one of our Nation's most prominent and successful early education programs. This bill continues to build on Head Start's success by ensuring that kids are prepared for school, by improving teacher and classroom quality, strengthening the focus on school readiness, increasing accountability, and boosting coordination. 
   Research has found that children who attend Head Start enter school better prepared than their low-income peers who do not attend the program, and that children who do attend Head Start make significant learning gains. 
   If we are serious about achieving the goals set forth by NCLB, then passing Head Start reauthorization is a down payment on achieving these goals. 
   I was proud to offer an amendment during the Education and Labor Committee's consideration of this bill to allow Head Start programs to use up to 10 percent of their quality improvement funds for transportation costs. This amendment was in response to concerns brought to me by my constituents, as many Head Start programs are being forced to choose between providing transportation to children or sacrificing the quality of their program. This is a decision that no Head Start program should have to make. 
   With this amendment, and with so many other worthwhile improvements to Head Start, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this balanced reauthorization for the benefit of our children and future generations of Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2693, the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act. Millions of Americans enjoy the convenience of microwave popcorn. However, few are aware that those bags of popcorn may contain diacetyl, an artificial butter flavoring and a deadly chemical when inhaled in high levels. 
   You earlier heard about Eric Peoples from Chairman Woolsey who worked at the Jasper Popcorn Company. Mr. Peoples has the debilitating disease of popcorn lung and as a result has only 24 percent of his lung capacity. Everyday activities are no longer possible for him. 
   Another worker at the Jasper Popcorn Plant, Linda Redman, started working at the plant in 1995. Within 2 years, her breathing was so impaired that she had to quit. I believe that Eric and Linda's pain may have been prevented if OSHA had acted to issue a standard to limit workers' exposure to diacetyl. OSHA has still failed to issue a standard, even though it was some 7 years ago that it was determined that worker illnesses were related to the chemical diacetyl. 
   H.R. 2693 is a simple bill. It requires OSHA to issue an emergency interim standard within 90 days to protect workers at popcorn and flavoring manufacturing plants to minimize diacetyl, and it requires OSHA to then issue a final standard within 2 years. An emergency standard will help protect the thousands of workers who come into contact with diacetyl every day. The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, the leading industry association for the flavoring industry, recommended similar actions as far back as 2004. 
   The simple and sad truth is that OSHA has failed to do its job, and thus in this case Congress must act to protect workers. These workers deserve a safe workplace. 
   As Eric Peoples said, ``I played by the rules. I worked to support my family.  This unregulated industry virtually destroyed my life. Please don't let it destroy the lives of others.'' 
   So I ask Members to join me in promising that we won't stand by and let this industry destroy the lives of others. Let's pass H.R. 2693.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   The chairman's mark is $6.9 billion above the fiscal year 2008 enacted level for education and $7.1 billion above the President's request for education. And as a member of both the Budget Committee and the Education Committee, I am proud of that. And I think all of our colleagues should be proud of that. Mr. Etheridge just talked about the 47 programs that the President's budget cuts but that this budget resolution restores. I want to talk about just three of them. 
   The President's budget resolution or proposal cuts $750 million out of the SEOG program, the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, fully eliminating the program. And it also eliminates the Perkins Loan revolving fund another $750 million. That is $1.5 billion on an annual basis taken out of the student loan delivery system. And that completely undercuts what this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, passed and enacted into law this fall when we passed the College Cost Reduction Act. So the Congress has gone on record as saying that the Federal Government needs to take a larger role in supporting student financial aid programs. And the President is ignoring that and, in fact, pushing us in the opposite direction. We need to push back and continue to fund those programs. 
   And the other is the Perkins Vocational Education program, $1.2 billion, that the President again recommends be eliminated. These are job training programs. And at a time when we are hemorrhaging jobs, and at a time when we need to remain competitive globally, to take away job training programs makes absolutely no sense. 
   So I am proud that the budget resolution addresses these three vital areas. I am hopeful we will be able to appropriate the moneys to keep these funds going. And I thank the chairman for his leadership on this and many other important issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I also thank her for her leadership on this very important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, a congressional override of this Presidential veto is absolutely imperative to ensure the safety and viability of our Nation's water infrastructure. 
   For the President to veto this legislation under the guise of fiscal responsibility is hypocritical at best. The tab for the President's endless war in Iraq is now in excess of $600 billion and counting. Just the interest on the amount we have borrowed to fund the war is $25 billion per year, an amount that exceeds the authorized level of this legislation. This veto is a stark reminder that the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on the war in Iraq has been at the expense of pressing priorities here at home. 
   In the 5 years since the war began, over $45 billion has been spent on restoring the infrastructure in Iraq. This is double the $23 billion price tag a bipartisan majority of Congress seeks now to address a 7-year backlog of much-needed projects.     
   When it comes to domestic priorities, the President has decided against investing in America. He has vetoed expanding health care for children, he has vetoed research for life-threatening diseases, he has vetoed benchmarks for Iraq, and has threatened vetoes on investments ranging from education to law enforcement. Are these vetoes the priorities of America, or are they the misplaced priorities of an administration hopelessly out of step with the American people? 
   Mr. Speaker, the Water Resources Development Act benefits all Americans and their families who use and enjoy our Nation's waterways. My district benefits from the good work that the Army Corps of Engineers does for coastal communities by helping small towns deal with multiple concerns ranging from erosion to longstanding environmental challenges. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1495 will go a long way towards supplying the Corps with the resources it needs to protect coastal communities by modernizing project planning and approval. We simply cannot afford to let another year go by without passing this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (PAYING THE PRICE FOR THE PRESIDENT'S FLAWED PRIORITIES -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, at least President Bush is consistent. Like the other seven budgets that he has submitted to this Congress, it is no surprise that his eighth and final request continues to reflect spectacularly flawed priorities. There was some debate earlier this week about whether the budget should be printed and distributed to congressional offices. Perhaps the best decision would have been to spare us the books and save the trees. 
   For the eighth year in a row, the administration has degraded the budget process. This budget barely goes through the motions. Instead of formulating a blueprint to guide this Nation toward what should be our fiscal priorities, the budget continues the flawed policies of the past 7 years. 
   Without putting forth an honest or straightforward budget, the President has yet to attempt seriously to meet our goals, goals that we should all share of budgetary accountability, enforcement, and fiscal responsibility. This is why so many of our colleagues, Madam Speaker, have already accurately described the President's budget request has a pro forma document with little meaning or relevance, that has also been described as arriving on Capitol Hill ``dead on arrival,'' and that is perhaps a very, very good thing. Perhaps the lack of truth in budgeting represents the best example of why ``change'' has become the overriding theme of this coming election. 
   This Congress should refuse to be misled again by a budget that hides the true costs of the devastating fiscal policies of this administration. For example, omitting total war costs gives an artificially deflated notion of what the deficit will be, and we now have the Secretary of Defense estimating that the true cost of the war in fiscal 2009 will be $170 billion, as opposed to the $70 billion that is put in the budget as a placeholder. That number alone will drive the deficit up to over half a trillion dollars. The President's budget also omits the cost of extending the tax cuts, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which disproportionately favor those who need those tax cuts the least. 
   Let me just cite two very troubling aspects of a budget that is shot through with scores of troubling aspects. The first is one that is of particular importance to my home State of New York. We have been fighting, those of us in New York, and this fight has been led primarily by CAROLYN MALONEY and also VITO FOSSELLA and JERRY NADLER, to see to it that the brave Americans who responded to the site of the World Trade Center, first to try to rescue people, then to recover bodies and then to clean up what came to be known as ``the pile,'' some 70 percent of them are suffering from various health ailments relating to the toxins that they were exposed to in the days immediately following those attacks on the Twin Towers. 
   In the current year, the Congress committed to spend $150 million to provide for the ongoing health care needs and monitoring of those very brave first responders and rescue workers. The President's budget cuts that number to $25 million. 
   My question for the President is: Have all of these people all of a sudden become well? Have they been miraculously cured? Or, more likely, has the President simply decided that providing health care for these very brave Americans is simply not a Federal responsibility? In either case, I certainly hope that this Congress will do the right thing and restore that funding. 
   The second has to do with education, particularly access to higher education. In his State of the Union message, the President chided the Congress for not having fully funded his American Competitiveness Initiative. Yet we are now presented with a budget that eliminates two programs for student financial aid that are absolutely crucial for needed students to attend college. One is called Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, approximately $750 million a year, and the other is Perkins loans, approximately $670 million a year. For those two programs, the President advocates taking approximately $1.4 billion out of the student loan program, and does so while costs are rising and the ability of students to pay is declining. 
   How can we have a competitive workforce, how can we have a competitive Nation, if we don't even provide our young men and women with access to college? 
   Future generations of Americans will pay the price for the President's flawed priorities and more debt as a consequence of his actions. In fact, the debt that will be accrued over the 8 years of the Bush Presidency will amount to some $3.5 trillion. That is an amount that exceeds the combined debt of all of the Presidents from George Washington through the first President Bush. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, I implore my colleagues, to resolve one last time to defeat this budget request from the President and to restore middle-class, mainstream priorities, the very priorities that our new majority has been working on now for the last year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, after watching last night's Presidential address, I must question whether or not our President actually listens to anyone besides the same neoconservative ideologues who are the architects of the fiasco in Iraq and who have insisted that victory in Iraq is just around the corner. 
   Clearly the President is not listening to his top generals on the ground who have expressed doubt in the President's call for a surge in troops; nor is he listening to the advice of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which has called for a redeployment of troops and additional training for Iraqi security forces; nor is he listening to the Iraqi people, 78 percent of whom say the presence of American troops is adding to, rather than controlling, the violence. 
   Most importantly, the President isn't listening to the American people, who sent a clear message last November that his policies in Iraq aren't working, and that a change of course is needed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the President's plan to escalate this war. I believe the solutions to the problems in Iraq are political ones. And I will support my colleagues in using the constitutional authority vested in the Congress to control our future involvement in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 306, expressing our condolences to the victims and the families involved in the tragedy which occurred this week at Virginia Tech University. 
   April 16 brought terrible loss to all Americans and particularly to those who are part of a college or university. The nearly 30 years I spent working on a college campus were some of the most fulfilling of my life. I know how much a campus can become a community and the people within it, a family. In some ways, a campus is a haven--of learning and growth--in which students feel safe and free to pursue their dreams and aspirations. To young Americans, a campus is among the last places where such horrific fears could be realized. 
   When we look back on what occurred this week at Virginia Tech, we will honor those whose lives were taken and those who gave their lives to protect others. We will remember that we can never safeguard against every threat. Still, we can take steps to protect the precious communities in which we live. We must do more to ensure that lethal weapons do not fall into the wrong hands. We must equip campuses and cities with adequate emergency communication systems, so that critical information gets out in time. 
   In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, we stand with the friends and family members around the world who lost loved ones on that tragic April morning in Virginia.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman OBERSTAR and Ranking Member MICA, as well as Subcommittee Chairwoman JOHNSON and Ranking Member BAKER and the committee staffs for their hard work and leadership on this important legislation--the first water improvement and conservation package in seven years. 
   Following several earlier impasses, I want to take this opportunity to commend the spirit of bipartisan and bicameral compromise on this important measure. 
   This bill benefits all Americans and their families who use and enjoy our Nation's waterways, public beaches--including over 300 miles of coastline along my district--and for U.S. businesses that depend on healthy and viable waterways throughout the country. 
   My district benefits from the good work that the Army Corps of Engineers does for coastal communities by helping small towns deal with multiple concerns ranging from erosion to longstanding environmental challenges. WRDA will allow the Corps to continue work on several projects on eastern Long Island that will protect the TWA Flight 800 Memorial, restore the quality of the Long Island Sound watershed, protect the famous Montauk Lighthouse, and continue environmental monitoring of the Atlantic coast of Long Island. 
   In addition, H.R. 1495 will go a long way toward supplying the Corps with all the resources it needs to protect coastal communities and vacationers by modernizing project planning and approval.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report. We can be proud that this budget finally produces a vision for our future that reflects our hopes and dreams and the promise of economic prosperity and security in the years ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to call upon my leadership to address an urgent need in my district that is affecting other areas across the country as well. 
   Two weeks ago, the cap on H-2B immigration visas for seasonal workers was reached. Consequently, many family-owned businesses that depend on such employees will be without the workforce they need to stay in business. 
   I support raising the cap on H-2B visas permanently and incorporating this change into broader immigration reform. Regrettably, partisanship blocked reform in the Senate last year. We must resolve to enact these smaller scale remedies we can agree upon today to alleviate the burden our broken immigration system imposes upon businesses as we continue to address economic and security challenges required to enact broader reform. 
   In the absence of such a consensus, and although I would prefer a vote on broader reform, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act and related measures that would relieve business owners of the immediate threat caused by the freeze on H-2B visas. We cannot leave small businesses that want to do the right thing with the unacceptable choice of going out of business or hiring illegal workers.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding me this time. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act. I represent the majority of Suffolk County where 20 Head Start and three Early Head Start centers have been serving the community since 1966. In fact, my wife's first job out of college was as a Head Start teacher in one of those centers. 
   Parents, teachers and many of our colleagues can all agree that Head Start is one of our Nation's most prominent and successful early education programs. This bill continues to build on Head Start's successes by ensuring that kids are prepared for school, by improving teacher and classroom quality, strengthening the focus on school readiness, increasing accountability and boosting coordination. 
   Research finds that children who attend Head Start enter school better prepared than low-income children who do not attend the program, and that children who attend Head Start make significant gains. 
   If we are serious about achieving the goals set forth by No Child Left Behind, then passing Head Start reauthorization is a down payment on achieving those goals.     
   During the markup of this bill, I was proud to offer an amendment that would allow Head Start programs to use up to 10 percent of their quality improvement funds for transportation costs. This amendment was in response to concerns brought to me by my constituents that many have thought programs were being forced to choose between providing transportation to children or sacrificing the quality of their program. 
   With my amendment and so many other worthwhile improvements to Head Start, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this balanced reauthorization for the benefit of our children and future generations of America.

   I rise today in recognition of the 150th anniversary of San Jose State University. San Jose State University was established in 1857 as Minns Evening Normal School, for the sole purpose of training teachers, as California's population grew.

   San Jose State is an extremely diverse school, with an enrollment of 23 percent of its students being Asian, 15 percent of its students being Hispanic, and 5 percent of its students being African American. This diversity has also led San Jose State to rank 10th in the Nation in total number of graduating minorities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 709, a resolution to recognize and honor the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum on October 9, 2007. 
   Sam Rayburn is a legend to many of us in this House, having served as Speaker of the House for a record 17 1/2 years. Born Samuel Taliaferro Rayburn, he served the people of Texas as an elected official for 55 consecutive years. Sam Rayburn spent 48 years here as a Member of Congress from the Fourth District of Texas and also served in the Texas House of Representatives. He was perhaps destined to become the Speaker of the House because he certainly had the experience for it. Prior to coming here, he was also the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives and he served as Speaker of this House on three different occasions: from 1940 to 1947, from 1948 to 1953, and then again from 1955 until his death in 1961. 
   During Speaker Rayburn's time of service to this great Nation, he presided over the enactment of the Marshall Plan, expansion of Social Security, and passage of the first pieces of major civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. 
   Throughout the House campus, we have an array of memorials to the Speaker. The largest House office building which houses Members and committee offices is the Rayburn House Office Building built in 1965. His likeness stands in the entrance to that building, and there is also the Rayburn Room, which has hosted many negotiations and meetings across from the House floor. 
   Texas has also honored its native son with the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum, located in Speaker Rayburn's hometown of Bonham, Texas. It recently had its 50th anniversary and is celebrating the completion of phase one of the museum's restoration program. This restoration program will help protect the valuable collections stored at the library. 
   This anniversary year has been a busy one for the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum. In January, it hosted the annual celebration of Speaker Rayburn's birthday and has featured three new exhibits. The Sam Rayburn Foundation also honors high school seniors from the Speaker's home of Bonham and Fannin County. 
   Speaker Rayburn, despite his busy congressional schedule, was actively involved in every step of his library's planning, construction, and dedication. The library and museum was his way of paying tribute to the people of Fannin County. This resolution also honors the supporters and contributors who have helped make this library such a success. 
   I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this resolution, and I urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 4153, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act Technical Amendments, makes a number of technical changes to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in order to ensure that the Department of Education and other relevant stakeholders reflect congressional intent when implementing the law. 
   Mr. Speaker, during this Congress we have made significant commitments to our Nation's students and families by putting resources in the hands of those who need them most. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act, as passed and signed by the President, does more to help Americans pay for college than any effort since the GI Bill, at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Specifically, the legislation provided a landmark investment of $20 billion in additional funding for Pell Grants, reductions in the interest rate on student loans, and the creation of programs to help students manage debt, as well as encourage individuals to pursue public service. Providing this critical funding is a large part of our efforts to increase access and affordability to higher education. 
   Our work on reforming and strengthening higher education is not finished for this Congress. I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the rest of the Education and Labor Committee on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which we are set to mark up in committee tomorrow. 
   The technical amendments contained in this bill include: ensuring that the mandatory Pell funding is available for the full award year, which is the current fiscal year and the following fiscal year, to match the availability of discretionary Pell funding. 
   It clarifies the definition of untaxed income and benefits to ensure that it does not include those items in the calculations that were removed from the list under the College Cost Reduction Act. 
   It clarifies that students who were in foster care anytime after age 13 are independent for purposes of calculating eligibility for Federal student aid. 
   It clarifies that married borrowers' income-based repayment payments shall be determined solely on the individual borrower's loan information and the individual's income without considering spouse's income or any loan debt they may have if the married borrower files taxes separately. 
   It ensures that members of the National Guard who are serving full-time are considered active duty for purposes of student loan deferment benefits. 
   It conforms language in the TEACH grant program to ensure appropriate implementation. 
   And it moves the funds provided to HBCUs and MSIs to title III of the Higher Education Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, swift passage of H.R. 4153 will ensure that students and families will fully benefit from the program's funding and intent provided in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this provision. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee and also of the subcommittee for working together so quickly and so cooperatively to bring this legislation to the floor. It is very badly needed, and the passage of it will allow us to expand upon the gains that this Congress has made in the dual goals of access and affordability. And let me just quickly reflect on those. 
   We have significantly reduced student loan interest rates. We have significantly increased the Pell Grant maximum. We have overridden the administration's recommendation to eliminate the SCOG program. We have overridden the administration's recommendation to eliminate the Perkins Loan program. We have done all of this on a bipartisan basis, and we have done all of this with a focus on keeping student need and student interests uppermost in our mind. 
   There are several very positive features of this bill. Let me talk just about three of them. The first is seeing to it that we maintain liquidity in the student loan market, a situation that is forced upon us by factors that have nothing to do with the Student Loan program. The second is the increase in loan limits on an annual basis. The most important element of this is that it will reduce student reliance on private lending, and that certainly is a goal of ours, to see to it that students have access to government regulated loans as opposed to private loans. And, lastly, the easing of the repayment requirements for the parent loan will be enormously helpful to needy families and the students of those families. 
   So I again want to commend leadership on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol for working so quickly on this. I want to commend the Education Department and the administration for their willingness to be supportive, and I urge speedy passage.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise with profound sadness to recognize a fallen marine from my district, Lance Corporal Jordan Christian Haerter who was only 19 years old when he was killed in Iraq last week.  
   Lance Corporal Haerter was from the small Peconic Bay community of Sag Harbor, New York, and is the village's first war casualty since World War II. He is the 30th of our brave troops from Long Island, and the eighth constituent of mine, who has fallen in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Lance Corporal Haerter had been in Iraq for only a month when he died a hero while defending a checkpoint in Ramadi. He was killed while firing at the driver of an enemy truck full of explosives that was running a barrier and about to crash into dozens of his fellow marines. His noble sacrifice was honored earlier this week when hundreds of Long Islanders paid their respects outside the Old Whalers Church in Sag Harbor. They remembered his youth, his love of the Marine Corps, and his determination to be the best marine he could be. He was always faithful. 
   On behalf of New York's First Congressional District, I extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. Their loss will never be forgotten, and we will always remember Jordan's noble sacrifice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I want to thank my colleague and friend from New Jersey for introducing this important legislation, and I wish to commend Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Johnson for their leadership in moving this bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is extremely important to my district, which is bordered by water on three sides. Each year, many of my constituents and millions of other Americans are sickened by swimming in water contaminated by sewer overflows. This inadequately treated sewage is filled with bacteria and viruses. 
   Also, the cumulative costs from sewer systems result in thousands of days of closed beaches at a cost of billions of dollars due to swimming-related illnesses. The impact of such contamination to my district, with over 300 miles of coastline, can be devastating to the fishing and tourist economies that depend upon clean water and healthy beaches. 
   According to the EPA, an estimated 850 billion gallons of raw sewage and industrial waste escape each year much of it into public waters. Unfortunately, despite this obvious need, the President's fiscal 2008 budget cuts infrastructure funding by $400 million or 36.6 percent. It is my hope that our budget resolution and our appropriators will override this cut. 
   Yet many Americans do not become aware of sewage leaks until they show up on a closed beach or, worse yet, are made ill because many sewer systems do not routinely monitor to detect sewer overflows or report those that do occur to environmental or public health agencies. 
   This bill authorizes $1.8 billion over the next 5 years for grants to prevent dangerous sewer overflows. More needs to be done, but this is a good first step. Vote for this bill, protect the health of our Nation's beachgoers and protect our environment.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of the rule and the underlying conference report, and I urge my colleagues to vote both for the rule and for H.R. 4137. 
   Let me commend Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon and Subcommittee Chair Hinojosa and Ranking Member Keller for presiding over such a collegial and bipartisan process. We entered into this process with the goal of enhancing access and affordability, and I truly believe that H.R. 4137 makes significant progress on achieving both of those very important goals. 
   Let me talk about some specific elements of the bill that I think are worthy of mention. 
   First, the bill very much strengthens the Perkins Loan program, the loan program that this administration has seemed determined to kill but has strong bipartisan support here in the Congress. The conference report increases the maximum awards that students may receive in any one year, it also increases the aggregate awards, and it also strengthens the revolving loan fund by ensuring that funds collected be returned to the revolving loan fund so that they may be reloaned to future needy students. And all of this helps to reduce the dependence on private loans for needy students, and that was one of our goals as well. 
   The conference report simplifies the financial aid delivery process by simplifying the completion of the so-called FAFSA form which is a very daunting form for many families, yet it is the gatekeeper to eligibility for all students' financial aid. It includes the provisions of the Student Loan Sunshine Act. This results from investigations conducted by the attorney general of my home State that revealed several abuses in the student loan program, and this legislation restores confidence and trust to the financial aid delivery system. 
   It also reestablishes a Federal role for supporting cooperative education which helps students gain valuable career information and also finance their education. It has many very valuable features in this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it, and I thank my colleagues for working so hard on it.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support and as a proud cosponsor of this resolution, recognizing the importance of the Federal Government's continued support for research into the rare bone marrow failure disorder for which there is no known cure known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 
   I am very proud to represent Manny and Maria Arturi of Remsenberg, NY, located in my district. After the loss of their daughter Daniela Maria nearly 12 years ago, the foundation they created and that bears her name continues making great strides toward the ultimate goal of finding a cure. 
   When a tragic disorder like this strikes infants within the first year of their lives, it is all the more important for Congress to go on record voicing our unwavering support to raise awareness and broaden support for funding rare disease research. Accordingly, this resolution demonstrates we support giving experienced doctors the resources for the most complete care for those patients. And by encouraging the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control to coordinate a multidisciplinary approach toward a cure, this legislation brings hope that other parents will be spared from the kind of devastation felt by the Arturis once they learned of their child's diagnosis. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution as well as other measures that will ultimately bring about a cure for Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

   The Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act of 2007, as its title implies, ensures fairness for the victims of the terrorist attacks by correcting a shortcoming in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and by reversing an unintended consequence of the bill that established the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. 
   Although I was not yet in Congress, many of my colleagues who were here at that time will recall when this body passed the bill creating the compensation fund in 2001. 
   Shortly thereafter, the Justice Department administered how the fund could allow victims of the terrorist attacks or their families to apply for financial assistance following the loss of loved ones who perished on that tragic day. 
   The Justice Department also designated the Southern District of New York as the only court in which 9/11 claims could be litigated if victims and their families chose to opt out of the fund. 
   As a result of this designation and a flaw in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, families of the victims, as well as the defendants in the 9/11 cases, cannot gain access to testimony or documents from witnesses who did not live within 100 miles of the Southern District of New York. 
   But there's really no logical reason why victims and their families should be prevented from securing documents and witnesses just because they happen to be more than 100 miles outside the Southern District. 
   It is obvious that many of the victims aboard the four airliners that crashed and those who were killed inside the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon, as well as those who witnessed these horrific events, resided well outside of this 100-mile radius of the Southern District of New York. 
   And it should be assumed that many of the families of the victims who are involved in the 9/11 claims, or those who will seek compensation at a later date, as well as the witnesses, still live in the same locations across the country. Therefore, geography simply should have no role in how they seek compensation. 
   In response to this problem, this bill amends the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to provide for nationwide subpoena power to all parties involved, victims, their families and the defendants, when litigating 9/11 claims. 
   Simply put, this bill establishes a full measure of justice by allowing subpoenas to be served anywhere in the country, ensuring that all the parties involved in the 9/11 suits can gain all of the information necessary to try these cases fully and fairly. 
   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle can agree that justice requires that all the parties to cases arising under the Victims Compensation Fund have access to all the testimony and documents relevant to their claims, regardless of where the witnesses or documents are located in the United States.  
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act of 2007. Once again, I want to thank the Judiciary Committee for reporting this measure to the floor so promptly, and I thank the leadership for moving it.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the California State University Fresno State men's baseball team for winning the 2008 Division I College World Series. 
   Since June 14, the first day of the College World Series, Fresno State made an improbable run at the championship. As a fourth seed, they fought and clawed their way into the College World Series. Just to make the College Word Series, Fresno State had to win the Western Athletic Conference. Though they edged their way into the CWS, their presence was definitely felt. They gave college baseball fans across the country special treat with their amazing play. 
   The Bulldogs belted their way through their matchup with Rice University. This lopsided affair ended with  the final score being 17-5. The Bulldog team had a pair of home runs and eight out of the nine starters had a hit. The team steamed forward to play the second-seeded University of North Carolina. In this best-of-three series, Fresno won the first game 5-3, lost a tight second match 4-3, and sealed their championship fate beating UNC 6-1 in the final affair. 
   In the championship series against the University of Georgia, the Fresno Bulldogs ended up losing their first game in the best-of-three series. The Fresno players bounced back with a vengeance. They cruised to a 19-8 victory with run after run. In the final game, Fresno brought home a championship after defeating University of Georgia 6-1. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to Coach Mike Batesole who was named the 2008 National Coach of the Year--the second time he has won this award. He has led them through an amazing College World Series. Assistant Coaches Matt Curtis, Mike Mayne, and Pat Waer complete the coaching staff. All of them have done a stellar job preparing this confident group. 
   Congratulations are always in order for Tommy Mendonca for winning the College World Series MVP and for being invited to play with the USA National Collegiate Baseball Team. Mendonca hit .285 with 19 home runs, 70 RBIs and eight doubles for the College World Series champions this season. He also hit four home runs and drove in 11 runs during the College World Series. 
   Winning the national championship as an underdog has brought national acclaim to Fresno State. They are the lowest seed to win a College World Series and the first men's team to win a national championship for their school. These Bulldogs have earned a special place in Fresno State sports history. 
   I once again congratulate Fresno State for their amazing success. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING THE ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1088 and thank Mr. Nadler for introducing this resolution. H. Res. 1088 commends the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater for its excellence, impact and service to the arts. 
   Alvin Ailey's Dance Theater is referred to by many as the world's premier dance company. AAADT promotes aspects of the African American experience while preserving modern dance heritage to millions across the globe. Its long-standing accomplishments and the rich global impacts speak volumes about the company's caliber of talent and unique mission. 
   Alvin Ailey founded AAADT in 1958. As a child, Ailey developed a keen interest in art. In his high school years, he began taking dance classes with Katherine Dunham, a pioneer of African modern dance. However, Ailey's most important influence came from Lester Horton. Horton led a team of racially mixed dancers. Ailey, however, took over the team once Horton passed away in 1953. Five years later, Alvin Ailey founded AAADT. 
   Both the founder and other leaders of the organization have made outstanding accomplishments and have been recognized for their contributions to the arts. In 1982 Ailey received the United Nations of Peace Medal. President George W. Bush recognized AAADT and Artistic Director Judith Jamison with the National Medal of Arts in 2001. Until that point, a dance ensemble had never received such an award. The recognition this dance company receives is well-deserved. 
   AAADT has performed for an estimated 21 million people in 48 States, 71 countries, and 6 continents. This company tours more than any other performing arts company. The Joan Weill Center for Dance, the studio for AAADT, is the largest facility dedicated exclusively to dance in the United States. 
   AAADT has performed before numerous distinguished audiences, including President Johnson, President Carter, President Clinton, and President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya. They have also represented themselves at famous historical engagements such as the Rio de Janeiro International Arts Festival, the First Negro Arts Festival in Dakar, the fabled New Year's Eve performance for the Crown Prince of Morocco, the Paris Centennial performance at the Grand Palais Theatre, South Africa, and two Olympic games. 
   In addition to the stellar performances, AAADT has also worked with more than 100,000 young folks every year to assist them in discovering their creative talents and help build their self-esteem through their artistic skills. The Arts in Education and Community Programs includes nine Ailey Camps across the United States. They also have implemented an Ailey II, a junior company, to train less experienced dancers to perform across North America. These young people come from various cultural, social, and economic backgrounds to come together to empower themselves and to learn art. 
   In recognition of 50 amazing years of excellence, let us commend AAADT for their contributions to the United States and the rest of the world. It has established an extended cultural community that provides dance performances, training, and community programs for all people while using the beauty and humanity of the African American heritage and other cultures. AAADT is irreplaceable. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I express my support for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the students of East High School in Denver, Colorado, on winning the 2008 ``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' national competition. 
   ``We the People'' is a program that encourages civic awareness and responsibility in middle school and high school students through hands-on activities. Students discover firsthand how the Constitution and the Bill of Rights impact their everyday lives and participate in a simulated Congressional hearing. At the national level, students utilize higher order thinking skills as they demonstrate their knowledge of constitutional theory by defending a historical or contemporary issue. 
   For the second consecutive year, Denver's East High School won the national title. In order to receive this high honor, 27 students from East High School competed against 1,200 other participants from all 50 States. The 3-day long competition took place on Capitol Hill and involved the students completing a mock hearing. They were judged by law school professors, State supreme court justices, mayors, and others on their opening statements and their responses to follow-up questions on 17 different constitutional topics. 
   This competition makes the Constitution come alive and helps students connect what they are learning to contemporary issues and events. This type of learning is important not only for its academic aspects, but also for the way in which it improves our democracy. Students are able to analyze and evaluate their rights and responsibilities and apply this new knowledge to their surroundings. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, I wish to congratulate the students of East High School and all the other students across the Nation that took part in the ``We the People'' competition. I hope all students have the opportunity to see civics come alive, and I encourage my colleagues to pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to congratulate the Arizona State University softball team for their victory in the 2008 NCAA Division I tournament. 
   On June 3, softball fans were treated to an exceptional game as the Arizona State Sun Devils defeated the Texas A&M Aggies and clinched their first national title.     
   The resounding 11-0 defeat is the largest margin of victory for a championship game in Women's College World Series history. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to Head Coach Clint Meyers and Assistant Coaches Kirsten Voak and Robert Wagner. This talented coaching staff was named the NFCA's NCAA Division I Coaching Staff of the Year for their outstanding leadership during the 2008 season. Coach Meyers returned to his alma mater 3 years ago and picked up his first Pacific-10 Coach of the Year honor this season. He has now led the school to its first conference championship and national title in softball. 
   Congratulations are also in order for pitcher Katie Burkhart who was named the Most Valuable Player in the Women's College World Series. Burkhart, a senior from San Luis Obispo, California, also struck out an impressive 53 batters during the World Series and posted a perfect record of 5-0. In her tenure at Arizona State, Burkhart has amassed 15 shutouts and 3 saves in her 32 career starts. 
   And for Kaitlin Cochran, a junior from Yorba Linda, California, who hit a three-run homer in the fifth inning of the final game to give the Sun Devils a 4-0 lead. In fact, Cochran was such a big offensive force this season that she was intentionally walked a record 29 times. Cochran was also named the Pac-10 conference Softball Player of the Year and earned the Conference's batting title for the third year in a row. 
   The extraordinary achievements of this year is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the many players, coaches, students, alumni, families and the fans that have helped to make Arizona State University a premiere softball program. Winning the National Championship, finishing the season with a 66-5 overall record, and winning the Pac-10 Conference championship has brought national acclaim to Arizona State University. I know the fans of the university will revel in this accomplishment as they look forward to the 2009 season. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again I congratulate the Arizona State University softball team for their success, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I wasn't sure that we were here to discuss energy. But since the subject has been broached, let me say that the messaging continues. The messaging clearly is to blame the Democrats for a problem that, in fact, grows out of legislation that was pushed by the Republican majority. 
   The Energy Policy Act of 2005 that was passed in this Chamber, most Democrats voted against it. Most Republicans voted for it. It is an energy policy that was written by the secret energy task force convened by the Vice President. And at the time that was written in 2005, the Energy Information Administration predicted that it would do absolutely nothing to reduce the price of gasoline at the pump, and would most likely result in an increase in the price of gas at the pump. And guess what? Here we are 3 years later and that is exactly what has happened as a result of the policy that was put in place by the Republican leadership of this chamber and the Republican White House. 
   And so what the messaging is about is about blaming Democrats for a policy and a situation that exists as a result of Republican-enacted legislation. 
   Let me say one other thing, and that is, that what the American people deserve is a short-term solution and a long-term solution, and increased drilling provides neither. If the President and the Republicans were truly interested in a short-term solution they would join the Democrats in this Congress and they would urge the President to release 70 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, something that would almost undoubtedly immediately bring down prices at the pump. And if they were interested in a long-term solution, they would join us in embarking on a policy that would give us a clean and independent energy future that would reduce our demand on foreign oil. 
   With that, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Mitchell).

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Hamilton College Continentals women's lacrosse team for their victory in the 2008 NCAA Division III tournament. 
   On May 18, Hamilton College Continentals women's lacrosse team celebrated their NCAA Division III championship title after defeating the Franklin & Marshall College Diplomats 13-6 in Salem, Virginia.     
   This was the first NCAA championship title for not only the woman's lacrosse team but also for Hamilton College. However, amidst the recognition of this single moment, the individuals that constituted this significant occasion should be the main focus of praise. Each individual's hard work and dedication in the course of the entire season should be noted and celebrated. 
   First, I want to recognize Nicole Tetreault, class of 2008. As a result of her outstanding performances throughout the season, she has received numerous awards and recognitions including 2008 Liberty League Player of the Year, 2008 NCAA Division III All-Tournament team, First Team All-America for the second consecutive year, and 2008 ESPN The Magazine's Academic All-America Women's At-Large Team. Furthermore, Tetreault was granted the honor of Academic All-American, a recognition given to exceptional athletes who also demonstrate academic excellence. Tetreault has proven to be an admirable role model to students and athletes alike. 
   Additionally, I want to extend my congratulations to head Coach Patty Kloidt who has propelled Hamilton College's women's lacrosse program forward ever since she assumed the position 6 years ago. Kloidt rightfully received the NCAA Division III Women's Lacrosse title Coach of the Year. Moreover, Kloidt and her assistant coaches, Amanda Nobis and Mackay Rippey, were named the Liberty League Coaching Staff of the Year in 2008. They are an excellent representation of outstanding leadership. 
   The Hamilton College women's lacrosse team made many more accomplishments apart from the ones already mentioned. Four of the women Continentals won All-American awards and six were selected to the All-Region team. They had an impeccable season with a record of 21-1, winning 19 straight games. And I'm sure their lacrosse program will only move forward with many victories in years to come. 
   It is very rare that a team is granted with an exceptional coaching staff and athletic ability. Yet it takes tremendous leadership and teamwork for potential to be fully realized and for any team to perform at their best. Again, I do not only congratulate the Continentals for their championship title, but the exceptional individuals that made the victory possible. These athletes and coaching staff are truly an outstanding model for any group to refer to, whether it is athletics, academics, or politics as an example of cooperation, tenacity, and excellence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I once again congratulate the Hamilton College Continental women's lacrosse team 2008 NCAA Division III championship title. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (ELEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TWA FLIGHT 800 DISASTER -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise on the solemn occasion of the 11th anniversary of the crash of TWA Flight 800. Many Americans remember where they were when they heard the shocking and tragic news about Flight 800 when it crashed off the southern shore of Long Island 11 years ago tomorrow, on the evening of July 17, 1996, claiming the lives of all 230 passengers and crew on board. 
   The event remains one of the worst air disasters in history and led to one of the most costly and extended investigations to date. Today, that loss is still felt by hundreds of families whose loved ones perished but are remembered by the breathtaking monument to their lives that extends along the grounds of East Moriches, Long Island, overlooking the waters of the Atlantic Ocean where the plane fell. 
   Tomorrow, we honor the memory of those who perished, just moments after taking off from JFK International Airport bound for Paris. Some of the victims were on their way home; many were high school students on the first leg of an international field trip; and some were on the way to visit loved ones. 
   Just as the families who lost their loved ones to the crash deserve to be remembered, so do each of Long Island's emergency personnel, volunteers and neighbors who selflessly responded to the crash and who worked tirelessly over the next several days and weeks following the disaster to assist with the search and recovery efforts. 
   Like other challenging times our Nation has faced, the reaction to the Flight 800 catastrophe brought out the best, not only among my constituents, but in so many other areas in the surrounding towns, counties and States across the Northeast who joined in helping my community recover from its most horrific tragedy. 
   Throughout their grief and despite the unimaginable shock, the families of the victims worked tirelessly to build a permanent memorial with the help of Navy Seabees and thousands of dedicated local and building trade union members. The solemn monument serves as a constant reminder of our tremendous loss 11 years ago tomorrow. 
   Last year, it was my honor and privilege to attend the dedication of the memorial completed at Smith Point County Park just before the 10th anniversary of the crash. 
   The centerpiece of this breathtaking and poignant memorial is a black granite sculpture called ``The Light.'' It was designed by Henry Seaman, whose cousin died in the crash. The monument offers some measure of closure to everyone who was affected by this terrible tragedy. 
   The memory of the passengers of Flight 800 lives on because of the continued work of people like Henry's brother, John Seaman, who is President of the Families of Flight 800 Association and among the memorial's most passionate and hardworking advocates. 
   In the 11 years since Flight 800, hundreds of thousands of people have visited the park in an acknowledgment of a shared sorrow for those who died. The monument ensures that future generations can do the same. 
   As we recognize the 11th anniversary of the Flight 800 disaster, it is important for us to take stock in the progress achieved since 1996 to prevent air disasters. We have made some great strides in aviation safety, particularly with design upgrades for passenger and cargo aircraft planes. 
   In particular, ongoing research and development of ``inerting'' technology will help to mitigate the vulnerability of aircraft fuel tanks to flammability, the underlying cause of the Flight 800 crash. 
   In fact, the crash was likely caused by a spark from a short-circuit in the Boeing 747's wiring that ignited the tank's volatile vapors. Although this was determined years ago and we know how to prevent similar disasters, we still have not required technology upgrades to protect passengers against another tragedy like the one witnessed 10 years ago. 
   To date, however, the Federal Aviation Administration has delayed taking on this challenge and has declined to work with the industry to implement a final FAA directive that would protect every air traveler with existing technology. 
   We still don't have the mandate for change. That is why I introduced the Transport Aircraft Fuel Tank Safety Act, which requires the FAA to retrofit all planes with new technology and to increase safety. I am pleased to report that the pending FAA reauthorization bill, which was recently passed by the House Transportation Committee, of which I am a member, includes a similar provision. 
   Senator Schumer is sponsoring a companion measure and is working with his colleagues on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee to move this legislation. 
   I am hopeful that my colleagues here in the Congress will work with me to bring an end to this delay. We have taken significant steps towards maintaining the memory of Flight 800, but we should also ensure that we don't allow this disaster to repeat itself. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again offer my deepest condolences to  the surviving families and friends of the victims of Flight 800 and encourage my colleagues to join me in commending each of them for the grace and dignity with which they have handled unspeakable pain.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me start by thanking Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Cummings and Ranking Member LaTourette for their leadership and tireless advocacy on behalf of the Coast Guard. I would also like to express my gratitude for the invaluable service provided by our exemplary Coast Guardsmen and women every day. 
   My amendment would require the Coast Guard to study the extent to which State and local law enforcement augment Coast Guard resources by enforcing Coast Guard-imposed security zones around vessels transiting to and from U.S. ports and conducting port security patrols. The amendment requires the Coast Guard to study and clarify their relationship with local law enforcement, the standards set to ensure that local law enforcement of Coast Guard security zones can deter a security incident. The amendment also seeks to identify the differences in law enforcement authority, particularly boarding authority, between the Coast Guard and local law enforcement. This amendment is necessary given evidence that the Coast Guard is overextended around the country. 
   A 2007 GAO report states that the assistance the Coast Guard already receives from State and local law enforcement is vital to meet security requirements with limited resources. 
   Some may point to this as a vindication of local law enforcement's ability to share in the responsibilities of protecting hazardous cargo from potential threats. I would argue that the GAO has shed a light on a more fundamental issue: a lack of adequate Coast Guard resources and a potential new role for local law enforcement that has historically been reserved for the Coast Guard. This issue requires increased scrutiny. 
   After 9/11 and the absorption of the Coast Guard by the Department of Homeland Security, considerable strain was placed on Coast Guard resources. This shortfall is apparent as dozens of LNG proposals across the country compete for Coast Guard resources to make waterways suitable for hazardous cargo. The Coast Guard on several occasions has expressed its concerns to Congress about the proliferation of LNG proposals that require extensive Coast Guard oversight. The limited public discussion about who should provide these resources has led to unanswered questions. Is this something that should be passed on to the consumer through the price of goods? Is this a local responsibility? Is this a Federal responsibility? This amendment begins the dialogue necessary to clarify what ratio of responsibility is appropriate to protect hazardous cargo. 
   It is vital to maritime security to determine the role local law enforcement should play in protecting hazardous cargo so that, as policymakers, we can determine exactly what the Coast Guard needs to protect and preserve America's waterways. 
   Madam Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.  
   I rise in support of H.R. 2264. As I drive around eastern Long Island, an area that is heavily dependent on its economic stability on travel and tourism, it is all too common to see gas prices as high as $3.30 a gallon. I'm reminded of how few influences beyond our shores affect our economic prosperity as much as the supply of oil. 
   The disappointment we share after 6 1/2 years of failed foreign and energy policies is matched by our frustration that price gouging by oil and gas companies, as well as collusion among foreign governments to restrict the flow of oil to the United States, continue unchecked. 
   As Thomas Friedman has written in the New York Times, we can't have an effective, forward-looking foreign policy toward the Middle East without a serious energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. This bill, which empowers the U.S. to legally challenge foreign collusion resulting in price spikes, is a good first step towards that goal. 
   One of the first resolutions I introduced called on the President to demand OPEC boost oil production, which was also included in the Democratic substitute I was proud to offer to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Despite a wave of record gas prices that summer, President Bush and the then-majority ignored that call. 
   Consequently, the surging price of gas continues to hit middle-class families hard while we wait for the administration to produce a foreign and energy policy that finally shrinks our reliance on foreign oil and vulnerability to the whims of oil cartels.

   Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to summarize in 1 minute the attributes of this first-rate conference report, but let me just say this: For a period of time before I came to the Congress, I was the senior administrator in a college. I had a very simple rule when I was faced with a decision. That rule was: Is the decision I'm about to make in the best interest of students, will it help students? And by that measure, the answer to this question is an emphatic ``yes.'' 
   We should be supporting the rule. We should be supporting the underlying legislation. This legislation helps students realize their dreams, and that's what this Congress should be about. This is about student aspiration, and this is about the Congress providing the resources to see to it that students can get their slice of the American Dream. And by increasing the Pell Grant maximum, by reducing the rate that students will have to pay when they borrow, and by streamlining the needs analysis system so that students have a more realistic measure of their ability to pay, we will increase access, we will enhance affordability. 
   We should support this rule and support this conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (PROVIDING FOR COMPENSATION TO STATES INCARCERATING UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1512, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) Reimbursement Protection Act. 
   SCAAP is vital to my district on eastern Long Island by providing much needed assistance to municipal governments that incur the large cost of incarcerating undocumented immigrants. In fact, in my district of Suffolk County, officials estimate that 10 to 12 percent of those incarcerated are undocumented individuals with a cost to the County of approximately $12 million in 2006. 
   Unfortunately, SCAAP does not reimburse States for all of the costs to incarcerate undocumented individuals. Presently, the only funding that SCAAP provides is the cost of incarcerating undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors. 
   This legislation will reimburse States incarcerating undocumented individuals charged with a felony or two or more misdemeanors. This small change will greatly assist local governments who are overburdened by recent escalating costs. 
   While my district and many others across the Nation have greatly benefited from SCAAP funding, the Bush administration continues to eliminate funding for the program. I was proud to cosign a bipartisan letter to House appropriators asking that they reject the President's short-sighted elimination of the program and increase SCAAP funding. 
   I am a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and as Congress continues to debate immigration reform, we cannot deny that State and local governments are on the frontlines of immigration enforcement. I will continue to work to ensure that they receive adequate funding and resources for the important role they play. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman S&#225;nchez, for introducing this much needed legislation.  
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. I yield back the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3648, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of similar legislation that also gives a much-deserved break to homeowners and their families facing enormous tax liability made more painful by the housing crisis. 
   Nearly 3,000 homeowners in Suffolk County, New York in my district are facing foreclosure. One out of every 180 families in my district will join 2.2 million families nationwide whose subprime loans have already failed or will end in foreclosure. 
   Adding insult to injury, most of them have to pay a tax when a lender forgives some part of their mortgage. The IRS treats that forgiven debt as income, and can even add interest and penalties. 
   To be relieved of debt at one moment, but then to be charged shortly thereafter with a huge tax bill is a tremendous shock and burden. We can all agree that middle class families who lose their homes should be spared any further penalty by the IRS. 
   Mr. Speaker, losing your home is bad enough. The last thing any family in today's housing market needs is for the IRS to make their struggle more of an uphill climb. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3648 and commend the leadership for expediting its consideration by the House today.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (HONORING HARRY A. MARMION -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Harry A. Marmion who recently passed away after a long and distinguished career in which he served of president of two colleges and as president of the United States Tennis Association during the time when the Arthur Ashe Stadium what constructed and opened. 
   He was an outstanding leader in all of these roles, but more than that, he was an outstanding person. He remained active and involved in life until the day he died. And I am proud to have called him my mentor and my friend. 
   Harry Marmion loved people, and they loved him. His quick wit and engaging personality enabled him to rally people to get the job done, whether it was establishing the John Steinbeck Room in the Southampton College Library or overseeing the naming of Arthur Ashe Stadium. 
   Following his graduation from Fairfield University, Harry served for 2 years in the United States Marine Corps as an infantry officer. He then served in the Marine Corps Reserve for 26 years, retiring as a colonel. Dr. Marmion held a law degree from Georgetown University and a Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut. 
   At the age of 37, he was appointed president of St. Xavier College in Chicago, a position he held from 1969 to 1972. In 1972, he was appointed president of Southampton College of Long Island University. During his presidency, I was an administrator at the college and thus I had the opportunity to see firsthand his leadership style and his ability. 
   He was always accessible and able to talk to people from all walks of life. He helped position Southampton College as a liberal arts institution with specialties in marine science and the fine arts, and it was during his tenure that Southampton students won the college's first three Fulbright Scholarships. 
   Harry was always available for advice and good counsel. I often relied on his judgment and advice after I was appointed provost of Southampton College and later when I was elected to Congress. 
   In 1980, he was appointed vice president for academic affairs and professor of law and management at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.     
   He retired after 10 years, only to embark on a second career with the United States Tennis Association. 
   His love of tennis began in the 1980s when he was ranked a senior player in the East, despite the fact that he had never played tennis until he was in his 30s. After serving as the president of the Eastern Tennis Association and on the USTA's board of directors, Harry became its 43rd chairman and president of the USTA's board in 1997. During his tenure, he oversaw the renovation of the USTA's facility in Flushing Meadows. He was instrumental in ensuring that the stadium be named in honor of Arthur Ashe, the great African American athlete, rather than for a corporate sponsor. 
   Harry loved a good joke as much as anyone I know, but he also loved a good cause and was never afraid to do the right thing. He played a key role in the election of Judy Levering as his successor at the USTA, the first female to hold that position. And when Southampton College was facing closure in 2005, he helped form the ``Save the College'' group and served as one of its most influential members, proudly participating in the ultimately Stony Brook/Southampton campus.  
   Always active in the community, Harry served as Southampton Democratic Town Chairman and as a member of the board of trustees of Southampton Hospital. He also wrote two books: ``The Case Against the Volunteer Army,'' and ``Selective Service: Conflict and Compromise.'' 
   Harry was also a devoted family man. He and his wife, Pat, were married for 54 years. They have three daughters, Elizabeth, Sarah, and Sheila, and nine grandchildren. 
   At a February 1997 press conference when the USTA announced the naming of the new stadium, Harry said, ``Arthur Ashe was an outstanding tennis player, but we naming our new stadium in his honor because Arthur Ashe was the finest human being the sport of tennis has ever known.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the same could be said of Harry Marmion: he excelled at his career and as a human being. I, along with hundreds of others he touched over the course of his life, loved Harry Marmion. I will miss him greatly.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and I thank him for his leadership on this very important piece of legislation. 
   It is imperative that we go to conference on this bill and that we pass the College Cost Reduction Act. It provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to help students afford college and to do so at no new cost to the taxpayer. Let me emphasize that point: At no new cost to the taxpayer. 
   We just heard this bill described, I believe, as containing unprecedented new spending, and I think it is important to point out that it is not new spending, it is redirected spending.  With this bill, the Congress is making a choice that we think it is important to take Federal resources, scarce Federal resources, and devote them to assisting needy students in meeting the cost of attending college, and it is more important to do that than it is to see to it that the student loan providers maintain what are already very healthy profit margins. I think that is a choice that the American people would support us in making, and it is certainly a reasonable choice. 
   If you were to look at today's front page article in the New York Times, an article that talks about how colleges are not raising tuition but they are raising fees, it underscores one of the central realities of higher education today, and that is, as public support for higher education is reduced, the burden falls on students and their families to make up the difference. We now have an opportunity to assist students and families with making up that difference. 
   This bill significantly increases the Pell Grant maximum, something, by the way, that the President has spoken quite favorably of doing. He has been promising an increase in the Pell Grant maximum since the campaign of 2000. It was not until the Congress acted with the continuing resolution for fiscal year 2007 that that increase became a reality for the first time. And now with this bill, we will dramatically increase the Pell Grant maximum to offset increases in tuition, increases in fees, and declining public support for education in other areas. 
   It also cuts student loan interest rates, which is very important. It is a point that continues to be missed by our friends on the other side. Access and affordability isn't just about the cost of attendance when the student is undertaking the cost; it is about looking at their future obligations. What this bill does is it enables students to make clear decisions about what they can afford and what they can't afford and have an expectation of what their future obligations are that is much more reasonable. 
   This is an investment. This is the kind of investment that we need to keep this Nation strong, to keep this Nation safe, to keep this Nation competitive. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank again the chairman for his leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (RAW SEWAGE OVERFLOW COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the residents of eastern Long Island, I would like to commend Chairman OBERSTAR, Chairwoman JOHNSON and Congressman LOBIONDO for their leadership and unwavering dedication to clean water issues. I would also like to thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee staff for their hard work and commitment to advancing this legislation to the full House today. 
   Madam Speaker, the EPA estimates that sewer overflows discharge roughly 850 billion gallons of raw or partially treated sewage annually into local waters. These discharges, laden with potentially harmful chemicals and pathogens, often end up in local rivers, lakes, streams, and the ocean. 
   In response, the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee has taken appropriate measures to restore the federal commitment to our Nation's wastewater infrastructure. In the 110th Congress, we have passed the Water Quality Financing Act, authorizing funds for the State Revolving Fund; and the Beach Protection Act, to carry out coastal recreation water quality monitoring and notification programs. Today, we take our commitment to water quality one step further by passing the Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-know Act. 
   As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: The best way to avoid human health and environmental concerns from sewer overflows is to ensure that they never occur in the first place. However, even with significant increases in investment, sewer overflows will continue to occur. Therefore, it is imperative that we provide the public with comprehensive and timely notification of sewer overflows. We need to make sure that the public is aware of sewer overflows to give communities the opportunity to protect themselves. 
   It makes no sense for operators of local sewer systems to know where and when overflows are occurring, but not to promptly notify the public. Notification of sewer overflows will help the public avoid direct contact with potentially harmful chemicals and pathogens, and it will facilitate rapid response to overflows in order to minimize the potential harm to the environment. 
   Accordingly, the Bishop/LoBiondo Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-know Act provides for the monitoring, reporting and public notification of sewer overflows from Publicly Owned Treatment Works by requiring POTWs to institute and utilize programs to alert operators to overflows, notify the public within 24 hours of discovery of an overflow by an operator, and notify public health officials when human health is endangered. 
   The bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency establish criteria to guide POTWs in assessing whether a sewer overflow has the potential to affect human health and developing communication measures to ensure the public is notified. The bill also establishes a process for EPA to determine if a State's existing notification program is substantially equivalent to, or better than, the requirements established in this bill, and should be allowed to continue.  
   This bill is a result of hard work by several organizations who believe that Americans deserve clean, safe waters. Without their many insights this legislation would not have been possible. Therefore, I would like to thank American Rivers, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the Water Environment Federation, and the California Association of Sanitation Agencies for the countless hours they have given to refine the bill's language to ensure that public health and the environment are protected. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense legislation, and I again thank my friend and colleague, Mr. LOBIONDO, for his leadership and support in authoring the bill.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica, as well as Subcommittee Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Baker for their hard work and leadership on this important legislation--the first water improvement and conservation package in seven years. 
   Following several earlier impasses, I want to take this opportunity to commend the spirit of bipartisanship and compromise on this important measure. I hope it extends to a bicameral bipartisanship in the weeks to come. 
   This bill benefits all Americans and their families who use and enjoy our Nation's waterways, public beaches--including over 300 miles of coastline along my district--and for U.S. businesses that depend on healthy and viable waterways throughout the country. 
   My district benefits from the good work that the Army Corps of Engineers does for coastal communities by helping small towns deal with multiple concerns ranging from erosion to longstanding environmental challenges. The Corps is currently working on several projects on eastern Long Island that will dredge inlets, restore damaged ecosystems, and study coastal health. 
   In addition, H.R. 1495 will go a long way toward supplying the Corps with all the resources it needs to protect coastal communities and vacationers by modernizing project planning and approval. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member again for their hard work on this issue, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we get a WRDA bill to the President as soon as we can. We simply cannot afford to let another year go by without passing this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this resolution. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that this budget represents the largest tax increase in history; nothing could be further from the truth. This budget does not increase taxes by a single dime. 
   Rather, this budget simply extends current law as the President and the then-Republican majority designed with the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which expire on December 31, 2010. At that time we will have a decision to make: Whether to renew those tax cuts, and how to pay for them. The era of blank checks for tax cuts is over. Today, we restore fiscal responsibility to the budget process. With respect to entitlement reform, I think many of us would like to hear some acknowledgment from our friends on the other side of the aisle that the $3 trillion in debt that was accumulated on their watch makes dealing with the growing demands on Medicare and Social Security all the more difficult to contend with. 
   We balance the budget within 5 years and set the table for tax-writing committees to do their job, which first and foremost, should result in repeal of the AMT for middle-income Americans once and for all. 
   As this budget puts us on the glidepath to fiscal responsibility, it dramatically raises spending levels education, veterans, and health care. These priorities will never be overlooked on our watch. 
   We reject the President's proposal to cut funding for education by $1.5 billion and eliminate 44 programs. We give college students and their families a chance to succeed by rejecting the President's plan to zero out SEOG, Perkins loans and need-based grants. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend the distinguished chairman and his staff for their excellent work, restoring middle-class priorities is accomplished. Fiscal responsibility is achieved. Finally, the fiscal blueprint of America's future reflects our hopes, dreams and the promise of economic prosperity and security in the years ahead.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. I want to thank Chairman Miller and Chairman Hinojosa and Ranking Member McKeon and Ranking Member Keller for their good and bipartisan work on this bill. This is, in fact, a bipartisan effort. It passed out of the Education Committee by a unanimous vote, and I think that that suggests that this is a very good product. It closely resembles the Senate bill, so we should be able to conference it quickly, and it continues the strong work that this Congress has done on a bipartisan basis to improve access and affordability for higher education. 
   We have twice now, on a bipartisan basis, saved the SEOG program and the Perkins loan program. We have increased the Pell Grant maximum, and we have cut interest rates in half. 
   Let me just go over a couple of the high points of the bill. 
   It strengthens the Perkins loan program, a loan program that the administration seems determined to kill but has broad bipartisan support in this Congress. We've increased the maximums that students may borrow. We also have mandated that the assignment of the proceeds of defaulted loans that are collected by the department will reverse back to the campus revolving loan funds so that those loan funds will remain fully funded. It increases the cohort default rate window so that the default rate is now measured over a 3-year period as opposed to a 2-year period. That will protect students and it will also provide greater accountability and stewardship of taxpayer funds. It restricts the Secretary's authority with respect to negotiated rulemaking on accreditation standards, and this is important as many believe that an effort is underway to federalize education, and we believe that these aspects of higher education are best left to higher education professionals. It reinstates the Federal role in supporting cooperative education. It simplifies the FAFSA process. It has very clear language on transfer of credit. And it incorporates the full provisions of our Student Loan Sunshine Act. 
   So from every vantage point, this is a first-rate piece of work, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim time in opposition, though I will not express opposition, I will just express a plea for clarity on this measure as we go to conference. 
   My concern is this, and by the way, I would like to applaud my colleagues for offering this amendment, and I certainly would like to laud their intent, but my concern is that we will be requiring colleges to provide information that, by its very nature, is speculative, and we will then be allowing students to make judgments on that information when it may not be reliable. And having gone through this for a long, long time in a previous life, it is not a good idea to give students misinformation. 
   So my plea is that as we go to conference on this, I hope that we can work with the authors of the amendment to maintain its intent but clarify the language in such a way that students are not put into the position where they are put in a position where they make judgments based on information that, as I say, is speculative and, therefore, not as reliable as it could be. 
   As I say, though, I am not in opposition. I just hope that we can clarify this in conference. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. Delivering the solemn promise we made to set a new direction in Iraq, this legislation provides us with the opportunity to reaffirm our support for the responsible redeployment of our troops and a refocusing of our efforts on the real threat that is facing America--fighting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, tracking down Osama bin Laden, and preventing another terrorist attack against America. 
   Along with a great many of my colleagues, I spoke out against the President's surge strategy when it was announced in January. We argued then, as we reiterate today, that Iraq is engaged in a civil war and thus political, not military, solutions are needed to address the problems facing the region. Yet, the President continues to operate under the assumption that somehow, some way, there is a military path to success. In other words, his strategy continues to be ``stay the course'' writ large. 
   It has now been seven months since the President announced his surge strategy, with the stated goal of providing stability in Iraq so that the political reforms that are needed to secure the region can take place. Since then, more than 25,000 additional troops have deployed to Iraq, of whom 600 have been killed and more than 3,000 have been wounded. All of this while the Iraqi government has failed to meet any of the benchmarks endorsed by the President in January, violence rates are at an all time high, and a recent government report estimates that al Qaeda is the strongest it has been since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
   Simply put, it is long past time for our involvement in this tragic episode to come to an end. The Iraqi people are the only ones that can bring a peaceful conclusion to this war. 
   It is unfair to ask our troops and their families to continue to sacrifice while Iraqi leaders have done so little to achieve the political and security goals asked of them. Therefore, it is imperative that we begin the gradual redeployment of troops as soon as possible to protect their lives and ensure the safety of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate my opposition to this war. I believe the decision to invade Iraq is the single most devastating and misguided foreign policy decision our Nation has ever made. I will vote for the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act because I believe it is time to bring our troops home and end our involvement in this civil war.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which is a clear and concise response on behalf of the majority of Americans who share our opposition to the President's misguided plan to escalate the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. 
   We can all agree upon and indeed must take this opportunity once again to affirm that our support for the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces is steadfast and unyielding. 
   As this resolution declares, our first priority must continue to be protecting the brave men and women in uniform who have served this Nation honorably and valiantly. The decision to invade Iraq is the single most devastating and misguided foreign policy decision our Nation has ever made, and the process of protecting our Nation from compounding this tragic error must begin this week under new leadership with a clear vision and a plan that finally acknowledges that we can no longer stay the course in Iraq.     
   After nearly 4 years of war, the sacrifice of more than 3,100 brave servicemen and -women, tens of thousands more injured, and over $600 billion spent on the war to date, President Bush's ``mission accomplished'' declaration certainly rings hollow. 
   We must not forget whose war and misguided strategy failed us, and we must ask who the President is listening to beyond the small circle of advisers who were the architects of this fiasco in the first place. 
   The only strategy this administration has proposed is to stay the course, augmented by four earlier surges, along with the most recent plan to deploy the additional 21,500 U.S. troops, likely to escalate further to 40,000 to 60,000 more troops before the year's end. This latest policy is stay the course writ large. 
   The President's plan operates under the assumption that somehow, despite  all the evidence to the contrary, there is a military path to success if only more forces are on the ground. Not only is this logic flawed, it flies in the face of the wisdom of his top generals in the field, such as the former commander of the U.S. Central Command, John Abizaid, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``more American troops right now is not the solution to the problem.'' 
   I agree. We cannot afford to inject more of America's best and bravest into the chaos, particularly without the armor and training to protect them. Shortchanging our heroes in the face of a relentless insurgency is unworthy of this Nation. If we can't supply our troops with what they need, how can we possibly contemplate an escalation? 
   Without a reduction to the violence against U.S. troops, without stability in the region, and without evidence of a correlation between the raging violence and the number of U.S. troops and the number of trained Iraqi troops, now is the time to reduce the U.S. combat presence in Iraq, not expand it. 
   The Republican mantra has been that the Democrats don't have a plan for Iraq other than cut and run, an assertion that is simply false. We do have a comprehensive plan for Iraq that includes implementing the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, a regional conference to engage Iraq's neighbors diplomatically, and seeking political solutions to the escalating turmoil in the region. But again I would ask, what evidence is there to suggest that this President will listen to anyone's plan other than his own? 
   This is simply not an insurgency that needs to be crushed. Confirmed by the President's most recent National Intelligence Estimate, Iraq is in a state of civil war, and thus political solutions are needed to address the real problem. Although al Qaeda remains active in Iraq, they have been surpassed by ethnic violence, the primary source of conflict and the most immediate threat to stability in Iraq. 
   Proponents of the war claim that those opposed to the surge aren't supporting the troops. I would ask them how we are supporting our troops while keeping them in a country where 70 percent of Iraqis believe it is acceptable to attack U.S. troops, where 78 percent believe that our troops provoke more violence than they prevent, where three-quarters of them would feel safer if American forces left Iraq. 
   By staying the course in Iraq, we are putting our troops in a situation that has no positive outcome. Aren't the lives of our troops more valuable than saving political face and trying to prove a point? 
   And while it is well known that the claims of weapons of mass destruction were based on faulty intelligence and there was no connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda, why are we committing our troops and resources towards refereeing a civil war in Iraq, thereby diverting resources required to win the global war on terror rather than fighting al Qaeda in Afghanistan, tracking down Osama bin Laden, and preventing another terrorist attack against America? 
   The President's earlier NIE made it very clear last September that the war in Iraq has become a primary recruitment vehicle for violent Islamic extremists, motivating a global jihadist movement and a new generation of potential terrorists around the world whose numbers may be increasing faster than the United States and our allies can reduce the threat. 
   Opposition to this surge does not mean a lack of support for our troops; rather, it affirms what the American people made clear last November, that our policy in Iraq is not working and that we need a new direction. I will vote for this resolution, and I will continue to join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring our involvement in this misguided tragedy to an end  
   The NIE also indicates that, rather than contributing to eventual victory in the global counter-terrorism struggle, the situation in Iraq has diminished America's position, What additional evidence does the President need to prove that his policies in Iraq are only making matters worse for Iraqis and making the world decidedly less safe for America? 
   And to those who would argue that this resolution sends a signal to our enemies that we are weak and divided, you are wrong. This debate proves why democracy works, unites us, makes us stronger, more resolute, and why these strengths--that our enemies envy and seek to overcome--will ensure that we ultimately prevail over them. 
   Opposition to this surge does not mean a lack of support for our troops. Rather, it affirms what the American people made clear last November--that our policy in Iraq is not working and we need a new direction. 
   I will vote for this resolution, and I will continue to join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring our involvement in this misguided tragedy to an end. Voicing opposition to this war, to this President's policies, and to more of the same is our solemn responsibility, consistent with the objectives of this resolution, the hopes of the American people, and the mission of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the Majority leadership and the distinguished chairmen of the Armed Services and International Relations Committees for their hard work and making this debate a priority of this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, it is all too rare when we in the majority and the President arrive at a consensus. So it's welcome news that we agree on relief Americans need in today's economy should come in the form of a stimulus bill. Targeted tax breaks and short-term measures to help the middle class can salvage our economy from plummeting home values, savings and market conditions. 
   We should insist upon including expanded unemployment benefits and food stamps, in addition to tax rebates. These benefits will be spent immediately by those who need our help most in this economy. 
   In fact, for every dollar spent by the government on food stamps, there is a $1.60 return to the economy; and for every dollar spent on unemployment benefits, the return is $1.90. 
   The tax rebate should be targeted to the middle class and include those low-income workers who didn't earn enough to pay income taxes but still pay into Medicare and Social Security through payroll taxes withheld from their paychecks. 
   This is the prescription middle-class Americans need to cure the ills of today's economy. Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to do their part to help us towards that end.

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Speaker, it is with honor and with a profound sadness that I rise to recognize Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy of the United States Navy, who last week was posthumously awarded our Nation's highest award for valor: the Medal of Honor. 
   Among my greatest privileges was attending last week's ceremonial presentations of the Medal of Honor to his family at the White House and the Navy Memorial. 
   Known fondly as ``Murph,'' Michael was born on May 7, 1976, in Smithtown, New York, and grew up in Patchogue, in my district on eastern Long Island. He was raised by a family of policemen, lifeguards, firemen, and teachers who instilled values reflecting that public service is a noble calling. 
   In high school, Lieutenant Murphy life-guarded at the Brookhaven town beach in Lake Ronkonkoma, a job he returned to each summer through his college years. He graduated from Patchogue-Medford High School in 1994. 
   Lieutenant Murphy attended Penn State University, where he was an exceptional all-around athlete and student. He excelled at ice hockey, graduated with honors, and was accepted to several law schools, but instead wanted to serve his country as part of the world's most elite fighting force: the U.S. Navy SEALs. 
   Slightly built at 5 feet, 10 inches, he attended SEAL mentoring sessions at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point and was accepted to the Navy Officer Candidate School in 2000. Lieutenant Murphy was commissioned as an ensign and after 6 months completed Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training in 2001. He then attended Army Jump School, SEAL Qualification Training, SEAL Delivery Vehicle School, and earned his SEAL Trident by 2002. 
   Lieutenant Murphy was later deployed to Qatar and to the Horn of Africa in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2005, Lieutenant Murphy was assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE as assistant officer in charge of ALFA Platoon and deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. 
   Madam Speaker, the Congressional Medal of Honor commemorates Lieutenant Murphy's actions as the officer in charge of a four-man SEAL unit in support of Operation Red Wing, tasked with finding a key Taliban commander in the mountainous terrain of northeastern Afghanistan. 
   On June 28, 2005, shortly after inserting into the objective area, the SEALs were spotted by three goat herders who were initially detained and then released. It is believed they reported the SEALs' presence to Taliban fighters. 
   A fierce gun battle ensued on the steep face of the mountain between the SEALs and a much larger enemy force. Despite the intensity of the firefight and suffering grave gunshot wounds himself, Lieutenant Murphy is credited with risking his own life to save the lives of his teammates. 
   He had moved into the open where he could gain a better position to transmit a call for help. This deliberate and heroic act deprived him of cover and made him a target for the enemy. While continuing to be fired upon, he made contact with Bagram Air Base to request assistance. He calmly reported his unit's location and the size of the enemy force while requesting support for his team. 
   He was shot in the back, causing him to drop the transmitter. He picked it back up, completed the call, and continued firing at the enemy closing in. Severely wounded, he returned to his men and continued the battle. 
   In response to Lieutenant Murphy's call, an MH-47 Chinook helicopter, with eight additional SEALs and eight Army Night Stalkers aboard, was sent. As the Chinook drew near, a rocket-propelled grenade hit the helicopter, causing it to crash, killing all 16 men aboard. 
   On the ground and nearly out of ammunition, the four SEALs continued to fight. After 2 hours Lieutenant Murphy, Matthew Axelson, and Daniel Dietz had fallen. Over 30 Taliban were also killed. 
   The fourth SEAL, Petty Officer Marcus Luttrell, was knocked unconscious and over a ridge by the blast of a rocket-propelled grenade. Though severely wounded, he evaded the enemy for nearly a day and was rescued by local nationals who cared for him until U.S. forces arrived for him 3 days later. 
   Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy was buried at Calverton National Cemetery, less than 20 miles from his hometown. His other awards include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Ribbon, and National Defense Service Medal. 
   Throughout his life, he was known for his unwavering loyalty and an instinctive responsibility to help others. With unwavering courage in the face of certain death, he gave his life for his country and teammates, reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the Navy's highest traditions. 
   Madam Speaker, our Nation is blessed to have a military full of great Americans like Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy who are serving with great distinction. He epitomized the selfless devotion to duty our young men and women have demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other hostile regions. My heart goes out to the Murphy family and the people of Patchogue, New York, for they have lost one of America's very finest.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Madam Chairman, on behalf of the residents of eastern Long Island, I would like to commend Chairwoman JOHNSON and Congressman PALLONE for their leadership and unwavering dedication to clean water issues. I would also like to thank the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee staff for their hard work and commitment to advancing this legislation to the full House today. 
   My district encompasses 300 miles of Eastern Long Island's coastline, which includes some of this country's most popular and beautiful beaches that I am very proud to represent. Maintaining coastal health is an integral objective not only in my district but to preserve our Nation's environment and to sustain the tourist economies of our States that rely on safe, clean beaches. Millions of beach-going Americans and their families who will flock to our Nation's shores in the summer months ahead deserve pristine waterways, and we should do all we can today to preserve them for future generations of Americans. 
   To that end, the water quality monitoring and notification grants established in the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act have been absolutely vital to protecting the health of beachgoers and preserving the quality of our shores. However, it has become clear that further development of the BEACH Act is needed after recent reports marked progress but raised questions about its implementation. 
   Therefore, I commend Mr. PALLONE, the author of the original BEACH Act, for building on the program's success by updating the law and advancing improvements in this bill to meet the challenges involved with carrying out the program and to continue funding its grant programs. 
   Accordingly, this bipartisan legislation reauthorizes grants to states through 2012, but increases grant authorizations to $40 million annually; expands the scope of BEACH Act grants from water quality monitoring and notification to include pollution source tracking efforts; and strengthens environmental standards for water quality testing and communication. In addition, this bill requires that beach water quality violations are disclosed not only to the public but to all relevant state agencies with beach water pollution authority. 
   Furthermore, this bill requires the EPA to conduct annual reviews to make sure state and local governments that receive funding in the BEACH Act comply with its process requirements. Under this bill, grantees have one  year to comply with the new environmental standards. Otherwise, they will be required to pay at least a 50 percent match for their grant until they come back into compliance, in place of current law which allows the government to require a non-federal share of up to 50 percent. 
   For six years, the BEACH Act has given beachgoers the peace of mind that the beaches they visit are clean. Our legislation begins the process of strengthening this important law and reassures the American public that preserving healthy shores is a priority of our environmental agenda. 
   One in ten tourists is destined for the beach this summer--providing our travel and vacation industries with customers and business. I hope my colleagues agree that the BEACH Act is an excellent example of an effective government program that benefits communities in every region of the country and has yielded tremendous progress in restoring healthy shores. 
   Madam Chairman, with the leadership and support of this body, we can ensure that beach visitors throughout the country are assured that local governments have all the resources they need to monitor recreational waters and alert the public of potential health hazards.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of New York. (FORECLOSURE TAX RELIEF ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight as a proud cosponsor of the Foreclosure Tax Relief Act. I commend its cosponsor, my colleague from Ohio, Mr. Space, as well as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, for agreeing to take up legislation that would give a tax break to middle-class homeowners who have been caught up in the subprime mortgage fallout. 
   Nearly 3,000 homeowners in Suffolk County, New York alone, that's one out of every 180 homes in my district, have joined 2.2 million families nationwide whose subprime loans have already failed or will end in foreclosure. Adding insult to injury, they face massive tax bills once any portion of their mortgage is cancelled. The IRS treats that forgiven debt as income and can even tack on interest and penalties. 
   In response to this unfair phantom tax, the Foreclosure Tax Relief Act would set the tax exclusion for middle-class families up to $50,000 in forgiven debt on first mortgages and primary residences. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support foreclosure tax relief legislation.
