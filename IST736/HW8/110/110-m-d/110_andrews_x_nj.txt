<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (CONDEMNING THE PERSECUTION OF LABOR RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN IRAN -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I would like to thank the cochairman of the Iran Working Group, my good friend, Mr. Kirk, for his efforts and the staff's efforts. And I would associate myself with the remarks that Mark made about the staff members who worked so hard on this. 
   I'd like to thank our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Sherman, and ranking members on the other side for their help. 
   A prison must be a terribly lonely and solitary place. And I think there is no more lonely and solitary place on the face of the Earth than an Iranian prison, because in an Iranian prison you live in a place where there is no due process, there is no right to be heard, there is no sunlight, there is no chance to address your grievances. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we meet today, two men, Mahmoud Salehi and Mansour Osanloo sit in that solitary confinement. Their crime is speaking up for the members of the group for which they work. Their offense is trying to organize and represent the men and women next to whom they work. This is taken universally as a human right, the right to speak up for better working conditions, for fairness in the workplace. It is a right that Iran recognizes as a signatory to the International Labor Organization, and Iran is bound to follow the core principles of the ILO. Clearly, Iran is not doing so as we meet today. 
   For more than 6 months, Mr. Salehi has been confined in a prison. For more than 3 months, Mr. Osanloo has been confined in a prison. 
   It is my hope that this resolution today will have the Members of this House, Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative, joining the voices of labor leaders around the world as expressed on August 9 saying to the Government of Iran that this imprisonment is unjustified. This is an egregious abuse of human rights. These men should be released. Their medical needs should be tended to, and justification should be given for the unlawful and inhuman incarceration of these individuals. 
   This is a larger question than the political relationship between the United States and Iran. It is a larger question than labor law and the right to organize. This is a fundamental question of human rights. Innocent, infirm people should not be held against their will with no rights and no right to address their grievances. Surely, Mr. Speaker, this House can and should join together today to rise up in opposition to this inhuman practice. 
   I would urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and thank her for her great work in shepherding this bill along. 
   I deeply respect the ranking member of the full committee, and I know his intentions are very sincere, but I think the Members of the House deserve a record that is accurate. Let me review the five points that he made and set forth what the bill actually says. 
   The gentleman says that the bill does away with secret ballots. That is not the case. 
   If those choosing to organize a union wish to have a secret ballot, they can follow the same procedure that is in the law now: get 30 percent-plus to sign a petition for a secret ballot, and have one. 
   The gentleman says that the bill legalizes coercion by unions. That is not the case. 
   Coercion by a union against a worker is and still will be an unfair labor practice. The bill says if a signature is acquired by coercion and is involuntary, it is not presumably going to be a valid signature and therefore does not count. 
   The gentleman says that the bill takes away the right of privacy from workers. Not so. 
   The same process essentially by which people sign petitions under the present law, they would sign cards under the new bill. Perhaps the gentleman should be more concerned about the loss of privacy of workers during campaigns by employers to coerce and intimidate people to vote against the union. 
   The gentleman says the bill takes away the right to vote on contracts. Absolutely not so. 
   What the bill says is if there is not an agreement for a contract between management and labor, after negotiation, after mediation, then and only then there would be arbitration. It does not take away the right to vote on contracts. 
   Finally, the gentleman says that penalties are somehow out of balance, but I think the gentleman respectfully misunderstands. 
   If in a union-organizing drive the unions are found to have coerced people into signing cards, the cards are invalid and it is the death penalty for the union because they lose the organizing drive. That is the most significant penalty there can be. 
   We are all entitled to our own opinion; we are not entitled to our own facts.

   Section 6 of the bill makes it clear that if a card is invalid, it will not be counted, and an employee who asks for his or her card back clearly would be an invalid card.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Chairman, this bill has the potential, I believe, to do great good for the working people in this country. I believe it has the potential to reenergize the middle class of our country. But I believe the opponents of the bill have grossly overstated the severity and magnitude of the changes that are proposed. 
   We repeatedly hear the phrase that we are ``doing away with the secret ballot.'' This is false. The bill sets up two mechanisms for people to organize and join a union. The first is to get a majority of those eligible in the bargaining unit to sign a card, at which time there will be an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board. It will determine the validity or invalidity of the cards. If the board determines that a majority of the bargaining unit has signed a valid card, then there is a union recognized. 
   There is one key difference between this provision in the bill and the law under which we have lived for the last 6 decades-plus. We have had the majority sign-up procedure for more than 60 years, but present law says even if a majority sign valid cards, the employer can arbitrarily veto that choice of a majority. This bill transfers the power from the employer's veto to the employees' majority. 
   Secondly, if the employees instead wish to organize by pursuing the election path, by getting at least 30 percent to manifest their intention to have an election, then there is an election. It is very important, and we have heard different points about who the union leadership is. 
   In my district, I will tell you who the union leadership is. They coach baseball teams. They read the epistle at mass. They volunteer in fire companies. They sign up and recruit people for the United Way. They are the first people to show up if there is a fire or a flood. They are the hardworking, basic core of this country. 
   I know there have been instances of intimidation on both sides, but it is important we look at the record. A group that is strongly opposed to this bill scoured over 60 years of court cases, and in those 60 years, they could find only 42 examples which they chose to highlight where there was a finding of coercion by a union person in an organizing job. 
   By contrast, in 2005, more than 31,000 workers in 1 year were awarded back pay because it was found that their rights had been violated. Yes, there is coercion on both sides, but the record shows that the coercion has been disproportionately on the management side. That is why this leveling of the playing field is needed. 
   This bill replaces the employer's arbitrary veto with a valid expression of majority will. It does not eliminate the secret ballot. It eliminates the systemic coercion under which we live today. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. ANDREWS. With the indulgence of the minority, which we appreciate, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to a member of the committee whose expertise is matched only by her passion in this area, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez) 1 minute. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   The ability to form a union and bargain has been instrumental in helping families reach the middle class. Workers who belong to unions earn more and have better benefits than workers who don't. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act is about ensuring that workers can join a union. More than half of U.S. workers would join a union if they could. 
   But to prevent workers from forming a union, 92 percent of employers will force employees to attend anti-union propaganda sessions, and 25 percent will illegally fire at least one employee for pro-union activity. 
   I learned from an early age how difficult it can be to organize a workplace and also how important unions can be to families. At the factory where she worked, my mother helped lead an effort to organize shop workers and get health benefits and pensions. 
   Later, I tried my own hand at organizing janitors and home health care workers, and, like my mother, faced staunch opposition from employers. It took the pleas of the religious community to get many workers reinstated.  
   Current law is simply not strong enough. Management-controlled campaigns, firings, and intimidation are not the hallmarks of the democratic process--but they are the hallmarks of the current system in which employers hold all the power. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Employee Free Choice Act.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   I oppose the amendment. First of all, let's make it very clear that salting, the practice the gentleman addresses, is legal. What is not legal are disruptive practices if one is working for an employer, as they should be illegal. 
   The gentleman's amendment frankly offers a breathtaking introduction of a discriminatory practice in the statutes of the country. If I read the amendment correctly, an employer could refuse to hire someone simply because someone is in a union. So let's think about the facts that would be involved here. 
   Let's say a person works part-time for a grocery store, and as a part-time worker they become a member of the union at the grocery store.     
   Then they go to apply for a job at a telecommunications company. As I read the amendment, the telecommunications company could refuse to hire the individual who worked in the grocery store, who is a member of the union, simply because the person was a member of a union. 
   This is a remarkable precedent. It basically suggests that by being a member of an organization, you subject yourself to discrimination. I think if the gentleman would think about someone else's ox being gored, he would understand what's wrong with this. 
   If an employer said we won't hire someone because you have been in the chamber of commerce, you have a pro-business attitude, we would be offended by that. If someone said we are not going to hire you because you have been in the National Rifle Association, we think there is something wrong with that, I think we would be offended by that. 
   There is no functional difference between what the gentleman is proposing and those discriminatory scenarios. The purpose of our law is to prohibit discrimination, not sanctify it. I believe that this would be a breathtaking departure from the tradition of American law where we discourage discrimination rather than make it a part of our statutes. 
   Salting is legal. Disruptive behavior is illegal. It stays ``illegal'' under the bill before us. But if the gentleman's amendment were adopted, discrimination against someone simply because the organization he or she is a part of, would become legal. That is a very, very unwise policy. 
   I oppose the amendment. 
   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment is unnecessary. It is unfair, and I believe it is unconstitutional, and it should be opposed. 
   If there are practices where union employees are coercing workers to sign cards or sign a petition, those practices are illegal and will remain illegal after this bill is passed. Under section 6 of this bill, if there are circumstances where union organizers are coercing or intimidating people to try to get them to sign a card or cards, the labor board would presumably find those efforts to be invalid, and the card would be invalid, so the amendment is unnecessary. 
   It is unfair in this respect. It is rather remarkable, the ranking member of the full committee just talked about adults being able to protect themselves against certain circumstances. I see no amendment from the minority that says that workers could be free from going to one-on-one meetings with their supervisors. I see no amendment from the minority that says that workers could be free from being forced to attend captive meetings where their employer has all the say and the union has none of the say. 
   I see no amendment that indicates there would be a strengthening of protection against firing people during an organizing drive for which there is a strong record that this is happening on a regular basis. 
   I further believe the amendment is probably unconstitutional. The amendment says that it outlaws efforts to ``communicate with individuals with respect to questions of representation.'' As I read this, if the union took an ad in a newspaper that encouraged people to sign a card and join a union, that is an attempt to communicate with an individual about the question of union representation. 
   We have a principle and constitutional interpretation in this country, where overly broad prohibitions against speech are presumptively invalid. This is an overly broad, and, I believe, presumptively invalid prohibition against free speech. 
   The amendment is unnecessary, it is unfair, it is unconstitutional. It should be defeated. 
   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like the RECORD to reflect a couple of points. 
   First of all, with respect to this continued phrase about a public ballot. The card is not a public document. When the card is collected by the organizers it is turned in at some point to the Labor Board for certification. 
   Second, this public opinion poll that keeps being referenced, or these polls that keep being referenced, none of the respondents to these polls were party to the information about the systemic pattern of coercion that has taken place in the workplace and asked questions, I believe, that were rather loaded. 
   And finally, on the issue of decertification, the fact of the matter is that the law today gives an employer the right to refuse to bargain with and recognize a union if there is a manifestation by a majority of the workers that they no longer wish to be recognized. There doesn't need to be a vote before an employer can choose not to recognize the union. 
   Madam Chairman, at this time, I would like to yield 2 1/2 minutes to the  gentlelady from New York City, Brooklyn, more specifically, Ms. Clarke.

   Since then, this administration has averaged 73 convictions for a year for hiring illegal workers. In 2004, this administration got zero convictions for hiring illegal workers. Do not force organized labor to do what this administration has failed so miserably to do.

   I rise in strong support of this legislation. The slogan that we should support our troops is given life and reality by this bill, by paying them well, by equipping them well, and by supporting them in every respect. This bill deserves the support of each and every Member of this body. 
   I also echo the remarks of my friend from New Jersey with respect to the  hard work that has been done to be sure that Americans who have been victimized by the state-sponsored terrorism have adequate means of redress in our courts. This is the issue that gave rise to the Presidential veto. I happen to agree that the compromise in front of us makes imminent sense. 
   The general rule in American law is that when you sue someone, you don't have the right to freeze their assets or go after their assets unless you win a judgment. We make an exception to that general rule in the case of assets owned by states which are involved in state-sponsored terrorism. It is the wisdom of the compromise here that that provision remains in effect for all of the other states that are involved in state-sponsored terrorism, with the exception of Iraq, which was under the regime of Saddam Hussein. It leaves to the discretion of the President a waiver to determine whether claims against that regime under Saddam Hussein should go forward, and how they should go forward. 
   This is an issue that I think the Congress ought to reconsider and revisit in 2008 and beyond. I, frankly, believe that an American who has been the victim of improper or illegal conduct under the old regime should not go without legal redress. That is a lingering question that is as a result of this compromise, but it's a wise and necessary compromise that would permit us to do what we should have done a long time ago for the men and women who serve this country so well. 
   So I congratulate the chairman and Ranking Member Hunter as authors of the compromise. I appreciate their hard work in bringing this bill back to life. Happily, I will support it, and look forward to doing even greater things in 2008.

   In the spring of 2007 at the Crandall Canyon Mine, retreat mining began, and when they started the retreat mining on the north side of the mountain, there were indications that there could be trouble. There were literally noises, sounds, that say there could be trouble. So they stopped. 
   In June of 2007, the company conducting that mining went to the mine safety regulators, the Federal Government, and said we want to now do on the south side of the mountain what we stopped doing on the north side of the mountain. In just over a week, 9 days as I recall, the Federal regulators said go ahead and do it. How much care could they have taken in that analysis in that short period of time? Tragically, in August of 2007, nine people lost their lives. 
   Here's what this bill would change. It would say that the next time a mining company submits a retreat mining plan, they've got to have a computer model of what might happen when they start. They've got to send people from the mine safety agency to the mine to watch that it's being done the right way, and they've got to look at every possible technology that could be used to protect and save people's lives. 
   Tonight, nine families have an empty chair at the dinner table because of the tragedy that occurred at Crandall Canyon. I can't assure any of those people that we would avoid a future tragedy, but we have to try, and this bill is an intelligent, good-faith effort in that regard. It deserves the vote of every Democrat and every Republican. It deserves to become law.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join the subcommittee chairman in opposition to this amendment. 
   Members who believe in a balanced and fair competition where the taxpayers get the greatest value for the dollar should oppose this amendment and support the underlying bill. The underlying bill, as the chairman said, is a carefully crafted compromise that permits a rational assessment of the cost and benefits of contracting out, and provides for a fair appeal process where whichever side loses that process would have the opportunity to bring its case to another level and have it reexamined. 
   So I think that the bill is neither pro-contracting out nor anti-contracting-out. I think the bill strikes a fair balance, and it says in instances where someone decides a contract should be permitted, it happens; and for instances where it should not be, it does not. 
   I commend the chairman for crafting a fair compromise. I join him in urging defeat of the amendment.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Alaska, who no doubt will oppose this amendment, is a principled and fierce advocate for his constituents. And over the years, the taxpayers of the country have financed the construction of 5,000 miles of roads  which facilitate industrial and community activity in his district which he strongly and understandably believes in. 
   I respectfully submit, Mr. Chairman, that we have financed this enough. Since 1982, the taxpayers of the country have expended over $1 billion to finance the construction and maintenance of these 5,000 miles of roads. The economic result of this investment has been an average annual net loss of $40 million a year. I believe that this is not sustainable. Yes, jobs have been created, and this is very important for anyone in anyone's district. But the average cost of this job creation has been $200,000 per job. 
   Now, this amendment does not say that the existing roads cannot be used. It does not say that the existing roads cannot be maintained. It does not say that the existing roads cannot be used for the purposes for which they were originally intended, for development and commerce. What this amendment does say, Mr. Chairman, is that we will not invest more money in more roads. We will not invest more money at a rate of $40 million a year to extend this system. 
   For reasons of fiscal good sense, for reasons of environmental good sense, for a precious national resource, I believe that this House should revert to the language which is included in last year's bill and prevent the expenditure of more funds for the extension of this 5,000-mile road system in order to save the public money and in order to preserve this important national treasure. 
   This is a bipartisan amendment. I am pleased that my friend from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) is my cosponsor. It has received bipartisan support in the past. I would respectfully ask my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

   Mr. ANDREWS. I would simply urge the Chair to overrule to the point of order on the grounds that precedent, that identical language was found to be in order in the last Congress.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Do any other Members wish to be heard on this point of order? 
   The Chair will rule. 
   The amendment turns on the purpose of the Forest Service in preparing for or building a road. If the justification for the road includes the harvest of timber by private entities, the limitation would apply. If not, the limitation would not apply. Nothing on the face of the amendment would require the Forest Service to monitor continuing use of the road. 
   As noted in volume 8 of Deschler's Precedents, section 51.13, a limitation may deny the availability of funds even if resulting in circumstances suggesting a change in applicability of law. It is also possible to restrict funds even if contracts may be left unsatisfied as a result. 
   The fact that this amendment requires those who would plan a road to know the purposes for which they are doing so is not a new duty or determination but, rather, a mere incident of the limitation. Second-order consequences do not render the amendment a violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. 
   The point of order is overruled.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this very well-thought-out piece of legislation. School districts across our country are struggling economically to pay their bills for their basics, to do the basic things that we've established schools to do. And sometimes some things that they would like to do that are somewhat extra fall by the wayside. Very often they do. 
   This program builds a competitive grant program where school districts around the country can compete for the most innovative and effective environmental education programs. 
   This is the field trip that the students might not otherwise have; this is the summer course for the teacher that he or she might not otherwise have; this is investment in the learning materials for the technology that the students might not otherwise have; this is the science fair competition that is centered upon environmental issues that the students might not otherwise have. The beneficiaries of this well-thought-out bill are not simply the students and the teachers and the schools who will benefit from the program, it's the U.S. economy and all of us who depend on it. 
   The jobs of the future will be jobs that generate new ideas, particularly in the area of alternative energy production. So much of that is intricately tied to environmental education. And it's today's students, today's young people, for whom these ideas will be enlightened and from whom new products will come. 
   So this is not simply an assistance to America's schools today. I believe it's also an investment in the jobs of the future that the country so badly needs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's not surprising to me why there is such disorientation from the erstwhile majority about the budget resolution that will be going to conference. It's because it contains a principle that they don't understand, which is called deficit reduction. 
   The erstwhile majority made a living out of borrowing money, spending more, taxing less, borrowing more; spending more, taxing less, borrowing more. They turned a huge projected budget surplus into an immense budget deficit and debt, which will be paid for by the children and grandchildren of the Members of this institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, here are the facts about the budget resolution the House passed: The fact is not one dollar of taxes is raised on anyone in the fiscal year covered by the first year of this resolution or the second year. Now, we get to a point at the end of 2009 where the tax cuts which the erstwhile majority enacted a few years ago expire. They passed a law that said that those tax cuts expire. We say let's pause at that point and decide what is in the best interest of the country. And there are options. Perhaps the surplus will have grown to the point where we can finance all of those tax cuts and not increase the deficit. Perhaps there will be greater revenues that have been projected under our conservative revenue estimates and we will be able to afford to extend all the tax cuts. Perhaps we will look at the state of the economy at that time and decide that the best thing to do is to extend all the tax cuts to try to engender some economic growth. Or perhaps we will decide that a rigid discipline that emphasizes deficit reduction, as is in this resolution, is the right thing to do. 
   The erstwhile majority practiced the principle of leap first and look later. This resolution says look before you leap. It says when we reach the point where the tax cuts expire, we will make a judgment about whether spending cuts, tax cut renewal, or some other strategy is in the best interest of the country. 
   Not one dollar of taxes is raised in the first fiscal year covered by this budget, and nothing in this resolution necessitates the raising of any taxes on anyone. It simply says, Mr. Speaker, that Congress should do something the erstwhile majority never did: Look before you leap. Make decisions based on good economic evidence, not blind faith.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I would like to thank my friend from Ohio for yielding. I would like to thank my friend, Mr. Lewis, for his hard work on this legislation throughout the process, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery), and obviously our chairman, Mr. Rangel, and other members of the Ways and Means Committee, Mrs. TUBBS JONES in particular. 
   When we started working on this project, it was a matter of simple fairness to Americans who sold a home under difficult circumstances. Now, unfortunately, the problem has grown into one of economic urgency because our economy is in trouble today in large part because of a drop in housing prices and housing values. And one of the reasons that we would have a glut on that market would be if people have to dump their properties on the market because they can't get a workout on the loans that they have because it would raise their taxes to come to a different arrangement with their lender. 
   Through the wisdom of the committee, we are fixing this law in such a  way that will encourage people to work out an arrangement with their mortgagee to work out a way they can pay their loans and stay in their homes. And if they stay in their home, we won't have that glut of supply in the housing market. If we don't have that glut of supply on the housing market, prices will stabilize and not drop, which will mean more Americans have more home equity, more Americans have economic confidence, and our economy can rebound. 
   So I want to thank all those both on the Democratic and Republican side of the aisle for making this project a reality, in particular the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, for their hard work in making this a reality and urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (PENSION PROTECTION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation and would like to echo the comments of my friend from Minnesota in thanking the efforts of so many people to make this bill possible, beginning with Chairman Rangel, Mr. McCrery, Chairman Miller of the Education and Labor Committee, Ranking Member McKeon, Subcommittee Chair Pomeroy, Mr. Ramstad and others. This has been a very cooperative and good effort. 
   Healthy pensions are healthy for the economy of the United States. When the tens of millions of people who are covered by pension funds feel more confident about the security of their money and the likelihood that it will continue on into the future, they are more likely to be consumers and investors and engines of economic opportunity for the rest of us in the economy. 
   This act makes a number of important corrections that will strengthen and therefore make more healthy the pension funds of our country. I embrace and support each of those changes. I would like to highlight three of them that I believe are of significant and important relevance. 
   The first has to do with the so-called smoothing provisions, which will particularly benefit the larger employers. We have significant and rigid new standards under the 2006 act which require underfunded plans to catch up so that they are fully funded as soon as reasonably possible. But it is important that those rigid standards do not choke off the economic activity of the plan sponsor, and when they are too rigid, they run that risk. So these smoothing provisions give the plan sponsor, the employer, the flexibility to make a rational judgment about how much money is needed to be put into the fund to catch it up how soon. 
   In my view, this reform is a win for the taxpayers, it is a win for the pensioners and employees and a win for the employer. It is a win for the taxpayers in that a plan that is caught up in a rational way by a successful employer is qualitatively less likely to go into default, to go into insolvency and to call for a bailout by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Ultimately, the taxpayers of the country stand behind the PBGC. The fewer claims of insolvency, the less risk to the taxpayer. 
   Second, I believe that these provisions are very good for pensioners and employers because these provisions substantially increase the likelihood that the pension fund will be stable, permanent and a source of income for the person for the rest of his or her life. 
   Finally, this is most certainly an advantage for all those who benefit from the pension system. So I think that this is a very important change. 
   This is an important change for small business as well. One particular change that lets small businesses rely upon a fixed 5.5 percent rate of interest in their pension calculations means that the person running a dental practice or a small manufacturing plant does not have to incur unnecessary legal or accounting or actuarial fees to calculate and recalculate changing assumptions. The matter of a few thousand dollars for that plan sponsor is very important, and it leads to the result that more employers will keep these plans, as my friend Mr. Pomeroy expressed concern about earlier on. 
   Finally, I would join with the comments of Mr. Pomeroy and Mr. Ramstad about the very significant importance of the public employee pension fund provisions in this bill. The history of public employee pension funds in this country is a very stable and positive one. With a few rare exceptions, fund trustees around this country have made proper fiduciary choices with the investment decisions for the men and women who rely upon those decisions, and one of those decisions they make is the credit interest rate that ought to be used in calculating certain distributions to retired firefighters, teachers, police officers and other public employees. 
   There is a saying that is not unique to pension law, but unique to common sense, which is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Public employee trustees around the country have done an excellent job in managing their funds, by and large. This bill has a provision in it that assures that those trustees will continue to have the freedom and flexibility to make their own determination as to what that credit interest rate ought to be and that that determination should not be supplanted by the judgment of any Federal agency or by this Congress. 
   You might say, well, what about the issue of exposure of the Federal taxpayer? Aren't we subjecting the Federal taxpayer to risk if the State and local trustees make the wrong decision?     
   Mr. Speaker, we are most emphatically not, because the plans about which I speak are not backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. So the idea of Federal regulation imposing itself upon the decisions of these trustees is without any merit or  justification. This will mean that police officers and firefighters and teachers and other public employees will get the fair pension for which they bargained and to which they are entitled. 
   I would like to express my appreciation to the minority and majority staff for their hard work on this bill. I think it well serves the country. I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3685, EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I rise in support of the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize a point of agreement and a point of disagreement: There is a broad and growing agreement that members of the transgendered community should receive the full protection of the Federal law, and many of us are committed to work to achieve that day as soon as we possibly can. But there is a strong point of disagreement that I have heard from the minority side about the procedure on which we are taking up this bill. 
   We had a vigorous debate in the full committee about this bill and three concerns were raised. One was the issue of the transgendered community, and Ms. Baldwin has in order an amendment, which she will decide the disposition of, so that issue can be raised. The second is the scope of the religious exemption, which my friends vigorously debated, and Mr. Miller and Mr. Stupak's manager's amendment raises that very same issue, and there will be a debate and there will be a disposition. Finally, there was some discussion as to the impact of this bill on the question of the definition of marriage, and the amendment of Mr. Miller and Mr. Stupak will make in order a debate and a disposition of that issue as well. 
   The purpose of the House, with all due respect to my friends on the other side, the purpose of the House is not to debate every issue for as long as it takes until everyone is done talking. The purpose of the House is to have a fair and reasonable proceeding and to decide, and that is what we are going to do here. 
   I would just say one final thing to my friend, and I know he is going to ask me to yield, and I will do so if he agrees to yield to me when my time has expired. But my friend speaks with great enthusiasm to bringing to a vote on the floor the question of transgendered people. 
   I would ask my friend why, for the previous 12 years that his group has had the majority here, they never brought the issue to the floor during  those 12 years if they have such intense feelings in favor. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my chairman and friend for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, we very often hear people say in this House that they oppose discrimination. Today there's a chance to do something more than just say that you oppose discrimination; you can vote against it. 
   I listened to the questions raised by my friend from California, the ranking member of the full committee, and I would like to address them. 
   My friend says that there are burdensome new mandates imposed by this bill. That is not the case. If an employer has 15 or fewer employees, they are not covered by it at all. And there's really nothing burdensome about the idea that you can't refuse to hire or fire or mistreat someone because of their sexual orientation. That's no more of a burden than having the same rules based on race or religion or nationality. 
   My friend says there are highly subjective measures, and he points to the use of the word ``perceived'' discrimination. He says that when we ban discrimination based on perception of sexual orientation, it creates too much confusion. The reality is that precisely the same legal concept has been part of our Federal law since 1989 under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   Listen to this. I know the word ``perceived'' is not in the ADA, but the legal concept is the same. One Federal judge in New York heard a case, and that judge says that the case was based on ``harassment and discrimination based on her perceived disability.'' I'm not sure this judge is qualified, but most of the Senate does because it was Judge Michael Mukasey, who is now the President's nominee to be Attorney General of the United States. This doesn't create new confusion; it simply restates an existing principle. 
   On free exercise of religion, the gentleman from California is correct. There was some debate about the proper scope of the free exercise provisions in the underlying bill. Mr. Miller's amendment, which we will hear shortly, imports precisely the same standard that has existed for the exercise of religion for the last 42 years under title VII. 
   The gentleman raises questions about marriage and says this is a radical attempt or a first step in a radical attempt to redefine marriage. Mr. Miller's amendment will make it clear that precisely the opposite is true. Mr. Miller's amendment will take the language that was approved by the House, signed by President Clinton, in the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines for Federal law purposes marriage as one man and one woman and import it into this bill. 
   Finally, the gentleman says this is a sweeping departure from civil rights laws. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a departure from civil rights laws. It's an inclusion of millions of Americans who should have been included for a very long time. It's a question of simple fairness. It's a question that says if you are a computer programmer or a bus driver or a carpenter, your job situation should be based on how well you drive the bus or how well you can program the computer, not on your sexual orientation.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Chairman, the record should reflect some accuracy in the point two of our friends just made that the proposition that the display of a religious artifact such as a Bible in and of itself creates a hostile work environment. There is not a shred of that in this bill, nor is there a shred of case law anywhere in the 42-year history of title VII that supports that claim. The majority certainly is welcome to supplement the record if we are wrong. I just don't see it.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this well-thought-out amendment from Chairman Miller and Mr. Stupak. I think it quite fairly addresses some of the concerns people have raised. 
   First, with respect to religion, on October 3, 2007, the president of Wheaton College wrote to our colleague, Mr. Walberg from Michigan. President Litfin worried about the scope of the religious exemption in the underlying bill, and here is what he said: ``I urge you to remove the problematic religious definition language currently in ENDA and ensure that the act categorically exempts religious organizations as in section 702(a) of title VII of the Civil Rights Act.'' 
   Here is what the amendment in front of us says: ``This act shall not apply to a corporation, association, educational institution, or society that is exempt from the religious discrimination provisions of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 pursuant to section 702(a),'' precisely what was asked for. 
   Second, I have heard concerns that there is preferential treatment or special rights for persons protected under this bill. The gentleman and others should read page 8 of the underlying bill, subparagraph (f), which is captioned ``No Preferential Treatment or Quotas.'' Let me read from it: ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed or interpreted to require or to permit any covered entity to grant preferential treatment to any individual or any group because of the actual or perceived sexual orientation of such individual.'' 
   It's helpful to read the bill. 
   Finally, we have heard suggestions that somehow the institution of marriage is undermined. It's very important to read the second part of Mr. Miller and Mr. Stupak's amendment, subsection (c) and I will read it: ``As used in this Act, the term `married' or `marry' refer to marriage as such term as defined in section 7 of title I,'' which is the Defense of Marriage Act which explicitly defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. 
   These were concerns that were raised. They are met. I respect and appreciate the fact that the ranking member of the full committee will vote ``yes'' on this amendment. So will I, and so will an overwhelming majority so we can proceed to passage of this bill with a strong bipartisan majority. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding and commend Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad for bringing this bill to our attention. 
   Someone who is struggling with substance abuse addiction or bipolar disorder, they shouldn't be under a different set of rules for getting their bills paid by their insurance company than if they had a knee injury. That is what this is about. If you have a $500 deductible for knee surgery, you ought to have a $500 deductible for your care for alcoholism or drug treatment or bipolar disorder. The insurance industry would be required to do that under this provision. 
   What would be wrong with that? Why would people be concerned about this? The first argument that we have heard is that there is a defined set of benefits that would have to be offered here to protect people with mental health and substance abuse issues. Well, there is a reason for that, because the insurance industry in this country has made it a practice of telling us what they don't cover. It is a cottage industry for people to find out that procedures are experimental or there is not enough justification. People find out every day that coverage they thought they had is no longer covered. 
   The second objection we hear from people is that this costs too much. That directly contravenes the evidence. As a matter of fact, the evidence shows over the long haul this saves money. And in the worst case scenario, the premium increase because of mental health parity laws is 0.6 percent per year, a minimal cost that is far outweighed by the benefit. 
   Finally, we hear concerns about small businesses. This provision exempts small businesses of 50 and fewer employees. 
   This is simple good sense. It says that a substance abuse problem or mental health issue should be treated under the same rules for getting your bill paid by your insurance company as a knee operation would be. Mental illness and substance abuse reaches across racial lines, class lines, religious lines, and geographic lines. It reaches into many, many families, including families represented in this institution. 
   This is a reform that is long overdue. It is why it is a reform that has support from both Republicans and Democrats. I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a commonsense step towards helping families across this country and vote ``yes'' on this much-needed piece of legislation.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the Education and Labor Committee's time. 
   My friend from California says that mental health parity is a goal that he lauds. Well, it's a goal that we should achieve right here, right now, today, by passing this bill. 
   We've heard the argument that the bill establishes preferential treatment for people with mental health and substance abuse issues, exactly the opposite of the truth. The bill establishes parity and equal treatment between mental health and substance abuse and physical and surgical benefits. 
   We've heard the concern that medical management practices that control costs have been taken out of the bill. What is also true, however, is that nothing in present law, nothing in the status quo precludes medical management practices that are useful in offsetting costs. There is nothing that prohibits that. 
   Finally, we hear that there is a concern that employers confronted with the defined benefit package, with the guaranteed rights of the insured under this will drop coverage. In States that have similar provisions, there is not a shred of empirical evidence that that is the case. Where State laws extend robust protections to mental health and substance abuse benefits, employers have not dropped mental health coverage; in fact, it has expanded. 
   This is the right time for the right bill. Its cost is minimal, its benefit is great, its support is bipartisan, and its time for passage is now. 
   I would urge each of our colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to join this bipartisan coalition and vote ``yes'' on the legislation offered by Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, you're 6 months away from your 58th birthday, and the place where you have worked for 25 years closes and you have no health insurance. So you dip into your savings and you figure out a way to keep yourself in the plan that you were in by paying for it largely with your own money. 
   Under present law, when you hit your 59th birthday, if you don't have another job with health insurance, you're out, and you have got 6 years to go until you qualify for Medicare. We are changing that in this bill. 
   Here's what this bill says. That person I just described, if they can figure out a way to stretch their savings and stretch their dollars until they're 65 years old, can enroll in Medicare and never have a gap where their family is left unprotected, with their own money by and large. 
   Now, the credits that are generously extended here, we wish we could do more, but this is a program that makes common sense for the person who is too young to retire and too old to start all over again. It's the person who's working with a good job and health care and good benefits, who's now working part-time at a retail store because that's the best he or she can do. What is wrong with that? 
   This is an opportunity for the Members of this Congress to stand up for forgotten Americans who built this country, raised their families and paid their taxes. This should not be a Republican and Democratic issue.

   Madam Speaker, I would urge our colleagues in both the Republican and Democratic Parties to vote ``yes'' in favor of this bill. 
   The opponents have raised two arguments. I believe both of them are wrong. 
   The first is that the bill repeals or eliminates the statute of limitations. This is not correct. What is, in fact, correct, is that once 180 days have passed from the final act of discrimination, the final tainted paycheck, then the plaintiff's claim would be barred. 
   The second argument that has been raised by the opponents of the bill is that there would be a flood of litigation and a flood of claims that would vex employers across the country. 
   This is not so. We are restoring the law as it has existed for more than three decades. During those three decades, there was no such flood or plague of litigation. 
   This conclusion is borne out by the Congressional Budget Office, which, in analyzing the costs of this bill, concluded that there would be no appreciable increase in the number of claims filed with the EEOC. 
   So, for these reasons and others, the arguments raised against the bill are invalid. Members should vote ``yes'' in favor of the bill.

   Madam Speaker, this is a narrow bill that supports a very broad principle. The broad principle is that discrimination has no place in the lives of Americans. 
   This House has people working in it whose families came here who could not speak English but now their sons and daughters write the law. This House has people in it whose ancestors were brought here as slaves but now who write the law of the land. And this House has one person in it whose grandmother could not vote but who now is the woman who is Speaker of the House of Representatives. When we eliminate discrimination, great things happen in America. When we restore discrimination, America moves backwards. 
   This country is bigger and stronger than the worst thoughts of any bigot. Discrimination has no place in our law, no place in our hearts, and no place because of technicalities. Vote ``yes'' in favor of restoring this strong tool against discrimination.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would like to begin by thanking Mr. Keller for his strong statement of support of the legislation, Mr. Duncan for his very vigorous advocacy of this bill, Mr. McKeon for his cooperation in getting it here today, obviously Chairman Miller for his leadership, and especially my friend and colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee). 
   For Mr. Kildee, this has been a 12-year effort, an endurance test, where he has built a coalition of all different kinds of groups across party lines and around the country for a very worthy piece of legislation. So Mr. Speaker, I would commend my good friend for his persistence and congratulate him on a job beautifully done on this legislation. 
   There is a strong bipartisan consensus for this legislation because it's all about common sense. 
   Mr. Speaker, most Americans would agree that, almost without exception, every American should have the right to bargain collectively and organize and join or not join a union. This legislation gives that right to our career firefighters, police officers, emergency service personnel, corrections officers, and other public safety officials.     
   There is a commonsense consensus that because of the significant work that these individuals do, they should not have the right to strike if there is a difficult contract negotiation. Under this bill they do not. There is not a right to strike created by this bill because we recognize the difficulty that strikes would create in the public safety field. 
   There is a commonsense consensus that there should not be a one-size-fits-all national rule to govern police officers, firefighters and public safety personnel in each of the 50 States and other jurisdictions. That is not what this bill does. 
   It creates a set of standards. It says that if a State and local jurisdiction meet those standards, then public sector collective bargaining laws stay in place without exception or change. But it says, in those States with the right to bargain collectively, the right to organize, the right to grieve are not fully recognized, where those States do not come up to standard, then there is a new Federal procedure that would guarantee men and women these rights. 
   The critics of this legislation say it is a threat to public safety. There is not a shred of evidence that that is the case. Not a shred. There is not a difference in crime rates where there is collective bargaining among public safety professionals. There is not a negative difference in absenteeism or other chain-of-command type of issues. 
   Frankly, we saw a dramatic example of just how wrong that point of view is. On September the 11th, the police officers and firefighters and other public safety personnel in and around New York City, the Port Authority, the New York City Fire Department, the New York City Police Department, those public safety professionals who responded to this great crisis were all unionized. Many of them were in the middle of a difficult contract process where there was strong disagreement between the City of New York and the union as to what to do next. 
   Not one of those men or women failed to respond nobly and heroically to the crisis this country faced. Not one. When they went up the stairs in the towers as they were about to crumble, no one talked about whether they were in a union or not. When the New York City Fire Department lost more people in 1 day than it previously had done in months and years before that, no one talked about a contract dispute. These individuals responded nobly and heroically. So the suggestion that there is some corrosion of public safety because of unionization is unsupported by the evidence and just flat-out wrong. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Kildee for the strong bipartisan coalition he has built. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor of this bill.

   Section 8(a)(2) of this bill says that nothing in this act or the regulations issued under this act shall be construed to prevent a State from enforcing a State law which prohibits employers and labor organizations from negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of employment.  
   This bill expressly preserves the rights of States to maintain so-called right-to-work laws in their State. I want the record to reflect that point, that the gentleman's concerns about the Georgia Constitution are met in this bill.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   This amendment seeks in 7 minutes to undue 72 years of labor law. For 72 years, it's been the law of the land that if an employer and an employee organization voluntarily choose to engage in collective bargaining, they're permitted to do so. This is a process that has led to labor harmony, economic prosperity and growth for the economy. Why we would even consider prohibiting that kind of arrangement from going forward is beyond me. 
   So I would urge the defeat of the amendment on grounds that it rather recklessly undoes a 72-year process that's worked quite well for both labor and management.

   This is something we do need and we can afford. Higher college scholarships for American students, lower school loan interest rates for American students. And it is paid for, unlike their massive spending increase, unlike their tax break giveaways to the wealthy, this does not increase the deficit by a dollar. We are changing their failed policy of buying things we don't need at prices we can't afford. They should vote for that change today.

   Mr. Speaker, nearly 10 years ago, I sat on this floor and listened to speeches like the one my friend from Texas just gave, and we voted to raise the minimum wage. And what happened?  Unemployment went down. The economy grew. And America prospered. It will happen again if we pass this increase in the minimum wage. There have been many days since that day nearly 10 years ago. One of those days when the prescription drug bill was on the floor, the industry came, and it wanted special protection from lawsuits and special pricing. It was their day, and they got it. 
   When the energy bill was on the floor, the energy companies came in and wanted massive subsidies, and no crackdown on pricing. It was their day, and they got it. 
   When the tax bill was on the floor, the wealthiest people in the country, people making more than $300,000 a year wanted massive tax breaks. It was their day, and they got it. 
   I am sorry to disappoint the opponents of the minimum wage, but this is not your day. This is the day for the people who empty the bed pans, change the bed linens, sweep the floors, and do the hardest work of America. After a 10-year wait, even though they don't have the lobbyists here, even though they don't have the political action committees here, this is their day. 
   This is the day we are going to raise the minimum wage, change the direction of the country, and restore economic fairness for the American economy. Join with Republicans and Democrats and independents across this country. Vote ``yes'' on the increase in the minimum wage.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, this debate is about a promise broken and a promise kept. When President Bush ran for President the first time in 2000, he promised to make the maximum Pell Grant $5,100 per year. Today, the maximum Pell Grant is $4,050 per year. It is true that the erstwhile majority spent more money on Pell Grants, but it is also true that many, many more people were eligible for Pell Grants and the value of the Pell Grant shrunk during the tenure of the erstwhile majority. The new majority is keeping a promise to significantly reduce student loan rates for students across this country. And we are keeping, in my view, a more important promise, to pay for keeping that promise by not adding to the deficit. 
   Unlike the tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country, this bill doesn't add to the deficit. Unlike the seemingly endless misadventure in Iraq, this bill doesn't add to the deficit. Unlike the huge tax breaks for the energy industry at a time when they receive the most profit in their history, this bill doesn't add to the deficit. The ways that this bill is paid for invite careful review of how we balance the direct and private loan programs and they invite careful review of how we adjust the present programs. But this bill is paid for. 
   This is the change that the American people voted for, help for the middle class, not increasing the deficit, and pay-as-you-go. I am delighted to hear that at least two of our colleagues on the other side will vote ``yes'' on this bill. I hope, Madam Speaker, that dozens or even hundreds of our colleagues on the other side will join us in voting ``yes'' in favor of middle-class students and deficit reduction.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of this legislation. In 2002, 5 years ago, NIOSH, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, discovered a link between a dreadful disease called popcorn lung that literally eats away at the tissue of a man or a woman's lung and diacetyl. A lot has happened in the 5 years since then. Hundreds of people have been severely sickened. A significant number of people have died. 
   In 2003, NIOSH recommended that manufacturers using diacetyl adopt certain standards to protect workers against popcorn lung disease. 
   In 2004, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, the trade association of the affected industry, voluntarily adopted certain recommendations that employers and manufacturers do what they could to protect workers against popcorn lung. Very recently, under the leadership of Subcommittee Chairwoman Woolsey, who called attention to the issue, the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections drafted a piece of legislation. 
   Some good things happened. The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association said, ``We agree with the legislation. We want OSHA to act to protect these workers as a matter of law, not a matter of courtesy.'' 
   The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association was joined by the industrial hygienists, the experts in this matter, by the physicians, the American College of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, by the public health experts, the American Public Health Association, by the voice of organized labor, the AFL-CIO, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the Teamsters, the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union and the American Society of Safety Engineers. 
   So, the manufacturers agree that OSHA ought to act, the physicians agree that OSHA ought to act, the industrial hygienists agree that OSHA ought to act, the labor unions agree that OSHA ought to act, and the American Association of Safety Engineers agrees that OSHA ought to act. All these things have happened in the last 5 years. But one thing has not happened. OSHA has not acted. So, today, we will act. 
   This is a case of administrative malpractice. This is a case of an administrative agency that is given the responsibility under the law to protect working Americans. After 5 years of evidence, after the unanimous judgment of doctors, hygienists, the trade association, organized labor, after 5 years of unanimous judgment that it is time for OSHA to act, OSHA still has not acted. 
   Now, the normal course, Mr. Chairman, is to wait for the administrative agency to make up its mind. We have already followed that course. We have waited for 5 years as hundreds of people have been sickened and a significant number of people have passed on. The time to wait is over. The time to act is now. 
   I urge our Republican and Democratic colleagues to join with doctors, industrial hygienists, the manufacturers association, organized labor, and the Public Health Association and say to OSHA, stop this administrative malpractice. Enact a standard and protect these workers against this dreadful disease. 
   I would like to congratulate Chairman Woolsey, Chairman Miller and the other leaders in this effort and urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the person who is being helped and touched by this bill is someone we all know. He is a person who comes home from work and is confronted with the heartache that his son or daughter is dealing with the ravages of clinical depression. And they are worried about it, but they feel secure because they say at least we are insured. At least we can take care of her. 
   Then they find out that there is a $10,000 deductible before the insurance company will pay for the visits. Or they find out there is a $5,000 limit on how much care can be received. 
   If their daughter had broken her knee, there would be a $100 deductible and no limit on the care. But because she is dealing with clinical depression or a substance abuse problem or another mental illness, they are conscripted and limited. This person is who will be helped by the efforts of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad. 
   This bill is long overdue, and it will save the system money. More importantly, it will bring justice and fairness to people like the family I talked about in these remarks here today. 
   I congratulate Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ramstad on bringing together this broad coalition. I urge both Republicans and Democrats to vote ``yes'' on this worthy legislation.

   We have sent the best men and women in the world to execute the worst policy in the world, and finally this House of Representatives is representing the will of the American people. They say fund the troops, and we do. They say change the policy, and we do. And they say let the Iraqis take responsibility for ending their own civil war, and we do.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'd first like to begin by sincerely congratulating the chairman of the committee and the ranking member from Wisconsin for, I think, a very thoughtful and substantive approach to a very serious set of problems. I think that the tone and quality of the debate on the House floor this afternoon has served the country well and has served the institution well, and it is entirely owing to the leadership of the chairman and ranking member and the men and women who serve the Members' committee so well, and I appreciate that. 
   I strongly support the gentleman from South Carolina's (Mr. Spratt) budget. I think it's the right thing for the country based upon an analysis of facts, choices, and consequences. The most important factual reason that the gentleman from South Carolina's (Mr. Spratt) budget benefits and strengthens families in our country is it operates on the principle that American families operate under, which is you can't live on borrowed money forever. You can't run your credit card up forever and hope that you win the lottery someday to get yourself out of that mess. The gentleman from South Carolina's (Mr. Spratt) budget, just as American families do across this country, recognizes the reality that you have to make choices. 
   Now, the other fact that I think is very important that Members realize is that this budget does not have a tax increase for anyone this year or anyone next year or anyone last year. One of our friends on the other side, Mr. Chairman, said that this was deja vu, this budget. She was exactly right because most of us were here almost exactly a year ago and heard a ritualistic incantation from the minority side that this was the largest tax increase in American history, the largest tax increase in the history of the world, the largest tax increase in the history of the universe, the largest tax increase in whatever's larger than the universe. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'd just invite the people of this country to evaluate the validity of that claim. When they sit down and fill out their tax return this year, they should ask themselves the question, did my income tax rates go up? No, they didn't. Did the capital gains tax rates go up? No, they didn't. Did the excise taxes go up? No, they didn't. And the same answer would be true for this year and the year after that. 
   Now, I am sure, Mr. Chairman, that people listen to this debate and they say, how can this be that the Democrats get up and say there are no tax increases in this budget and the Republicans get up and say it's the largest tax increase in the history of civilization or whatever the latest version of it is? Here's the answer: 
   In 2010 the tax cuts enacted earlier in this decade expire, and the Congress will have to make a choice. Until then, there is no tax raised on anyone for anything. When that day occurs, this budget contemplates that we will do what families across the country do and make an intelligent decision. If the economy bounces back and grows, there's a very good chance there will be plenty of revenue to renew all of those tax cuts. If it doesn't, then the Congress has the choice of reducing spending in given areas to finance tax cuts for all or some of the people who would be affected. 
   But what we will not do is what the erstwhile majority elevated to an art form during its reign, which is to borrow the money to pay the bills. We won't indebt the children of this country to the People's Republic of China and our other creditors because we don't have the discipline to make a decision here. 
   There's a big choice. Our budget believes that the economy grows and American families prosper by stopping the practice of borrowing money to run the government, by investing in the education and health care and development of our people, and by expanding economic opportunity. We believe that works. 
   The other side, with great sincerity, believes that massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people will trickle down to the rest of us and that will work. 
   This is the big choice we have to make, but there is a record for this choice. We do not have to make this choice in the empty vacuum of political theory. You see, because we tried their way for 6 years when they had control of both Chambers and the White House, and our strategy of stopping the practice of borrowing money, investing in people, expanding economic opportunity is what we tried for most of the 1990s, and there's a record. They created some jobs through their strategy. But for every one job they created, we created five. There was some economic growth under their strategy, but for every dollar of economic growth they created or facilitated, we created a dollar and a half. 
   What was the impact of their strategy on the American families that this budget supports? Well, over a 6-year period, the purchasing power of a typical middle class American family shrunk by $1,100. During the years in which our strategy was the policy of this country, the purchasing power of a middle class family increased by $6,000.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Yes. 
   Reclaiming my time, it's also the case that every single Republican there in 1993 voted against the plan that put that into effect and, therefore, they have no ownership. 
   So I would say the record is very, very clear, that I think our friend from Wisconsin and his fellow colleagues on the committee are very well intentioned about the policy they followed to help American families. I just think they're wrong, and I think the record shows that they're wrong. 
   Now, what are some of the consequences in this budget between their way and our way? Well, one of them is the issue of middle class tax cuts. Now, they are going to say that all these middle class taxes are going to go up. 
   Here's the reality: The budget contains what we call a reserve fund for the purpose of financing middle class tax cuts. And, again, when we reach that point, we will make a decision as to how best to preserve those, either based upon growth in the economy, which we certainly hope will occur, in offsets in spending, which we are prepared to make, or in other sources of revenue which we have brought to this floor before.     
   Look at the issue of children's health care. Last year, we attempted to provide health insurance for 5 million additional children. These are the children of people that work in convenience stores, gas stations and retail stores. These are very hardworking people who are struggling to get ahead. And there is a program that has worked very well since 1997 to help those families and their children. Now, we wanted to expand that coverage to 5 million more children, and we paid for it. A great number of Members on their side voted for this, and a great number of Members of the other body on their side voted for this, but not quite enough, because we ran into a Presidential veto, and we couldn't quite override it here. 
   Our budget will do the same thing. It will say let's find health insurance for  5 million more children who do not have it, and let's pay for it. Let's not pay for it by borrowed money. 
   For those who are trying to live by collecting child support enforcement, there are more resources for it. For those women who are pregnant or have small children and want to promote their well-being, there is more money for it. For Americans struggling to deal with getting by and paying the grocery bills on food stamps, there is more resources for this. Public health issues, whether it is the spread of disease or the prevention of disease, there is more resources for this, as well. 
   This budget proceeds on the powerful principle on which American families proceed. Don't try to survive on borrowed money forever. It puts us in position to make difficult and sometimes unpopular choices. It does not raise taxes on anyone in the fiscal year that is in front of us, and it makes investments in the strategy for economic growth that has worked in the past and we believe will work again. 
   I know that the gentlelady from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) who is new to the institution, but in no way new to serving her constituents, has a special concern about block grants. I would like to encourage her to engage in a colloquy at this time.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding and I rise in strong support of her legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no disagreement that we should do only what is right for our troops in the field and keep them safe, but there is a disagreement over the meaning of article I of the Constitution of the United States. 
   Conduct of the foreign policy of this country is not the exclusive purview of the executive branch, but for too long in this institution we have behaved as if it is. So this bill says that it is about time that the Congress of the United States took on our responsibility for assessing the problems in Iraq, took on our responsibility to provide for the common defense. Not to be a spectator as the executive branch makes these decisions in isolation but to be a thoughtful and full partner in that decision-making process. 
   It is very important for the Members to understand that if the President feels that there is an impairment to the national security of the country, he has the authority to waive the provisions of this bill. But, absent that, he should abide by it.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my chairman for yielding. 
   I would like to thank and congratulate him and Mr. McKeon and Mr. Sensenbrenner and others for their hard work on this. Mr. Hoyer in particular. 
   Words have meaning. And when the original Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted, the word ``disability'' had a commonsense meaning. It meant if someone had a substantial impairment, mentally or physically, that would interfere with their ability to do something important, that was a disability. I think a hundred of Americans, if you stopped them on the street and asked them if they agreed with that, they would say ``yes.'' Unfortunately, not enough of those Americans served on the United States Supreme Court, and we wound up with a tortured rendition of the definition of ``disability'' where people that we clearly would think were disabled were excluded from the protections of this law. 
   The authors of this bill worked long and hard to clear up that confusion and strike the right balance between the opportunities of Americans with disabilities and a fair set of ground rules for employers and other institutions in our society. I believe this legislation clearly strikes the right balance. 
   Something else is very important, too. It liberates the talents of people who have been heretofore kept out of the workplace and out of other institutions: the person in a wheelchair who might be the best computer programmer, the blind person who might be the best financial analyst, the person with tuberculosis who might be the best financial planner or health care technician. The talents of these individuals have too often been kept out of the fray.  
   This bill will put them back in the fray, put them back on the playing field and help not only Americans with a disability but all of us who will benefit from the liberation of their talent. 
   I congratulate the authors and urge a ``yes'' vote on this necessary and important piece of legislation.

But they can't send her to the pediatrician because they do not have enough money left in the family budget this week and they have no health insurance. 
   The question before the House is whether or not to provide health insurance for that family and that little girl. Yes or no? 
   The bill says ``yes.'' It pays for it responsibly by a modest increase in the cigarette tax and by eliminating subsidies to health insurance companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from South Carolina, the chairman, for producing an excellent budget for which every Member should vote. 
   Responsible people do not pay their bills by borrowing from their children. Responsible people analyze what they can afford, spend only that and save what they can. 
   For too long, this Congress has labored under a culture of irresponsibility: focus on the next election, spend what you want to, hand out tax cuts to your supporters, and let someone else worry about it down the line. 
   This budget ends that culture of irresponsibility, and it stands for one clear principle over and over again. We will not run this government on borrowed money, period. We wish to double the number of children covered by the children's health insurance program and we will. But when we do so, we will pay for it without borrowing more money. 
   Most of us absolutely are committed to extending the tax breaks for middle class families that help them survive, but when we do so, we will do so without borrowing more money from the Chinese, from the Germans, and from our grandchildren. 
   The easy thing to do around here is to spend more, tax less and borrow more. What it gets you is higher mortgage rates, higher car loan rates, more unemployment, more debt and no explanation whatsoever to the next generation in this country. 
   Today marks a turning point away from the culture of irresponsibility, toward a culture of responsibility for the future of people of this country. 
   I urge both Republican and Democratic Members to vote ``yes'' on this budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, by vetoing this bill, the President refuses to sustain the troops that we have sent to Iraq. Every dollar they need, every ounce of protection they need, and the health care they need when they come home is in this bill that he has vetoed. We refuse to sustain a failed, endless policy that takes us nowhere. 
   The President refuses to acknowledge the reality that we have sent our sons and daughters to be referees in a bloody civil war. We acknowledge that reality, and we want to stop it. 
   The President refuses to acknowledge the comments of General Petraeus, who says that ending this civil war is a political mission, not a military one. We acknowledge that reality, and we provide the tools to achieve success in that political mission. 
   Today the President has refused to acknowledge the will of the American people, but we are expressing the will of the American people. 
   We will vote to override this veto, and the result will obtain. But we will never yield, never quit, never back up in this effort to change this failing policy and bring our troops home from Iraq. 
   Vote to override this veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I would like to add my voice in congratulations to Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Chairman Miller, and Mr. McKeon for their outstanding cooperation in this regard. 
   Today is Constitution Day. Over 200 years ago, the Constitution of our country was ratified. As majestic a document as it is, it has been an imperfect delivery and realization of that document because, over time, people have been left out of its benefits and privileges. Throughout our history, people with a disability have been among those left out of the many privileges of governments and economy in our country. 
   In 1990, the Congress, under the first President Bush, took a major step forward in remedying that injustice and discrimination. But sadly, since 1990, erroneous court decisions have stripped persons with a disability of the rights that they thought they had under that 1990 law. 
   Today we are working together to remedy that problem and fix it. This is a victory for common sense and for merit over ignorance and obliviousness. More importantly, it's a victory for human beings who will be very profoundly helped by this law. 
   There was a man who got a job with a major retail corporation in this country, and he's diabetic. When he first started work, his supervisor understood that for this worker to be productive, he needed a special lunch break in the middle of his work day so he could deal with his blood sugar needs and stay healthy and be productive. 
   So the man gets a new supervisor. The new supervisor comes in and doesn't understand that need, doesn't permit the lunch break, and the man's unable to do his work. So he files suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the court says he doesn't win the case because he's not disabled. Diabetes is not enough of a disability to remedy this person's concern. 
   Now that's just wrong. And the other body understands it, both parties in this body understand it, the American people understand it. 
   What we have done in this Act is to restore the commonsense, meaningful definition of what ``disability'' means, not so that people with disabilities get special privileges, but so they get the same rights and opportunities that everybody else is guaranteed in this country under the law. 
   Again, I congratulate Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Sensenbrenner, in particular, for working together and bringing together a broad coalition behind this bill. And on this Constitution Day, the House will set a mark in history and continue the progress so that people who work with a disability can achieve and thrive and succeed in our country and in our economy. 
   I would urge both Republicans and Democrats to vote ``yes'' on this very substantial piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution because it provides the affirmation and the change that I believe we need in Iraq. The affirmation is essentially universal in this House. It is an affirmation that we are irrevocably committed to arm, support, equip, and protect the troops that we have sent to Iraq. We are committed to stand by the young men and women who have made the choice to make a sacrifice for this country. That issue is not an issue. 
   What is an issue is whether American policy is working in Iraq or failing in Iraq. I believe it is failing, and I believe that a vote for this resolution is a vote for change. 
   We have frequently heard, Mr. Speaker, from the minority side that they would like to hear a plan. With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, I suggest they start listening to this debate and to the American people. 
   Here is how you build a plan: First, you acknowledge reality by properly defining the problem. The administration persists in rhetoric that defines the conflict in Iraq as a struggle between forces of civilization on one hand and the forces which wrought September 11 on the other. To some extent this characterization is accurate, but to a great extent this characterization is inaccurate. 
   A significant portion of the violence in Iraq is not the result of Islamic violence against American troops, although it exists. A significant portion of the violence in Iraq is the result of sectarian violence, Shiia against Sunni, Sunni against Shiia, and occasionally others against the Kurds. This is not the position of the Democratic Party. This is the observation of the military and intelligence leadership in public documents of this country. Sectarian violence is the principal problem in Iraq. 
   If the problem in Iraq were that a fragile but legitimate young government was struggling to hang on but could not overcome the resistance, then this idea of a troop surge would make sense. The idea of sending more fighters to defeat the resistance would make sense. This is not the proper definition of the problem. The troop surge does not send more fighters to defeat the resistance. It sends more referees to inject themselves into the violence between Shiia and Sunni militia and warfighters. The problem in Iraq is largely, not exclusively but largely, how to stop the sectarian violence. 
   The second change that we must have is a change that vests the Iraqis themselves with the primary responsibility and eventually the exclusive responsibility to defeat that sectarian violence. Sending more American troops to do the job of the Iraqis is not the answer. Insisting that the Iraqis do their  own job, defend their own country, fight their own fight is the answer. 
   Now, the United States should not divorce itself from that effort. The United States, in my view, should not immediately vest the Iraqis with all that authority. But sending more young Americans to fight the fight for legitimacy of the Iraqi Government will not further the legitimacy of the Iraqi Government. It will defer it. It will weaken it. It will undermine it. There is one way, and one way only, to determine whether Iraqis themselves are willing to fight for this government, whether Shiia are willing to fight Shiia militia, whether Sunni are willing to fight Sunni militia. And that is to let them do it, not to give the job to more and more Americans. This is the change that we need. 
   And, finally, we need a change which recognizes that the principal problem in reaching a unity government in Iraq is political negotiation. Now, this is not to say that diplomats alone can solve this problem, but it is most certainly to say that if those who are vested in the outcome of this civil war are not brought to a conference table, brought to a negotiation, and compelled or encouraged to reach a solution, I doubt very much that it will come. 
   The United States has become the guarantor of the status quo in Iraq, and the status quo is failing. The best way to serve the interests of the American troops is to engage in the democratic debate for which they are fighting. Young Americans are fighting and dying so that Iraqis will have the right to debate their country's future. It would be sadly and bitterly ironic if we abrogated our responsibility to debate our country's future over what they should be doing in that country and how long they should be there.     
   If you want to serve the troops, have the debate. And if you want to promote the idea of avoiding failure in Iraq, then change the policy in Iraq. Do not sustain the status quo. I believe that if you want to change the policy in Iraq, voting ``yes'' on resolution 63 is the right first step. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to my friend from California (Mr. Schiff).

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, our friend, the ranking member of the full committee, just said that this bill repeals the statute of limitations. This is completely wrong. The bill does not repeal the statute of limitations for these claims; it restores the statute of limitations that has been in existence for nearly four decades under this law, an interpretation of the statute of limitations that virtually unanimously, in the Circuit Court of Appeals, has been held to be the law. 
   What is this standard? It says that if a person works in a workplace, as most workplaces are, where knowing what your coworker makes is discouraged or even prohibited, that if you're the victim of discrimination because of your race or your gender or your religion or your nationality, then you have the right to pursue that claim each time a new paycheck is issued that manifests and evidences that discrimination. This is not a novel theory. This has been the law for nearly 40 years. And this bill restores that law. 
   Second, our friends on the other side talk about these cataclysmic events that are going to occur if the law is restored, people filing suits 70 years after discrimination took place. What an odd plaintiff that would be, Mr. Speaker, someone who has been victimized for 60 or 50 or 40 years by discrimination, but because they want to game the legal system, sit and wait it out? I've never  met that plaintiff, Mr. Speaker, and I don't think anybody really has. 
   If all of these cataclysmic events were going to happen, why haven't they happened for the last 40 years? Why haven't people sued 40 or 50 years after discrimination took place? It's because that's not what this statute of limitations permits, and that's not human nature. 
   My friend makes reference, Mr. Speaker, to the worst case scenario. My friends, Lilly Ledbetter lived the worst case scenario. She worked for nearly 20 years for Goodyear. She was very good at her job. She got awards for being an excellent employee. Very late in her career she found out that she was making 20 percent less than the men doing the same job because she was a woman, so she went to the EEOC. She pursued her claim in Federal court. Goodyear stood up and said, oh, no; she was discriminated against not because she's a woman, but because she wasn't as good at her job as the men. And a jury of her peers heard that defense, heard that evidence, and ruled in her favor. 
   Up the ladder the case went to the United States Supreme Court, and the Court said, she may have been discriminated against, she may have been wronged, but she just didn't do anything about it soon enough; never mind that she followed the rules that had been in effect for nearly 40 years. 
   This is a restoration of the statute of limitations, not a new statute of limitations or an abrogation of it. And more importantly, it is a restoration of justice for people like Lilly Ledbetter who deserve better than this Supreme Court ruling and deserve the passage of this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Miller and Mr. McKeon for skillfully navigating this legislation to the floor, and I strongly support it. 
   Our country's economy has been severely affected by a lack of liquidity crisis. In plain language, people who need to borrow money to do good things who are creditworthy are having a very difficult time borrowing that money. 
   The early tremors are present in the education field that young men and women who need money to go to school are beginning to have trouble borrowing that money; and we are, frankly, concerned that an earthquake may follow those tremors. 
   Rather than wait for that disaster to occur, Chairman Miller and Mr. McKeon are taking preventive, action along with the Secretary of Education, to try to prevent such a calamity from occurring. 
   This legislation is commendable on any number of grounds. First, it strengthens the lender of last resort program so that guarantee agencies around the country will be equipped to quickly move capital to students and schools who find it difficult or impossible to get that capital from the banking institutions. Second, it increases the limits that students can borrow money that is guaranteed under the Federal guaranteed loan programs. 
   This is especially important, because so many of our students need what are called gap loans. This is the person who has an aid package of $28,000, but who needs 31,000 to go to school. In the past, the way families and students have dealt with this problem is to find a private lender to make a loan to fill that gap. There is increasing evidence that achieving that loan is increasingly difficult. By raising the loan limits in a fiscally responsible way, this bill alleviates that problem. 
   And, finally, by encouraging the growth of technological progress in the education sector, this bill ramps up the infrastructure that will be necessary to move loans to more students around the country as the time has come. 
   There is a lot of cynicism, Mr. Speaker, in this country about government, and some of it is quite justified. But I would hope that the cynics would watch the process that has occurred here where two leaders, one Democrat, one Republican, have come together, listened to the Secretary of Education, carefully analyzed the problem, and worked together to produce a piece of legislation that I believe will solve that problem. I commend them for their leadership. 
   I am proud to support this legislation, and I would urge Republicans and Democrats to vote ``yes.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of this legislation. I would like to thank all of those involved in bringing us to this point, Ms. Slaughter, Mrs. Biggert, and I especially want to mention Mark Zuckerman, Brian Kennedy, Michelle Varnhagen, and Carlos Fenwick from our staff who worked so hard on making this a reality. Thank you very much for your good work. 
   This is about as basic as it gets. It is a fundamental principle in this country that when you walk in and apply for a job, you shouldn't be judged on the color of your skin, your gender, your sexual orientation, your ethnicity, your age, or your religion. To that today we are adding the notion of your genetic background. 
   I think most Americans would understand as a matter of simple common sense that if your grandmother had breast cancer, it should be irrelevant as to whether you get a job or not. If your grandfather was diabetic, it should be irrelevant as to whether you get health insurance or not, and under what terms. 
   This simple, powerful, commonsense idea that is embodied in this legislation will become embodied in the law very shortly because of the good work that is being done here. 
   Beyond the basic fairness, the basic principle that we should be judged by our abilities and not by our characteristics, is the point that we discussed earlier during the rule debate. Many Americans justifiably fear that if they share their genetic information with  researchers, that information may wind up hurting them. It may wind up depriving them of a job, depriving them of health insurance, or raising their health insurance premiums. 
   The very significant protections that are in this bill, soon to become law, will provide a level of assurance for Americans that when we participate in genetic research, as I have by donating my DNA sample to the Coriell Institute in Camden, New Jersey, that we will be protected against misuse of that information. 
   This unlocks an exhilarating potential for finding the cure for all kinds of diseases and afflictions that have hurt so many people for so long. So I believe this is a singular achievement. It is an honor to be a part of it, and I know that generations of Americans will benefit not only from the simple fairness that this law will impose in the workplace, but for the great potential that this law will unlock for the investors and inventors and researchers of this country. 
   No American should ever be denied a job or health insurance or a promotion because of their genetic characteristics. Because of our actions today, this will become the law. 
   I thank the chairman for his leadership. I thank Mrs. Biggert for her leadership and Chairwoman Slaughter as well, and urge a ``yes'' vote in favor of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank and congratulate my dear friend from New York for a stellar achievement in her stellar work here in the Congress, and to thank Mrs. Biggert, who has fought with great vigor and enthusiasm for this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, here's what Ms. Slaughter and Mrs. Biggert have achieved. Somewhere this morning, a family is going to get news that a biopsy came back with bad news, that someone they love has a tumor, and that family is going to go through the agony of the next couple of months or even years of wondering if that person they love so much is going to live or die. 
   Now the progress we have made in this country, thank God, has let many more of those people live. But the ultimate progress is to get to the genetic puzzle that makes that person susceptible to that tumor in the first place. The way we are going to find the solution to that puzzle is by gathering data by more and more people being willing to share their genetic information with the brightest men and women in this country. 
   Right now there's a justifiable fear that if you share your genetic information, someone may misuse it to deny you a job, deny you an insurance policy, or hurt you in some other way. This bill lifts that burden, lifts that fear, and will stimulate millions of Americans to voluntarily, privately and safely participate so they can be part of finding this puzzle. 
   What Chairwoman Slaughter has accomplished today, Madam Speaker, is that some day is coming, and I hope it's soon, when people will get the right answer all the time to that question, when the cure will be here, the pain will be gone, and the hope will prevail. There's a lot of things we do in this  chamber that have transitory significance. What will happen in a few hours will benefit people around the world for years to come. 
   This is a singular achievement. I congratulate the chairwoman. And as a father and a husband, I thank her for what she's done.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, this resolution affirms the obvious and avoids the necessary. It is obvious that the common goal of the United States, the House, the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, is to avoid a failed state in Iraq. The Senate bill affirms this, the House bill affirms this, and I am supremely confident that the final conference report will confirm it as well. 
   The issue, as my friend the gentlewoman from California said, is how do we avoid a failed state in Iraq. Sadly, the record gives us many examples of what not to do. 
   When General Shinseki told the administration that his recommendation was to put 300,000 troops on the ground after Saddam fell, and the administration ignored that request, that is what not to do; when leaders who had studied Iraq in our State Department, our intelligence agencies and our Defense Department said abolishing the Iraqi Army and the Baathist Party in its entirety is the wrong thing to do, abolishing the Iraqi Army, abolishing the Baathist Party in its entirety was the wrong thing to do, it increased the risk of a failed state. 
   Now I heard my friend, the ranking member, talk about 11,000 Sunni generals, and he is right. The top of the Iraqi Army, the erstwhile Iraqi Army, the top of the Baathist Party should have either been put on trial, put in prison, or, at the very least, removed from those institutions. But the 85 to 90 percent who ran the sewer system and the train system and the bureaucracy of Iraq should not have been fired all at once. It was not the recommendation of the Secretary of State, it was not the recommendation of the intelligence community, but it's what we did, and it's how to create a failed state. 
   When voices within our government and around the world said that the right way to transition from Saddam's corrupt and evil regime to a new day was an internationally supervised political process, not listening to those voices was the wrong thing to do, and it increased the risk of a failed state. 
   So, yes, we know all sorts of things. We have learned all kinds of lessons about what not to do. 
   What should we do? Well, I think what we should do is insist that the Iraqi politicians do what American troops have done with such excellence, to execute the job they have been given. We are thankful that the level of violence has been reduced. We are very grateful for this, and we understand that the credit for that largely goes to the Americans in uniform and to their Iraqi partners fighting with them. We are very thankful for that result. 
   But we are also very mindful that the Iraqi politicians who have been given a golden opportunity to bring peace and stability to their country have utterly failed to do so. They have not passed a law dividing up the proceeds of their oil industry; they have not guaranteed minority rights in their government; they have not set up and established provincial elections and provincial governments. They have utterly failed to establish a stable government, because we have stood there and continued to hold their coats and let them suffer the delusion that America's sons and daughters will stay there forever. 
   If you want to avoid a failed state in Iraq, change that delusionary perception. Say to the Iraqi politicians, the  clock is running. The time is drawing nigh when our sons and our daughters will no longer referee your civil war. Negotiate an end to it, stop it, build a stable government. That is how to avoid a failed state. That is the policy underlying the policy of this majority. Frankly, it's a policy reflected in this excellent Armed Services authorization bill, which I hope will promptly be on the floor, promptly be on the President's desk, and promptly get about the business of serving the people who serve us so well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I would like to thank my friend from California for yielding. This bill is for the woman who runs the office, who makes all the important decisions, without whom the place couldn't function; who one day comes in and discovers that a man, usually a man younger than her, has been brought in and given a higher title, a higher pay, and fewer responsibilities. And she goes to work and says, this isn't fair. I'm doing a job that is actually more important than this other person and getting paid less for it. 
   Now it's true that the statutes presently say you have to get equal pay for equal work. But it's also true that the remedies are so limited under existing law that many women can't get an attorney to represent them in their case so it never gets brought. 
   The best idea in this bill is for the first time it gives robust and full remedies to help that woman so that if she is able to prove her claim that she is underpaid relative to the work that she is doing, she will be fully and fairly compensated, and out of that compensation will come the funds to get her the competent representation that she deserves. The woman who's the office manager who doesn't make as much as the executive vice president for administration. 
   Well, I will tell you, in my life, Mr. Chairman, I benefited from a lot of women who are office managers that don't have fancy titles but without whom institutions could not run. This bill is for that woman and for her daughters so that they do not have the situation where they are devalued, debased, degraded, and disrespected in the workplace. 
   It is long overdue that we vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I would urge colleagues on both sides to do that.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to this amendment because I believe it gives veto power over this legislation to the Secretary of Labor. 
   The premise of this amendment is we need to study more and let the Secretary of Labor decide whether we need stronger legal protections for women to earn equal pay for equal work. I don't think we need to study it at all. I think the fact that women are earning 77 cents for every dollar that a man earns is evidence of why we need this law. 
   I think the fact that 10 years out of college, when you adjust for different family factors such as child rearing, that women are earning, on the average, 12 percent less than men in similar professions shows that we need this law. 
   I think the fact that studies have shown that women are shorted millions of dollars, anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million over a lifetime because of inadequate enforcement of the law for equal pay for equal work, I think it makes it crystal clear that the idea of subordinating our responsibility and giving the Secretary of Labor the opportunity to subvert what we are doing here today is unjustified and unwarranted. 
   So I would urge the defeat of this amendment because I believe it is unnecessary, and I think it substitutes the judgment of the Secretary of Labor for the judgment of the elected representatives of the people. We should defeat this amendment, support this bill.

   People criticize the Congress, I think justifiably, because they think we don't get anything done and we can't ever agree with each other. Well, this bill shows that we can get things done and we can agree with each other. There are many strongly held opinions about the war in Iraq, pro and con. But I think there is unanimity. We should show the people who wear the uniform of this country our appreciation by raising their pay. And this bill does that 3.5 percent across the board. I think there is unanimity that when we send our young men and women into harm's way, they should have the best protection. And this bill puts $17.6 billion, the highest ever, into up-armored vehicles and protective gear for the troops in the field. I think there is unanimity that says that when someone is wounded in the service of this country, he or she should never be forgotten, ever, when they are in the VA health care system. So there is unanimity here for the Wounded Warrior Act. 
   This bill is well worth supporting because it shows the broad support in this Congress for the men and women who serve this country, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. Speaker, with governing comes responsibility. The responsible vote on this rule and this bill is ``yes.'' The minority has talked about responsibility for the military. They are right. That is why this body and the other body passed a Defense Appropriations bill, $459 billion to support the military. The other side talks about responsibility for reducing the deficit. They didn't reduce the deficit when they were in the majority. We are reducing it by passing a budget that puts us back on the path to a balanced budget. 
   We also have a responsibility to listen to the concerns that are being raised by the men and women that we represent. They are worried about gangs and drugs. So this bill puts 34 percent more money into drug courts, nearly doubles the amount of money being spent on police support programs around the country. They are worried about porous borders and people coming into the country illegally. So this bill puts 15 percent more into customs and border enforcement. They are worried about high heating costs, being unable to pay their utility bills. So this bill puts 21 percent more into the program that helps people pay their utility bills. 
   Finally, there is all this talk about supporting and saluting our veterans. This bill stops talking and starts acting with a request that matches that which the veterans service organizations of this country asked us for, the largest increase in veterans health care in the history of the country. The responsible vote is ``yes.'' The irresponsible political course is to complain. Let's do the country's business, pass this rule, and pass this bill.

   When the scientific community comes to you and asks you to participate in a genetic study that may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of AIDS or Alzheimer's or leukemia, you should be able to participate fully and freely without fear that your genetic information will be unlawfully and improperly shared with someone who wants to do the wrong thing with it.     
   This is a significant achievement, not only in protecting the working men and women of America from discrimination, but in empowering American scientists to achieve the maximum that we can from the promise of genetic medicine. 
   The bipartisan effort to support this bill will be vindicated year after year and case after case as Americans can work freely, can avoid discrimination, and as scientists can take the next step and the next step and the next step to unlock the keys to genetic medicine. 
   So I congratulate my friends, Madam Speaker, for their great work on this bill. I enthusiastically support it. I ask everyone to vote ``yes.''  
   I would like to note that the final version of H.R. 493 represents the input and compromises made by 3 committees of jurisdiction. 
   In particular, I would like to mention 3 critical compromises reflected in the final bill:

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation because where continuity is merited, we have continuity, and where change is demanded, we have change. 
   The continuity comes from the fact of a bipartisan consensus to provide every dollar that our troops in the field need, and this bill does that. That will not change. What must change, though, is the abrogation of constitutional responsibility by the erstwhile majority. 
   For over 3 1/2 years, the erstwhile majority, Mr. Speaker, vacillated between apology and inaction. Yes, the President is the Commander in Chief, but no President should be the sole source of law and judgment. And for nearly 4 years, the erstwhile majority sat silently by as the quagmire deepened. That is changing under this legislation. 
   What also must change is the policy itself. We have been asked what our plan was. Here it is. We say to the Iraqis, you promised to pass an oil law. Pass it. You promised to have local elections. Have those elections. You promised to stand up your own security and police forces. Put them into the fight. If you succeed, we will then stay for an 18-month period of time to facilitate your success, but if you fail, the days of the blank check and the endless commitment are over. 
   The erstwhile majority, Mr. Speaker, has a hard time recognizing this plan because they have no plan. Their only approach is to ratify the failure of the status quo. The troops in the field and the American people deserve much, much better, and that is what this legislation provides. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend from New York for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the outstanding athletes of the Lady Vols of the University of Tennessee for being outstanding students, outstanding athletes, and great representatives of their university in this country. 
   I must say, coming from New Jersey, as far as we were concerned, there were two champions playing in this championship game that took place. The Lady Vols won a decisive victory fair and square on the court, although those of us that are fans of Rutgers say we will be back next year to challenge again. 
   But I was in the chair when the Rutgers resolution passed last week, and I did not want to let this moment pass without adding my voice to acknowledge the championship quality of the young women on both of these teams. In New Jersey, we are particularly proud of the grace and dignity and class shown by the young women of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights basketball team. We think those characteristics are amply shared by the Lady Vols as well, and I just wanted to add my voice  of congratulations as the runner-up to the Lady Vols. But we believe that our young ladies, Mr. Speaker, from Rutgers are champions in every sense of the word.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Chair, I rise in support of this bill which I believe merits the support of Members of both parties because it makes three strategic judgements that are very sound and very right. 
   First, it makes the judgment that the highest priority of the Congress should be the pay, the benefits and the well-being of the families of the men and women who wear the uniform of the country. Together, as Republicans and Democrats, we're doing more in this bill than we've ever done before to serve those needs. 
   Second, this bill makes the right strategic judgment to deal with the urgent present needs of men and women in theater in the field. Yes, this is at the expense of future systems that will some day aid our competitive edge. And I believe in funding those systems. But the choice we need to make today is the up-armored vehicles, the weaponry, the training, the support for men and women in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the heat of battle today. This is the right strategic judgment. 
   Finally, this bill decides to take $764 million out of strategic missile defense, still giving the President 91.5 percent of what he asked for, and spending the money on securing loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union, spending the money on converting reactors that could be turned into bomb material in the former Soviet Union. These threats were identified as the principal threat to the national security by the 9/11 Commission. This is the right strategic judgment. 
   For these and many other reasons, I would urge both Democrats and Republicans to vote ``yes'' on this very fine bill.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I believe that it is in the interest of freedom-loving people around the world to deny the present regime in Tehran access to a nuclear weapon. 
   The amendment that I submit does not raise the issue of the propriety of Iran having a nuclear weapon. The amendment I submit raises the issue of the propriety of this coequal branch of our government asserting its proper constitutional authority. 
   My amendment contemplates, Mr. Chairman, the following circumstances, and I want to be very clear about this. If our troops in Iraq become involved in a fight that requires them to in some way engage, in order to defend themselves, Iranian personnel in a given situation, they have the right and power and authority to do so. 
   Mr. Chairman, if our planners on the military side, as part of their normal planning exercises, as they do throughout the world and around the globe, find it necessary to game out and analyze the circumstances under which we would prepare for conflict with Iran, they have the authority to do so. Any American soldier or servicemember under any circumstances has the authority to defend himself or herself, and the President has the authority to act under emergency or self-defense circumstances. However, in those circumstances under which the President would wish to initiate a major contingency operation in Iran, this amendment says he may not use funds which we have authorized and appropriated to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The amendment asserts the proper constitutional authority of this coequal branch of government. The Constitution vests us, as the duly elected representatives of the people, with the authority and responsibility to decide when this country will initiate hostilities in order to serve our national interest absent an emergency or a self-defense situation. This amendment preserves that emergency authority of the President. It preserves the self-defense authority of the President. But it properly asserts the duly assigned constitutional role of this branch to decide the circumstances under which we should go forward with a major contingency operation. 
   Mr. Chairman, whether Members believe that we should be more aggressive or less aggressive with Iran, they should support this amendment. Whether Members believe that we should pursue more active diplomacy or a different kind of diplomacy, they should pursue and support this amendment. The question here is not the proper policy with respect to Iran. The question here is the proper allocation of constitutional authorities between and among the branches. 
   I would urge both Republican and Democratic Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I reciprocate the respect expressed by my friend, the ranking member from California, and respectfully disagree with his interpretation of the amendment. 
   In a situation where we would want to interdict IEDs, there are two ways  that this bill makes it clear we could do so. The first is, under all of the other titles of this bill that fund all the other operations of our Armed Forces we would have the authority to do so. And second, such an example is not a major contingency operation in Iran under the contemplation of the bill. So we would absolutely have the ability to interdict the creation or transport of IEDs. 
   Second, with respect to a hostage situation, rescuing hostages is not planning a major contingency operation in Iran. Nothing would preclude our military personnel from executing such a mission should the need arise, either under this title or under the other titles of the bill. 
   So as I said in my opening remarks, it is clear to me that under emergency or self-defense circumstances, there are no limitations whatsoever. What this amendment does is to properly assert the constitutional authority of this coequal branch of government that if this country is to initiate hostilities, is to conduct a major contingency operation in Iran, the President must come to this body and ask for our permission. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would yield to my friend from Rhode Island.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   My friend from Florida a few minutes ago talked about a threat over the horizon. He is right, it is a threat, and it's over the horizon. This bill takes, to deal with that threat, for every $100 the President asks for, we give them $91.50 to deal with that threat. 
   We allocate that money in this way. We say for the technologies that are robust and mature and working, let's do more of it to protect us better and sooner. But for the technologies that are untested, let's test them and see if they work. 
   Now, what do we do with the $8.50 per $100 that we do not put into these untested technologies? We find what the 9/11 Commission has called the grave immediate threat to the country. A grapefruit-sized quantity of loose nuclear material, if made into a bomb by a terrorist group, could create a Hiroshima-type explosion in Times Square in New York City, or at the Washington Mall here in this city. 
   The administration is on a path to convert reactors that have that loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union to get them all done in the next 14 years. We don't think that's good enough. So we take the money and speed it up so those reactors will be converted and shut down sooner. That threat is not over the horizon. It is here today. 
   That is where we should be spending our money, and that is why this amendment should be defeated.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I oppose this amendment because I believe its provisions subvert the best hope for stabilizing Iraq and ending the Iraqi civil war. I believe that if the responsible Sunni and Shia leadership in that country believe that it will become their responsibility to reach a political settlement to the end of the civil war, they will do so. I believe they will never accept that responsibility if they believe that the presence of the United States is permanent and indefinite. 
   I think, as the base bill does, that making a statement that we do not wish to have permanent bases in Iraq supports this theory, and will bring about a greater probability of stabilization of Iraq and an end to the Iraqi civil war. 
   So I believe the amendment sends precisely the wrong message and I oppose it.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   One of the key determinants of the country's economic prosperity in the future and our ability to become less dependent upon imported fuel from around the world is our ability to develop alternative renewable fuels. 
   One of the most powerful tools at our disposal is the purchasing power of the Department of Defense. Presently, the Department of Defense spends in excess of $3 billion a year to buy electricity. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to codify a practice that the Secretary of Defense has already initiated, which is to increase the percentage of electricity purchased by the Department of Defense from the 9 percent, which it presently is, up to 25 percent by the year 2025. In order to do this, we believe that the Secretary of Defense should have flexibility. So the amendment provides that if the Secretary in his or her judgment believes that defense and security goals of the country would be in some way impaired by meeting this target, then the Secretary is authorized to waive this target. 
   We believe that with the adoption of this amendment and of these goals, we would generate a $15 billion market in the purchase of electricity generated by renewable fuels. We further believe that the entrepreneurial capacity of American scientists and entrepreneurs would generate products that would help fill this need. Once those products are available, they would then be widely available to the commercial and nonprofit and public sectors to help us greatly reduce our dependence upon nonrenewable fuels generally, and imported nonrenewable fuels specifically. 
   I would ask that the amendment be adopted. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this point in time I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, colleagues, our country is living on borrowed time. A quantity of highly enriched uranium or plutonium the size of a grapefruit that could be put into a vehicle the size of a U-Haul truck could result in the detonation of a nuclear weapon about the size of that which leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
   Loose nuclear materials have been too loose and too free for too long around the world. This was the first and most urgent recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. Frankly, we have been moving at too slow of a pace with too little of a focus and without sufficient funding to get this problem under control. 
   Today's long overdue legislation is a necessary first step toward protecting the American people against these egregious consequences. This legislation properly focuses on the problem of loose nuclear material, the origins of which and the whereabouts of which we do not know. It focuses upon nuclear material that is in hands that are not properly being secured, it focuses on nuclear materials that are being properly secured, and it expedites the process of converting reactors that use highly enriched uranium to reactors that would use low-enriched uranium and, therefore, be much, much less of a risk. 
   For the first time, there will be a central point in the executive branch where the diplomatic intelligence, research and development and military responsibilities for bringing this problem under control will be focused and centered in one place. 
   The job will not be done by the passage of this legislation. But for too long we have lived on borrowed time waiting for the passage of this legislation. I would urge my colleagues on both the majority and minority side to vote ``yes'' and start us down the road toward solving this egregious and urgent problem.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, I thank and congratulate my chairman and friend for this excellent piece of work. 
   When middle-class people, when police officers and real estate agents and computer programmers sit down to fill out the forms at the kitchen table and apply for financial aid, they end the process very frustrated because they quickly conclude there's nothing in there for them. After hours and hours of putting their tax returns forward, filling out forms, there's nothing in the financial aid laws for middle-class people. That's the way people feel. 
   This bill changes that. For the first time in a long time, there is aid to middle-class students under this bill, and here's the way it works.     
   When your son or daughter borrows money, and we wish there were less borrowing and more scholarships, but the reality is, given the fiscal constraints we have, there is going to be borrowing. When your son or daughter borrows money, their repayment of that loan will rise as their income does. So when they are new, they have their first apartment, their first car payment, other issues in their life, their payments will be low. But as their incomes rise, their payments will rise to pay their loans back. 
   This is a loan repayment program that works the way life does. You start out with a low income and a lot of obligations, and hopefully your income grows. When it does, your payments do; but if it doesn't, then your payments stay reasonable. 
   This is the way life works. This is the way the student loan program ought to work, and I commend the chairman for his leadership in making this happen and urge a ``yes'' vote for this bill.

   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding, and I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and his staff especially for their great work in bringing this to the floor. Thank you very much. And to Mr.  McCrery and to my friend Mr. Lewis for showing that when people from two parties come together in support of a good idea, it can happen. 
   This is what this bill is about: A person buys a house for $150,000 and has a $140,000 mortgage. And then bad times hit the neighborhood and the person can only sell the house for $130,000, but they still owe $140,000 on the mortgage. So they go to closing and they sell the house, but even after all the proceeds of the sale are paid, they still owe money on the mortgage. Now, someone is only going to do this because they have lost their job or had a health crisis or some other family crisis. By definition, this is an American family in some trouble. 
   If their lender says that they are going to write off that $10,000 that still is owed on the mortgage, if the lender says we are not going to bother to chase this person, usually because there is nothing to recover from, under present law the IRS would treat that family as having $10,000 worth of income. Now, they have no money in their checking account to pay it. They have no means to go earn the money. They owe a tax on money they never saw. 
   This is unfair, and it exacerbates the problem we see in the mortgage market right now. So Republicans and Democrats came together. We are thankful for the leadership of Chairman Rangel, and we have before us now a bill that will address in a fair and targeted way this problem. 
   I would also add I do appreciate the pay-for. I think we should pay for what we do here. And what this bill does is close a loophole. It basically says that everybody can get the $500,000 exclusion for the house they actually live in, but you can't take that for a property you don't live in. That seems pretty fair to me. 
   So, again, I thank people on both sides of the aisle for their support. I would urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, this week, the House has in front of it two well-thought-out but starkly different visions of where to take the country. We have put forward a budget that is true to our principles. We believe that you grow the economy and create opportunity for people by stopping the practice of running the government on borrowed money, by investing in the education, health care, and development of our people, and by expanding opportunities for economic development both here and around the world. 
   The minority, true to its principles, has introduced a budget which follows its strategy. I think this is a sincere and well-thought-out budget whose principles are just wrong. And if anything, I think that this budget is nostalgic because it does remind us of the 6 years in which the minority had the majority in both the House and the Senate and the White House. And it follows a tried and true, but failed, strategy, which is to say that you reduce taxes by more than you cut spending, and you borrow the difference. 
   Now, if I add this up correctly, in reading the minority's budget, it calls for spending cuts in the area of $800 billion over 5 years. Perhaps there's a different interpretation, but it would seem to me that there is entitlement spending reduction there and also discretionary. And it calls for reductions in revenue over a 5-year period in the vicinity of $1.2 trillion. So it would appear to me that there is about a one-third or $400 billion difference between the reduction in revenues that is called for and the reduction in spending that is called for. That is, if nothing else, traditional to the practice of borrowing money to run the government. 
   Second, I have a concern about the specificity of the spending cuts that are put forward. Our friend from Missouri, the minority whip, just talked about the instructions to cut spending in the Education and Labor Committee's area. And our friend said that, as a former university president, he would not first look to cut student loans as a way to deal with the cuts that are required under the minority's budget. Well, I would respectfully say to him, Mr. Chairman, through you, that to my knowledge there is only two other places one could look to find those cuts: The first would be in the pensions of Americans through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the second would be through the school nutrition program, through school breakfasts or lunches. 
   So, one can say that you don't want to cut student loans, but if you do, then you've got to turn either to the school lunch or breakfast program, or the pensions of Americans. 
   We, frankly, disagree with that approach. We took a very different approach on student loans, as the chairman said. What we did was to cut student loan rates in half and expand opportunities for Pell Grants and other scholarships, and we did so without borrowing money. What we did was to go after what we felt were unjustifiably high subsidies for the student loan banking industry. So, this example, I think, shows the difference in philosophies. 
   In order to finance tax cuts which are skewed toward the wealthiest in our country, the minority would borrow a substantial amount of money on top of the debt it has already run up, and it would pay for it in part by cutting either student loans, by raising interest  rates to students, or cutting school lunches and school breakfast programs, or somehow getting money out of the Pension Guaranty Corporation. We would not do that. What we did was to cut student loan rates in half, increase Pell Grants and other scholarship opportunities, and pay for it without borrowing money by reducing what we view as a corporate welfare subsidy to the student loan banking industry. 
   This is a very big difference. It's a legitimate difference. We think it's why the gentleman's amendment should be rejected.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (IRAN -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Madam Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks with words of appreciation for Mr. Robert Knotts, who served with distinction as my legislative director and who will be leaving our office next week to further advance his career. I want to express my appreciation to Robert, Madam Speaker, for the service he has given to our constituents and the fine work he has done as a member of this institution. 
   He has helped me prepare these remarks tonight, and I mean them in a heartfelt way to say thank you. 
   For the last 25 years, the regime in Iran has secretly and unlawfully commenced the process of acquiring a nuclear weapon. This is a grave threat to peaceful and freedom-loving people around the world. This is a regime headed by a president who just recently has said that one Holocaust was not enough, that we need another one; a regime headed by a president who said that Israel should be wiped off the face of the Earth; a regime that has flagrantly and blatantly disregarded international law in pursuing this weapon of mass death. 
   I believe that it should be a policy not only of our country but of freedom-loving nations around the world that this regime in Iran must never have a nuclear weapon that it could use against its neighbors or other peace-loving people around the world. It is truly a grave threat. In my view, Madam Speaker, it is a grave threat that calls for diplomacy, strategy, and cooperation, and not for a reckless rush into armed conflict. That is the purpose, Madam Speaker, of my remarks here this evening. 
   I am troubled by recent signs that I have seen from our administration with respect to the issue of Iran. Placement of naval assets in that area of the world is justified as a defensive measure, but I worry that it may be a provocative measure. The words of our President are words which can be taken, and I hope they are meant in the spirit of warning and cooperation, but they could also be taken in the spirit of provocation, and I hope and pray that they are not meant in that regard. 
   My principal message though this evening is not one about answering the question as to what we should do about the threat of a nuclear weapon in Iran. My principal message is to find who the ``we'' in that sentence is, what ``we'' should do about the question of nuclear proliferation in Iran. 
   The Constitution of this country vests the sole authority to declare war in the Congress of the United States of America. Our Presidents as commanders in chief have inherent authority to protect our country in time of emergency and to act in self-defense, but it is a clear principle of this Constitution that the power to initiate hostilities, the power to declare war, rests in this body and the other body.  
   I think it is imperative in the days and weeks ahead that in whatever forum, in whatever way, this House go on record as reaffirming that constitutional prerogative with specific reference to the issue of what we should do about Iran. 
   If there is to be consideration of military action involving Iran, in my judgment, such consideration would be reckless and premature at this time and under these facts. But if there is to be consideration of military action, it should be careful, deliberate, thoughtful consideration done under the auspices of this Constitution. 
   America's greatest resource in the area of national defense is the men and women who step forward voluntarily to serve this country and wear the uniform of this country. They step forward because of their faith that we are a country that follows the rule of law, and not the edict or desire of any one man or woman irrespective of what office he or she is elected to. It is my concern that that faith would be eroded and indeed misplaced if we do not follow the rule of law in this crucial instance. 
   This House needs to affirm our constitutional prerogative in this matter. There should be no consideration of the initiation of any preemptive hostilities against Iran or anyone else without the careful, thorough, constitutional consideration that such a question mandates and demands.

   First of all, as my friend Mr. McHugh just said, it is important to note that the drafters of this bill listened to the good work that was being done by the many, many men and women in the military health care system, in the veterans health care system. 
   The system has been beleaguered lately with terrible news reports of intolerable treatment of the wounded warriors of this country. We deplore those reports. We deplore the facts that gave rise to those reports. 
   But we do want to commend the vast majority of people who work in each of these systems for the great work that they do and acknowledge the contribution they make to our country. 
   The leaders of this bill listened, and I think they have come up with a great work product that will help. They have listened to the family of the warrior who has sat for too long on a bed unattended, who has languished for too long in a bureaucracy, forgotten about, whose care and whose future situation has not been given the attention it deserves. And by requiring a medical case manager and an advocate for each one of those persons, I think we will find that fewer people will be forgotten about and more people will get top-quality care. 
   This bill shows that its drafters have listened to those who have experienced the gaps in care and the frustration where there has not been a continuity of care when they were in the military health care system and then moved over to the VA health care system; that the care they are receiving, the diagnosis, the treatment is not consistent of someone who has had a good quality of care for a period of time, finds that interrupted and finds that to be inappropriate. This bill will establish means by which we can merge the best qualities of both systems and address the needs of that wounded warrior. 
   Finally, this bill deals with the outrageous inconsistency that so many people have experienced in the disability system, where the same injury under the same circumstances is treated one way in one system and another way in the other and where it takes months or even years to find out what your final resolution is going to be. So this is a bill that shows that we can listen to those concerns and address them. 
   As Mr. McHugh says, the bill is not perfect, but the bill is sound, because it listens to the very real concerns of the wounded warriors. It addresses them in a way that puts aside politics. I am proud to support this bill, and I thank the authors for this opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, just to save my good friend from Wisconsin the time, I represent a State where 7.5 million people will not see the repeal to their marriage penalty relief, a State where 7.5 million people will not see capital gains rates go back up under this budget, where 7.5 million people will not lose their child care tax credit, et cetera. Here is what these budgets say about taxes. 
   In 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, the present law remains in effect. There is no tax cut that was enacted that is modified, limited or repealed.     
   On December 31 of 2010, whomever is in control of this Congress will have a choice to make, and that choice will be which, if any or all, of the tax cuts should be extended beyond their expiration date. 
   Here is the difference between our budget and the President's Republican approach. We say that we should think first, analyze first, and then make the right choice. We say that when we get to December 31 of 2010, let's look at what surplus may exist. If Mr. Spratt's budget is adopted, the budget will be in surplus of $154 billion by fiscal year 2012. 
   We say, let's look at the revenues that come in. Our budget, of course, is based upon the CBO's more pragmatic and conservative revenue estimates. 
   The President's budget, Mr. Chairman, is based upon more optimistic revenue assumptions. We hope that he is right. We hope that the optimistic revenue assumptions are correct, and there will be an even greater surplus at that point in time. 
   Our budget contains significant investments in closing the tax gap, in going after the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, of dollars that are owed under present law but not collected. And we say, let's see how we do in collecting some of those funds. Let's look at the Nation's priorities, and then let's make an intelligent choice about what to do. 
   The President and the Republican Party have fallen back into the same old rut of saying, when we get to December 31 of 2010, let's do what we have done throughout our period of primacy and majority. Let's borrow more money. That is how we got into the mess that we inherited when we took this majority in January. 
   We believe that this budget should not borrow money from the Social Security trust fund and from foreign governments like the People's Republic of China to meet our obligations. We believe we should pay as we go, whether it is adding a dollar for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or reducing a dollar in taxes paid by the people of the country. 
   We believe that the right choice and the first choice and the dominant choice is to stop running this country on borrowed money from the Social Security trust fund, from the Chinese and from others. 
   So when my friend from Wisconsin read from our resolution, I thank and commend him, because that is exactly what we stand for. When we get to December 31 of 2010 and the question about which tax cuts to renew should be taken up by this Congress, if we are the majority at that time, we will make a wise choice based upon what the surplus is, what the economy looks like and what our options are. But we will not borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund and from other creditors around the world. 
   We have tried that under them for the last 6 years. It is a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe for a cataclysm in the next decade when Social Security and Medicare come due in a very, very large way. So our principle is not to increase this deficit and to build a surplus, and we stand by it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. I thank my dear friend for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, why would someone not vote for health insurance for 10 million American children? There is the excuse that the bill covers illegal aliens. 
   Read section 605 of the bill; it doesn't. There is the excuse that it covers adults, not children. Read section 112 of the bill, which is called termination of coverage of nonpregnant childless adults. There is the excuse that it covers a lot of wealthy kids, but there is the fact that 91.3 percent of the children covered come from families that make less than $40,000 a year, and the rest live in States that are very, very expensive to live in, like mine in New Jersey. 
   Then there is the excuse that, well, it's bad for the budget somehow, unlike the $109 billion they want to send to Iraq. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that over 10 years this bill saves $200 million for the Federal Treasury. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, no more excuses, vote ``yes''.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Student Loan Sunshine Act. This bill helps to ensure that parents and students have access to all student loan options available to them in order to make the best informed decision. 
   Some key improvements include providing students information on all federal student aid opportunities through a new ``one-stop'' link on the Department of Education website. This will allow students to have access to all lenders of their choice, and not feel limited with preferred lender list. The bill also requires institutions disclose all relationships with lenders and protects students from aggressive marketing practices. 
   The student loan industry has been under intense scrutiny recently and it is our obligation as Members of Congress to promote open and honest leadership. I applaud Chairman Miller for developing a strong piece of legislation that will help restore trust in the student loan industry. 
   Access to affordable and quality education is a key element to this country's future. As a cosponsor of the Student Loan Sunshine Act, I encourage my fellow colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank those involved in this bipartisan effort for a commonsense idea. I would especially like to thank my new colleague, Ms. Shea-Porter from New Hampshire, who has shown great interest in the volunteer fire service; Mr. Pascrell from New Jersey, who wrote the FIRE Act; the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle); and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Kuhl), who has long been interested in this issue. I would also like to thank Mr. Matthew Riggins of my office for his participation on this matter. 
   Here is what the bill says. If a volunteer firefighter or EMT is called to a national emergency as declared under the relevant statutes and that volunteer responds to a call, not self-volunteers but responds to a call, that person should have protection when they go back to his or her job. They shouldn't be fired, they shouldn't be disciplined, they shouldn't have their pay docked for up to 14 days in each calendar year. 
   The service that is performed by our volunteer firefighters and EMTs across this country is enormous and enormously important. We believe that none of those individuals should have the burden of suffering problems at work because of their voluntary spirit. Again, one cannot self-volunteer. Again, the emergency must be sufficient in scope for a Presidential declaration. 
   We believe this makes good sense, and it is a good bipartisan issue, and I urge Members of the House to vote ``yes.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I congratulate Chairman Hinojosa, Chairman Miller, Mr. Keller and Mr. McKeon for their excellent work on this bill. 
   In the global economic competition, the difference between winning and losing is having skilled workers or not having skilled workers. This bill takes a major step forward in making sure that we have skilled workers, that America puts its best team on the field at all times. 
   There are two specific areas I commend the leadership of the committee for including in this bill. The first has to do with autistic men and women. A lot of autistic children make great strides in their lives and they become very able, very empowered people. But then they graduate from high school, and they age out of their education, and the supportive, intensive learning environment that they need is very often no longer there. 
   This bill has provisions to help establish residential, high-quality, post-secondary programs for autistic men and for autistic women. 
   This bill says to the men and women who wear the military uniform of our country that when they come back to campus, they will be welcome. An anomaly in the existing law says that a young man or a young woman who is deployed and goes overseas and fights for our country, when he or she comes back, they may be treated as a returning student, has had a gap in their student life, which means they go to the back of the list for enrollment in special courses, for financial aid and for many other purposes. This bill corrects that and recognizes that when a young man or woman serves, they should be rewarded. We should all support this bill on a bipartisan basis.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to thank the chairwoman, my friend from California, for yielding. 
   The chairwoman and I came to this Congress on the very same day in 1990, and I'm extremely proud of the work she's done on this bill and gratified to support it. 
   I especially want to thank her for including language that I think will help underdogs, and the chairwoman has been a friend of the underdog for a very long time, and in her work in Sacramento she achieved her visions where tenants who were being mistreated by landlords, where the property was not being properly kept up and was not habitable, would be given the option of withholding rent in order to force repairs on the property. She's taken that provision and extended that principle in this bill in a way for which I salute her. 
   The bill contains provisions that say in situations where a public housing authority chooses, when notified of serious code violations by a tenant, it may take actions to withhold part of the section 8 voucher payment that would otherwise go to the landlord. And the purpose of this would be to empower the public housing authority under certain circumstances to deduct that amount of money and pay for the repairs. 
   What does this mean? It means a powerless person who doesn't have a political action committee or a lobbyist or a lot of political power but who needs their sink fixed or a broken window repaired or a heater repaired for the first time is going to have sufficient leverage to do so. 
   I think this will have three very important effects. First, it will be fair and right for these tenants. Second, it will be fair for landlords. If the tenant is the cause of the problem or if a landlord is acting responsibly, this poses no burden on a landlord. And third, it will help responsible local officials prevent blight and degradation of certain neighborhoods so that each person can live in an environment that's proper and good for their family. 
   So I want to thank the chairwoman for her characteristic advocacy on behalf of the underdog, for taking this idea, and I would urge support of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I support this legislation because it will make America safer. Our safety depends upon stability in Iraq. 
   Now, there are two ways to achieve stability in Iraq. The first is to prop up the present government and hope it succeeds.     
   That has failed. The best evidence of that failure is from Iraqi leaders themselves. Last weekend, a Shiite Member of Iraq's legislature said, in the absence of enough security forces, authorities should help residents arm themselves for their own protection. The Sunni president of Iraq said, people have a right to expect from the government and security agencies protection for their lives, land, honor and property, Mr. al-Hashemi said. But in the case of the inability of Iraqi security forces, the people have no choice but to take up their own defense. 
   This government has failed, and we are spending the precious blood of our sons and daughters to prop it up. 
   The second way to achieve stability in Iraq is to compel a political solution. This resolution will do that. It deserves our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   I rise in support of the amendment. I would like to first thank the gentlewoman, the chairperson, for the funding she has supplied for this program. 
   I believe we are at a crucial time in the southern part of our hemisphere. I believe that it will go one way or the other in the years ahead. It will either be a breeding ground for violence, trouble, and difficulty; or it will be a breeding ground for the democratic values that will make us safer and stronger and more prosperous. Cuba is not the only country that will influence that decision, but it is a pivotal country. And I think an investment in the long-term process of promoting democracy and prosperity in Cuba is not only in the best interest of the Cuban people but in the best interest of the American people. 
   Many of the issues that my friend from Massachusetts talked about have been addressed and corrected. But I think the largest mistake that we could make would be to avoid our responsibility and opportunity to influence positively those who wish to bring democracy and the rule of law to Cuba at this very critical time in her history. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. ANDREWS. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in strong support of this bill and in opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is very important the RECORD be clear about this endless rhetoric about tax increases. Here are the facts: The budget resolution that was adopted by the House does not raise taxes in this fiscal year or the next on anyone. 
   When the tax cuts that the erstwhile majority enacted expire at the end of 2009, our budget resolution calls for us to look at the state of the economy, the state of the budget and the state of the situation, and, unlike the erstwhile majority, make a choice as to what to do. There is no tax increase in this fiscal year or the next one. 
   What there is in this amendment is a strange sense of irresponsibility, that in a world where we are threatened by all kinds of threats and difficult problems, in a budget that is going to spend less than 1.5 percent out of every dollar we spend in improving our relations with countries around the world, that we have an irresponsible proposal like this. 
   There is no tax increase this year. This amendment should be defeated.
