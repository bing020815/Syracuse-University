<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition of this legislation. I don't smoke, and I never have. I'm a father of two small children. You won't find a bigger opponent of tobacco use in this Congress. 
   I have a great deal of respect for Chairmen Waxman, Dingell and Pallone. I respect their hard work, and I share the dedication they have to reducing smoking, especially among teenagers. But giving FDA approval to tobacco is not the answer. 
   The FDA Commissioner testified that he has ``serious concerns that this bill will undermine the public health role of FDA.'' And the FDA Science Board said that ``FDA's inability to keep up with scientific advancements means that American lives are at risk.'' 
   The FDA is dangerously overworked. Recently, the FDA shut down the entire domestic tomato industry. We've had listeria in frozen strawberries, E. coli in spinach and lettuce.

We should listen to the people that are working at the FDA. We should not pile more work upon them. This bill is hazardous to your health, whether you smoke or not.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, the times of reckless and unchecked spending in Congress are over. With my fellow Blue Dogs, we are cutting our Nation's credit card. It is time to have a commonsense budget, just like our families, and just as we do in business, have a commonsense approach of budgeting. 
   Congress followed these rules in the 1990s. George H.W. Bush signed on, and in 2 years we saw a record budget surplus. Unfortunately, Congress has abandoned these rules and started financing spending increases with borrowing money from China. 
   China's share of the U.S. debt has grown faster than any other nation, from $61.5 billion in 2001 to $165 billion in 2004. We cannot borrow ourselves out of debt. 
   This is an important first step of implementation of a statutory PAYGO. Congress should be able to justify every line item of every spending bill to the American people. This should be supported by all Members for the future of our children and grandchildren. 
   This rules package also prevents inserting earmarks into bills in conference, and requires that all Members be given time to examine all bills before voting on them.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. 
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs have established a process for recognizing Indian tribes. Recognition of tribes is a job for experts and requires facts. This decision should not be made by politicians relying upon a motion. 
   Every time a legislature has gotten involved in this case, they have gotten it wrong. The North Carolina State House mislabeled the group four different times. The U.S. Congress made the decision worse in 1955 by blocking them from going through the standard process. 
   I offered an amendment which would have taken the emotion and politics out of this process. It would have allowed the experts of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to establish the facts of this case, but this rule blocks that amendment. 
   Today, we have missed an opportunity to settle this case. Instead, once again, we will leave it up to politicians. 
   I am not an expert on Indian tribes. My colleagues are not experts on Indian tribes. None of us are qualified to make this decision. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and let the Bureau of Indian Affairs do its job.

   Mr. SHULER. I thank the chairman. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 65. I grew up in North Carolina near the Eastern Band Cherokee Indian reservation. I conducted youth camps on the Eastern Band Reservation for young men and women who attended the reservation schools. 
   The Cherokee people have a distinct, living culture that makes them different from many other people in the world. I'm embarrassed to say that efforts were made right here on this floor to take their language and their culture away from them. Congress has arbitrarily voted on the identity of Indian tribes many times and have gotten it wrong. Today, it will again get it wrong. 
   There is no historical tribe with the name Lumbee. That name wasn't used until 1952. Over the years, the Lumbee identified themselves as four different tribes, meanwhile they claim the Tuscarora people as part of their group, even though the Tuscarora angrily dispute this. 
   There is no Lumbee language. There is no reservation. There is no record of any Lumbee being forced out by Andrew Jackson's troops with the Cherokee on the Trail of Tears. Yet, the Congress is being asked to recognize them as the third largest tribe in the U.S.     
   The Department of Interior testified that there are serious doubts about the identity of the Lumbee. The Congressional Budget Office says recognizing this group would cost nearly $1 billion. Shouldn't we try to get the facts straight before making such a commitment? 
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs process requires that any petition group meet seven mandatory criteria in order to become Federally recognized. This process involves qualified experts in the field of genealogy, anthropology and Indian history. I strongly oppose any attempts to circumvent this established process by any group. 
   My great friend, Mr. MIKE MCINTYRE, has pointed out that the Lumbees are not allowed to go through the process. He is right. That's why I have introduced an amendment to this bill which would have allowed the Lumbee to go through the process. That amendment was rejected. 
   Members of the Congress should not arbitrarily rule on the identity of a people without establishing the facts, and the best way to establish those facts is to let the system work and let the experts do their jobs. Reject this bill and protect the integrity of the process.  
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (CHARLES GEORGE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to request that a great honor be bestowed on an equally great soldier. I am referring to PFC Charles George, a son of western North Carolina who bravely sacrificed himself for his fellow soldiers and for his country. Private First Class George came from Cherokee, NC. He was a proud member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an exemplary soldier in the U.S. Army. 
   On the night of November 30, 1952, George's company was operating near the South Korean village of Songnae-dong. While charging an enemy camp, Private First Class George dodged mortar and machine-gun fire, jumped into the enemy's trenches, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. When the American soldiers were ordered to retreat, Private First Class George remained behind to ensure the safety of his withdrawing companions. The enemy then launched a grenade into his company, at which point Private First Class George dove upon the explosive, absorbing the blast and saving his comrades. He died soon after while being evacuated by his fellow soldiers. 
   Private First Class George was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and is the only member of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians to be given this mark of distinction. Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we bestow another honor upon Private First Class George by placing his name on the Asheville VA Medical Center. This center has a 112-bed acute care facility and a 120-bed extended care facility that serves veterans in western North Carolina and sections of Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. It provides quality and comprehensive primary, tertiary, and long-term health care to those who have valiantly sacrificed for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman FILNER for his leadership on this issue, as well as the American Legion and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for their diligent efforts to ensure that PFC George is given the honor he deserves. I ask that my colleagues support me in renaming the Asheville VA Medical Center the Charles George VA Medical Center.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, we entered the fifth year of the war in Iraq. Throughout that this Congress has provided the President with all the resources needed to wage this war. However, this body failed to provide any of the oversight he needed. Today, this Congress will correct that lack of oversight, while still providing our troops the funding they need and our military leaders the flexibility they require. 
   Today we say an open-ended commitment to this war is no longer acceptable. We say that we will no longer grant the President a blank check. 
   The war in Iraq has already lasted longer than World War I, World War II, and the Civil War. Continuing this war in the same manner with no accountability from the Administration or requirements on the Iraqi government is unacceptable. 
   Today, we stand up for our men and women in uniform; we honor our veterans, and we begin a new course to securing Iraq by passing H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. 
   Passing this emergency funding guarantees our troops will have the equipment and resources they need. This bill demands that our troops are fully mission capable and meet the readiness standards set by the Department of Defense before we send them to war. And this bill demands the Iraqis get off the sidelines and begin fighting for their country. 
   The people of Western North Carolina sent me to Congress to ask the tough questions and demand accountability on this war. I have attended briefings at the White House and the Pentagon where I have been able to ask those questions. I have spoken to generals and troops on the ground, veterans and the families of those fighting. I have listened to my constituents, and I have prayed. I am confident that supporting this bill is the proper course of action. Soldiers support this bill. Generals support this bill. Veterans support this bill. The families of those fighting support this bill. A vote against this bill is a vote against our troops. 
   I am confident that this bill is a step in the right direction towards promoting a just and stable Iraq, and in bringing our nation closer to the day when all of our troops can return home to the warm welcome of a grateful Nation. May God bless our troops and their families, and may God bless the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, which will expand suicide-prevention services to our nation's veterans. 
   Joshua Omvig was an Army Reservist who committed suicide in 2005 after serving his  Nation in Iraq. My thoughts and prayers are with the family of this fallen hero, who have responded to this tragedy by championing efforts to improve mental health care for returning war veterans. 
   It is widely understood that suicide among veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and pressing problem facing our veterans' community. Our Nation's men and women returning from service abroad deserve the highest quality care that this Nation can provide, including access to top quality mental health programs. 
   H.R. 327 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take a comprehensive approach to combating the negative long-term effects of PTSD. 
   Specifically, this Act requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop a program that includes screening for suicide risk factors for veterans receiving medical care at all Department facilities, referral services for at-risk veterans for counseling and treatment, designation of a suicide prevention counselor at each Department facility, a 24-hour veterans' mental health care availability, peer support counseling, and mental health counseling program for veterans who have experienced sexual trauma while in military service. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure to improve suicide-prevention programs through the Department of Veterans Affairs. I commend the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for their hard work on this bill.

Our law enforcement officers dedicate and risk their lives daily to protect our Nation and ensure that our neighborhoods are safer. 
   More than 56,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted every year, and in 2006, 143 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty. No words can adequately express our gratitude for their sacrifice and service. My heart goes out to the families and friends who have lost loved ones in the line of duty, and to those officers who have been harmed while serving this great country. 
   A few months ago, Western North Carolina lost one of our own brave officers. Police Officer Shawn Joshua Dean Williams died while responding to a fellow officer's call for assistance in Old Fort, North Carolina. He was only 23 years old. He is survived by his wife, Shannon Kirby Williams; his young daughter, Ryleigh Alexis; and his parents, Max Suttles and Holly Williams. 
   Mr. Speaker, Officer Williams' life was an example of service for all of us to follow. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing sadness over all the officers lost in the line of duty and to acknowledge the dedication of all law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities every day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today on behalf of myself and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp). 
   In 1941, the United States was building up for World War II in dire need of new sources of energy. The Tennessee Valley Authority obtained Federal authority for construction of a hydroelectric dam in Swain County, North Carolina. This construction required that an important road be flooded. In a 1943 agreement, the Federal Government promised to rebuild the road. 
   In the 64 years since the agreement was signed, no road has been completed and no settlement was offered to the people of Swain County. The 2001 Transportation bill provided $16 million to study the environmental costs of building this new road. The National Park Service will complete this study in September.     
   Mr. Chairman, the financial and economical costs are too high to build this road. The National Park Service has said that the final environmental impact study will recommend a cash settlement with the people of Swain County. 
   Senators ALEXANDER and DOLE have amended the Senate version of this bill with language to allow the Park Service to use remaining funds from this study for this solution. This commonsense solution enjoys strong bipartisan support in the North Carolina and Tennessee House delegations. 
   Mr. Chairman, would you be willing to work with me and Congressman Wamp to ensure that this bipartisan language is included in the final conference version of this bill?

   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. The passage of this bill is an important step for those suffering from mental health problems in this country. 
   I believe it should not be an uphill battle to get treatment for millions of Americans living with mental illness and addiction. Thanks to my colleagues Mr. KENNEDY and Mr. RAMSTAD we are moving towards achieving parity between mental and physical conditions. 
   While I support the underlying legislation, I oppose the closed rule under which it is being introduced, because it does not provide for an opportunity to address the revenue raisers included in the bill. I am particularly concerned with the offset used to pay for the legislation, specifically the Medicaid prescription drug rebate. 
   Increasing these rebate rates could have a chilling effect on pharmaceutical research and development for the next generation of treatments, including those that aid patients with mental health conditions that we are attempting to help today. 
   I urge the passage of this bill. However, as this bill advances to conference, I hope that the final product that returns to the House will not contain an increased Medicaid rebate or any other provision that will deter the innovation of new treatments for the diseases that affect American families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 1219, supporting and honoring the ideals of Flag Day. The American flag represents the freedom and democratic ideals of this nation and the brave Americans who have defended these ideals throughout our history. 
   Established in 1885, Flag Day commemorates the adoption of our flag on June 14, 1777. Bernard Cigrand, the Father of Flag Day, was the President of the American Flag Day Association and the National Flag Day Society. In 1894, he orchestrated a celebration of Flag Day in Chicago that brought together over 300,000 public school students. The celebration was such a success that it was continued the following year. The trend of observing Flag Day caught on and quickly spread to New York and Philadelphia. However, it was not until August 3rd, 1949 that President Truman signed an Act of Congress designating June 14th as National Flag Day. 
   Today, we continue to honor Flag Day with a proclamation from the President urging U.S. citizens to fly the American flag from their homes for the duration of the June 14th week. Also, it is encouraged that all government buildings fly the American flag. On the second Sunday of June, the National Flag Day Foundation holds an annual observance for Flag Day. The program includes a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, singing of the National Anthem, a ceremonial rising of the flag, and a large parade. These types of celebrations play an important role in observing one of our nation's most important symbols, the American flag. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to support the ideals of Flag Day. May we continue to recognize the symbol of our freedom and display our patriotism proudly.

   Mr. SHULER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Juan Antonio ``Chi-Chi'' Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez was a native Puerto Rican who overcame the obstacles of poverty and became recognized as a renowned professional golfer, and a true inspiration to the Latino community. 
   Mr. Rodriguez has had nothing less than an exceptional career as a professional golfer. Among his many accomplishments, Mr. Rodriguez has a total of 38 professional wins, including 8 PGA tour wins, 22 Senior PGA wins, and wins in the Bahamas, Colombia, and in Panama. Because of Chi-Chi's distinguished sportsmanship throughout his career, in 1989 he was awarded the Bob Jones Award, which is the highest award given by the United States Golf Association. In 1989, he was also awarded the Tom Morris Award, from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America. In 1992, Chi-Chi was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame This was a remarkable accomplishment because he was the first Puerto Rican honored into this elite group. 
   Mr. Rodriguez has not only been an inspiration on the course, but through his charitable work as well. He established the ``Chi-Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation'', an after school program at the Glen Oaks Golf Course in Clearwater, Florida. Chi-Chi and his staff work with children to improve their self-esteem, character, work ethic, social adjustment, and academic performance. His humanitarian work allowed him to be recognized as an inaugural inductee into the World Humanitarian Hall of Fame. 
   Madam Speaker, Juan ``Chi-Chi'' Rodriguez leads an exemplary life of public service and gives hope to the underprivileged children of America. He has used his success in his professional career to make a positive impact in many people's lives. Mr. Rodriguez is deserving of the utmost respect and recognition for his contributions to the youth of America. That is why I support H. Res. 1029, introduced by Mr. GUTIERREZ of Illinois.

   His farm is now a National Historic Site visited by thousands of families around the world. This site is important both for its history and its beauty. 
   H.R. 1100 would revise the boundary of the historic site to add 115 acres. The addition would serve two purposes. The first purpose is to protect the scenic views and open spaces the Sandburg family enjoyed from their home. The second purpose is to allow the site to build a much-needed visitor center and parking area. These additions are part of the site's General Management Plan which was adopted in 2003, after a full public process. 
   This bill has wide bipartisan support. The administration has testified in support of this bill. North Carolina Senators RICHARD BURR and ELIZABETH DOLE are pushing companion legislation in the Senate. And this is strongly supported by local county government.

Had he required H.R. 1080, Mrs. Cubin's legislation dealing with the Grand Teton National Park, to delay land acquisition until deferred maintenance was completed, it would have cost them $57 million. That is 115 times more in deferred maintenance costs than the Carl Sandburg home. 
   None of these groups or agencies is required to complete backlog maintenances. That is because the maintenance is never fully completed, and it is an ongoing process.

   Mr. Speaker, when a husband and wife owns a business together, they are really collecting only one paycheck. They should only have to pay taxes once.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (COMMENDING THE APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2006 NCAA DIVISION I-AA FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to sincerely congratulate the Appalachian State University football team for winning the 2006 National Collegiate for the second year in a row, Athletic Association Division I-AA Football championship. 
   December 15, 2006, marked a historic day for this university as the Appalachian State University football team defeated the University of Massachusetts 28-17 to win the championship. 
   Most Valuable Player Kevin Richardson's four touchdowns and Corey Lynch's fourth-quarter interception, all under the direction of Coach Jerry Moore, secured the road to victory crowning the remarkable season for the Mountaineers. An intimidating defense led by Marques Murell, Jeremy Wiggins, Monte Smith, and Corey Lynch, complemented by a high-powered offense led by Richardson, who rushed for over 1,000 yards, and William Mayfield, who had over 1,000 yards receiving, and an impenetrable offensive line, made it possible for this championship to occur. 
   Undefeated in conference games and champions of the Southern Conference for the second year in a row, Appalachian State University affirmed its position as a dominant football program by securing its second consecutive national championship. Not only have they become great sportsmen, but they have consistently showed great dedication to each other, continued sportsmanship to their opponents, gratitude to their unwavering fans and respect for the sport itself. 
   I am proud of the 2006 Appalachian State University football team for bringing the championship home to western North Carolina. These student athletes are excellent representatives of a fine university and have contributed to its long history of excellence and achievement.

   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been 10 long years since Congress has raised the minimum wage. This is the longest period between raises in the minimum wage since it was enacted in 1938. The American people have spoken very clearly. It is time to raise the wages of our lowest-paid workers. 
   Our families have been squeezed: an increase at the gas pump, an increase at the grocery store, an increase in  health care and an increase in childcare. It is time that we give back. As a part of Congress, we should be an example. We shouldn't always be following our States, as my great State of North Carolina has increased the minimum wage. We should be leading by example. 
   That is why it gives me great privilege to support this bill. It is our moral commitment to the families of this country, and that is why I strongly support this measure.

   Mr. SHULER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 1361, the RECOVER Act. This bill is a strong step in the right direction to ensure that the problems small businesses face in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita will never repeat. 
   I know firsthand the difficulties that small businesses face after a natural disaster. It is vital for our community to know that the government stands with them in their hour of greatest need. 
   My district recently suffered disastrous weather, which wiped out nearly the entire crop of apples, strawberries and ornamental horticulture. I asked the people of the community to join together in prayer for the farmers and their families as they work through this crisis. Just like the small business owners of the gulf region and other areas affected by disaster, these farmers need the quick and effective response of their government in their time of greatest need. 
   I commend Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for her work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (TRAIL OF TEARS DOCUMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 5335, the Trail of Tears Documentation Act. As a co-sponsor of this legislation, I feel that it is imperative that Congress make it a priority to protect and preserve these historic routes. 
   H.R. 5335 amends the National Trails System Act to provide for the inclusion of new trail segments, land components, and campsites associated with the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. 
   The Trail of Tears was a significant and shameful chapter in American history. In 1838-1839, the U.S. Government forcibly removed Cherokee Indians from their ancestral homelands in western North Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States and resettled them in Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Over 15,000 Cherokees were systematically rounded up from their homes and forced to travel by foot, horseback, boat, and wagon across the southern U.S. to Indian Territory. More than 1,000 people died from exposure, illness, and exhaustion during the roundup and removal. 
   I am proud to have grown up alongside the Qualla Boundary in western North Carolina, home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The EBCI are descended from the Cherokee who resisted removal by taking to their ancestral mountains, where they still live to this day and keep alive the traditions and values of their forefathers. 
   The Trail of Tears Act designated two primary travel routes, the northern land route and the water routes. This amendment specifically adds other significant routes that were used by the Cherokee during the resettlement. These include: the Bell and Benge routes, the land components of the water routes, the routes from the roundup forts and camps in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, and the related campsites located along the routes and land components. 
   I am a proud co-sponsor of this bill, and I commend Congressman ZACH WAMP for introducing this legislation and fighting to ensure its passage in the 110th Congress. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the memory of all of the Cherokee who suffered during the removal on the Trail of Tears.

   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman from Arizona, and I appreciate what he is doing. 
   No Member should ask to spend the people's money if he or she is not willing to come to the people's House and explain his or her request. That is why I'm so pleased to have this opportunity to talk about the good work that Advantage West is doing for the people of western North Carolina. 
   Communities that have been hit hard with plant closings and job losses have two choices: they can give up or they  can look forward. The partnership between Advantage West and the Federal Government will provide local communities with the tools to make themselves ``business ready.'' 
   This checklist includes broadband access, access to capital, streamlined permit systems, and cooperation with schools and universities. 
   This program is a great example of how the government can partner with distressed communities to offer a helping hand instead of a hand-out. 
   Mr. Chairman, without these types of funding and this type of work with our community, it would be nothing more than us having to give a hand-out. We're asking for a helping hand. 
   Advantage West has done an outstanding job of working, not only in the 11th District, but the 8th District and the 10th District of North Carolina, being able to help small businesses. 
   And I might add to my colleagues that 95 percent of new businesses in America today come in small businesses. Here's a situation where the corporations are helping. The community is helping. Our universities, our schools are helping to create these small businesses in our community so a husband and wife can fulfill a dream come true, that they can have the opportunity to purchase their new home and have a business that they can feel proud of and that they too could maybe pass down for generations to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of this resolution because for 4 years this administration has driven us down the wrong road in Iraq. The administration's newest proposal does nothing more than accelerate our pace further and further away from our obligation of stabilizing Iraq and getting our troops home. 
   Our men and women in uniform have performed bravely and done everything  asked of them. Yet, 4 years into this conflict, we have our troops driving unarmored humvees in enemy territory. 
   Meanwhile, our government cannot account for roughly $12 billion allocated for the war in Iraq. With that $12 billion, we could have made the following purchases for our men and women in harm's way: 80,000 armor kits for humvees; 16,000 armored security vehicles; 20 million bulletproof vests; 40 million helmets. That money is gone. It disappeared in a cloud of waste, fraud and incompetence that has engulfed this war from the beginning. 
   In the words of Three Star General Greg Newbold, ``Members of Congress, from both parties, defaulted in fulfilling their constitutional responsibility for oversight.'' 
   Now, this administration wants Congress to rubber stamp an escalation and continuation of those same failed policies. Well, that time is over. 
   My fellow Blue Dogs and I have made a public commitment to root out war profiteering. We demand oversight. We demand accountability. We demand transparency. The Blue Dogs and I will do everything in our power to make sure when we say we are funding our troops, the money actually gets to our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, our military defeated a terrible dictator. This is what they were asked to do, but for 4 years now, we have asked those same troops to rebuild a Nation, and we have asked them to do this without a plan. 
   Now, this administration has asked us to send over 20,000 more military troops to continue trying to rebuild Iraq, still with no plan. Mr. Speaker, that is wrong. 
   I believe it is the patriotic responsibility of every Member of Congress to ask those tough questions. I promised the people of Western North Carolina that I would ask those questions. I have been to the White House, I have been to the Pentagon, and I have been to the hearings, and I am not satisfied with the answers I am getting. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution we are debating is not a binding resolution, but the grief felt by families who have lost loved ones is binding. The physical and mental struggles of our returning troops are binding. The devastation caused to innocent people by the violence in Iraq is binding. 
   It is a moral outrage to continue sending troops into harm's way without a plan for success. 
   This administration must realize that military might alone is not enough to secure Iraq and end the civil war. 
   Victory in Iraq requires more than bullets and bombs. It requires the cooperation of the Iraqi government, increased regional diplomacy, and competent leadership at home.

   Small businesses account for over half of all of our jobs in the U.S. and are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of all of our new jobs. For our small businesses to continue to grow and prosper, we must help them gain access to capital. 
   The bill will grant American entrepreneurs that access to capital by updating and streamlining SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs. Additionally, this bill will eliminate loan fees for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

   Mr. SHULER. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of House Resolution 179, expressing support for National Foster Parents Day. 
   There are over half a million children in foster care in this country. Every child deserves to have a safe and loving home, where they do not have to worry about the fear of harm or of being abandoned. While caring for a child is never easy, foster parents have additional difficulties to work through. All foster care children need special care, support and nurturing. There are a wide array of issues that these children are dealing with such as abandonment, physical or sexual abuse, undisciplined or delinquent behaviors, and physical or emotional handicaps and disabilities. Foster parents are challenged with helping their foster children feel secure and loved, while they also work through many of these difficult issues. 
   And while immensely challenging, foster parenting is also immeasurably rewarding. When foster parents open their homes and hearts--sacrificing, while giving support and love--they change children's lives. Many foster parents go on to adopt the children that they have in their home--60 percent of children who are adopted after they have been in foster care are adopted by foster parents. These children are given what every child deserves--a permanent home and a loving family. 
   It is important to recognize and honor the crucial role that foster parents play in shaping the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year. Because of this, I stand here today in support of a National Foster Parents Day, to honor their invaluable sacrifice, dedication, and selfless commitment to improving the lives of children.

   March 29th, 1973 marked the official departure of the last American troops in Vietnam. 
   During the longest military conflict in U.S. history, over 3 million Americans served in Southeast Asia. Over 58,000 Americans lost their lives and 304,000 additional Americans were wounded. 
   Those who fought to preserve our freedom in Vietnam have never received the hero's welcome they richly deserve. 
   Derrell Maxwell and the Veterans of Chapter 994 of Vietnam Veterans of America in Franklin, North Carolina recently approached me with an idea. They wanted Congress to commemorate March 29th as Vietnam Veterans Day. 
   I was proud to work with Chairman FILNER to get the full House of Representatives on record in support of this idea. House Resolution 1231 calls on all Americans to take time each March 29th to remember all of the service members who defended our Nation in Vietnam. 
   We honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, those held captive or missing in action, and those who sustained wounds, both seen and unseen. To all Vietnam veterans, including my constituents in Western North Carolina and those currently serving in this body, I offer my deepest thanks for your service to our Nation.

Beneficiaries of the National Textile Center's work include fire-fighters, police officers and soldiers who require protective clothing that allows them to carry out their dangerous jobs. I am proud to have several companies in my district including 3Tex and FirstChoice Armor who are working closely with the National Textile Center to produce the next generation of life-saving textile products.

   Mr. SHULER. Madam Chairman, this bill includes important reforms that will help conservation efforts by private forest landowners. Today I offer an amendment to help out a little more. 
   Over 260 million acres of forest lands are in the hands of families and individuals. At least 75 million acres of forests are part of farms. Forests provide habitats for wildlife, a source for clean water, and places to hunt, fish, hike and enjoy other recreational activities. 
   But many of our privately owned forest lands are threatened by insects or diseases, and these threats are real. Most of the insects or diseases are non-native and invasive, making them difficult to contain. 
   In my district, private landowners expect to lose all of their hemlocks from the attack of the hemlock wooly adelgid. This loss would permanently alter the diversity and unique forest environment in our region. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill provides emergency restoration funding for private forest lands that experience a loss or damage from natural disaster. My amendment would take this one step further and allow the emergency restoration funds to be used for treating private forest lands under imminent threat of attack by insect and disease. 
   In the case of insect or disease, we must stop their invasion before they create the disaster. Preventing the losses will save money and save our forests. Prevention is less expensive than restoration. 
   Madam Chairman, I thank the members of the committee for their work on this bill to support healthy forests, and I urge my colleagues to support the Shuler amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHULER. (HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WATER SUPPLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHULER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, as water bills continue to rise larger, in the rural communities throughout the country home water bills have increased faster than the rate of inflation. Over 50,000 community water systems serve populations under 10,000. In North Carolina, 95 percent of our community water systems service populations of less than 10,000. 
   Currently, rural populations across America are being forced to comply with costly regulations. At this time, many rural areas have a greater percentage of the poverty and lower mean household income.     
   This is imposing a major burden on the rural families of America. In the same rural communities, some citizens are now paying 770 percent more for the water services than that of urban populations. 
   The Conaway-Shuler amendment does not call for more money or strike existing language. This is a fiscally responsible approach which points us in the right direction to take some of the strain off of the rural communities as they struggle to provide safety. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
