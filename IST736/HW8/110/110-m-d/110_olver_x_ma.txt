<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I am not quite sure how long my voice will hold out, so I will probably be fairly short. 
   I just want to commend the chairman of the full committee, Chairman Rahall, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman Grijalva, and thank them for all of their great work in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   The New England Scenic Trail Designation Act is a product of almost a decade of cooperation between the Massachusetts delegation and the Connecticut delegation, and both delegations have changed over that period of time, the National Park Service, the Appalachian Mountain Club, the Connecticut Forest and Park Association and a lot of local communities and individuals. 
   The bill designates major portions of an older, voluntary Metacomet-Monadnock-Mattabesett trail system as a national scenic trail. Now, I have hiked every mile of the old voluntary system through Massachusetts; and while some segments are very well protected, other sections have suffered serious encroachment. National scenic trail designation will provide an opportunity for long-term preservation for future generations. 
   Currently, the MMM trail system is administered by local nonprofit organizations: the Connecticut Forest and Park Association in Connecticut and the Appalachian Mountain Club through its Berkshire Chapter in Massachusetts. The Connecticut Forest and Park Association in fact is a private nonprofit organization which contracts with the State of Connecticut to run the trail systems in all of their public parks, so it is a very reputable organization which has been there for a long time and has a huge number of volunteers who work on it, and it works closely with the State of Connecticut. I want to recognize and thank the many volunteers and staff of these organizations who have worked diligently to help develop this initiative. Because of their effort, every Member through whose district this trail system passes supports this legislation. 
   In the case of Massachusetts, the Appalachian Mountain Club has over time been sort of a sponsor for the trail within Massachusetts, the old voluntary trail, not only this trail but other trails within Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, the land passes through at least four substantial State parks or State forests so that much of the land is already publicly owned by the State of Massachusetts, but there are connections between those publicly owned pieces of land and there are visitor centers and park facilities and so on at a rather convenient distance for hiking purposes, for day hikes or overnight camp-type hikes along the way. 
   Now, I understand that some Members have expressed concerns that this bill will infringe upon landowner rights and allow the National Park Service to seize lands through eminent domain. Well, the Federal Government does not own any land anywhere in the area that the trail is intended to go, following the old voluntary trail, and then some additional territory that has to be worked out by the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association in order to reach the Long Island Sound. There is no expectation of there being any Federal land there. It was never intended there would be federally owned land. Whatever protection of the land would be held by the Park Association or on behalf of the State of Connecticut. And in Massachusetts, the same thing is basically true. 
   No one wants to establish Federal ownership of a corridor. In recognition of that, in the legislation we added the language: ``The United States shall not acquire for the trail any land or interest in land without the consent of the owner.'' 
   Yet the argument keeps coming back that that doesn't protect people. Well, maybe the language of the motion to recommit will satisfy that. I think it is completely redundant with what is already there and certainly in total keeping with the intent not to have any Federal ownership of land in that area. 
   The blueprint for the management of the trail specifically states that all existing landowner uses and rights, including hunting, fishing, timber management and other recreational activities, will continue to be at the discretion of the landowners.

   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I guess I thought that the problem was that the devil was the Federal Government here and that we wanted to make certain that there was no way for them to issue eminent domain, and the language of this bill, in relation to this trail, is quite clear on that point. In fact, it would appear that now we're trying to solve a problem which isn't there, which just is an order of magnitude somewhere farther away in concept, that somehow the local communities or the State is going to issue eminent domain and then pass the land to the Federal Government in some sort of manner. That really surprises me as there is nothing in the intent of this anywhere along the way to do such a thing. 
   I think we have solved the problem as much as it needs to be solved with the language which is in the bill, that there can be no Federal acquisition of land here. Nobody wants Federal acquisition of land. There might well be community acquisition of a corridor somewhere along the way over time, but there is to be no Federal ownership of any of that land. 
   I hope the matter will be opposed and we will not adopt this amendment. This is finding a solution where there is no problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, high gas prices are taking a huge toll. Republicans claim they want to reduce gas prices, but for a month they have voted against every bill that would do so. 
   Last week, Republicans blocked a bill to release 70 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Much smaller releases by the last three Presidents have produced nearly immediate reductions in crude oil prices of up to one-third. That would translate to savings as high as $1 per gallon of gas. The Republican plan to lease more public land without requiring Big Oil to actually drill and produce oil gives exactly zero savings now. 
   Today, they will have a chance to vote against the speculation in oil futures. Experts have testified that rampant speculation accounts for roughly $30 of the price of a barrel of oil, or 70 cents per gallon of gas. Isn't it time Republicans voted for 70 cent savings on gas prices by stopping speculation and $1 savings by opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now?

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, but he shouldn't really yield me all the time that I might consume because I might consume it all. So please inform me when I have used about 4 minutes, and then I might use an additional 1. 
   Mr. Chairman, each of the people who have already spoken in favor of this piece of legislation, which would take $1.3 billion or $1.8 billion, whichever it is, I don't remember precisely, out of the recommended budget, the budget that has been recommended by the chairman and ranking member with a unanimous vote out of the Appropriations Committee, each of the people who had spoken in favor of this amendment has made the comment that the budget resolution has raised taxes by the largest amount ever in the history of this country. Each of the Members has made that allegation. 
   Each of the Members knows perfectly well that you cannot raise taxes, you cannot raise taxes by that mechanism; that any raise in taxes has to be passed by the House and the Senate in exactly the same form and then signed by the President of the United States. So it is simply incorrect, and each and every Member knows that it is incorrect that the budget raises taxes, raises the largest tax increase in the history of the country. 
   The last gentleman who spoke pointed out that the adoption of this amendment, which would reduce this particular bill, recommended by both the chairman and the ranking member, by $1.3 billion, that that would be a $1.3 billion tax reduction. The gentleman who made that comment also knows that no reduction in taxes can occur except by legislation that is passed by both Houses and signed by the President. So, again, it is totally incorrect to make that allegation. 
   Now, the first speaker, who has offered this amendment, has said that this bill spends too much. Well, I think the measure of whether a bill spends too much is whether we are doing what is necessary for the security of this country and for the well-being of the people of America. And I think what has been done by the chairman and ranking member falls very much in the point of providing for the security of the country and also for the well-being of the American citizens. 
   I would point out that the chairman and the ranking member and the full  subcommittee that brings forward this legislation has reduced by over $800 million the President's request, actually $900 million over the President's request, in programs that have been terminated or reduced, in all of those that have been terminated and reduced. Now, what they have done, after making those reductions from the President's request and in their responsibility to provide for the budget for the country, they have then added moneys. They have added about $400 million in the provisions for renewable energy, which have to deal with solar energy, biofuel energy, nuclear energy and geothermal, wind, and all the other good renewable energy sources which we need desperately for our national security to remove ourselves from the heavy dependence that we have on foreign oil. So that is a place where if this amendment were adopted and we were to go back to the 2007 numbers, then we would lose that increase, that very important increase of $400 billion. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman asked to be notified when he has gone past 4 minutes. The gentleman has gone past 4 minutes.

   Mr. OLVER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
   We would lose that $400 million of very important investments for the security and well-being of this country. 
   And I would just also like to point out that there are substantial increases, which the ranking member has pointed out, that deal with the deficits, the deficits in investments in our water infrastructure under the Corps of Engineers and also under the Bureau of Reclamation, those places where we have dams that are in need of investment that has not been done over recent years and investments that should be done in our ports in order to make our commerce go better, a whole series of things which the ranking member had laid out very carefully in his initial remarks in relation to this legislation. All of those things which are increases that are in this legislation, part of that $1.3 billion, which would be removed, then those pieces of investments would thereby become unnecessary. 
   So I think this legislation is right on target for securing this Nation and for securing the well-being of the people of America. And I hope that the gentleman's amendment will be rejected.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for yielding me time. I will try to cover my points in those 3 minutes. 
   I just want to remind the members of the committee, of the Congress, of the body, that this bill came from the subcommittee with full support of the subcommittee members, with the ranking member and the chairman in strong support, with a very good and thoughtful look at what energy and water expenditures ought to be. 
   There are increases in moneys that are investments in flood control, in dam safety, in putting money into dealing with our ports which need dredging, things of that sort. There are substantial increases, that is true, in renewable energy, which is the one place where we can really get at our dependence upon oil that comes from very unstable parts of this world. 
   There were some wonderful recommendations that in large part are a balance between nuclear nonproliferation, so important, because that is where our real danger is to the security of this country in the future, our major danger, versus some unnecessary expenditures in nuclear weapons development, nuclear weaponry development. That recommendation is here. 
   We have had about 12 hours now of debate in this committee with 50 amendments, with offers of amendments to cut and reduce, offers of amendments to increase expenditures, to shift expenditures. There are some that have been adopted. Most of them have been refused. But everybody has had a chance. And the basic body of the bill remains as it was, as it was recommended by the chairman and the ranking member of the committee with the support of the subcommittee and the Appropriations Committee. 
   Here now we have a 1 percent reduction which attempts at this late date, after all those amendments have been dealt with one by one, increases and decreases, and the issues have been discussed, then to reduce by 1 percent, $300-plus million, which then has an effect on all those earlier decisions that have been made by this committee as a whole. 
   So I would hope that this amendment would not be adopted. I think that this is a basically irresponsible way of going about budgeting. If you can't deal with the issues and then come to a conclusion on the budget that you have adopted in that process, then one should not do what is being proposed here. I hope that the amendment will be resoundingly defeated.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (REAUTHORIZATION OF THE HOPE VI PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, last month at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water of the Appropriations Committee we heard expert, corroborated testimony that heating and cooling and the electrical fixtures and appliances in buildings in the industrial, commercial and residential sectors use nearly 50 percent of all the energy that is used in America today and thereby were responsible for nearly 50 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. 
   We were also told that we could reduce by one-half the energy used in new or renovated buildings using present knowledge and technology. 
   One month ago, because of the powerful and insistent leadership of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, and the critical cooperation of Chairmen Dingell and Markey and a host of others from both parties, this Congress passed and the President signed landmark energy legislation. 
   That new law focused heavily on reducing the fossil fuel used in transportation by raising corporate average fleet efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020 and mandating production of 36 billion gallons of biofuel, mostly ethanol, by the year 2020. 
   But equally important were some provisions relating to buildings, what I have said already, which use nearly 50 percent of all the energy used in America today. First, the increased energy efficiency standards for appliances used in commercial and residential buildings; second, the goal that all commercial buildings built after the year 2025 would use zero net energy; third, that all federally constructed buildings would reduce their general energy usage by 30 percent by the year 2015; and fourth, that all new Federal buildings reduce their fossil fuel-produced energy by 55 percent in 2010 and eliminate by 2030 all fossil fuel-produced energy. 
   Our first opportunity to meet the spirit of this landmark energy bill comes in the bill before us tomorrow, the reauthorization of the Hope VI program. 
   This reauthorization proposes a rejuvenated program at $800 million a year which with just Hope VI dollars alone could produce as many as 4,000 units per year of housing, affordable housing for people with low income. Put in perspective, those potential affordable housing units represent less than 0.1 percent less than 1/1000th of the housing built in this country each year, and virtually all of the cost is borne by the Federal Government. 
   The bill includes an extremely important provision that projects must use green community criteria to be eligible for the Federal funding. Numerous cities and even States already require or use compliance with such green community criteria. 
   Washington, DC, for instance, requires the criteria for all residential construction, not just public construction. 
   Washington State requires criteria stronger than the green community  base criteria for all State-funded housing. 
   Maine requires similar criteria for all housing built with public dollars in that State. 
   Cities from coast to coast, such as Cleveland, Ohio, and Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Oregon, have already built Hope VI projects complying with the green community criteria. An assessment of the added costs for construction using such criteria and for some 20 already completed projects shows an average of 2.4 percent increase in construction costs. 
   But we build housing to last for 50 to 100 years. Such projects exceed savings in energy costs that are greater than the construction costs that is slightly higher within about 5 years, and those savings accrue to the low-income families using that housing over the 50- to 100-year lifetime of the housing. 
   The benefits go to the low-income families directly if the families pay their utility bills directly or those benefits go to the public housing authorities if the authority itself pays the utility bill for the housing unit. And those benefits are then passed on to the tenants, and they require less of an appropriation in operating costs by our government to the public housing authorities in the various cities around the country that use this housing. 
   We should not lose this opportunity to meet the spirit of the energy bill, the new energy law, that landmark legislation which we have all touted and so strongly supported. We should use the best green criteria available to promote healthier homes for low-income families and save all of that energy over the long haul.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I hope that this amendment, obviously, will not pass. 
   In our subcommittee earlier this year, in testimony on the hearings that were held in relation to the park service and the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service and EPA, people spoke of the challenges to their stewardship, of our lands, basically our public lands, that were caused by climate change. 
   Then toward the end of our hearing's process, we held a hearing specifically on the issue of climate change and had witnesses who were experts in that field to speak to the issues there, and they testified describing, for instance, how permanent ice coverage in the Arctic has shrunk dramatically at an ever-increasing rate. 
   It's at an ever-increasing rate because, first of all, because ice coverage reflects sun's heat back to the atmosphere, back to space, whereas water and land absorbed that heat, so that heats, that raises the temperature. 
   Because methane is released from permafrost, as you take the ice cover off, and the land heats up, ends up expanding the greenhouse gas blanket that is the very cause of global warming. So they are telling us by the year 2050, we will have no ice over a substantial piece of the north polar region that is then contributing to ever more greater global warming.     
   They tell us that the Everglades National Park is at risk from rising sea levels and more intense hurricanes. They tell us that the changing climate has allowed invasive species to move into new ecosystems where they have no predators and they can expand explosively, which they're doing, for example, the northern pine beetle in huge portions of the northern forests in the northern U.S. and in Canada over much of the central part of the continent, and increasing severity of droughts that will make our lands more vulnerable to forest fires and such. In any case, regardless of one's opinion on the need to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it is irresponsible to ignore the impacts that we are witnessing. 
   For the record, this commission that the amendment would eliminate does not create any new regulations with regard to carbon dioxide emissions or any other greenhouse gas emission. What the commission does would be to review and assess the scientific challenges to the available adaptation and mitigation strategies necessitated by the climate change and simply provide recommendations to the various Federal agencies on how to proceed. 
   It seems to me that with the importance of this issue of global warming and the climate change that comes with that global warming, that it would be irresponsible for us not to look at those things that are particularly within the jurisdiction of our subcommittee and to seek the ways that  we might adapt and mitigate those climate changes. 
   And so I hope that we will not be tempted here to take a shortcut that will cost us deeply in the future, and I hope this amendment will not be adopted.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   First I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for bringing forward a very good bill. And I want to also commend the chairman and the ranking member for agreeing to the amendment that has just been adopted. But I want to put that a little bit in context here. 
   I have to say that I was surprised and somewhat chagrinned by the characterization of the ranking member of the full committee when he described this legislation, this whole legislation, as having an excessive and overgenerous allocation. I don't really think that that is the case, and the Park Service programs within this bill are a perfect example of that. 
   We are coming up on the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service and have a lot of work to do to bring that up to a state of good repair, the facilities of the National Park Service up to a state of good repair. 
   The Park Service embarked on a program to try to repair some damage that has been done, particularly in the fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The reduction in budget compared with what would be, including inflation, the necessary funding to keep the maintenance of service in the Park Service programs is close to 20 percent in those two fiscal years. And in fiscal year 2007, we were able to virtually level fund the budget for programs within the Department of the Interior and the Park Service at just no increase. But now this year, with this legislation, there is an additional $105 million in the legislation for the increase in the Park Service's base funding which should allow them to begin to make some additions in the maintenance, the backlog of maintenance, which is so well described in the previous amendment, and the need at one of our greatest, most important national monuments, the Statue of Liberty, to make that available to the public. 
   We have hundreds of millions of people in total that visit our national parks, our national monuments, our historic sites, our fish and wildlife refuges, and the maintenance backlog is in the billions of dollars level, of which $105 million to deal with the backlog needs in the Park Service's accounts is only a small portion of what is needed to bring up our facilities that serve those hundreds of millions of the public who visit at all these variation locations each year, to bring them up to a state of good repair. So I think that it is important that we provide those monies. 
   I know there will be other amendments. I will be supportive of those amendments, which also increase the amounts that can go, reasonably, into state of good repair for our facilities under the Park Service for those national parks, historic sites and national monuments that we so badly need in good repair for the visitation and for the education of the public. 
   The Park Service system is a national treasure, and it must be preserved and valued for our future generations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the gentleman from California that would cut valuable research at the Silvio Conte Anadromous Fisheries Laboratory. It is a Federal fisheries laboratory now under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Geological Survey, though when it was built a couple of decades ago, it was under the aegis of the Fish and Wildlife Service. So it is a Federal function in the first place. 
   This research benefits commercial fisheries and sports fishermen across the Nation. As we now know, the word ``anadromous'' describes any fish species, such as the Atlantic salmon, that is spawned in fresh water but spends the majority of its adult life in salt water before returning to fresh water streams or lakes to spawn and then die. 
   In the Northeast, as in many other areas of the United States, during the 1800s, dams which altered the stream flow sometimes completely stopped the process of spawning, and pollution degraded the water quality and ended up virtually destroying this fish species that must navigate hundreds of miles of man-made obstructions in order to reach their spawning grounds. 
   That is exactly what happened to the Atlantic salmon, which was a major sports fishery and commercial fishery in Colonial times in all of the rivers from the Hudson River northward along the coast which included the Housatonic, the Connecticut, the Kennebunk, the Androscoggin and the Merrimac Rivers, those being probably the more major rivers up that way. 
   Ironically, the Silvio Conte Anadromous Fish Research Lab was established by Congressman Silvio Conte. For those who served with Congressman Conte, he was a Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for all of the years of the 1980s and well into the 1990s, at least a couple of years into the 1990s. He was remembered as quite a remarkable gentleman and quite a remarkable and colorful figure within the Republican Party. 
   This fisheries research laboratory was created in response to the disappearance of the Atlantic salmon in these Northeastern rivers and the strong regional desire to see a restoration of those salmon runs as a great sports fishery. 
   The premier laboratory for research on Atlantic salmon and other anadromous fish in the eastern part of this country, at least, I am not sure how one deals with that on the western coast, but on the eastern coast, has been this laboratory in Turners Falls, Massachusetts. 
   The lab performed the basic and applied research for the improvement of fish passages, for the health and preservation of endangered fish species, and ultimately for the economy and the environment of the Connecticut River watershed, and by connection to the other watersheds where the restoration of the Atlantic salmon has been attempted. 
   It has been somewhat successful, not wholly successful. The salmon runs are not what they were. A few hundred salmon return to each of these rivers each year. But that is how the thing got started. 
   The research at the Silvio Conte Fisheries Laboratory improves the understanding of the impact of dams, the effect of the altered flows in the water quality, the various effects of pollution, contaminants on the ecology and migration success of anadromous fish species, and also on the genetics of all those species. 
   The research includes testing of fish passage designs to facilitate the movement of migratory fish over major dams. And the research is valuable to the region.

   By the way, the $150,000 that is involved in this amendment is for the acquisition of scientific equipment necessary to this research, which has impacts up and down the eastern coast of the United States for all of the anadromous fisheries. But it was centered in the Atlantic salmon by Congressman Conte. 
   So I urge the rejection of the amendment by the gentleman from California.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, as the stock market plunges, financial institutions fail and the economic pain Americans feel grows, our Republican colleagues' only answer is to drill. 
   Drilling won't help the 2 million Americans who have lost jobs in the last year. Drilling won't protect 46 million Americans without health insurance, 7 million more than when George Bush took office. Drilling won't help nearly 6 million people who have slipped into poverty. Drilling won't bring back the huge surplus that George Bush inherited and squandered. And drilling won't help the 3 million families who have lost their homes to foreclosure in the last 3 years. 
   Despite their cries for drilling, our Republican colleagues voted against accelerated drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve, already under lease, and against drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. In fact, the drilling they do support wouldn't produce new oil for at least 8 years. 
   In truth, they don't want to help American families. They only want to distract public attention from eight disastrous years under George Bush.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. I thank the chairman for yielding me time. 
   I just want to say that we have a very severe problem in this country on our energy supplies. In the short term, there are a series of ways that we might save ourselves some money on the gas prices, and those ways include driving less, driving slower, carpooling, and using public transportation where it is available.     
   And I have to commend the chairman for bringing so quickly to the floor this important legislation, which provides a substantial increase in moneys, authorization, at least, for public transportation, which is already in place in our smaller metropolitan areas and even in our rural areas, so that we can enhance the public transportation available for people--what is already available--and take care of people who are making that move toward using a bit more public transportation. 
   In the longer term, which is speaking about the 10-year kind of time frame, whereas the short term is in the first year or so, in the longer term, living closer to where we work so you don't have to commute so far, doing the research and development on renewable energy sources, drilling wherever it's open for leases, and I say that's in the longer term because everybody agrees that it will take, even in the best of circumstances, 5 years to bring new leased areas to production and more likely 10 years to bring those new leased areas to production, that and changing over our whole vehicle fleet, our whole vehicle fleet, which will take a considerable period of time, to using much more fuel-efficient vehicles, those are the longer-term ways that we can get out of this problem. 
   And by far the fastest way to immediately have an effect is the elimination of speculation. There has been much testimony before our committees that speculation is a very significant portion of what is going on right now. The speculative activity in the oil market has quadrupled in just the last few months, 3 or 4 months, and that would be the fastest and most effective way. 
   My friend the ranking member from Florida has pointed out that we need to increase supply. Well, yes, it would be possible to increase supply. But remember, as the majority leader said here a few minutes ago, we in America have 5 percent, somewhat less than 5 percent, of the planet's population. We are now consuming 25 percent of the oil produced on this planet today, and we in America have only 3 percent of the reserves. You can't drill your way out of this problem because we do not have the reserves.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   First of all, I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member and all of the staff on both sides of the aisle for this excellent bill. I hope that all of the Members on both sides will find it is something that they can support. Particularly I want to commend the chairman, this chairman and his ranking member, for the very amicable and nonpartisan way that they have conducted the work of the subcommittee. I think that is a wonderful picture for all of us as chairs and ranking members for the way that they have done this. 
   A great deal has been said about energy independence for this country, and I would say, I would assert that it is truly a matter of national security that we maximize the efficiency and conservation of energy in this country. We use 100 quads of energy; 100 quads is 100 quadrillion Btus of energy in this country for 5 percent of the world's population. The world as a whole uses about 400 quads of energy. So we, for 5 percent of the population, are using 25 percent of the whole world's energy usage. 
   Early in our hearings process this year we had a series of theme hearings, and we had many expert witnesses. The most dramatic testimony that I heard there that is easily conveyable is that we could save of our energy usage some 50 percent; all across all of our uses of energy, 50 percent of what we presently use. That same testimony indicated that since 1973 when the first oil crisis hit, we had saved already some 47 quads of energy in that roughly 40 years since the first energy crisis, a little less than 40 years. So we could save a huge amount more. 
   I just want to make three points about this very good bill. The bill recognizes that energy efficiency is one of the Nation's largest underutilized energy sources. It provides $146 million more for building technologies which is an increase of $60 million above the President's request; this, in an area where 40 percent of all of the energy we use is related to our buildings, our industrial, our commercial and our residential buildings. So there alone we can save a huge amount of energy, and the bill recognizes that and puts money where it will do the most good to try to improve our energy efficiency in our buildings. 
   But it also provides $23 million to address the backlog of equipment standards and analysis, $10 million above the President's request, which goes to accelerate the approval and the updating of appliance and equipment efficiency standards which we know that the Department of Energy is very much behind on. They are behind on at least 20 different standards related to appliance and equipment that we could be saving a lot more energy if those standards were brought up to date. And the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories estimates that the administration's negligence will cost an estimated $28 billion in foregone savings.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California. I note that this amendment is offered to the section of the bill on energy efficiency and renewable energy, and I would note first that the President's request for this year is more than 10 percent below on every one of the renewable energy accounts in the budget. Those are cuts below the 2007 enacted amount, and it covers biomass, which leads to the biomass accounts, which include biodiesel, corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol, which, of course, is the area that so many people believe is going to be a major saver in the future. 
   It includes solar energy, wind energy, geothermal technology, hydropower, vehicle technologies, where 30 percent of all of our energy is used, building technologies, where 40 percent of all of our energy is used, industrial technologies, where 20 percent of all of our energy is used. And the President proposes in those areas 10 percent reductions below the enacted, whereas the subcommittee, in its wisdom, and apparently agreed to certainly by me and certainly apparently agreed by the gentleman from California, the committee has added moneys over the enacted number for 2007. So we apparently agree on that. 
   But then, oddly enough, the gentleman from California chooses to attack the one program that gives direct help to low-income households in this country. It is the one program, the weatherization program, where low-income households can get assistance to install energy-saving technologies and measures in their homes. 
   Well, it turns out there are something like 14 million households in this country that have incomes of less than 50 percent of the median income in various areas around the country. Half of them live in homes. Most of those homes are very inefficient users of energy. So the Low Income Weatherization Program is a program that would help those homes be more efficient in the use of energy. 
   The President's request for this year is in fact below the enacted 2007 number actually by more than 30 percent below what the enacted 2007 number was. Enacted 2006 number was even higher than the 2007 number. So the committee, in its wisdom, has instead recommended raising the number to the 2006 level, to the levels expended in fiscal year 2006, and the gentleman from California wants to take it back from the committee's number by this time 45 percent or something like that, the exact number I haven't quite calculated.     
   Those moneys are well invested in those homes which low-income households are using, where energy is so inefficiently used, where we can save a substantial amount of energy every year, thereby reducing greenhouse gases that are produced in the production of the energy that would otherwise be wasted in those homes. And where one would say far beyond the cost of the energy-saving measures that would be part of the weatherization program, far beyond the cost. In such situations, you are saving the amount of the cost within a 3 or 4 or 5-year period when the savings go on long into the future, year after year after year, saving energy and reducing greenhouse gases and saving dollars. Perhaps most important for those people, it is the savings of the dollars that they otherwise would spend in those low-income households where the amount of money spent on housing per se in low-income households tends to be up in the two-thirds to three-quarters of the total household income. 
   So I think the weatherization program is a very useful program, a very effective program for saving money for people at the lowest levels of income. I hope we will soundly defeat this amendment by the gentleman from California.

   Mr. OLVER. I want to thank my colleague from Florida for bringing this issue to light. 
   Mr. Chairman, all of our public housing and section 8 residents deserve to live in a safe environment. We have done our best to ensure that PHAs have adequate resources to address the security issues. 
   The gentleman from Florida is correct, that there were public housing Drug Elimination Grants, a separate item in the budgets up until the fiscal year 2001 budget. The last time we had that separate program for Drug Elimination Grants, the appropriation for that was around $300 million on a nationwide basis for securing, for employing security personnel and employing local police and other additional security services that were necessary. 
   At that time, in the fiscal year 2001 budget, the Drug Elimination Grants were combined with the operating fund. Since that time, the housing authorities, the public housing authorities have had the authority to use monies that were in the operating fund for the purposes that had been previously done with the direct Drug Elimination Grants. 
   So we, as my colleague from Florida has pointed out, we no longer have the direct Drug Elimination Grants, but all of the functions of those grants may be funded at the discretion of the individual public housing authorities under the operating funds or under the capital funds. I support the use of either of those funds for the important functions of safety and security for our public housing residents. 
   I am happy to work with the gentleman in the future on this issue. I thank the gentleman for bringing the issue to the discussion today and thereby highlighting the problem, which is severe in some cases, but the resources, as we have indicated, as he has indicated, and we have already done, have been added. 
   We have added $200 million this year above the President's request for the operating fund of the public housing authorities, and that should give them the necessary money to do, where it is needed, as they deem appropriate, as the public housing authorities deem appropriate, the drug elimination activities. I am very pleased that the gentleman has brought the issue to the discussion today.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program is a small program, a small account that makes a big difference in the lives of Native Hawaiians who happen to reside on Hawaiian homeland. 
   From 2002 through 2005, when the gentleman's party was in the majority, Congress funded in each of those years an average of $9.4 million for this program. We held it to $8.7 million in the 2007 budget, and have frozen it at the same level as the 2007 budget in the recommendation in this budget for the 2008 fiscal year. 
   So this is not an increase. We are, in fact, holding it steady for a program that has been funded at higher levels earlier when the gentleman's party was in the majority and in substantial majority control of this process. 
   With the funding in the bill, more than 100 Native Hawaiian families will be provided with the opportunity for home ownership, including counseling, construction, and rental assistance during that process. This is one of the HUD programs. We have programs for Native Alaskans, we have programs for American Indians and so forth that are helpful in providing the hope for home ownership on the part of some of our small minorities in our population. I think it is a goal that we should support, and I strongly support the program and urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that the gentleman will withdraw his amendment here, and I would be happy to work with him because in substantial measure I support the intent of the amendment, but I have concerns about the offset, even though it is a relatively small offset. But I do want to use this time to point out what has happened here on the brownfields program. 
   The President, in the 2007 budget process, ended up recommending that we zero out this program in the 2007 budget, and he actually recommended rescinding the 2006 moneys, which were exactly the same amount of money that has been put in the 2007 finally and had been put in the 2006 budget. And under those circumstances, when they are making recommendations to rescind, their approach is not to give out any grants under the program until after the budget process for the following year is complete, and, therefore, those moneys just don't get put out until very late. There is a real big gap in it. That is what has happened previously.  
   This year the President did not propose to rescind the 2007 budget moneys for the simple reason that the 2007 budget moneys were not settled in this until the CR was adopted after the budget was submitted. If that had been done prior to when the budget was submitted, my guess is that the President would have proposed rescinding the 2007 moneys as well as zeroing out the 2008 moneys, which is what has happened in his recommendations for this year's bill. 
   So we are in this game, in a situation where the people over at OMB believe, I believe wrongly, but they seem to insist that there is someplace else in the budget, namely under EPA, where brownfields redevelopment is going to get done. That doesn't happen. The moneys that are in for brownfields under EPA are for assessments, and we have been doing assessments, and I believe that this should be funded. So in the face of what I have described, we have for the last couple of years continued to appropriate, but at the constant value of $9.9 million for this program, to keep it there until such time as we have someone who understands that that kind of program isn't being done anywhere else and is willing to move the moneys along, which the administration, as I have described, simply is not willing to do. So that is the situation that we are in.

   Mr. OLVER. I am saying that they finally put the grant proposals out for award, but a year late essentially, and each time only after it is clear, for instance, the 2007 moneys will finally be sent out for grant announcements at the very end of this fiscal year when it is clear that we have not rescinded the 2007 moneys.

   Mr. OLVER. No, there is none. There is none. But the offset that the gentleman has used is salaries and expenses, salaries and expenses is an account which, in the tightness of this budget, in trying to do for section 8 and CDBG and the other places, we have already cut a bit, not a great deal, but a bit, and I oppose, as I said before, in good conscience, the movement of salaries and expense moneys into this where we know that it is not going to be spent with any alacrity and any expedition.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentleman if he would withdraw his amendment, and I would be happy to work with him, as I am sure the ranking member would as well, though I would lead him to comment, to work with him in conference to address this issue.     
   Otherwise, I rise in reluctant opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   I believe the need, as he has indicated, for housing counseling is strong. But what his offset does in this instance is to take the funding for the Inspector General for HUD back to the level of the budget request for the year 2007, where we had increased in the supplemental budget the appropriation for the IG to $88.2 million, in the supplemental budget had been added to the IG to do its work, and have recommended in this bill a less than 2 percent increase. So that, compared with the 2007 appropriation for the IG, the amendment would represent a 5 or 6 percent decrease in the amount of funding available for the IG. 
   We simply are not in a position to be able to increase this account because of the deep holes that the President handed to us in the HUD budget. We froze the account at the FY07 level, with the supplemental amount there, which is the best that we could do without harming other HUD programs. 
   Now, taking the funding from the Inspector General to increase this account is counterproductive to the gentleman's amendment. Should we reduce the oversight in order to increase the housing counseling? They're both vital programs. We feel that we have struck the correct balance here for this pair of needs. 
   I commend the gentleman's passion on the issue, and I would be happy to work with him in the future on the issue related to housing counseling. And I do recognize that we are likely to have some, in the secondary lending market, problems later this year, continuing problems, as we have been having, but I would urge the gentleman to withdraw the amendment at this time and we would try to work it out in conference.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I would like to point out to the gentleman that the bill before us includes language that requires the Secretary of Transportation to review and ultimately approve or deny grant requests for each train route as part of the grant agreement. When grant requests are submitted to the Secretary, they include a detailed financial analysis and revenue projections, and the Secretary then determines whether to approve the grant request for the specific train route. 
   I'd like to make another comment here. All too often we forget about rural areas. Rural communities deserve transportation choices. This line serves a number of rural areas in the South and Southwest. But I do again remind that the Secretary has the authority to review the financials in relation to a particular route and to approve or disapprove of grant requests. 
   Amtrak has made some good moves over the recent past. They've reduced their debt by $500 million. They have exacted about $100 million of savings so far in their effort to reduce the costs of the long-distance routes. They've increased the amount of State investment that's involved in these routes, and they continue to show better revenue and ridership. 
   But the route to deal with individual routes, the way to deal with individual routes is through the language that's already in the bill, and so I'm going to oppose the specific effort to eliminate one specific route when the route is already in place in the legislation for the Secretary to make that decision. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman who is the Chair of the subcommittee of the authorizing committee, Ms. Brown.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman offering this amendment doesn't happen to be here at the moment; so let me try to point out what is involved here. 
   Yes, the Belmont Complex does provide recreational opportunities and conference and meeting space. Yes, it is a facility that is used for Chamber of Commerce meetings, and banquets, and business, and seminars, and training and testing for displaced workers, and local union meetings and negotiations, emergency rescue training, voter registration drives, local business-to-business job fairs. 
   In the county, Armstrong County in Pennsylvania, which is one of those in the northern part of Appalachia that is struggling hard, losing population, by the way, if I remember the map exactly correctly. I was from Pennsylvania in an earlier period of my lifetime. These are all purposes that are important to the process of keeping the economy going in that community and that county. 
   But most important to this particular earmark is that a 2003 fire damaged much of the building, and these funds are needed to make continual interior and exterior renovations and to make the facility handicapped-accessible. Those are important specific things that go beyond the other bits and pieces that are pulled together in this complex. The main building within the complex has had fire damage and needs this money for repair. 
   Now, I just want to point out that the great explosion, the truly irresponsible explosion, of congressional earmarking began shortly after the party which is in the minority gained control of the Congress in 1995. And so during that period of time, we have gone from zero earmarking in the Labor, Health, and Education budget to over $1 billion a year. We have tripled the number of earmarks in the defense bill. The number of earmarks in this legislation, while it has been reorganized a couple times, has gone up in similar kind of proportion. Yet this year, this year, we are reducing the number of earmarks and the number of dollars involved in those earmarks by 50 percent from what they were under the last time that a budget was put through completely with earmarks under the leadership of the gentleman's party. So we are trying to clean up a mess and get a good strong measure of the earmarking process. 
   But this one, I think, is legitimate for its purposes, and I hope the amendment will be defeated. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, to respond to this, last night, as the gentleman from New Jersey has already pointed out, we had an amendment being offered which was subject to a point of order. I had agreed that I would be happy to work with him, and I obviously will be very happy to work with the three Members who are part of this colloquy from New Jersey, from Pennsylvania and from New York, on this issue, which is an important issue and would require authorization legislation to do, and that is why the point of order lay last night. 
   Mr. Chairman, I repeat, I will be happy to work with the three gentleman who have spoken on this issue as we go on toward conference.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, the major problem, other than lack of funds, related to aviation in this country for the next period of time is the great growth in traffic. We are expecting total traffic to pass 1 billion passengers within the next 10 years. Over the last 10 years it has risen from, gone well above 500 million passengers per year. 
   Now, this amendment will make the cost of providing facilities and equipment in order to be able to meet that great growth in traffic much higher than it otherwise would be. The modern equipment that is necessary, most of the present towers need to be upgraded, the equipment needs to be upgraded, towers need to be built for the next generation of air traffic control to deal with all of that huge increase in expected traffic. The towers themselves are expensive. The electronic equipment, the facilities, what you call the STARS systems for control, all of these are expensive items, and the expense of the process burgeons if we do not make other kinds of efficiencies. 
   Now, this amendment would halt all of the modernization of air traffic control facilities, both TRACONs and towers, and the equipment within those facilities. Consolidation has already gone on very successfully in some parts of the country. 
   The gentleman from Florida has suggested that there are problems in safety, potential problems in safety. Look, in California they have consolidated to now two TRACONs covering the whole State for the 30-plus million people in California and the roughly 40 commercial air systems, airports that are there. So that kind of consolidation has gone on also in New York, also in Chicago, also in Atlanta, in all of those places, some of the most complicated air traffic systems in the country. The most complicated ones have already been undergoing consolidations, and this proposal would stop that process. 
   It would cost us $85 million in savings from planned and designed and in construction consolidations that are already in process. It would cost another $110 million in funds which would expire, because funds for FAA facilities and equipment goes on a 3-year cycle. 
   In addition, there would be $225 million in construction funds that will be placed on hold. It is an extremely costly endeavor, and it is generally wrongheaded, really. We have to have this consolidation because it's critical to the efficient dealing with our movement of air traffic in this country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar).

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out that the gentleman from Florida has made the point that the House passed last year legislation doing this. That was never acted upon and was not included in the CR, the final CR for the 2007 budget. That was adopted in the House version of the bill, but it was not carried through to the CR. So there is no precedent of merit there. 
   Secondly, the crux of our problem is that we have a huge growth of air traffic that is expected within a 20-year period. From 1995 to the year 2015, we will have gone from half a billion passengers to a billion passengers, and that is in the commercial traffic, plus all of the increase in general aviation. We cannot sit with our head in the sand and not modernize all these facilities, the towers, the facilities, the equipment, the control systems that are necessary to deal with that increase in traffic, and that has to be done. It has already been done in some of our major parts of the country. 
   The gentleman from Texas has concerns about Texas. The authorizing language which the T&I Committee has reported out includes a system to look at those cases to review and to set up a system for reviewing how those systems will be set up in additional places as the consolidation of TRACONs and the modernization of these facilities and the reequipment of these facilities must go forward. 
   So I think that that part of it is a red herring, truly. In the case of Chicago and New York and Philadelphia and Washington and California, our heaviest traffic locations in the country, and Atlanta besides, we already have these consolidations in place. And in the case of California, 40-some-odd airports and their tower facilities have been included now in 2 TRACONs where there used to be 8 or more TRACONs in the State of California. 
   So the number of TRACONs is going to come down. It must come down, and we must get on with this modernization of the facilities and equipment that otherwise would always be very costly. It must be done.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, this and the previous amendment go together. Together, if these two amendments pass, our air traffic control system will be set back years in the process from which they have been going forward in trying to modernize both the air traffic design and the TRACON facilities to be used. 
   The FAA has spent more than $50 million on airspace redesign in the New York, Philadelphia, New Jersey, western Connecticut area already. They have posted hundreds of outreach meetings to understand the needs and concerns. In addition, the design has undergone independent analysis by the inspector general throughout the process, and the FAA has adopted each of the IG's recommendations. 
   Now, what are the benefits, what are the purposes of the airspace redesign? Well, number one, we have got this huge expected increase in traffic that I have already spoken to twice. 
   Secondly, the air traffic region that is being described here, and this amendment only affects that region, not the whole country, only that region, but that air traffic system, that airspace system, is the system where the greatest delays, the greatest delays, are happening as we speak. 
   The redesign of the airspace would allow for a major reduction in delays, first of all. By so doing, there would be less noise. They would be able to fly at higher altitudes, and use a gradual glide pattern in rather than stepwise glide patterns in, and use the whole airspace so that the net reduction of people who are affected by noise, by the levels of noise, is very large. 
   In addition to that, environmentally if you are not flying around for long periods of time in the airspace and under delay and in holding patterns and sitting on the tarmac with the engines going, then you are saving a lot of fuel.     
   There will be much less fuel burned, therefore, much better air quality control in the process. 
   All of these taken together, along with the fact that if you've got delays in that major area where so much traffic occurs, then there are backups with delays all over the country. So the air space design issue is a critical issue in totality for our modernization of our traffic control. 
   So, I oppose the amendment, and I hope it will not be adopted. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, the author of this amendment is undoubtedly trying to get at some egregious earmarks that are funded in this bill or in some other bill; however, in drafting a provision that is so broad in scope that what we have is an amendment that's careless. 
   There are legitimate parking facilities that can be built using Federal funds, and I use an example, for instance, the parking facilities that we have with elder housing projects, built in various places around the country, but this amendment would kill that. 
   Under current law Federal funds can be used to fund park-and-ride facilities and other activities aimed at encouraging carpooling and vanpooling. In fact, these activities are of such a high priority that they're eligible for 100 percent Federal funding and require no State or local match. Similarly, Federal funds are used to build safety rest areas along our interstates. This amendment would put an end to that. 
   For these reasons and others, this amendment must be defeated.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment is an amendment that reduces the overall funding in this legislation by $3.2 billion, which is the amount of the budget as passed for the 2007 fiscal year by way of the continuing resolution that was passed back in February. In this process we have had a large number of holes in the legislation that had been presented to us by the President for this year, and in his budget was $2.8 billion under the bill that we had presented here this evening. 
   In the process there are several items which are very similar and some which are quite different in reaching where we are in this legislation. In particular, the section 8 funding under HUD, we felt that we had to increase the funding for section 8, both for the Tenant-Based Housing Assistance program and for the Project-Based Housing Assistance program, by a substantial sum of money. That is done specifically because there was a change in the CR of the authorizations there for funding vouchers, and in order to make certain that every person had their vouchers and no one was going to lose rental assistance, it was necessary then to add about $1 billion into tenant-based and project-based assistance in order to meet that and fill that need. That is one of the items. 
   We had also to very substantially increase the programs in transportation in order to reach the guarantees necessary for meeting SAFETEA-LU, which, of course, the President doesn't really care about. 
   So those items, which I think everybody in this Congress agrees with, have had to be increased and require that we not reduce the funding under the legislation to the level that has been suggested.

   Mr. OLVER. I just wanted to respond to the gentleman who had just spoken. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Minnesota has mentioned twice in the comments that he has made, at least twice in the comments, that, again, the idea that this budget that we are dealing with has somehow inherent in it the largest tax increase in American history, twice he has made that comment. 
   Well, the budget that we are dealing with has no increase in taxes whatsoever related to it. I think the gentleman understands that. In fact, even the budget resolution that guides the budgeting this year for all of our bills, all of our discretionary budget legislation, that budget resolution does not have any tax increase in it either. I think the gentleman understands that as well. 
   We are making messages here that are really not correct. They are simply not accurate. They are simply not true. 
   I want to make a couple of points. I want to remind the gentleman and others from the other side who have spoken that since President Bush took office, the national debt has increased by over $3 trillion, $3 trillion, over 3, it's closer to $3.3 trillion. That's 3 with 12 zeros behind it. 
   Some people have a difficult time understanding a three with six zeros behind it. That's $1 million. But $3 trillion, with 12 zeros behind it is $1 million, million dollars. 
   That debt increase of $3 trillion that has occurred in the 6 years that President Bush has been in power in the Presidency, that ends up costing us, the American people, us as a Nation, $100 billion each and every year in additional deficit, which is what has happened, an additional deficit, every year $100 billion each year, which is some 200 times the amount of money that is being suggested ought to be cut from this one little budget that we are talking about that provides money for a whole series of very important initiatives that serve the American people. 
   To close, I could go on substantially on the debt, but the $500 million that has been suggested that should be cut from this budget, this one simple budget that funds housing and transportation programs of the government, this one budget, if one compares the $500 million, that two pieces of the budget, the $500 million is essentially the same money that we had to put back in the budget because Amtrak would have shut down. 
   $500 million is about the same amount of money as was put into that. It is about one half of the money that was put back in to make certain that not a single family, low-income family, people who are living with incomes of under 30 percent of the adjusted median income in their areas, one half of the amount of money that would allow all of those people who had vouchers and who are getting rental assistance, in that very low-income category, to maintain their vouchers for the next year. 
   It is also a sum of money which is somewhat less than the amount that we had to put back into the budget to bring it up to these levels, to the 2007 enacted level at $700 million, or the Community Development Block Grant program, which provides money to virtually every community in the country, larger cities, by direct distribution from the Federal Government through Housing and Urban Development, but also to many smaller cities and communities, even quite small communities, through the money that's distributed to the States who then give it back to those communities in order to build affordable housing and build public facilities in their communities. 
   It is very close to the amount of money that is included in this budget and provides for the construction of elder housing, housing for the disabled and housing for distressed public housing as well. 
   So that is what is involved in $500 million at this point. I hope the amendment is defeated.

   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I just want to say to the gentlewoman from North Carolina that the absolute platinum standard for fiscal irresponsibility lies squarely on the shoulders of her party and the Presidents of her party. 
   The national debt for this country when President Carter left office in 1981 was less than $1 trillion. The national debt 12 years later, in the case of President Carter, that represents the debt that had been reached over 180 years of American history. Twelve years later, the national debt when the first President Bush left office was $4.3 trillion, more than four times as much, more than quadrupling the total national debt. That is the gold standard of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   And then we had 8 years of President Clinton, and the national debt went up another $1.2 trillion, about a 25 percent increase in the national debt in the 8 years that he was President. 
   But then, under the present President Bush and the Congress of his party in control during those years, the national debt has gone up $3.3 trillion more, a total of about two-thirds more, 67 or 68 percent more in debt. That is the platinum standard in debt increase and in fiscal irresponsibility.

   Mr. OLVER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The gentleman from Georgia is attempting to renew an authorizing fight, which is only a matter of days old, on the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill, and that is not the appropriate way to handle the question of the affordable housing trust. 
   Our capable authorizers, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee Mr. Frank, and the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee of that committee Ms. Waters, have included an Affordable Housing Trust Fund in their FHA reform bill. That bill was passed by the House last week or 2 weeks ago. I forget which week it was. 
   Clearly there is a need for more affordable housing in this country. The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University has documented that from 1993 to the year 2003 alone, we have lost 1.2 million affordable units. It is also documented that we have some 8 million households in this country who have incomes below 30 percent of the adjusted median income in their area. Those households all fall within the lowest, most vulnerable category of people who are eligible for assistance under the Housing and Urban Development Department. We are only providing somewhere in the total of 2.5- to 3 million units for all of that 8 million people and households who are falling within that very low-income category. However, we don't intend to step on the turf of our authorizing committee by renewing the fight about that bill, which passed, as I said, just a few days ago, on this bill tonight. 
   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment and urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Either this is not a serious amendment or it is an exceedingly serious amendment. This amendment is either totally unnecessary or it has a really nefarious purpose. We do have rules and regulations, I think, that might come under the material of the legislation that support and require certain set-asides for minority or women-owned businesses in providing among all of our contracting in transportation departments, in some of those departments, and under certain circumstances. I think those are entirely appropriate. 
   I don't know whether this is the sort of thing that the gentleman was trying to get at, but I think that this has some entirely unknown effects. Perhaps I should have asked the gentleman whether he had particular things in mind that he knew about because I couldn't at first think of any.

Mr. Chairman, I want to assure the gentleman from Georgia that this and other important safety standards are the utmost priority of the committee, as they have been all of the years I have served on, earlier, the Transportation Subcommittee and now the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. 
   Occupant ejection prevention is critical to saving lives. Motor coach and school bus accidents are not necessarily commonplace, but when these tragedies occur, they shake the Nation to its core. The committee highlighted that motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for young Americans, and strong safety standards are the cornerstone to protecting American lives.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment. 
   The amendment would eliminate the requirement that the funding provided in this bill comply with the prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that the Davis-Bacon law was enacted about 75 years ago by a Republican Congress and a Republican administration. 
   The law sets minimum labor standards for workers employed in Federal contract construction and ensures that workers are paid at least the locally prevailing wage. There's no good reason for denying prevailing wage protection to workers involved in transportation. This is an issue of fairness for working men and women. 
   Without Davis-Bacon, the transportation construction industry, which is responsible for building our highways and transit systems, might suffer from low-bid firms that aim to undercut local wages and perform construction on the cheap. 
   Davis-Bacon encourages a higher quality of workmanship, and we should not do away with the law for transportation construction where we need the highest quality and the longest lasting workmanship. 
   I urge a rejection of this amendment.

   There was no objection. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, there are two problems with the motion to recommit, one major and one tricky. First, I will take the major one. I want to point out to the Members of the House that the adoption of the motion to recommit offered by the gentleman from California will derail the bill. The motion instructs the committee to report the bill back promptly rather than forthwith. Unlike a motion to recommit with instructions to report back forthwith, a motion with other than forthwith instructions proposes to take the bill from the floor without reaching the question of passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, section 1002(b) of the House Manual states, ``Unlike the case  of the motion to recommit with instructions to report back forthwith, the adoption of which occasions an immediate report to the floor, the adoption to a motion to recommit with instructions to report back other than forthwith sends the bill to committee whose eventual report, if any, would not be immediately before the House.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, a vote for this motion to recommit takes the bill off the floor. A vote against the motion will allow the bill to go forward to final passage. For that reason, I urge defeat of the motion to recommit. 
   Secondly, the bill before us includes a rescission of $1.3 billion, which is exactly the same size that the President proposed for the 2008 budget and which is, in fact, lower than what was rescinded last year. HUD refuses to tell specifically where it will take the rescission from, but the President obviously believes that HUD can meet the rescission. The motion purports to disallow rescission from certain accounts, but HUD has traditionally not used those accounts, so the President must have believed that he could meet the rescission without rescinding funds from those three specific accounts. 
   So again, this one is the tricky one, and I would say that given the trickiness of it, that we should defeat the motion to recommit and go on to passage of the bill. For both reasons, I urge the Members to vote against recommittal of the bill. 
   I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Maryland.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman from West Virginia for yielding time and for his dedicated leadership of the Resources Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1483, but I will address my specific comments to subtitle D of title II which authorizes the Freedom's Way National Heritage Area. 
   New England provided four of our original 13 States and has been long associated with our Nation's formative years, our major social and intellectual movements and, of course, great natural beauty. The area that comprises the proposed Freedom's Way National Heritage Area, which is included in this bill, has provided the backdrop for many other events and movements that shaped America. 
   Freedom's Way includes 37 communities in Massachusetts and eight in New Hampshire that are historically rich. Freedom's Way chronicles and celebrates the Revolutionary War stories of Lexington and Concord. Additionally, the free religious expression and social movements of the Shakers and Transcendentalists had their roots in the region. The area also hosted the social justice and the social criticism development found in the writings of Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, Fuller and Thoreau. And finally, the movements for the abolition of slavery, women's rights and environmental conservation all have roots within the boundary of Freedom's Way. 
   The proposed initiative embodies the National Park Service's criteria for national heritage areas. It will conserve historic, cultural, scenic and natural resources for the benefit of current and future generations. The idea has received widespread support from local residents and has the support from every Member of the House whose district includes a portion of the proposed area. 
   With this designation, the communities included will benefit from better resources to create a cohesive learning experience, using the natural setting and historical and cultural artifacts to tell the story of American democracy.  
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1483.

   Let me remind them, H.R. 6899 contains essentially the same drilling language they demanded a vote on in June and July. Yet, they will vote against it today just as they did in June and July when they voted against requiring drilling in the already leased National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, against cracking down on speculation, and against releasing a small portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   The truth is, they don't want to even begin to fix the problem. They only want to distract public attention from eight disastrous years of the Bush administration.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important legislation to put America back to work. The financial crisis on Wall Street will soon be addressed by this Congress, and we must not adjourn for the year without also throwing a lifeline to the millions of people that are struggling to find work and support their families. 
   In the last year alone, the unemployment rate has risen from 4.3 percent to 6.1 percent. Furthermore, we currently need about 125,000 new jobs each month just to keep pace with population growth. Instead, we have lost over 600,000 jobs since January, yielding a deficit of 1,600,000 jobs so far this year. 
   The jobs bill before us is needed for two reasons. It will create thousands of new good-paying jobs, and it will help close the investment gap in our transportation and housing infrastructure. The transportation and housing infrastructure parts of this bill will create nearly 500,000 jobs. 
   In addition to the jobs created, the infrastructure investments we fund will make a lasting and tangible impact on this country. This bill provides funding only for projects that will have an immediate economic impact and can be bid within 90 days. The bill includes almost $13 billion to create safer and less congested roads and bridges, over $5 billion to improve and expand transit and intercity passenger rail, $600 million for safety and capacity improvements at our Nation's airports, and $1 billion in infrastructure funding for the public housing capital fund, which will help repair our Nation's public housing. 
   Let's put America back to work and improve our transportation and housing infrastructure by passing the Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House the fiscal year 2008 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. 
   I thank Members for their input and work on this bill. I especially recognize the important contributions of my ranking member Mr. Knollenberg in putting this bill together. As former chairman of this subcommittee, he had numerous valuable insights that make the bill and report stronger, and I have appreciated his advice and counsel during this process. 
   I also thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee Mr. Obey and the ranking member of the full committee Mr. Lewis for their support. 
   I must also recognize the hard work of the staff on both the majority and minority side. Kate Hallahan, Cheryle Tucker, David Napoliello, Laura Hogshead, Alex Gillen, Mark Fedor and Bob Letteney with the majority staff, and Dena Baron, David Gibbons and Jeff Goff with the minority have spent many late nights putting this bill together, and we would not be here today without their great dedication. 
   This is a bipartisan and fiscally responsible bill. Indeed, this bill should not be partisan because a broad consensus affirming the great needs for transportation infrastructure investments and for affordable housing exists countrywide. 
   The bill provides $50.7 billion in discretionary funding for transportation and housing programs, and is within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. 
   Nonetheless, due to current budgetary constraints, the subcommittee was forced to either flat-fund or reduce numerous programs. Furthermore, there are no major expansions of existing programs and only a handful of new initiatives. 
   Our first hearings this year sought a broad assessment of the future challenges this country faces in transportation and housing. Not surprisingly, our hearings showed that there's a great and growing need for transportation infrastructure and affordable housing, particularly in metro areas experiencing explosive growth, such as Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix and Las Vegas; but also in older metropolitan areas such as Boston, New York, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, whose infrastructure is aging and in need of extensive repair; and even in rural communities and counties suffering from a loss of population and disinvestment in both housing and transportation. 
   To meet these challenges we have restored the President's deepest cuts and have continued important investments in transportation and housing started by my predecessors. In short, we've tried to make our core programs whole and function better, rather than start a lot of new initiatives. 
   With regard to transportation, our bill fully funds the highway and transit guarantees contained in the current transportation authorization bill known as SAFETEA-LU. 
   The bill contains $40.2 billion for highways, which is $631 million over the President's request; and $9.7 billion for transit investments, $334 million over the President's request. 
   Adequate investments in our highways and transit systems are critical to the economic and social future of our country. Vehicle miles traveled on our Nation's roads have doubled since 1980. 
   While we have fully funded the highway guarantees this year, I must warn my colleagues about the future solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. The Office of Management and Budget recently estimated that by the end of the fiscal year 2009, the Highway Trust Fund will have a $4 billion deficit. This deficit is far greater than any other previous projection and will inhibit our ability to fully fund the highway guarantees in the future without additional transportation revenues which must be provided through the authorization process. 
   Our bill also continues to make critical investments in aviation. In 1995, our aviation system handled 545 million passengers, but that system must handle 1 billion passengers by 2015. We must provide adequate infrastructure to deal with that growth. 
   Our bill includes $3.6 billion for the Airport Improvement Program, restoring the President's $765 million cut, and adding $85 million above fiscal year 2007. The bill restores funding for the Essential Air Service Program so that no existing service will be lost.     
   We have also invested over the President's request for transportation safety. Specifically, an increase of $20 million for critical aviation safety inspectors and engineers; a $2 million increase for additional investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board; a $3 million increase to preserve highway safety staff at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and a $6.2 million increase for staffing and research programs related to pipeline and hazardous materials safety. 
   Investments in intercity passenger rail, especially in high-density travel corridors, must also be part of a valid transportation system. The bill provides $1.4 billion for Amtrak, plus $50 million for a new intercity passenger rail State matching grant program requested by the administration; thus, the bill leverages a total of $1.5 billion for intercity passenger rail. This funding will help create a faster, safer, and more reliable intercity passenger rail system. 
   With regard to housing, four major categories of HUD programs provide assistance for very low-income families, the elderly, the disabled, and their communities. First, HUD provides our 3,200 public housing authorities funding for the operation and capital needs of the Nation's public housing stock. Public housing is home to 2.6 million people, more than half of whom are seniors and persons with disabilities. 
   Second, HUD administers rental assistance programs, largely under the section 8 tenant- and project-based programs. Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance serves about 1.9 million low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities, while the project-based section 8 assists more than 1.4 million households, two-thirds of which include elderly or disabled persons. Both the tenant- and project-based programs serve very low-income individuals and families, overwhelmingly those whose incomes are below 50 percent of the median household income for their area. 
   Third, HUD administers housing production programs, including the HOME program; the HOPE VI program, which revitalizes or replaces severely distressed public housing; and construction programs for the elderly and disabled. 
   Finally, HUD administers a number of community and economic development programs, the largest being Homeless Assistance Grants and Community Development Block Grants. 
   My colleagues are all very familiar with CDBG, the Community Development Block Grant program. But many of our constituents may be unaware of the importance of CDBG in their communities. CDBG funds are used by communities to rehabilitate and construct affordable housing; to construct public facilities improvements, such as streetscaping and community centers; and to promote local economic development and job creation. About 70 percent of CDBG dollars go directly to communities with populations of about 50,000 or more. The remaining funds go by formula to the States and are distributed to smaller towns and rural communities. Taken together, HUD programs address the large unmet need for affordable housing throughout the country. 
   The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Howard University has documented that, from 1993 to 2003 alone, we lost 1.2 million affordable housing units. In fact, approximately three-fourths of American households which, by household income, are eligible for HUD assistance receive none. 
   In the face of this, we have done our best to restore the President's cuts to housing. Some accounts we have only been able to freeze at last year's funding level. In other accounts we have targeted increases where the people served by the HUD program were particularly harmed. Funding is included to renew all current section 8 tenant-based vouchers so that no one who has a voucher will lose it. To that end the bill provides an increase of $330 million above the President's request for tenant-based rental assistance and nearly double that increase for project-based assistance. 
   Within the section 8 funding provided in the bill, we have $30 million for 4,000 incremental housing vouchers for nonelderly disabled individuals, some of whom will be homeless veterans. 
   The President's fiscal 2008 budget request cut CDBG by over $700 million from the 2007 enacted level, cut housing for the elderly by $160 million, cut housing for disabled by 50 percent below fiscal year 2007, and for HOPE VI zeroed the program out for 2008 and rescinded 2007 funding. 
   Our bill rejects all of these cuts for our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. We have funded CDBG at $4.18 billion, which is $400 million over the enacted 2007 budget but still $400 million below the CDBG budget for fiscal year 2001, 6 years ago. We have restored funding to last year's level of $735 million for elderly housing, the 202 program, and $237 million for housing for the disabled, the 811 program, as well as provided $120 million for HOPE VI, a small increase from last year. 
   With our funding decisions, we have also promoted sustainability by encouraging more environmentally friendly transportation and housing practices. We have restored the President's cuts to transit and to our intercity passenger rail system, which are more fuel efficient than other transportation modes. Thanks to Mr. Knollenberg's leadership, we have increased funding for the clean fuel bus program by $26 million. 
   In the area of housing, we have included language in urging HUD to incorporate stronger energy efficiency standards into the HOPE VI program as well as other HUD programs. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill is a compromise, and we have had to balance a number of competing needs. There are areas where I would have liked to provide more dollars. However, we have done our best with limited dollars to invest in our transportation networks and affordable housing. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I would like to make a comment on the gentleman's amendment since the gentleman has indicated that he is willing to withdraw the amendment. I appreciate that. The gentleman and I have worked for several years now together on biking and rail-trail issues, so I can remember just a few years ago that we actually were closely involved in saving the transportation enhancement program on this very bill. 
   We both recognize the environmental and public health benefits of bicycling. Even though I have stopped bicycling, I watch the Tour de France rather than bicycling myself these days. So I applaud the gentleman's concern and support for the Conserve by Bike program. 
   As we move toward conference, I will do my very best to try to accommodate this, and just remind the gentleman that we have language in the bill to make certain that enhancements are not disproportionately cut in the case of rescissions, which is a balancing act in any case. The gentleman may wish to take part in that discussion, which may occur later this evening.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment strikes the language on page 18 of the bill that delineates how the rescission will be applied. I remind the gentleman from Florida, although I suspect he does already know this, that the rescission in the 2006 bill was $3.8 billion. The rescission in the 2007 bill was $4.2 billion. The first of those was passed by the Republican majority, and the second was in its final form through the CR that came in the Democratic majority.

   Mr. OLVER. That is correct. The gentleman is correct, the flexibility was there. But what we find out in that process is that the States very disproportionately focused that rescission upon enhancements and took enhancements in some places completely out of the budget, which, under the highway fund, we are supposed to be giving 10 percent of the highway formula moneys to enhancements. 
   So this language was, in fact, exactly or very similar to language which was passed out of the T&I Committee of which the gentleman is the ranking member a couple of days after we had marked up in committee. So the T&I Committee already has agreed to the idea that enhancements should not be disproportionately targeted for rescissions when they occur when they are required by the legislation. 
   In fact, we were asked by the T&I Committee to do something very similar to this, if not exactly this, which we have done, in making certain that there would not be disproportionate cuts to enhancements in the process of applying rescissions. And those data do not really affect what has happened to the 2007 or 2006 bills because we don't have the final numbers on those, but the data that I am describing is all through the rescission process in every year that there has been rescissions, that those have in sum total gone heavily against the enhancement parts of the formula funds. So we have striven to correct that in the language that we have put in at this point, and I would ask the membership to oppose this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Minnesota. 
   First of all, I think that the subcommittee and the full committee, this legislation was passed out of full committee unanimously without dissent, by voice vote but without dissent, and we've tried to strike an appropriate balance in funding the transportation and housing problems in the bill. 
   As in previous bills in previous years, I've opposed amendments that take funding from housing to increase the funding for transportation programs, and similarly, I've opposed amendments which take funding from transportation and transfer those funds to housing programs.     
   I think that's entirely appropriate. We have this bill where we cannot have one portion. Each has its important features, and we cannot have one portion of this bill taking sizeable funds from another portion, which has equally important priorities within the bill. 
   I would point out to my colleagues that in the bill before us, the appropriation for the homeless is $1.56 billion. That's $119 million already above the 2007 enacted sum for the Homeless Grant Program. That's 8 percent already above the level of the 2007 enacted program from just last February. 
   The amendment that the gentlewoman has proposed would move another $106 million into that, which would then put it far over the President's request, that program. I don't think that that's really necessary here. 
   What we do have is a situation where year after year the Amtrak program has gone through reform, substantial reform, to try to reduce their cost and to provide greater service, as has been requested by this Congress over the last several years. To take that money away from them at a time when the other body, the Senate, has passed authorization legislation or has reported out of committee authorization legislation, and our own T&I Committee is working on authorizing legislation for Amtrak, which is considerably higher than even the level of the funding that we have in this bill. 
   For both of those reasons, the balance of the legislation not moving money from housing into transportation or vice versa, which I will oppose at every point that it comes up, because I think we are trying to keep a reasonable balance of the priorities in each of those very important areas, and because the homeless program is already funded at almost $120 million above the 2007 funded amount, that this is not a necessary amendment, not an appropriate amendment. I hope that we will not pass this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, this is an effort to bring Amtrak to a stop, simply. Over the last couple of years, we have had the President recommend no funding for Amtrak. We have refused that and funded them so they could continue service at the level that they were. We have added reform programs to them to require substantial savings out of the first-class service and the meals service and things of that sort, which have been quite substantial, and they have saved each year $80 million to $100 million a year on that program. So we are moving to make the system more efficient, though there is not any passenger rail system anywhere in this world that operates without some operating subsidy. 
   Where we have public transportation systems, any subway system, the fares never get to as high as 50 percent of the cost of the service, and the remaining service is then part of a subsidy for the operation of that service. In fact, most of our transit programs function at considerably less than a 50-percent fare box amount. So Amtrak is not any different from any other rail program which provides great energy efficiency in the movement of large numbers of people, and it is very important in our very densely populated corridors. 
   We as a Congress have then added the idea of having a national rail system that covers long-distance rail. And those even require a greater subsidy, but it has been our decision to do that over the years. 
   We have to have a rail program in this country. We have somehow to get over making Amtrak ultimately, somehow, to morph Amtrak into a system that will provide high-speed passenger rail in corridors of relatively short distance. But in the meantime, we also have to keep Amtrak running, and this amendment would take the operating monies completely away from a system which cannot operate without that operating subsidy. 
   The rest of the money, the gentleman believes most of the remainder was in there for capital improvements. Well, there isn't any point in having the capital improvements if you are not going to have an operating subsidy unless you can move the monies around, and then you have to cut seriously the total amount of service that is being provided by Amtrak with the amendment that the gentleman has offered. So it is really a killing amendment for Amtrak. 
   Amtrak cannot function with the amendment that the gentleman from Arizona has offered in this instance. We have gone through this fight time and time again, and each time the end result is that Amtrak is supported because Amtrak service is provided in over 40 of the States. In some cases, it is the only rail passenger service that is available to people in some of those States on some of the very long-distance rail lines that people complain are the ones that carry the highest subsidy. And those are supported the strongest because they are the only rail service, passenger service that is available in a good number of those States. 
   So I think that this amendment should be defeated, I think it will be defeated, and I hope it will be defeated. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I again oppose this amendment. This is just a continuation of the effort to strangle Amtrak. 
   In this instance I think that what I'd like to do is to just try to review with the, whoever is still listening at this hour of the night what the President's budgets have looked like over the last several years. I may be slightly wrong, because I maybe have 1 year misplaced as to what happened, but I have been the ranking member for 2 years, the last 2 years, in the 2006 and 2007 budgets. My recollection is that the 2006 budget that the President provided no money, and we had to fill the hole completely to keep whatever was functional functioning in the case of Amtrak. 
   And then in the 2007 budget, that year we ended up providing between, by the time the conference process was complete, $1.3 billion for a mixture of operating subsidies and capital programs. In the 2007 budget, the administration came up with a number which was much lower than what had been appropriated the previous year, and again we had to, it was around 8- or $900 million in total, and we, again we had to come up with a higher sum of money, back to the $1.3 billion, in order to complete, to keep the level of service where it was, which includes the whole of the Northeast corridor, which carries half of all the passengers and is trackage that is owned by Amtrak, and all the services that go out of Chicago and the other metropolitan areas, and the long-distance services on the west coast and across the country. 
   So what we have this year is that the President came up with an amount of $500 million for capital, and $300 million for efficiency incentive grants, which is sort of an oxymoron because in the previous year, we had provided some sort of incentive grants which Amtrak, after they had provided the savings and made serious savings in the accounts, they then found that they got exactly nothing in the way of incentive grants that were released to them. So what's the point, really, of trying to save money? 
   But we've included that language, included the mandate essentially, that they are to continue to look for savings in the system. In the meantime we provided, again, the $1.3-, now up to $1.4- because of inflation, a total of $1.4 billion of which now the amount was put up to $925 million for capital, which the gentleman wishes to reduce to $500 million for capital, which was never adequate in the first place. 
   On the Northeast corridor, we have done so little upkeep, we are nowhere close to a state of good repair, which is dangerous. It is causing safety problems in the Northeast corridor, where more than half of our total passengers are being handled, so that the gentleman's amendment takes away capital monies now. This is the second hit at it, the capital monies that would be necessary to make progress on dealing with the backlog of capital deficiencies that have been built up over a period of years. 
   There are tunnels and bridges and trackage and the cantanary lines, the electric lines and so forth that go with it, all of which are in need desperately of capital repair and a steady infusion of money to bring that up to date. These are expensive propositions when nothing has been done or so little has been done over a period of time. 
   So first the gentleman has made an effort to reduce the operating subsidy, which no rail system anywhere in the world can function without it, and now he's reducing the capital grant program down to a level which leaves us with an ever-worsening state of safety and repair on the part of the system that is actually owned by the Federal Government.  
   So this should not be done. This is a bad amendment. This is another killer amendment for Amtrak, and I hope that the amendment will be defeated.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I think we got a little bit confused by the chairman of the authorizing committee's involvement here. But in any case, I very much sympathize with the gentleman from New Jersey's point of view. There is language in our report that deals specifically with businesses using railroad properties as waste transfer handling points and urges the Surface Transportation Board to ensure that these types of operations are subject to local, State, and Federal regulations as other solid waste facilities are. 
   So, again, I sympathize with the gentleman from New Jersey and Members from other affected States. My subcommittee will work with the STB to close this legal loophole and prevent instances of illegal handling of solid waste on railroad facilities. But it is an authorizing issue, and we have not allowed authorizing issues in the legislation this year. My ranking member has been particularly insistent and I have been insistent about that as we have moved thus far. And so I would have insisted on my point of order, and I appreciate the gentleman's withdrawing the amendment.

   Mr. OLVER. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment to cut the $330 million from the Tenant-based Rental Assistance account will not hold the program steady at the fiscal 2007 level. It will actually cut somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 families that are currently in the program. That means that somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 families, that is a large margin but that is families, that is real people, that currently have a section 8 voucher will find themselves without a home in fiscal year 2008. 
   Now, we know that rents increase each year. This is a market-based program, and market-based programs do escalate, are subject to inflation.     
   And that's what this $330 million amount was. It was a deficiency in the President's budget, where the President's budget was presented to the Congress before the actions in this continuing resolution in February of this year were acted upon, were taken by the Congress, and the President signed, ultimately, that legislation in the continuing resolution. 
   So, his original amount of money was for an entirely different set of circumstances because there was a restructuring of the section 8, the tenant-based section 8 program in the continuing resolution. And keeping the people with the number of vouchers, the vouchers that have been out there, we had to come up with the additional money in this bill which only allows the same number of people to have vouchers. 
   There is one $30 million amount in here for the first incremental vouchers added to the system in about 6 years; $30 million to be used for new vouchers for nonelderly disabled people and homeless veterans. As my ranking member pointed out, while we were affording 4,000 new vouchers, 3,000 of them go to nonelder disabled people, and 1,000 of them go to nonelder disabled people who also happen to be homeless veterans. That's how the 4,000 is structured. It's a very good, one of only a handful of initiatives in this bill for new vouchers for that particular program. 
   I can't really fathom why anybody would want to deny thousands of people with disabilities and homeless veterans a chance to live in a safe, affordable home. 
   I strongly oppose this amendment and urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would also like to point out to the gentleman from Ohio that we have available about, under authorization, 2.1 million vouchers of which this bill only funds 1.9 million of them at the level that we have provided the money with the 4,000 additional vouchers. 
   I would like to remind that the authorizing committee just brought out legislation and has added 20,000 in authorization for each of the next 5 years. Whether we will have the funding next year to actually provide that money, I do not know, but they're asking for us not only to move upward toward filling the vouchers that presently are authorized, but also adding some additional ones. 
   And the reason for that is that we have 8 million families roughly, 8 million households in this country which are living at incomes below 30 percent of the median income in their areas, and we are only providing somewhere in the range of 2 million, a little bit less even in this funding, of money for rental assistance for those people. So we're not coming anywhere close to dealing with the poorest people who are eligible under the law as it is written for that rental assistance because their income lies below 30 percent of median income in the area involved.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding time and for his good work along with Chairwoman Slaughter, Ranking Member Dreier and Members on both sides of the aisle in granting this open rule for the debate governing the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. 
   We requested an open rule with some necessary waivers. The Rules Committee has granted that, and for that we are grateful. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill is a bipartisan, nonpartisan bill, as it should be. I urge the adoption of the rule and passage of the bill. 
   Let me briefly summarize the highlights of the bill. With regard to Transportation, the bill meets the highway and transit funding guarantees mandated by the authorizations, SAFETEA-LU. In meeting the guarantees, we were required to increase above the President's request the highway obligation limit by $631 million and funding for transit programs by $334 million. 
   Airport development grants are funded at $3.6 billion, which represents an increase of $850 million over the budget request, but only $85.5 million over the last year. The Essential Air Service program is funded at $110 million, which will preserve all existing air service at small and rural communities. 
   The President's request for Amtrak was woefully inadequate and would have resulted in the loss of intercity passenger rail service to many communities. Therefore, this bill includes $1.4 billion for Amtrak in order to preserve a national system and to assist the railroad in making capital investments to improve the railroad's overall service and reliability. 
   For the first time, the bill includes $50 million for State matching grants for intercity passenger rail and $35 million for the Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Program. 
   With regard to HUD, each year the President's HUD budget arrives at severe cuts to vital programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant Program, known as CDBG, housing for the elderly and disabled, and Hope VI. In the face of this, the committee has done its best to restore the cuts to the programs that serve our most vulnerable citizens. In some cases we have frozen funding at last year's funding levels. In other places we have targeted increases where the people served by HUD programs were particularly harmed. 
   Funding is included to renew all current section 8 tenant-based vouchers so that no one who has a voucher will lose it. To that end the bill provides an increase of $330 million from the President's request for tenant-based rental assistance and nearly $667 million increase for project-based rental assistance. Included within this amount is $30 million for 4,000 incremental housing vouchers designated for nonelderly disabled individuals, but which will simultaneously serve 1,000 homeless veterans. 
   We have funded CDBG at $4.18 billion, which is $400 million over last year, but still $400 million below the CDBG budget for fiscal year 2001. We have restored funding to last year's level of $735 million for section 202 elderly housing construction and to $237 million for section 811 housing construction for the disabled. We have also provided $120 million for the redevelopment of severely distressed public housing through the Hope VI program, a slight increase over the last year. 
   Once again I would like to thank our colleagues on the Rules Committee for their assistance in moving this bill forward, and I urge the adoption of the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 3074. Before I explain the contents of the conference report, however, I would like to thank my ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan, Joe Knollenberg, for his great help in crafting a well-balanced Transportation and Housing bill. Joe and I have put together a strong bipartisan bill that will help address the Nation's important transportation and housing needs. 
   I think Joe and I have been a good team and I look forward to working closely with him again next year. I would also like to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for all of their hard work. On the minority side, Dena Baron and Dave Gibbons and Jeff Goff. And on the majority side, Kate Hallahan, our clerk; Cheryle Tucker; David Napoliello; Laura Hogshead; Alex Gillen; Mark Fedor and Bob Letteney. They performed well under stress and trying circumstances, and without their dedication we would not be here today debating this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members can and should be proud of this bill because it provides critical investments in our Nation's transportation and housing infrastructure, and does so within a fiscally sound manner and within our conference allocation. 
   Unlike some other issues we debate in Congress, transportation and housing have a long history of bipartisanship, and I hope we can continue in that spirit of bipartisanship today. 
   At their core, both transportation and housing have a direct impact on the people we represent. All of us are affected by congestion on our roads, travel delays in our airports, and the lack of dependable public transportation. We also all benefit from community development investments and the availability of affordable housing in our communities. This bill in so many ways affects each and every one of us. 
   Let me briefly explain some of the highlights of the conference report. 
   For the first time in 13 years, our bill includes $75 million for the Veterans Affairs Supported Housing program, commonly known as VASH, to provide roughly 10,000 housing vouchers and supportive services to homeless veterans. 
   While we do not know the exact number of homeless veterans, the Veterans Administration has estimated that there were as many as 196,000 during a point-in-time count just last year. Surely we can all agree that 10,000 homeless veterans are 10,000 too many homeless veterans. Even one homeless veteran is a homeless veteran too many. 
   We have also included $30 million for about 4,000 new housing vouchers for the disabled, the first new housing vouchers for the disabled in 5 years. The need for housing for the disabled has been well documented, with average housing rents rising much faster than a disabled person's monthly supplemental security income, SSI. 
   Secondly, the bill provides $250 million to help with the current foreclosure crisis. We have included $200 million over the President's request for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a recognized national intermediary between lenders and homeowners, to help individuals and families forestall foreclosure and keep their homes. A separate $50 million is provided for HUD's housing counseling program to help new potential home buyers avoid future foreclosures. 
   According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the second quarter of this year saw the highest percentage of mortgages go into foreclosure since 1972. Many of those foreclosures and delinquencies are due to the proliferation of subprime and other adjustable-rate loans. With 2 million subprime mortgages expected to reset over the next 18 months, the number of homeowners facing delinquency is staggering in many parts of the country. 
   The funds included in this bill for foreclosure counseling is the first major Federal investment into this growing crisis. The President has stated on a number of occasions that he wants to help solve this problem. If he is serious, he would sign this bill into law and help many tens of thousands of families receive the help they need to manage their finances and the refinancing of their mortgage so they can keep their homes. 
   In addition, the bill also makes significant investment in our transportation infrastructure. The Minnesota bridge tragedy put a national spotlight in the State, on the state of America's transportation infrastructure, especially with the number of lives lost in that tragedy. More than 20,000 out of some 100,000-plus bridges on the national highway system are characterized as ``structurally deficient'' or ``functionally obsolete.'' Traffic on these bridges is over 190 million trips per day. 
   The conference report includes an additional billion dollars over the President's request for the bridge program as a downpayment to help States fix their long list of substandard bridges; $195 million is specifically included for the I-35 bridge in Minnesota, which alone carried 140,000 passenger vehicles per day. And that sum will make Minnesota whole for the full replacement of that Interstate 35 bridge in Minneapolis. 
   Those are the new initiatives, but there are numerous other positive transportation and housing investments in this bill. The bill honors the highway guarantees which were set in the authorization bill in 2005, the SAFETEA-LU authorizing bill which was brought forward by the now minority just 2 years ago. That guarantee provides a record level of investment in transit as well. This funding will improve the Nation's transportation and infrastructure and is expected to create close to 80,000 new jobs between highways and transit. 
   The bill also provides $1.375 billion for Amtrak, plus an additional $75 million for a new intercity passenger rail program to create a faster, safer, and more reliable intercity passenger rail system. That $75 million was requested by the President. 
   We have included $3.5 billion for the Airport Improvement Program, the same as last year, for critical airport safety capacity and security upgrades. 
   We have also provided almost $3.8 billion for Community Development Block Grants, the extremely popular CDBG program, which is $100 million above fiscal year 2007 but still $400 million below the fiscal year 2001 level. It is estimated that every dollar of community block grant funding leverages $3 in private investment for critical community and economic development priorities in over a thousand localities around the country. 
   The bill restores housing for the elderly and disabled to last year's level. And finally, we have provided enough funding to ensure that no one that has  a section 8 tenant or project-based housing voucher will lose that voucher in this fiscal 2008 year. 
   Mr. Speaker, transportation and housing is not a Republican, not a Democratic issue. A broad consensus exists affirming the great needs for transportation and infrastructure investment and affordable housing nationwide. As such, this budget should be above partisan politics and should be passed and signed into law. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to adopt the conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I hesitate to get involved between my chairman and my big ranking member here, but since they've gotten into it and the ranking member has made the comment that every suggestion that we make is to throw money at the problem, I just wanted to point out that the President has actually indicated that he will veto this legislation. It provides $3 billion more in budget authority than he requested in the original budget. 
   And I'd like to remind people on both sides of the aisle that in each of the last 6 years, each of the last 6 years, the President, rightly, signed transportation and housing budgets into law that were above his initial request. The irony here is that in fiscal year 2003, the President signed into law the transportation and housing budgets that were over $9 billion above his request. Ours is 3, on budget authority. And in fiscal 2004 it was $4.2 billion above his request, and in fiscal 2006 it was $7 billion above the President's request.     
   And he did that at times, he signed those bills, without a whimper, without any objection, when the deficits, the budget deficits, were much larger than they are today. This bill is a responsible piece of legislation, and I hope that it will be adopted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), who is the authorizing Chair for the housing portion of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 422 to call on the People's Republic of China to use its unique influence and economic leverage to halt the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan. 
   As hundreds of thousands have died at the hands of government-backed militias in Darfur, China, and Sudan have cultivated a mutually beneficial relationship that provides crucial energy resources to China in return for thwarting international efforts to sanction the Khartoum government and deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur. 
   China and Sudan have extensive economic, political, and military ties. China is Sudan's largest foreign investor and purchases two-thirds of Sudanese oil exports. China has sold arms to the Sudanese military and in February cancelled $80 million in Sudanese debt.  
   While it can do much more, China has taken some steps to alleviate the suffering in Darfur. Last November, China helped negotiate the agreement at Addis Abba which called for the deployment of a joint United Nations/African Union peacekeeping force. In May, China appointed a Special Envoy to Sudan and pledged $5.1 million in humanitarian aid to Darfur. Yet these positive steps are far outweighed by China's continuing support for the genocidal regime in Khartoum. 
   Unless China acts to pressure the Khartoum government into accepting a U.N. peacekeeping force, China risks having the 2008 Beijing Olympics forever known as the genocide Olympics. China must condemn the violence taking place in Darfur, halt all military arms sales to Sudan, and suspend economic ties to Sudan until the Government of Sudan stops attacking civilians, complies with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and enters into peace negotiations with rebel groups. 
   As China rises as a power in the 21st century, it must realize that with its increased power comes a greater responsibility to take action to stop genocide.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, the cornerstone of our Republican colleagues' energy mantra these days is ``Drill Now, Drill Anywhere'' to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil and to bring gasoline prices now. ``Drill now, drill anywhere'' works more like a concrete boot than a cornerstone. In the interest of America's national security, that is just about the worst policy we could adopt. 
   According to our Geological Survey and our Minerals Management Survey, our total oil reserves both on land and offshore would only last 15 to 20 years at the rate America consumes oil today, which is 8 billion barrels a year and still rising. What exactly would America do in 15 to 20 years when all of our oil is used up and the only remaining sources of oil are controlled by some of the most undemocratic oil dictatorships around the world? 
   Think about it, America, before it's too late.

   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Michigan has already said, the provisions that are in the legislation on the House side, section 416 and 417, are two provisions that relate to illegal immigration. The first of those provisions is one which states that no funds in this act can be used to provide homeownership assistance for illegal immigrants. The second, section 417, says that no funds may be used to employ workers who are illegal immigrants. 
   The first of these sections applies to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the second one applies to the Department of Transportation and relates to people who might otherwise be employed in construction under the Department of Transportation. 
   As the gentleman from Michigan has pointed out, those were adopted unanimously by voice vote here in the House during the passage of this legislation. So they are before the conference and, because they were adopted earlier, I am willing to adopt them now and adopt the motion as is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The gentleman from Ohio has offered an amendment which is a 4.3 percent across-the-board cut, across all of the agencies here in this bill. And that is about the final desperate or thoughtless way of balancing a budget or of approaching the process of budgeting. After all, the amendments that we have been debating for the last day have been defeated, to throw up your hands, but I suppose that is really progress. At least it is better than trying to reduce the budget down to the level of the President's request in the first place, which was hundreds of millions of dollars even below what the last year's budget was. 
   But I think you need to look at the core programs. The core programs here are the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service. Those are the major programs in this budget. The budget for 2007 was a very small increase but not as much as an increase up to the inflationary amount from the previous year's budget, the 2006 budget. So we would have had at least 3 years of budgeting below the inflationary level. 
   The gentleman's amendment would force all those agencies that cover Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service, which are the places where our Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service serve most of the public, the millions of people of this country who use those facilities, and it would force them to eat the inflation of that, as of now, over a 2-year period, 2006, 2007, and 2008. 
   What really is happening is that we are having to try to cover for the enormous reductions in the budget from fiscal 2004 to 2005 and from fiscal 2005 to 2006. That is where the major budget cuts have occurred over the last several years. And this budget only partially, partially, replaces for that enormous cut that occurred in those 2 years, way below inflation, serious, real cuts in dollars way below inflation. 
   Now, I just want to look at a couple of other things not just 3 or 4 years back but a little bit farther. When President Carter left office, the debt of this country was $1 trillion. Twelve years later, after the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the debt of the country was $4.3 trillion, $3.3 trillion more. When President Clinton left office 8 years later, it was $1.2 trillion above that. 
   Now, in only 6 years, with you folks on the other side having been in the majority throughout those 6 years, the debt is now up to $8.8 trillion, another $3.5 trillion. Think of it. Under 8 years of President Clinton, the total debt increase was $1.2 trillion, about one-third of the debt increase in just 6 years under the present President and all of that coming under your leadership. The debt increased to that time is all under your majority's leadership. 
   So I just want to say in the final analysis when you take into account inflation, with this bill, the Department of Interior would still be 11 percent below what the budget was in 2001, when President Bush took office. For the EPA, it would be 16 percent, still below the 2001 budget. And for the Forest Service, it would still be 19 percent below. Those key core programs would still be 19 percent below the budget in 2001. 
   I oppose this amendment and hope it will not be adopted.

   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman from the subcommittee for yielding me the time. 
   I'm interested by the amendment. Now, as the gentleman from Georgia has explained it, I, of course, had thought that without instruction the amendment would end up being an across-the-board amendment. But what in fact has happened here is that the gentleman's amendment, without instruction, allows the executive to decide exactly where those $276 million would be cut. 
   Now, I would consider that a total abrogation of our responsibility for budgeting in article I of the Constitution, where we have taken an oath of office to the Constitution, and where our responsibility is to define where the budgeting for the country will go. 
   So I think that's, in fact, a far worse thing than it would be if it were a strictly across-the-board kind of budget, senseless as though that would be. 
   I often find it necessary to be a little bit repetitious. I just want to go back to something that I had pointed out, and that is, that at the end of the Carter administration, when President Carter left office in January of 1981, the debt of this country was $1 trillion. Twelve years later, after 8 years of President Reagan and four of President Bush, father, the debt of the country was $4.3 trillion, more than four times as large in 12 years, but $3.3 trillion increase. In 8 years of President Clinton, the debt was increased by an additional $1.2 trillion to $5.5 trillion.     
   After now 6 years of Bush, the son, as President, the debt, at present, is at $8.8 trillion, an additional $3 1/2 trillion in just 6 years 
   Now, I don't know, the gentlemen and women on the other side of the aisle were in the majority through all of those 6 years in this House of Representatives which starts all the budgets. They can't claim that they were out to lunch at all because, in fact, they were here voting for those budgets that increased the debt by $3 1/2 trillion over the last 6 years. So if there is fiscal responsibility, it certainly cannot be claimed either then or now for what is now the minority in this House of Representatives.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to speak to the gentleman who has just spoken. I commend the gentleman who has just spoken. I think he has taken a very responsible, very serious approach to budgeting over the last several sessions, and I appreciate that sort of thing very much. 
   But I would say that here we are in this instance with an amendment that takes an approach not quite across-the-board, but gives the total responsibility off to the President of the United States to decide where to make any cuts he wishes to make, which, I repeat, is an abrogation of our responsibility under the Constitution that we take an oath to. 
   I would say that also this is a bad approach because after 40 amendments, each of which has been defeated, and 40 amendments which have had so little merit to them that they have been defeated, many of them by roll call votes, by roll call votes, and the sum total of all those amendments was considerably more than the $276 million, to now throw up your hands and try to do it in  a different way, in that kind of a meat-ax approach, to use those words, is not a good thing to do. It is not an appropriate budgeting thing to do. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT F. DRINAN, SJ -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for organizing this tribute, and I am grateful for the opportunity to add a few thoughts to the eloquent comments of my colleagues in celebration of the life of Father Robert Drinan. 
   Priest, lawyer, teacher, author, law school dean, Congressman and international statesman, Father Robert Frederick Drinan was an amazing individual who touched the lives of thousands. 
   More than 100,000 of my current constituents in the northern part of Worcester County, Massachusetts, were fortunate enough to have been represented by Father Drinan during his time in Congress, and they were served extremely well by his unique brand of politics and conscience. 
   Father Drinan was elected to this House by what was essentially an anti-Vietnam War platform. He was the first to call for the impeachment of President Nixon but not on Watergate grounds. Father Drinan's cause was the President's illegal bombing of Cambodia. 
   He was a passionate supporter of international human rights. Father Drinan spoke out against injustice wherever he saw it. He even privately funded several humanitarian missions to Chile, El Salvador, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other developing countries torn apart by violence and oppression. He repeatedly urged the President and Congress to do more to restore religious and social freedom to the people of Russia, Bolivia, and Iran. 
   While he served in the Congress, he uniquely balanced matters of faith with matters of state. Although he opposed abortion on moral grounds, he held that particular religious belief as separate from the issue of the legality of reproductive rights and thus was a fervent supporter of those constitutionally protected rights. 
   In his district, Father Drinan worked to increase affordable housing in older cities like Fitchburg and Gardner, both of which are in my current district. He was also instrumental in securing funding to begin the cleanup of the Nashua River in north Worcester County. Twenty-five years later, his efforts are the foundation on which we build today. 
   Later in his life, Father Drinan continued his crusade for international human rights by teaching that subject at Georgetown University and by lending his expertise to numerous international justice organizations here in Washington. For his distinguished career in public service, the American Bar Association and later this House of Representatives awarded him official honors. 
   Father Drinan's life's work is an enduring example of public and humanitarian service that few will ever equal, but we should all aspire to follow his example. He led with superior conviction, and he lived his life with universal compassion. He will be remembered for many, many years to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (BATTLING OIL AND GAS POWER PLAYS -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, we are witnessing the mother of all oil and gas power plays in this country. Big Oil and their allies are desperately trying to open every possible site for oil drilling before the Texas oil men, Bush and Cheney, leave the White House in January. 
   Under the Bush-Cheney-McCain plan, were it to become law, every acre of the Outer Continental Shelf, 50 to 200 miles offshore, and all of our coastline would be open to leasing and drilling. You can bet your home that the most promising areas for oil production would be fully leased at the foolish, long-term, low-price policy now in effect, but that's all. There's no certainty that the newly leased areas would be producing a drop of oil 10 years out. Big Oil could simply bank their cheap long-term leases until the price of oil reaches $200 or even $500 per barrel. And we, the Congress and country, would be over the barrel. That, after all, has been the history. 
   The claim has been made that opening the Outer Continental Shelf would unlock 86 billion barrels of known estimated reserves. Eighty-six billion barrels, by the way, would provide a dozen years of America's oil without using any foreign oil at all, but our Minerals Management Service estimates that 80 percent of those reserves lie in areas already open for leasing and for drilling. So the big oil companies have already leased large areas that have the greatest potential for high production, and yet they're producing on less than one quarter of the already leased acreage. Ironically, that may be the best policy for the U.S. because America's problem is huge. 
   Our less than 5 percent of the planet's population consumes almost 25 percent of the oil produced in the world. We are so dependent on oil that we have limited leverage to reduce demand, but we have only 3 percent of the known oil reserves on the planet, and therefore, have very little leverage to increase the supply. Because exploration has been more thorough and extensive on our land and in our sovereign waters, the oil yet to be discovered on this planet lies not just predominantly but overwhelmingly beyond U.S. sovereignty. 
   The Bush-McCain solution is doomed to failure because, first, opening more land and waters to leasing will not necessarily lead to production. Second, even if it did, the production under the best circumstances of shallow waters and of easy drilling and infrastructure in place would take 5 and, more typically, 10 years to produce. Third, if we were foolish enough to pursue that policy, we would use all of our oil, economically recoverable, in about 20 years and would be totally at the mercy of unfriendly oil producers. 
   For America, the only certain solution to the high price of gasoline is to reduce the consumption of gasoline. Many of the big ways to do that require time to achieve, things like developing and switching to renewable energy, the research and development of fuel cell vehicles, living closer to work, building more extensive public transportation systems, replacing the whole vehicle fleet--both cars and trucks--with high fuel efficiency vehicles. 
   There are immediate ways we can cut the speculation now. We can drive slower. We can drive less. We can carpool. We can use public transportation when it's possible. We can develop ``work from home'' wherever and whenever that's feasible as an option, and we need to start doing all of those immediate ways immediately.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (LEFT OVER THE BARREL -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, the cornerstone of the Bush-McCain plan to lower gas prices is to open every acre of the Outer Continental Shelf between 50 and 200 miles offshore to oil leasing, drilling and production. That plan is a surefire failure. 
   You can bet your house and your children's college education as well that the most promising areas would be leased for long terms at bargain prices, but there is no guarantee that those new leases would be producing a drop of oil even 10 years from now. That's been the history. 
   The Minerals Management Service estimates 66 billion barrels of oil are recoverable on already-leasable areas of the continental shelf. Sixty-six billion barrels equals 10 years of America's need without any foreign oil at all. Yet less than a quarter of the area actually leased is in production. The oil companies are simply banking their cheap, long-term leases for future higher prices and profits. And we, the Congress and the country, will really be left over the barrel.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I want to congratulate first Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairwoman Waters, both from the Financial Services Committee, for their great work in bringing forward to the floor this reauthorization bill for the important HOPE VI program. 
   I am a supporter of the manager's amendment, and I want to say a few words from an appropriator's perspective here as the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that deals with HUD. 
   In America, we have at least 10 million American families who live below or near the poverty line who are struggling to make ends meet and working largely in minimum wage or near minimum wage jobs and part-time jobs. We appropriate voucher rental assistance for roughly 2 1/2 million of those families through the tenant and project basis, and they're costly. We also appropriate monies to provide operations for the roughly 600,000 units which are under our public housing authorities all over the country. 
   The HOPE VI program is our only program that allows for total renovation of replacement of family housing units in that group that are under the public housing authorities in cities and towns all over the country. All 10 million of those families dream about better jobs and owning a home, but with incomes so limited, the family budget gets destabilized if there is a job loss or an unanticipated health problem in the family, and they end up being the most vulnerable people for predatory lending practices that have become so obvious in the mortgage disclosure crisis if they are trying to make ends meet and trying to have homeownership. Those are exactly the families that would benefit the most from reduced monthly energy bills, and they are the most in need of that help. 
   Under the bill before us, HOPE VI projects must meet energy saving requirements embodied in the green community criteria established by Enterprise Partners, the American Planning Association, the American Institute of Architects, and the Natural Resource Defense Council, among others, who have put forth a comprehensive set of criteria which include siting of buildings to maximize passive solar heating and cooling, siting near public transportation, using Energy Star highly efficient appliances, using water fixtures that save water and energy. 
   A study of 20 already completed projects using these standards showed an average of 2.4 percent only in construction cost increase, but that cost is recovered within 5 to 7 years by lower monthly energy bills.     
   For the rest of the 50- to 100-year lifetime of the public housing, the moneys, those savings go back to the individual families, and it requires us to appropriate less money to the public housing authority. So it's a very important program.

   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I have high respect for the gentlewoman from West Virginia, the ranking member of the subcommittee. In fact, I occupy now the apartment that she used before upgrading. 
   But arguments in the builders' letter to Members promoting the amendment are specious and deliberately misleading. First of all, all references to LEED have been removed. Secondly, the letter greatly exaggerates the cost of green community criteria which are so strongly supported by the U.S. Council of Mayors and 40 other major organizations. 
   A well-documented study of some 20 completed projects using these criteria, completed projects using these criteria, showed an average of only 2.4 percent increase in cost. We all need to remember that we build housing for 50 to 100 years. The small increased construction costs produce huge savings in lower monthly bills for energy for tenants. The low-income tenants have all of the remaining 50 years to accrue those savings after the payback comes within the first 5 to 7 years of the program. 
   I urge defeat of the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (RECOGNIZING PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, AS BEING HOME TO THE EARLIEST KNOWN REFERENCE TO THE WORD ``BASEBALL'' -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased today that the House of Representatives is considering House Resolution 1050, which honors the city of Pittsfield for its rich baseball history. As a sponsor of this legislation, I would like to thank the Committee on Education and Labor, especially the gentleman from California Chairman George Miller for his assistance in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Pittsfield, Massachusetts, can trace its baseball roots all the way back to 1791.     
   The city, which was only the town of Pittsfield then, was in the middle of constructing a new meeting house. Trying to protect the windows of this new building, the town enacted a bylaw that banned the playing of ``baseball'' within 80 yards of it. You see, even back in 1791, youths were already breaking windows playing America's favorite national pastime. With that, the first mention of baseball was penned into history. 
   Madam Speaker, besides being home to the earliest known reference to baseball, this resolution also honors the city for being designated the Birthplace of College Baseball by the College Baseball Hall of Fame. 
   On July 1, 1859, the city hosted one of the Nation's oldest collegiate rivalries, Williams College versus Amherst College, in the first collegiate baseball game to be played in the Nation. Now this game was played under the old ``Massachusetts'' rules. No gloves were used, the ball was pitched under hand, only one out was necessary, and a foul ball, if uncaught, was considered a hit.  The record shows that Amherst College won this first contest by a score of 73-32. 
   Pittsfield is also the site of many other historical baseball moments. Among others, this resolution honors the city for being the birthplace of Ulysses F. Grant, born in 1865, who's generally considered to be the best African American player of the 19th century, as well as Mark Belanger, born in 1944, who spent most of his career playing for the Baltimore Orioles. 
   In 1924, Lou Gehrig made his professional debut at Wahconah Park, the venerable ballbark in Pittsfield that is listed on the National Historic Register, and in that debut he appropriately hit a home run into the Housatonic River. Jim Thorpe, considered one of the most versatile athletes in modern sports, also played there. 
   In recognition of its baseball past, the city of Pittsfield plans to erect three permanent monuments, Bat, Ball, and Glove, representing the virtues of the game. 
   Overall, Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize the city of Pittsfield for its rich baseball history and I am honored to stand on the floor today to honor its significance to our national pastime. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, Madam Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (LIHEAP -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Mr. Speaker, to significantly lower gas prices at the pump, Congress must end rampant speculation in crude oil futures, yet our Republican colleagues in both branches have consistently opposed such legislation. Meanwhile, a whole new crisis looms as families face a price approaching $5 per gallon for heating oil for their homes. That's twice last winter's price. 
   Last winter in Massachusetts and New England alone, 350,000 low-income families used the LIHEAP program to get by, yet only one in four of the families eligible by income use the program. Many of those already eligible families will be in desperate need of help this winter, and many more middle-income families' budgets will be severely stressed by the doubled price of home heating oil. 
   Heat for a home or an apartment is not optional for any family, and Congress must act on an historic investment in LIHEAP before we finish our session.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, I support the resolution before us today. In clear and succinct language it says what I believe must be said regarding the war in Iraq that America is engaged in by the choice of President Bush. 
   I support our men and women on the front line with all the training, the body and vehicle armor and the equipment they need to be successful at the task that they have been given, and I support them as they return, whether safe and sound or scarred by grievous wounds. Almost 24,000 have been wounded, and many returned broken in body or spirit. Many have suffered permanently disabling wounds. Thousands of others, not physically wounded, suffer severe traumatic stress disorders. And all will need and must be given the care and rehabilitation they have been promised. 
   America mourns the loss of more than 3,000 of our soldiers since that fateful first day of May in 2003 when President George W. Bush triumphantly proclaimed ``Mission Accomplished.'' At no time in the 220 years since the founding of our Nation has America suffered such casualties during an occupation following war. This occupation has been spectacularly mismanaged, yet Americans are asked to suspend doubt and support an already used tactic, placing almost 20,000 additional troops on the ground around the clock, with our young men and women caught between the combatants in the civil war raging in Baghdad's urban streets and neighborhoods. 
   I oppose this escalation. It is 4 years too late and more than 100,000 troops too few. The tactic itself has been used repeatedly over the last 4 years, with dangerously counterproductive results. Each time this tactic has been used, it has left behind greater hatred for the occupation and the occupiers, as well as thousands of new recruits for the insurgency or al Qaeda. I believe that this escalation will be remembered for the deaths of many more American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. 
   President George W. Bush has repeatedly cited the 300,000 strong Iraqi army and police force which we have spent billions of dollars to train and equip. They should be pacifying their capital city. As dysfunctional as it is, the Iraqi government which we created must decide whether they want all-out civil war or a stable, unified Iraq, with oil revenues fairly distributed and with changes to their Constitution to assure the rights of 40 percent of the population who are not Shia Muslims. We cannot decide that for them. 
   The civil war will continue and our casualties will continue to mount until we disengage our forces from a direct military role, except to deny haven to al Qaeda. We must place responsibility directly on the Iraqi government. 
   At this very late date, virtually everyone agrees that peace and stability for Iraq cannot be secured militarily, but only politically. Our best chance for a positive outcome to this tragic and unnecessary war is outlined and unanimously recommended by the Iraq Study Group, led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. 
   We should substitute a robust, multifaceted diplomatic campaign to discourage all of Iraq's neighbors from engagement in the growing civil war and to gain support and assistance for a stable, unified Iraq. That diplomatic campaign must involve major powers and regional groups like the European Union and the Arab league, along with all of Iraq's neighbors, without exception or precondition. The U.S. should always be willing to talk. In every way, talk is far less costly than war. 
   In a month, the war in Iraq will have gone on 4 years, well beyond our participation in World War II. It is time to begin bringing our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. OLVER. (ANOTHER QUARTER OF RECORD-BREAKING PROFITS FOR BIG OIL -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, while Americans pump billions of dollars into their gas tanks every week, Big Oil has just completed another quarter of record-breaking profits. 
   The companies claim they are looking for new oil to bring down the price at the pump, but what they spend on exploration is small compared with their stock buybacks and shareholder dividends. That's great for their investors, but no help for millions of Americans who drive to work every day. 
   Come to think of it, why would they bring to market the 4 million already  leased and easily developable acres of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, only to have their profits plunge while trying to reduce gas prices? 
   Last week, Democrats in Congress supported legislation to increase domestic oil production by requiring oil companies to drill on leases they control or lose those leases to companies that would drill. 
   The Republicans once again voted no. Republicans won't require oil companies to drill, but they have no problem handing them more leases to hoard while gas pump prices and oil company profits soar.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation to reauthorize Amtrak and rail safety programs. I want to commend and congratulate the gentleman from Minnesota, the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Mica, for their tremendous efforts and fine work on this important piece of legislation. I also congratulate Subcommittee Chairwoman Brown and her ranking member, Mr. Shuster, for their tireless efforts on the bill. 
   At a time of record fuel prices, Americans are finding travel by air more expensive and increasingly difficult. It is no secret that those record fuel prices, along with congestion on our Nation's highways, make travel by car less attractive and less affordable. 
   Investments in intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail must become more integrated into our Nation's transportation policy, and this legislation will help accomplish that goal. Intercity passenger rail is already experiencing its own renaissance. Amtrak has enjoyed 5 straight years of record level ridership, reaching almost 26 million passengers in 2007, and 2008 will be another record year. 
   This bill will help Amtrak reduce its capital backlog, increase safety and improve service. This bill opens the door to true high-speed rail service in the Northeast corridor and will help many more Americans enjoy the benefits of intercity passenger rail.     
   Again, I would like to commend the authors of this bill, and I urge Members to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. OLVER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank first of all Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf for their good work in bringing this good bill to the floor. But I rise today particularly to commend Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Wolf, and the subcommittee for their efforts to relieve the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. By providing over $200 million for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid to Darfur, this bill will provide desperately needed support for the 2.5 million people driven from Darfur or displaced within Darfur by the Sudanese's deliberate actions. 
   Yet even as I acknowledge the significant resources that have been included in this bill, I cannot contain my outrage and frustration that the genocide in Darfur continues. Hundreds of villages and small towns have been razed, burned to the ground, and obliterated, the men killed, the women systematically raped, children slaughtered as if they were vermin, survivors fleeing for their lives into the squalor of refugee camps. 
   A common tactic of this horror has been to stuff the villages' water wells with the bodies of the dead so there will be no water for people who try to return to their ancestral homes. 
   Just last week, Sudanese President Omar Bashir agreed, yet again, to the deployment of a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur. This proposal calls for 20,000 African Union peacekeepers to be led and paid for by the United Nations. President Bashir has apparently offered his unconditional acceptance to the plan. 
   But do we have any reason to believe that this latest agreement is anything but one more delaying tactic? After all, President Bashir already agreed to a joint U.N.-A.U. peacekeeping force in November only to renege a couple of months later. Each time the international community moves even timidly towards imposing punitive measures against Sudan, President Bashir briefly acquiesces and then prom ptly resumes his unconscionable obstruction of peacekeeping efforts. How are  we to know if this latest concession is any different? 
   Just last week, activists representing 36 organizations addressed a letter to the U.N. Security General, Ban Ki-moon, decrying the escalating attacks in Darfur and documenting the flight of aid organizations from the region. The conference on Darfur to occur next week in Paris will provide one more opportunity for the United States, France and other nations to join t ogether in outlining tough consequences for Sudanese failure to accept prompt deployment of the twice-agreed-upon U.N.-A.U. peacekeeping force. 
   We know that the Sudanese Government responds to international pressure, but it must be fierce and sustained if it is to finally end the vicious and senseless slaughter of the people of Darfur. 
   I would like to ask simply five questions, Mr. Chairman. How many times in this Congress have we and will we congratulate ourselves for passing virtually unanimously powerless resolutions condemning the Bashir regime's actions in Darfur? 
   Second, Will President Bush build on the study provision in the House-passed Armed Services authorization for fiscal year 2008 to develop a robust base in Chad for the deployment of peacekeeping forces and for the delivery of food and services to the millions of refugees? 
   Or three, Is this administration so committed to other dealings with Sudan that all of President Bush's statements about the genocide in Darfur are just words? 
   Four, Why should America participate in the 2008 Olympic Games in China when China repeatedly obstructs U.N. action on Darfur? 
   Finally, When will America's 4-year demonstrated impotence be perceived as complicity in the horror of Darfur? 
   It is time to stop the shilly-shallying, stop the attacks on civilians, and bring peace to Darfur. Today as we again provide funding for humanitarian assistance, let us remember that our lack of more effective action will be judged harshly by future generations who will wonder why we didn't act decisively to stop the genocide in Darfur.
