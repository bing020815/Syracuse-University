<DOCNO>Mr. MOLLOHAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3093, COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for consideration of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Science and related agencies. 
   I would first like to thank distinguished Chairwoman Slaughter, Ranking Member Dreier and the entire Rules Committee for this open rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, we bring before you today a balanced appropriation bill that's responsive to Member input on both sides of the aisle and reflects the legislative priorities of this Congress. This bill is creative in addressing problems that face our Nation, such as the  rising crime rates that can only be addressed through additional law enforcement resources, the need for scientific research and discovery to inspire our youth and maintain our competitive edge in an increasingly competitive world economy, and the need for our country to understand and address the documented phenomena of global climate change. 
   In this diverse bill we have gone to great lengths to address these and many other issues, and, Mr. Speaker, I think the House will be pleased with the result. And again, I urge support for this rule.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and at the same time, let me compliment her for her leadership in this area and her concern for this huge problem and these extremely important programs that are focused in these organizations. 
   We have funded this account handsomely. The bill provides $61.4 million for missing children programs. As we move to conference, I know the gentlelady is interested in funding for particular organizations to focus on the problem. We are as well. At the same time, we want the universe to be able to access these programs, and that's the way we have structured our bill. 
   As we move toward conference, we look forward to working with the gentlelady with regard to her particular concerns in this area.

   I can't commit to a specific result here, but I can assure the gentlelady that we will work for funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, as we move through conference. All this time working with her is all that I can commit to specifically.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Etheridge's amendment. I can tell you that the beneficiaries of the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program and the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Program are extremely lucky to have advocates like Mr. Etheridge in the United States House of Representatives. I mention him first and most often because he has been all over this issue for the last 6 months, since I have been chairman of this subcommittee. 
   I am extremely pleased to see Mr. Reichert on this, a person who comes from law enforcement, who understands the issues of law enforcement, and is probably personally acquainted with cases of disappointment of beneficiaries under this program. It is tremendous that this program is bipartisan. 
   You can tell by Mr. Kennedy's remarks and the sincerity behind them that this is an issue of vital concern to the subcommittee as well. Mr. Kennedy has been championing Mr. Etheridge's cause and Mr. Reichert's cause through the process of this bill. 
   I give credit to these people because they have been especially attentive to this concern. It is, indeed, something that we should be concerned about. 
   As we talk about homeland security, as we talk about State and local law enforcement, and as we recommend a bill with this kind of funding to the House of Representatives, we have to be mindful of those people who have made sacrifices and who have suffered greatly. That's what these programs are about. That's why the Congress authorized them, and that's why we have provided appropriations for them. 
   It is not acceptable that the Department of Justice has not moved these beneficiary cases, with far greater expediency than they have. It is actually a denial of the benefit that some of these cases have been processed so slowly. So that's the initiative, that's the purpose of Mr. Etheridge's amendment. 
   I am pleased to accept the amendment because of its merit. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to my ranking member, who has likewise been passionate about ensuring that the Department of Justice moves these beneficiary programs in the Office of Justice programs.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I admit to being a bit confused by the gentleman's logic here, who I have great respect and great regard for. He comes out of an exemplary academic background, and I can't imagine how we could be thinking differently on this amendment. Nevertheless, we do, and I rise in strong opposition to the amendment as I understand it. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bill provides $80 million for State and local grants to address violent crime and gun crime across the Nation, the two issues that the gentleman expresses concern about. I hope he agreed with the committee when we increased funding for this purpose by $35 million over 2007. I have to oppose his amendment because of the offset of $15 million for law enforcement costs of offender reentry programs. 
   These are the programs that go hand in glove with our other law enforcement activities. Recidivism is a terrible problem. These programs establish partnerships with correctional institutions, with community corrections, with social services, with faith-based institutions and with community policing groups. They want to help make our communities safer. 
   Our Nation's prisons are bursting at the seams. In the Federal prisons alone we have an inmate population that has risen six-fold since 1980; we have 195,000 inmates in Federal prison. The recidivism rate is 40 percent, and in the States it is 67 percent. If we reduce those numbers, we are dramatically not only reducing crime in the country and reducing the recidivism rate in the process, we are doing both at one time. So these statistics being deplorable, we need more resources applied to addressing recidivism. For those reasons, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment. 
   In light of the fact that we have increased funding significantly for the violent gang and the gun crimes across the country by $35 million and by providing $80 million in this bill, that seems to be a healthy increase for that purpose that the gentleman expressed his concern about.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, this provision is simply a provision of fairness. It provides that contracting out of Federal employees in the U.S. Bureau of Prisons cannot be done under these A-76 guidelines and puts a prohibition on that. 
   Now, we have accommodated in our language in our manager's amendments all of the concerns that we received from private industry. We have accommodated that. And the bill and report language were modified in the full committee's manager's amendment to clarify that the general provision does not impact the Bureau of Prisons' practice of contracting with State, local and private entities to meet needs for existing and new prison capacity. 
   This language is compromise language. It protects Federal employees, professionals working in the Bureau of Prisons, who obviously have a very sensitive job and position, at the same time it accommodates the concerns of private industry with regard to appropriate contracting out by State and local and private entities. 
   I urge opposition to the amendment on that basis. The bill is a good, balanced approach and accommodates the Federal employees who risk their lives every day working in correctional situations, but at the same time it accommodates the legitimate concerns of the private sector. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and first of all, I want to acknowledge the compelling story of the gentleman from Indiana. That's truly moving. There's no two ways about it, and that's why we have this program, and that's why the subcommittee and the full committee strongly supported funding for VAWA and all of these grant programs, acknowledging at the same time that there are additional grant programs authorized under VAWA that have not received funding. We look forward to working on those, and this one in particular, as we move forward through conference. 
   But let me suggest to the body that we would love to increase funding for programs like this, the Violence Against Women Act Programs. There's more compelling argument for it, particularly as described. 
   Let me note, however, for the record that we have increased VAWA funding to $430 million. We rejected the President's proposal to shrink the grant program, actually to eliminate these individual grant programs, and to have a bloc grant program. We have continued to fund the various categories, and we certainly look forward to considering other authorized grant programs that are not currently funded. 
   We funded, at $430 million, VAWA programs, a $60 million increase over the President's request, and $47 million over the 2007 funding level. That is a sizeable increase to this very worthy program, not that there couldn't be more. So I can't argue for one second to either of my colleagues against adding funding to VAWA. 
   The real point is that we have significantly increased that funding because we share the concerns of the gentlemen who have spoken here, and I hope that we can all understand and agree with that. 
   We are again targeting offsets in a general administration account. A $14 million cut to the Department of Justice general administration account will require layoffs. And let me just put this in perspective. We've already had a $30 million cut to this account. We're down from $104 million in Department of Justice general administration to $74 million, and we're looking at another $14 million cut. 
   At some point, everybody has to appreciate that there has to be some money in these administrative accounts to administer these programs that we all care about, and we have to get real about this process. This is obviously a very strong and passioned expression of support for the programs we've authorized to prevent violence against women, and we're all working in that venue. The committee did it by increasing the funding by $60 million over the President's request, almost $50 million over last year. You're doing it here today by adding another $14 million. And we can't argue with the merit of that sentiment, but we can express concern and try to bring some reality to the offset suggested here. 
   We are cutting Department of Justice general administration accounts below the level in which they can effectively operate and administer the very programs which we are increasing. 
   So, reluctantly, I oppose the amendment. At the same time, I do look forward to working with the gentlemen, no matter what the outcome of the amendment, as the process moves forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, let me commend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) for bringing this matter before the body again this year. 
   The point is being made that this particular act is not being funded and it should be. It's extremely meritorious. The sacrifice, and the dedication, the commitment of our law enforcement people throughout the country need to be recognized, and this is the reason we passed the legislation. 
   As we move this bill forward to conference, I hope that we can work with the gentleman and assure that there is funding on this provision, and we will commit to the gentleman to work with him in that regard.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his tireless efforts on behalf of NASA. He has been working, I know, diligently in that vineyard all year long. I know, personally, because he has been contacting me and the committee in order to advance the best interests of NASA, to personally facilitate important meetings between the NASA Administrator, and I know the chairman of our full committee Mr. Obey, and several of our colleagues throughout the year. 
   These meetings and my talks with the gentleman from Texas have made it clear how important NASA funding is to the gentleman, significantly contributing to NASA's ability to meet all of its mission commitments. 
   The gentleman is to be commended for his commitment and his hard work on behalf of NASA and on behalf of NASA's employees. I will continue to work on the House floor and in conference to maintain funding levels as reported out of the subcommittee. 
   I sincerely appreciate the gentleman's interest and hard work.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I thank the gentlelady. I think this amendment is one more expression of a number one concern about the attention that education is getting in our various science accounts. We have attempted very diligently, pointedly, to address that by increasing funding in education accounts across the bill. This account, the NASA account, first of all, we broke it out as a separate account and then increased it by $66.6 million for a total of $220 million. 
   The fact that the gentlelady is reaching out to NASA, NASA should be listening. Universities, education, K-12, they want NASA. They realize how important, and the gentlelady realizes how important, NASA is to inspiring youth and also getting resources on programs and funding them. That's the gentlelady's purpose behind this. 
   I hope that the gentlelady will allow us to work with her to achieve her purposes as this bill moves forward within the funding allocations that we have received. I want her to know that I have heard her interest, and we intend to be responsive to her as we move forward. I commend her for her leadership in this area. 
   We will be as responsive as possible, and I appreciate the opportunity to do so.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the gentlelady for bringing this issue to our attention. I want her to know that the House knows she knows something about basic industry in America. She knows something about the challenges of transitioning economies, and she knows something about the importance of USTR trying to protect the very best interests of American citizens and American workers working in all sectors of the economy. From my perspective, I am particularly concerned about those workers in basic industry, in extraction-related industries in America. 
   A lot of us have concerns about the USTR and the Trade Representative's actual commitment to representing the very best interests of those sectors of our economy. As we transition into an increasingly international economic community, we have to be cognizant of the impacts of a trade policy that is precipitous to the point of creating real chaos and tremendous hardship, particularly in those sectors of the economy that I represent and that I know the gentlelady is particularly sensitive to. 
   So we need to provide oversight of the USTR as we encourage them to enforce our trade laws and to be aggressive advocates, advocates for our best interests as they approach our trading partners and trade negotiations. They should be looking at issues to balance and level the playing field, such as insisting that trade agreements include environmental laws that we have correctly imposed upon our industry and our manufacturing processes. 
   Incorporating those regulations into the manufacturing process is expensive. Our competitors around the world, many of them, particularly in the developing countries, don't have those costs. Where we have incorporated health and safety regulations in the workplace, statutorily imposed, that has cost money. 
   The USTR needs to be sensitive to that. The administration needs to be sensitive to that. It needs to incorporate those kinds of public interest concerns as they negotiate trade agreements. 
   Why? Why? Because we have done it, and we are their competitors. We are a country with a higher standard of living, and if we can't level the playing field with regard to regulatory activity, then we will never be able to begin to be competitive with our competitors from developing nations. 
   Let me again compliment the gentlelady for being focused on this very early in her career, being a champion for the working people, and for the best interests of our trade policy generally in all sectors of the economy, and for bringing this to our attention in this bill.  
   I can assure her that we will be sensitive in large part because of the concerns that she expresses here today. Thank you very much, Ms. Sutton, for bringing that to our attention. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I appreciate the gentlelady yielding. 
   The gentlelady is really at the forefront of this issue. She is co-chair of the 131 Member strong Congressional Missing and Exploited Children Caucus. She is to be commended for that. She has worked with me, she has worked with Mr. Frelinghuysen, she has worked with the committee. To some extent she can declare success because she is tenacious in getting additional funding for Missing Children's programs. She has been successful in increasing funding 100 percent, you could argue, since the President asked for no funding here. 
   But we would like to point out that in response to her and the caucus's expressions of concern to the committee, we have funded the Missing Children's program account to the tune of $61.4 million, which is $14 million above the 2007 enacted funding level. That is in large part because of her efforts, and we do appreciate it. She should declare success, and she should be proud of that. She is, as I say, tenacious. And speaking for myself, and Mr. Frelinghuysen who I know shares this interest, we look forward to working with her as we move forward. She is representing this caucus here today, and we look forward to trying to even increase this amount of money as we go to conference. 
   I want to thank her for her efforts and for helping the committee as we have marked up our bill and funded this account.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, again, not because of the intended purpose of the gentleman trying to do good here and getting additional resources into the crime victims fund. That's worthy. 
   It's being authorized at $625 million, this amendment would raise it to $635 million. And you might ask, if there are additional resources, why don't we disperse all of them? 
   Well, that's because that fund has to be managed to ensure that there's a source of funds that will remain available for the program despite the inconsistent levels of the criminal fees that are deposited there annually. So part of that is trying to manage the account to assure stability year in and year out so that funds will be available for victims to be paid out according to the authority. 
   I would like to point out that the gentleman's offset draws from an account that has been drawn from in the past, and it is the offset is in Commerce. We started out at $58.6 million at the beginning of the day. We've had a $25 million cut, a $10 million cut. This cut would take us down to $23 million, if my math is right. But if my math is not precisely right, my point should be taken that we've gone from $58.6 million down to approximately $23 million in this S&E account. That's a 60 percent reduction. There is going to be nobody left to administer these programs. And that's why we have to think very carefully. 
   And actually, folks coming here and offering amendments go through the same difficult exercise that the subcommittee and the full committee have gone through. How do you apportion funds when I would argue, the allocation is not adequate to fund all the worthy projects and to fund all of the people who need to administer the worthy projects in this bill? 
   A 60 percent cut the gentleman's amendment would effect in this S&E account, it simply cannot stand. So for that reason, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   If I might, for the Department of Commerce here, the S&E account is now down to $18 million if the last two amendments are adopted and you add it to the offsets that were affected by the amendments that have already passed. The Department of Commerce S&E account, they are just going to have to shut down their office again. I would just encourage Members, when they offer these amendments, to get serious about the offsets. And, my goodness, I don't know what would have happened to President Bush's budget if we had not increased it, because his S&E account would have been really decimated in increasing the Violence Against Women account. We increased VAWA by $60 million over the President's request, $47 million over 2007. 
   I understand that our colleagues who are offering these amendments are absolutely in the forefront of protecting women. As we oppose these amendments, at the same time we embrace your cause and that that is why we have worked so hard in effecting these funding increases above the President's request. If we had a larger allocation, we would put more money on these accounts. 
   Having said all that, and because the offset is so draconian to the Department of Commerce, I will continue to oppose amendments with these negative offsets. If we aren't able to restore  the salaries and administrative accounts to the extent these amendments are successful, the Department of Commerce would have to shut down. That is how, as I have used the word before, cavalier we are being about these offsets. 
   Mr. Chairman, while I certainly support the cause and the purposes of the programs these amendments are increasing funding for, I have to oppose them because of the offsets and because we don't have enough resources to go around, a point which is demonstrated by the offsets that these amendments are having to resort to. 
   I oppose the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. The committee has heard the gentleman. In years past the gentleman has been very concerned. He has asked for increases to the Criminal Records Upgrade Program grants, and the committee has been very receptive to that. Indeed, the committee this year has increased funding for this program by $2.1 million over 2007, which in part was an effort to be responsive to the gentleman's consistently expressed concerns about this, and genuine concerns, about this account. 
   If the gentleman has looked at this carefully, we respect his expertise in this area, and we would be interested in visiting with him as we move this to conference and understanding more clearly the justification for an additional increase. 
   And because of who the gentleman is, I have no doubt that his reasons are valid. And so we look forward to working with him to find a better offset and to be responsive to his needs, if at all possible, as we move to and through conference.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Well, with Mr. Culberson speaking on this issue with such knowledge, he's a member of our subcommittee and I respect his knowledge of border issues so much that I approach this debate with fear and trembling. I know that he is passionate about this issue as he has talked with me about it before, in addition with the other border issues that I'm totally serious he is nigh an expert on. 
   Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman, I have to rise in opposition to this amendment for a number of reasons, but principally, let's get our jobs straight here. We're article I. We're the legislature. We pass the laws. We appropriate the dollars, and then the executive branch, of course they administer, and it goes on and on. 
   But the executive branch is article III, and the executive branch takes  these criminal cases and they process them. I heard some really excellent defense summary arguments here before juries in support of this amendment. I cannot imagine a body less capable, less appropriate to adjudicate the issues surrounding the incarceration, conviction, prosecuting of the cases against these two gentlemen than the United States House of Representatives. 
   First of all, it is a very serious issue, and if we were to act as a jury, we ought to be sitting here. And look around and we're not, not very many of us. 
   But secondly, it's not at all the appropriate forum. So we really shouldn't even be taking this up. This is a limitation amendment on an expenditure of funds to incarcerate two individuals who have been processed, due process arguably, and have had a very unfavorable result so far as they are concerned. This issue ought to be resolved in the courts surely, or if the President of the United States wanted to take it up, he has the power that we don't have, to my knowledge. He has a pardoning power. We don't have that here, but in effect, we are attempting to act as if we did here with these two amendments. 
   So I don't even begin to speak to the merits of the cases, and some folks have spoken to the merits of the cases here. I don't have the facts to argue the case, but I do know this is a particularly inappropriate forum and a particularly inappropriate and imperfect process by which to address these gentlemen's grievances. 
   So I rise in opposition to the amendment. I trust the body will recognize the merit of the arguments that I'm making, because I think they're sound, and will likewise oppose these amendments. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

As the gentleman describes the merits in the favor of these gentlemen, they're powerful. I mean, it sounds like the equities are running all in their favor. I make no comment on that at all because I don't know the facts. And I have read about it, and it does make one sympathetic based upon the facts as you cited. 
   But I don't make any judgments about that. I just oppose it because I don't think this is the right forum. The President, of course, would be an appropriate forum, but that's the only basis of my concern about the amendment. So I commend the gentleman for bringing the issue to the House.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. 
   The motion was agreed to. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Altmire) having assumed the chair, Mr. Snyder, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3093) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, today we're considering the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies. 
   Before I get into the substance of the bill, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my ranking member, Rodney Frelinghuysen, for his important contributions to this bill. He's done an outstanding job. He's been a terrific partner, and I respect and appreciate the expertise that he brings to our subcommittee. He has a strong commitment to our law enforcement agencies and grant programs for at-risk individuals. Mr. Chairman, he's demonstrated a real desire to make sure that the U.S. has adequate resources to negotiate fair trade agreements and the means to obtain an accurate census. I thank him for his assistance. I sincerely also want to thank his personal staff, Katie Hazlett and Nancy Fox, and minority staff, Frank Cushing and Mike Ringler, for their help during this whole process. 
   Mr. Chairman, I also want to express my thanks to Chairman David Obey who has done an excellent job leading the Appropriations Committee through a hectic year that began with a continuing resolution. 
   I also want to express my sincere gratitude to a tremendous subcommittee staff. This bill would not have been possible without the extreme hard work of Michelle Burkett, Meg  Thompson, Marjorie Duske, Tracey LaTurner, Dennis Dauphin and Jennifer Eskra, who sacrificed long hours many days to complete this bill. 
   I also appreciate the strong efforts and expertise of the full committee, including majority staff director Rob Nabors, John Daniel, David Reich, and Leslie Turner. 
   Lastly, I want to recognize my personal staff for their hard work, Sally Moorhead and Julie Aaronson, who have done a tremendous job working on the bill as well. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, turning to the substance of the bill. Mr. Chairman, this bill totals $53.6 billion in spending and was formulated with input gathered from 24 hearings, including agencies that had not had a hearing since fiscal year 2005. We also heard expert testimony from outside witnesses regarding law enforcement needs, the importance of scientific research for our Nation's competitiveness, and the need for Federal investment in local and regional economic development. 
   Through these hearings, we developed a fair and bipartisan appropriations bill that responds to legislative priorities supported on both sides of the aisle. Those priorities include both programmatic funding and congressionally directed spending for projects in individual districts. Pursuant to the strong rules put in place by the House and the full Appropriations Committee this year, designated funding has been cut in half from the fiscal year 2006 enacted level, and oversight has been increased by examining closely and carefully each earmark request and the accompanying certification letters. 
   In several areas in the bill, Mr. Chairman, this subcommittee has eliminated earmarks and instead has created competitive accounts in which eligible entities may compete by submitting proposals to the agency for Federal funding. This process will increase transparency, spur innovative solutions, and allow programs nationwide to compete in the marketplace of ideas. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm particularly pleased that this subcommittee, which funds the major science agencies for the Federal Government, has taken on the issue of climate change. This bill funds $1.9 billion worth of climate change initiatives, an increase of $164 million above the President's request. Now that the scientific community has determined that global warming and the resulting climate changes are real phenomena, we must identify steps to be taken and strategies to be adopted in response to global climate change, and this bill does so by funding new programs in the Department of Commerce, in NASA, and in the National Science Foundation. Some of the climate change initiatives in this bill include: 
   Funds to improve data collection associated with understanding global climate change, including restoring critically important sensors on the National Polar-orbiting Operating Environmental Satellite System, NPOESS; 
   Second, funding increases for competitive climate research grants in NOAA's operating, research and facilities account; 
   Third, two new education programs directed at climate change as recommended by the National Academies; 
   Fourth, additional funds to the Marine Mammal Commission for monitoring mammal adaptation to climate change; 
   And, finally, Mr. Chairman, $6 million in NOAA for an investigation and study by the National Academy of Sciences on climate change. 
   This climate change study by the National Academy of Sciences will be a science-driven report examining the climate change data that has been collected in the last decade to provide the Federal Government, the business sector and other interested parties with an understanding of what we know and what we don't know about climate change and the options for how to proceed in the future. This landmark study process will begin with a 3-day climate change summit, at which top experts in the field will gather to determine the study's scope and topics. This subcommittee will take great efforts in this process to assure that agency agendas and politics do not get in the way of good science guidance to this country which it needs to move forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, perhaps the most vital theme in this bill is law enforcement and protection for our communities. The job of funding the Department of Justice was made more challenging by funding holes in the President's inadequate budget request. In this bill, we increased funding for the Department of Justice above the President's request by $1.68 billion for a total funding for the Department of Justice of $23.9 billion. 
   The President requested $1.475 billion for State and local law enforcement. Well, this was $1.4 billion below the fiscal year 2007 enacted level, thus creating a huge hole in the bill.     
   The bill provides $3.195 billion for State and local law enforcement, and that is a 53 percent increase above the President's request and a 10 percent increase above fiscal year 2007 levels. 
   The President's request would eliminate the existing Office of Justice Program's formula program and discretionary grants, and create three vaguely defined initiatives to be administered under the sole discretion of the Attorney General. This bill rejects the administration's proposal and provides funds directly to State and local law enforcement. 
   Other key funding increases in the Department of Justice include two new competitive grant programs. The first is the Youth Mentoring Grants, funded at $100 million. The second, a $10 million program, will provide competitive grants to programs of national significance to prevent crime and improve the administration of justice or assist victims of crime. This bill provides $725 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services programs, which played a vital major role in reducing crime in the 1990s. 
   Within this total, $100 million is for restarting the COPS hiring program, which has not been funded since 2005. Many Members contacted the subcommittee and myself and the ranking member with regard to the COPS program. I am very pleased that we were able to restart this COPS hiring program, which was extremely effective in reducing that crime rate in the 1990s. 
   This bill also offers comprehensive funding to help State and local law enforcement address the methamphetamine epidemic, including $600 million in Justice Assistance Grants, $85 million for meth-specific COPS grants, $40 million for Drug Court programs, $10 million for State Prison Treatment Drug Programs, and $20.6 million for DEA Mobile Enforcement teams, which Mr. Frelinghuysen was so instrumental in advocating. The President proposed to terminate all of these programs. 
   The bill also provides funding for Southwest Border Methamphetamine Enforcement. The bill increases funding for Violence Against Women Act, the VAWA programs, by $60 million for a total funding of $430 million, and rejects the President's proposal for VAWA's 14 grant programs. Tremendous interest among both the parties, Democrats, Republicans, for VAWA, and we are very pleased to bring a bill to the floor that can increase the violence against women programs by $60 million, I repeat, for a total of $430 million. 
   Lastly, within the Department of Justice, the bill provides $25.4 million and increases for several Federal law enforcement agencies to implement the Adam Walsh Act of 2006. Increased funding is provided in several accounts within the Department of Justice for the apprehension and prosecution of sex offenders. An increase of $14 million, for a total of $61.4 million, is also provided for the Missing Children programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Department of Commerce recommendation is $7 billion, a little over $7 billion, an increase of $497 million above the President's request. 
   In the bill the committee restores funding for a number of programs that the President cut or eliminated, including the Advanced Technology Program, the Manufacturing Extension Program, and the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program. 
   In the Census Bureau, funds were restored for the Survey of Income and Program Participation, an extremely important program with great interest among the body, and community partnership program has been restored as well. For the Economic Development  Administration, an increase of $100 million was provided to reverse a recent downward trend in funding. The bill also rejects the President's proposal to consolidate the economic development programs into a single regional development account. 
   Mr. Chairman, for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the bill provides robust funding of almost $4 billion. The bill establishes competitive funding in the Coastal Estuarine and the Land Conservation Program and the Integrated Ocean Observing System, and also competitive funding in the education account. 
   In support of the Innovation Agenda, the committee funds the National Institute of Standards and Technology at $831 million, an increase of $190 million above the President's request, and provides $6.5 billion to the National Science Foundation to continue the goal of doubling the National Science Foundation funding in 10 years. 
   The bill also provides an increase of $72 million in National Science Foundation over the President's request for education programs. 
   In NASA, the bill provides $17.6 billion, an increase of $313 million above the President's request. This funding restores the cuts made by the administration in science and aeronautics and the education portfolios, and provides the funding in a new account structure to improve transparency and understandability of NASA's submissions. 
   We have tried in a small way to give NASA the increases that it needs where the President has been negligent. The President's budget request made an ambitious proposal in the Vision for Space Exploration for the United States to return to the moon and to eventually go to Mars; however, by all accounts, he did not fund his vision adequately. The most recent telling evidence of this shortfall is the fact that the President's proposal assumes the inability of the United States to access space for a gap of 4 years between when the space station retires and when the CEV launches on its first official flight, the crew exploration vehicle. This leaves the United States with no guaranteed source of transportation during that gap to the space station. 
   I want to make clear to Members that the gap has nothing to do with the continuing resolution of last year. Full ownership of this gap resides with the President. His unfunded mandate of the vision, as well as the fact that NASA had to pay for return to flight after the Columbia accident out of its own hide, has resulted in NASA being forced to rob Peter, science and aeronautics, to pay for Paul, shuttle, space station and exploration. In the end there is not enough for either Peter or Paul. 
   The President has to acknowledge his inadequate budget request in this area. We invite him to reinvigorate and legitimize the Vision for Space Exploration by asking for necessary funds for returning to the moon and for going to Mars eventually and for other key NASA missions through a budget amendment or through an adequate fiscal year 2009 request. Otherwise, limited U.S. access to space and stagnation of key NASA programs will be, in this area, the President's legacy, the President's legacy in space. 
   This bill makes positive changes in some of the smaller agencies. We have added $66 million above the President's request to the Legal Services Corporation for a total of $337 million. We have added $5 million to the EEOC to reduce the backlog of pending cases, and included a provision to eliminate the outsourcing of the EEOC call center. We have restored funding for the National Veterans Business Development Corporation, which was zeroed out in the President's request, and we have provided additional funds to the Marine Mammal Commission for monitoring mammal adaptation to climate change. 
   There are many worthwhile programs in this bill. This reviews the highlights of them, and this bill represents a responsible bipartisan approach to funding these priorities, and we are pleased to bring it to the body today.     Insert offset folio 163/1 here EH25JY07.001     Insert offset folio 163/2 here EH25JY07.002     Insert offset folio 163/3 here EH25JY07.003     Insert offset folio 163/4 here EH25JY07.004     Insert offset folio 163/5 here EH25JY07.005 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman for raising this issue. I assure him that I share his concern. I think most members of our subcommittee share his concern with any unwise cuts to Census. That happened in full committee. There was an amendment which used Census as an offset; $25 million came from the periodic census, $5 million came from salaries and expenses. Both of them were very regrettable offsets. We are going to work to restore those offsets as we move forward into conference, and I have a considerable amount of confidence that we will be able to achieve that. 
   Again, I commend the gentleman for bringing this up and giving us an opportunity to express and share our concerns with him and also to make that commitment that we are going to work as hard as we can as we move forward to restore this funding to Census. It is usually important to the Nation that the decennial census move according to a regular process which requires a lot of preparation in the early years. And the gentleman's foresight in seeing that and his insistence on our proceeding accordingly is really appreciated because we want that pressure from the body to make sure that we adequately fund Census.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment and, at the same time, I share concern with the gentleman for our ability to monitor, carefully and comprehensively, compliance regarding our trade with China. 
   We have an Office of China Compliance, which the gentleman wants to increase by $6 million, which about doubles the funding. There is a group in the Congress, and I am certainly one of them, who are extremely concerned about foreign competition. I am very concerned about how, as this world increasingly is becoming a smaller economic community, how we compete successfully, particularly as competition relates to the impact on traditional industries in this country and making sure that a fair and level playing field exists. That is why we have the Office of China Compliance. That is why we have funded it in this bill. 
   The gentleman suggests that the funding level is inadequate, and we have very consciously funded it at the President's request. A $6 million increase doubles the Office of China Compliance, and given the balances that are necessary in this bill and the funding demands that exist, we feel that the level that we funded it at is adequate. 
   Let me also comment about the gentleman's offset. He offsets the Census Bureau, the salaries and expenses account, I believe. That is unacceptable. 
   Does the gentleman offset the salaries and expenses or the decennial census account? The decennial census account. That is a terrible offset, respectfully, because we have to prepare for the decennial census, and we have to prepare for it carefully and adequately. 
   First of all, I think the account is funded adequately at the President's request in last year's funding. Secondly, the offset is just terrible. 
   I would invite the gentleman to work with us as we move forward to conference and look carefully at the account and make more careful judgments about the adequacy of the funding, if he would like to do that.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I just will stipulate to our concerns about trade with China and the necessity to review it. That is why we have this office. You are suggesting that we need additional funding. You are suggesting doubling the funding, which impacts Census in its ability to collect economic statistics, which is also extremely important to the economic viability of the country.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment which, again, shows there is a run on the Census Bureau; it's as though the Census Bureau wasn't important, and it's crucially important. 
   We have funded the southwest border prosecutors program at $30 million in this bill, and the President requested zero for it in this bill. So I think we're keeping faith with the southwest border prosecutors. And we have kept faith and funded in this bill tremendous amounts of money for State and local law enforcement above the President's request, $1.7 billion above the President's request. So we really are addressing these concerns. 
   We can go anywhere in the bill for any worthy cause, especially all of the law enforcement accounts, they're all worthy causes, and say, oh, let's increase the funding for that. It makes it sound like we are newly addressing an issue where it has been substantively addressed previously in this bill. 
   Now, let's look at the offset. And again, we're looking at Census like it's not important, and it's crucially important. Specifically these cuts that were represented by the offsets to this increase would eliminate the current Industrial Reports Program used by the Federal Reserve Board for the index of industrial production and also used in trade negotiations by our U.S. Trade Representative, the International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce's Office of Textiles and Apparel. This amendment will also make it impossible to assess the impact of increased imports on domestic industries. 
   Secondly, this offset would eliminate the quarterly financial reports which are the government's most current and comprehensive reports on corporate financial activity. This break in this valuable time series program, which goes back 60 years, there is a continuity to this program, would erode the quality of our statistical measurements, hinder public and private decisionmakers and eliminate a critical source of information on corporate profits. 
   Next, Mr. Chairman, it would eliminate the Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons, which is the only comprehensive source of information on selected economic and demographic characteristics for businesses and business owners. The survey data is absolutely critical to the missions of the Minority Business Development Agency, the Small Business Administration, and other Federal, State and local agencies to assess changes in women and minority-owned business, and to analyze the effectiveness of these programs. And the amendment it would eliminate funding to the Foreign Research and Analysis Program, which generates economic, social and demographic information.  
   Do we see the harm that this amendment and this offset would do to the Census Bureau, to the statistics we gather that are absolutely crucial to business, in addition to the overall attitude about an almost frivolousness as we deal with the important business that the Census Bureau does? 
   Let's respect the Census Bureau. Let's respect the surveys and the reports and economic statistics which it generates, which we rely on in our daily lives for social programs, but also for the important purpose of assessing where we are and where we stand in business in an increasingly competitive world. 
   I oppose the gentlelady's amendment on all of those grounds, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is currently balanced among the many competing priorities between the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science. The amendment significantly upsets that balance. 
   This Congress has already provided the proper funding mechanism for enhanced 9/11 grants, which is through proceeds realized through the sale of the spectrum space. I have grave concerns about a $5 million reduction to the general administration account of the Department of Justice. 
   The Department may have to lay off its current personnel, reduce key projects that might have to be terminated, and substantially scale back others in order to absorb a reduction in this office. 
   We have to be respectful in the requests and the necessity of having adequate funding and adequate personnel to run these programs, to run the Department of Justice. Let's not be cavalier in these offsets. Just because the account is called ``general'' doesn't mean that it doesn't need funding. It also doesn't mean that we haven't been careful and deliberate as we have looked at the needs and funded these accounts. These are real people we are talking about laying off. They have real jobs, and they administer real programs. 
   So when we offer an amendment and suggest a $5 million offset, we have to be mindful of the consequences of that. DOJ is currently challenged to fill authorized positions at all of its components. We are increasing funding at the DOJ. Partly these funding requirements are the result of chronic gaps between the funding requested and appropriated for the S&E accounts and the true cost of pay raises. Let's be respectful of other people in their jobs as we consider these offsets. 
   I yield to the distinguished ranking member.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the distinguished ranking member for those  thoughts. If I have any time left, Mr. Chairman, I would just point out that about 90 percent of the account where the gentleman is seeking an offset, the general administrative account, goes towards operational support for the Department of Justice agencies and their missions, by maintaining and overseeing facilities, for procurement of law enforcement tools for agents and employees, and for management of financial systems. 
   Cutting this account could prevent implementation of a unified financial management system that would limit the fraud, waste, and abuse that everyone in this body talks about. These are not the areas in which we want to make cuts.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, first of all, I want to commend the gentleman for raising this issue. Six of the seven sea turtle species are endangered. It is a real concern. It is a real plight. We can be particularly proactive trying to address the endangered status of these turtles in our borders. It becomes far more difficult as we go out around the world.     
   It is important that we address it and we pay increasing attention to it. The gentleman requests an additional $1 million. There is a $9 million program looking at this. We intend to work with the gentleman, if he so desires, to ensure that NOAA is increasingly focusing on the problem, and we will be bringing the gentleman's concern to their attention, and letting them understand that. We will be working with the professionals at NOAA, and we want to give them all of the support that we can and let them know that this is a priority for us. 
   So I commend the gentleman for bringing the issue to our attention, and assure him that we look forward to working with him not only as we process this bill through to completion, but subsequent to that and throughout the year to ensure that NOAA gives it the adequate attention that this issue deserves.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I point out that when the gentleman brought his interest in CASA to the attention of the committee, I pointed out to him that CASA is funded in our bill at the authorized limit of $12 million. We don't suggest that it does not merit and that the need isn't there for considerably additional funding. That is something that we can look at in the future, and I thank the gentleman from California for bringing this matter to the attention of the committee and to the attention of the full body. 
   CASA is a vital program that is important in the lives of countless children in foster care, and we will continue to work with the gentleman on his concern of ensuring that soon every child has a CASA representative. 
   As the gentleman represents, only 50 percent, if it is 50 percent, of those in need are served by this vital program. As my colleagues may know, 7 years ago, and as the gentleman pointed out, and we are very impressed by that fact and taken by it, adopted two foster children. There is no greater love than adopting children. We look forward to working with the gentleman as we move forward.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The gentleman attempts to move $2 million out of NOAA, out of the very important programs that fund the National Weather Service--fisheries, oceans, climate--money that is used to do a lot of the research that is extremely important to all of these areas, including climate change. 
   We have tried to fund NOAA in a way that respects its mission this year in the House of Representatives. Typically we don't do that, and the Senate earmarks it. We have tried to go through account by account and look at the National Weather Service, look at the fisheries, look at oceans and look at climate change, and fund these programs accordingly. This money will take away from that effort. 
   Now, where is the money going? It is going to the ITC. During a hearing we specifically asked Chairman Pearson if he got his request, and he got the funding he requested as he requested it, if he would be happy and if he would be made whole. And his testimony specifically to us: ``If you do that, Mr. Chairman, then we are very happy.'' And that's what we did in this bill, so I really don't see the need under any circumstances for increasing the ITC at this time. 
   The gentleman mentioned all of the important missions of the ITC and all of the work it does. And you know what? We respect that, and we have funded it completely in this bill and been responsive to the Chairman Pearson's request. He represented to us at the hearing that if we were to do that, which we did, that he would be totally happy with this funding. 
   I have to say that the gentleman is laboring on behalf of an agency that is fully funded and above that has received all of the funding requested in this bill. So I oppose this amendment to take money from science programs and to take it for no compelling reason from NOAA.

   The level of funding for this program needs to be increased to help foster and promote traditional indigenous fishing practices. The gentlelady has been a tireless supporter of assisting the indigenous people of Guam, Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific. 
   And this funding provides funds for a competitive grant within NOAA to allow indigenous peoples of the western Pacific to explore new fishing means both which are safe and economically sustainable.

   This issue was brought before the committee rather late, after we had marked up. The point was made on a bipartisan basis that the authorization for this program was not adequate. We accepted the authorization change on our bill and supported an increase in the authorization, I believe to $30 million. 
   The bill is already marked up, and we have funded this program at $8.9 million, recognizing that, like a lot of accounts in this bill, additional resources are needed. We would be pleased to work with the gentleman as the bill moves forward to see how we can augment this funding. 
   That's a difficult proposition, but we do commit ourselves to looking to see how and where we might be able to find some additional resources to fund these accounts, and we look forward to working with the gentleman in that regard.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. And I want to begin by saying I am very impressed by the bipartisan presentation by the representatives from California, all of whom I respect very highly and many of whom I work very closely with. 
   Let me start off by saying their support for increasing SCAAP is not misplaced on its merits. Indeed, I am struck by the fact that their efforts on a bipartisan basis are evidence, pretty strong evidence, of inadequate funding, certainly in the request of the President. We have increased SCAAP by multi-billions of dollars, as we have already said, above the President's request. But the one argument against the bill that comes from the minority side is that we have too much money in this bill to fund the priorities in this bill. 
   I think this amendment is evidence in an argument against that position. There is not too much money in this bill to fund the priorities in this bill, and SCAAP is certainly a priority. 
   Let me help those who are moving this amendment with their argument. Certified requests for reimbursement to this SCAAP account from the jails, the sheriffs, and the State prison systems would demonstrate or would evidence the fact that there is twice the certified merit for reimbursement of this program than this program has funded. 
   In other words, we are only having 50 percent of the money that is in the bill. And even if we raise it, it is virtually not increased much more. We are only funding 50 percent of the certified demand for this program in this bill. Well, that is not unusual. There are a number of programs in this bill that certifiably we are only meeting 50 percent of the need. 
   When I was before the Rules Committee, the distinguished gentleman, Mr. Dreier from California, talked about our increase in funding for Legal Services. Well, we have increased Legal Services by $28 million in this bill to $377 million. And there is a study that was recently completed, a credible study that we are only serving 50 percent, just coincidentally, of the demand of people across the country who need legal services, but because of their financial condition cannot access the courts of this land. Now, that is meritorious. 
   It is meritorious, I believe, that we have a program, Legal Services Corporation, that meets that need and allows people to access the legal system. If equal protection under the law means anything, it means equal access to the law. So we have a legal services program to do that, but it is only 50 percent adequate in its funding. Well, SCAAP is only 50 percent. So we all have to sacrifice here, and this is a reimbursement program to States and local governments that are incarcerating illegal aliens. It is meritorious. So is Legal Services. I am just saying that the funding is inadequate, Mr. Chairman, and that we need additional resources in this bill. 
   So now we are down to prioritizing, and we think that we have done a good job in crafting the priorities of this bill. We are funding Legal Services at 50 percent. Legal Services' high watermark in 1995 was $400 million. We are not there, but SCAAP is there. We are not there. We are not back there. We are at $377 million in this bill. 
   SCAAP is not disadvantaged in this bill. Relatively speaking, look back over the years. In 2005, SCAAP was funded at $305 million. From 2005 to 2006, it jumped to $405 million. Why? Because of the good efforts of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee at the time, Chairman Lewis, and the chairman of the  Rules Committee at the time, Mr. Dreier, to effect an increase of $100 million. 
   So if you go off the base of 2005 of $305 million, Legal Services was increased to $405 million; we funded it at $375 million. At full committee, it was increased back up to $405 million. It is where it was. It is where it was last year. Relatively speaking, off of that 2005 base, SCAAP is enjoying a privileged position in this bill of strongly competing programs which rate merit. 
   So now where is the offset? So I am just saying, admitting, acknowledging, stipulating to SCAAP being underfunded, along with a lot of programs, State and local programs, as well as agency programs in this bill.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I thank my distinguished ranking member, Mr. Frelinghuysen. 
   Since we are talking about increasing inadequate funding in the bill, Mr. Chairman, let me explain that in our law enforcement agencies, we had a gap in the funding of the bill versus the need. The Department of Justice faced the challenge to fill authorized positions in all of its components, and partly as a result of chronic gaps between the funding requested by the President and the appropriation for these administration accounts and the true cost of paying for raises. We had going into this bill, underfunding in the Department of Justice, which we have tried very hard to address. 
   The offsets for funding SCAAP in this amendment impact those administration accounts in Justice and in Commerce. These are real people doing real jobs, and we have very carefully funded them. These accounts are underfunded by the President, just like SCAAP and just like Legal Services are underfunded. We have tried to balance priorities as we move forward, and there are lots of people concerned about these offsets. 
   This amendment proposes to offset $25 million in the S&E accounts for the Department of Commerce. Commerce runs good programs. The amendment proposes to offset $25 million in the Department of Justice for general administration. The Department of Justice has a lot of programs to administer, and many are State and local programs which distribute those funds to our local law enforcement. We can't cut either program by $25 million. This would hurt real people with real jobs. We are not funding overemployment in these agencies and we are not funding salary increases at adequate levels, either. 
   A lot of folks are concerned about this, and that is why we tried to balance the bill fairly. The folks that are going to be RIFed and laid off are government employees and are concerned about it. Their union representatives, the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, are concerned about amendments such as this one and they have written us a letter: 
   ``Dear Chairman Mollohan, On behalf of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, I strongly urge you to oppose any amendments that would substantially reduce fiscal year 2008 funding for the salaries and expenses account in the Department of Justice agencies.'' And they are concerned about the others besides Commerce and Justice as well. These offsets have cavalierly, I would say, respectfully, targeted these administrative accounts. 
   I thank my ranking member for yielding me time. I respectfully engage this debate with my colleagues who I respect, and it brings me to respectfully opposing this SCAAP amendment. If our bill were to receive any more money, and I note that the Senate has $800 million more, maybe we can address these concerns in conference.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I find myself agreeing with everything the gentleman has argued, and at the same time being, unfortunately, opposed to his amendment. 
   It's hard for any of us to argue or to have a desire in our hearts to do anything but increase the National Science Foundation. We all understand what good work it does. 
   NSF provides competitive, peer-reviewed granting that translates into cutting-edge research that is the foundation for the future economic viability of the Nation. Our economy is increasingly becoming an international one, and we have to be on the cutting edge. 
   That's why we have funded NSF at a rate that guarantees its doubling in a 10-year time span. We embrace and salute the doubling and have been responsive to that need that is expressed by members and the community. 
   Nothing is more important than funding education, and increasing NSF and its ability to develop and implement programs to facilitate education and to incentivize our best and brightest young people to go into math and science, and to choose those careers. That's what NSF does very well. The gentleman wants to facilitate that by augmenting our funding in the education accounts for math and science partnerships. I commend him for the initiative. 
   I oppose the amendment because we have funded the Math and Science Partnership Program. We increase it significantly in our bill, and I'm sure the gentleman knows that. We increased it $20 million over the President's request of $46 million for a total of $66 million. That's a 43 percent increase. And I will say that not only is it a generous increase, but perhaps it's an increase they need time to absorb. 
   The fact is that we have significantly increased Math and Science Partnerships $20 million over the President's request, funding it at $66 million. 
   Where does the offset money come from? It comes from Commerce. For every one million dollars that you offset in these administration accounts, at least seven people would be laid off. We're not funding these administrative and S&E accounts with the idea that we can use this funding for amendments on the floor. We're funding these accounts at the requested level or at the levels that we've discerned are adequate pursuant to information that we've received in our hearings. We're on the level with funding in these administration accounts. Again, I think  these offsets are cavalier. No matter how meritorious the object of the funding increase, it's cavalier to cut S&E accounts. 
   The employees are saying, help. Time out. Stop. Their organizations, like the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, are writing to us. They're saying, please stop invading these administrative accounts. 
   With that comment, Mr. Chairman, I yield to my distinguished ranking member.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Our bill demonstrates an upward trend in juvenile justice programs, indeed, Mr. Chairman. That has been a real focus and priority of this subcommittee as we have marked up the bill. 
   We have increased funding in juvenile justice programs $120 million over the President's request, and that is $62 million over 2007 funding. Why? Because of efforts from Members like Mr. Murphy, who has been all over this issue, and I value very much his expertise as he has communicated with the subcommittee. He has expressed his concerns about juvenile justice, about the problems that these programs address; and he is really to be commended. He has also made it clear that Mr. Platts has been very active in this effort as his colleague, and I commend Mr. Platts as well. 
   We look forward to working with them as we move this bill forward, but also in future years to ensure that the juvenile justice programs not only are funded appropriately but also that they are focused as they should be so that we make sure this funding is spent to maximize not only its efficiency but its effectiveness. 
   So, Mr. Platts, Mr. Murphy, we thank you for your assistance with regard to this issue, and we look forward to working with you.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I appreciate the gentleman from New York's interest in this. As a matter of fact, he was the mover and shaker in the Congress in pointing out that we had 2 years of successive increases in violent crime in the country. He was the first one to point out that in the 1990s, the COPS, the Community Policing Cops on the Beat Program, was extremely effective in reducing that; and in large part, along with other Members, advocated and encouraged the committee to reactivate the COPS hiring program, and we've done that. We've done that with $100 million, which we think will fund approximately 2,700 policemen. 
   This is a down payment. This is an initiative, and the gentleman is to be commended for providing the impetus for that initiative. So I thank him. We look forward to working with him in future years. I know this is a program that, because of its proven effectiveness in the past, is going to get increasing attention in the future.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, in this body, anyone has a right and an  opportunity, as the gentleman has taken advantage of, to raise whatever issue one wants. The gentleman raises an issue in the context of virtuousness and virtuosity. He raises a virtue issue here; he argues it from a premise of virtuosity. 
   I have no doubt that the gentleman is a good person and that the gentleman is a virtuous person. But I would suggest that the gentleman, number one, has expressed a greater knowledge about any investigation than I have. Perhaps he has inside knowledge about it. But I could not tell you actually if it exists, because I have never been approached with regard to it. 
   Number two, I would suggest that as the gentleman raises his point in the context of virtue, that he might want to be very cautious, because, as he says, he reluctantly does it, and he might want to be concerned about those who have raised this issue initially perhaps failing his test of virtue. I simply suggest that as a caution to him when he raises this kind of an issue in this context. 
   I could suggest that it is unworthy to raise it in this context because it is obviously ad hominem. But I am not going to go there. I would just suggest that the gentleman, as he contemplates this issue and as he raises a virtue question, that he satisfy himself in his own mind that those who have initiated and perpetrated this effort, that he contemplate the possibility that their motives are not pure and that they, in this instance, are not virtuous. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, the gentlelady offers an amendment to one of the grant programs in the Violence Against Women Office of the U.S. Department of Justice. To give a little bit of context to the amendment, the Office of Violence Against Women was funded in fiscal year 2007 at $382.571 million. The President requested $370 million, about $12.5 million less than was funded in 2007. So the President's request for the office was decreased. He requested less money than was appropriated last year. 
   In addition to that, the President wanted to eliminate all of the grant programs, including the one that the gentlelady seeks today to increase funding for specifically. The subcommittee increased funding over the President's request by $60 million. So the subcommittee looked at the Violence Against Women Office and looked at the scourge that office addresses and fights every day and the programs that the office administers, and we said not only do we need to increase the President's request from last year's level, we need to increase this program above the President's request, and we did by $60 million. We also rejected the President's request to eliminate all of the grant programs under Violence Against Women. We retained those grant programs and those categories, and then we funded each and every one of them handsomely. 
   So the request before us today, or the recommendation of the committee before the body today, increases over Fiscal Year 2007 funding by $47 million, over the President's request by $60 million. As for the grant program that the gentlelady offers an amendment to, we fund it at $40 million, which is 100 percent over the President's request, because he wanted to eliminate that program, and 3 percent over the 2007 funding. 
   Now, there is no question that the Office of Violence Against Women deserves adequate funding. That is why we funded it at $60 million over the President's request. It enjoys a privileged position on our committee. Chairwoman DeLauro is aggressive in her leadership on this issue as is every member of our subcommittee. The Rural Domestic Violence Assistance Grants have been funded at $40 million and are extremely proud of that funding level. 
   The gentlelady looks for her offset in the National Science Foundation, the premier research and development agency in the United States Government. It offers peer-reviewed granting; it looks at education programs; it looks at research programs, cutting-edge, transformational research, the research that we rely upon in order to ensure our competitiveness in the arena and also lay a foundation for our competitiveness in the global economic marketplace. 
   Don't make any mistake about it, everyone who has testified before our committee agrees the National Science Foundation is not only an economic security issue, it is a national security issue, and it is not the place where we ought to be taking funding. There is a recognition that we need to double the funding for the National Science Foundation, and that is the track we are on with the level of funding in this bill. We should not, and hopefully we won't, reduce funding to the National Science Foundation by $10 million. That would knock us off of the track. 
   To summarize, Mr. Chairman, funding in the Violence Against Women programs is robust: $60 million above the President's request. The particular grant programs, one of which the gentlelady addresses, each have been retained, and each of those grant programs has been funded robustly. 
   So, like every other account in this bill, we could use additional money, and if the budget resolutions that the minority would vote for would allow us additional money, we would be pleased to look at increasing funding for violence against women programs. 
   But given our allocation, and given the priorities and the conflicting demands in the bill, and given the importance of the National Science Foundation and the robust nature of our funding for violence against women, I must oppose the gentlelady's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity the gentleman offering the amendment gives me to speak in favor of the funding for the Wetzel County Courthouse. 
   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, would strike funding needed to repair the Wetzel County Courthouse, a very valuable historic structure in that community. It was built, Mr. Chairman, in the first decade of the 20th century. This courthouse is listed on the National Historic Register, and this courthouse serves as the centerpiece for New Martinsville's efforts to preserve its legacy and expand new tourism opportunities. 
   Wetzel County, Mr. Chairman, is one of the smallest counties in my district, and the county has very limited funds available for capital improvements and repairs to its structures. They need this grant to help protect this important historic property. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, it's important to note that the Wetzel County Courthouse is not just a historic building, however historic and what a grand legacy it has in the county; it still  functions as a courthouse and a county office complex. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, in a way, I hardly know where to start here, but I might start with the gentleman's question that he poses time and time again, not only today but in previous days: Is it the Federal Government's role to fund these projects? 
   He has several different arguments against projects. When projects of a very significant nature are pointed out that are going on in his district, he says, oh, well, in the past they were authorized, appropriated, and he says they have oversight. To what extent, we don't know. 
   But the point is, they went through a process here in Congress. Article I, section 7 doesn't say what process it should go through. It says that it's the Congress' job to do that. Every Member of this body is looking at their congressional district and thinking about economic developments and what are the needs. 
   If you are in a transition economy, transitioning from a basic industry, manufacturing economy to a new economy, tourism is a very important part of that new economy, of that vision into the future. 
   We have seen a lot of projects from industrial areas that fall into that category, whether they are museums, whether they are trails, whether they are any of those kinds of appurtenances, if you will, that contribute to the economic development in the tourism realm. 
   Well, if the gentleman's question is, is it the government's role, the Federal Government's role, to fund these projects, which he asks over and over again, as the alternative argument against these projects, then it has been answered over and over and over again. It is the Federal Government's role to do it through this body. Constitutionally, it is our responsibility. Article I makes that very clear. 
   So I just want to point that out and then speak and thank the gentleman for the opportunity to stand up to speak for Friends of Cheat, because they are doing just that. They are laying the kind of infrastructure that is necessary and crucial to that new economy, and that aspect of our economy in the future of West Virginia is going to be tourism. He has allowed me to speak to that. 
   Before I speak to it, I would like to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his leadership and review of this project. I know his staff has spent hours on it, because my staff has spent hours on the projects that we have approved. But this funding will be used, as the gentleman said, to acquire land and develop a trail in order to create those kinds of infrastructure that are attractive and make usable the bounty that is West Virginia. 
   I thank the gentleman for allowing me the opportunity to speak in favor of this project. I want to compliment him for the tremendous assets that are going into Arizona. I am extremely impressed; it's an affluent area. His predecessors have worked very hard, as has been pointed out here today. 
   There is nothing the matter with that, and there is nothing the matter with the process that those projects went through. Nor is there anything the matter with the projects that we are talking about here today have gone through. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I want to thank both my colleagues for their very kind, gracious remarks about West Virginia University and the game that we speak of today, particularly the Fiesta Bowl game. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 938, congratulating the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team for its recent outstanding Fiesta Bowl victory. 
   The Mountaineers' regular season closed with an unexpected and a bit demoralizing loss that ended the team's bid for a national championship. As a further complication, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, the team began preparation for the Fiesta Bowl without its head coach, who left suddenly for another opportunity. WVU consequently was branded the underdog for the Fiesta Bowl appearance. 
   But these young men and the able interim head coach, who is now the permanent head coach, who stepped into the void were steady, they were confident, and they were prepared to pursue a game plan unaffected by the swirling controversies and the many media pundits who predicted defeat.     
   Mr. Speaker, seeing that team demonstrate grit, skill, and determination,  as described by my colleagues, to silence its critics, while overcoming challenges, reminds us of the potential for accomplishment that resides in us all. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting H. Res. 938, as it offers a ``well done'' to a team that set a high bar for accomplishment, focus, and determination.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to highlight a unique economic development opportunity in my district. 
   This funding would be used to renovate, as he suggested, a historic glass factory in Star City, West Virginia, just outside Morgantown. This location will serve as a business incubator for start-up artist businesses and will house the West Virginia University ceramics program and the West Virginia University Creative Arts Community Center. 
   To understand the importance of the project, you have to understand West Virginia. For decades, our economy has been focused on coal, timber and basic manufacturing, and those industries have suffered under unreasonable regulation, free trade agreements and unfair foreign competition. 
   I've worked hard and will continue to do so to keep those industries strong. But along the way, West Virginians have realized that we also need to diversify our economy to ensure a viable economic future. 
   Mr. Chairman, that diversification can occur in part by focusing on another sector of our rich history, our cultural history. This earmark provides that opportunity by nurturing new artists and businesses in cooperation with distinguished university programs and will develop Star City and the greater Morgantown area into a destination. 
   Star City has identified the arts project as an economic development model for the community. And this request responds to the importance the community has placed on redevelopment. I should also note that this Federal investment will be used to leverage funds from the State's Commission on the Arts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased the committee selected this project. I appreciate their consideration, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the floor about it.

<DOCNO>Mr. MOLLOHAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MOLLOHAN. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution opposing the President's decision to escalate this war. My position on the Iraq war is uncomplicated. I voted against the initial war resolution back in 2002, mostly because I never believed the President made a compelling argument that Iraq posed the sort of substantive threat to the United States that would justify war, and the considerable human, political, and financial costs that it would bring.     
   I thought it was a bad decision at the time, and I think it is a bad decision today. 
   In my limited time this afternoon, I would like to comment on a couple of refrains that we keep hearing. The first is the President's repeated criticism that those who support this resolution are prejudging a plan that hasn't even been ``given a chance to work.'' He makes that charge with a tone of wonderment, as though somehow it weren't our duty to anticipate the consequences of different courses of action and to avoid the bad ones before embracing them. If more of us had prejudged his 2002 decision, taking us to war before it was ``given a chance to work,'' we wouldn't be having this debate today. 
   The difference between today and 2002 is that a majority of this House and this Congress are no longer willing to give the President the benefit of the doubt he enjoyed 5 years ago. We are no longer willing to suspend judgment and trust the decider. That should surprise precisely no one. 
   For 4 years we have been asked to trust this administration, to trust, as the Vice President emphatically declared, that they knew where the weapons of mass destruction are; to trust that the Iraqis would welcome us as liberators; to trust that we had a large enough invasion force to stabilize the country; to trust that the Shi'a would find common cause with the Sunni and the Kurd in a united Iraq; to trust that Iraq's oil reserves would pay for its reconstruction; to trust that Iraq would serve as a beacon of democratic ideals throughout the Middle East; to trust that those early signs of a growing insurgency were nothing more than the ``last throes of a few dead-enders.'' 
   And now the President asks us not to prejudge his plan to put another 21,000 Americans in harm's way. He asks us to trust him yet again. With respect and humility, Madam Speaker, I ask him, how can we? And how can he even ask it of us? Paraphrasing the President, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me five times, shame on me. 
   And another criticism of this measure that we have heard repeated over and over this week is that, as a nonbinding resolution, its passage and this debate is meaningless. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution is far from meaningless. If need be, Congress will end this war with binding legislation. As even the President acknowledged, we retain the power of the purse, and we have ample opportunity to exercise that power. 
   But just as wars should be started with a united government, so, too, should wars be ended with a united government. And that is the meaningfulness of this resolution. It is the last chance to draw this government back together on Iraq. It is the last call for us to work together, Democratic and Republican, legislative and executive, on ending this war. It is the last call for the President to come back to the people. 
   He may ignore that call. He may dismiss this resolution and this debate as meaningless. He may dismiss the voice of the people expressed through 439 newly elected Representatives as meaningless. But if he does, Madam Speaker, he forces us to move forward without him. I hope that doesn't happen. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution, and I urge the President to listen to this debate and to join with us.

   The United States Congress has, in previous years, passed legislation specifically granting to the EEOC authorization and responsibility to work on behalf of employees where they face discrimination in the workplace. That legislation anticipated an opening of a remedy for employees. This amendment would close a remedy for employees. 
   These cases should be decided on their facts. If we were to adopt this motion and the conference were to include the amendment in its agreement, then the EEOC would not have an opportunity to look at the facts and represent employees pursuant thereto. Therefore, we do oppose the amendment. 
   I want to point out that the court in this case upheld the decision and upheld the position of the employer in this case. That's well and good. 
   What's important in that is that the court, through due process, decided the matter. That's the way the EEOC ought to operate, not through Congress in a motion to instruct conferees and in an appropriation conference, taking away what the Congress has already given jurisdiction in these cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, the policy that this amendment addresses is obviously authorizing the policy that the EEOC has followed in this area through Democratic and Republican administrations. They have had a consistent position on the employer English-only policies throughout both Democratic and Republican administrations. This amendment would undermine that long standing policy. If the gentlelady and the gentleman want to change that, they ought to take it to the authorizing committee where they can have hearings and have a full-blown discussion, rather than trying to change this policy that has been in place for a long period of time, through both Democratic and Republican administrations. The amendment should be opposed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to support the gentleman from Maine's program. This funding supports scientific staff who monitor the health of Maine lobster fisheries, a crucial industry in his area and a crucial resource for the whole country. 
   The funding provides infrastructure to improve science research efforts in this regard. Funding is crucial to understanding the health of the lobster fishery industry, and he stresses that in his remarks. 
   This amendment is supported by the subcommittee. It's a good earmark, it's a good project, and this Member has concluded that it's essential in his area and to support this very important industry in his area. The subcommittee strongly supports this Member's project in this regard.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. First of all, let me compliment the gentleman from Indiana on his project. We are here arguing, debating, describing, justifying, and questioning the merits of this particular project. However you want to describe it, the gentleman who offers the amendment, his basis of offering these amendments is, on the one hand, that we shouldn't be doing this. We talk about that on almost every amendment, the fact that indeed it is the job of the United States Congress and particularly the House of Representatives in the first instance under Article I of the Constitution to do just exactly this. This is our job. This is what we do--we provide funding for the United States of America. 
   The gentleman, I'm paraphrasing, said one Member of the body or of the Appropriations Committee or one Member of the Congress brings a project forward. Well, there's nobody in the Congress who would bring a project forward for this gentleman's congressional district if it were not this gentleman. 
   And then we get to the merits of the particular project. This one seems eminently justifiable; funding for equipment to train young people in forecasting. If you believe in government participation in education, that's what we do, and this is how we can empower this institution, this educational institution, so that they can bring excellent training for weather forecasting, which I think we all have to stipulate is extremely important for the Midwest in light of the kind of weather conditions they have. 
   So let me compliment the gentleman from Indiana for his project, and for bringing it to us. We have looked at it carefully, and perhaps we should say thank you to the gentleman who raises the amendment for giving the gentleman from Indiana an opportunity to stand up and discuss and describe his amendment for us and for his constituency.     
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   The gentleman alludes to the Defense Department. He could save a lot more than $2 million for the United States Government if he turned his attention to the Defense Department and some of the contracting activities that are certainly going on in Iraq. And perhaps that's something he will want to look at. 
   But let me say with regard to the textile-designated funding in this bill, I don't know a project that has actually had more scrutiny, or more broad-based support than this project. And in a time when our industries are competing internationally, the textile industry is particularly under siege around the world. This initiative has probably saved the textile industry that continues to struggle to exist in this country. To the extent that this program has been able to save it, the research and development that has come out of the textile industry's research can largely take credit for that. 
   I want to commend the Members who represent these areas. And it's not one area. It's not two areas. There are eight universities involved in this, focusing on this and being ahead of the problem enough in order to be able to fund, promote, and facilitate the research that has allowed the textile industry to be as competitive as it is around the world. It is only research, it is only new discoveries, it is only new materials, new ways of manufacturing  that have allowed the textile industry in this country to survive. So actually, these gentlemen are to be commended, each and every one of them for their foresight in supporting this project. I think I heard the textile industry has 60,000 employees across this country, and is a $60 billion industry. This is really a small amount of money which has had a huge pay-off for the textile industry and the economy of the country. It's a good project, Mr. Chairman. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, we are awaiting the arrival of the unanimous consent, which has been a long time coming, and it is still slow in arriving. Once it gets here, it will facilitate and speed up our business for the day. It will allow us to, in an orderly fashion, finish our business on CJS, not as expeditiously as we would like.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I just want to expand on the excellent debate and the points that have been made in opposition to this amendment. 
   The fact is we are in a period of rising crime. In the last 2 years we have experienced a rise in crime. We are looking at an amendment that proposes an across-the-board cut. 
   The first thing you all need to understand about this amendment is that it is indiscriminate. It doesn't look at what programs are being cut. It doesn't talk about cutting one program more because it's a lower priority or that program less because it's a higher priority, or excluding some programs from being cut because they are a tremendously high priority. 
   My colleague just talked about State and local law enforcement. The previous amendment would have cut the  Justice Department by some $681 million. This amendment cuts the Justice Department by $335 million. Those are real dollars and real cuts to law enforcement. Those cuts translate directly to local law enforcement and the people that are actually fighting crime in the streets.     
   What the Federal Government has done to support those folks in the past is given them resources, as the gentleman just described. If you are the sheriff's department in rural America, or you are the chief of police in urban America, or if you are a local law enforcement coordinator, then you are hurt badly by this across-the-board cut amendment. 
   The last amendment was a $45 million cut to State and local law enforcement. That means, as the gentleman just eloquently described, a large cut to our State and local law enforcement. 
   I would like to describe another area of the bill that would be cut by this amendment. To emphasize how real these cuts are, let's look at NASA. We have acknowledged that NASA is not being funded at a level that allows it to meet its missions across the board. If you are at Glenn Research Center or the Ames Research Center, and you are out there listening to this amendment, you need to understand that across-the-board cuts are going to mean significant things to your institutes. It means you are going to have fewer resources when right now you have a mission that you already lack resources to perform. 
   Employees at Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Goddard Space Flight Center and Johnson Space Flight Center in Texas, or who live in the communities and depend on it will be impacted by this amendment. 
   Science. This amendment would cut $79.7 million out of the science account. In this bill we tried to increase the science account so they will be able to do their missions. 
   Aeronautics; $9 million. And out of exploration--Johnson Space Flight Center and Kennedy Space Flight Center ought to be really tuned in to this--$54.9 million. 
   A total cut for NASA, Mr. Chairman, of $246.7 million. NASA is concerned about that. NASA says, and let me read, ``The consequence of these cuts is that NASA will not be able to make as effective or safe a transition to the new systems as originally planned. There will likely be significant workforce impacts as a result. Thus these budget reductions have ripple effects over many years due to the highly integrated nature of the shuttle and exploration systems. Many shuttle employees are at risk with these across-the-board cuts.'' 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this is just another reason of why we should be against these across-the-board cuts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, as we understand it, is merely a restatement of current law, which already prohibits the employment of unauthorized aliens. We don't read into it that it imposes any new burden on those who are using funds appropriated under the act. It is fully consistent with current legal obligations imposed on all employers, regardless of whether or not they use such funds. 
   We would accept the amendment, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. 
   The motion was agreed to. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Tauscher) having assumed the chair, Mr. Snyder, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3093) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, he reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. If I heard the gentleman from California correctly, I believe he misspoke and said that he encouraged a vote against the motion to recommit. Of course he's not against the motion to recommit, but if he were, that would be the only place that I agree with him on this amendment. 
   Obviously this is a killer amendment. This is the ``I got you'' amendment. It provides for promptly returning the bill back to the House. That means that the bill will not pass today on the Floor. That's the ``got you'' part of each one of these motions to recommit. It means we wouldn't be able to pass the bill here today. 
   Additionally, the amendment asks for additional funding for the Department of Justice immigration law enforcement capabilities. We just had a number of amendments proposing across-the-board cuts during this proceeding. Many of their supporters have argued that there's too much money in these bills and in these accounts. We're funding this bill substantially above the President's request, $3.2 billion above last year and $2.3 billion above the President's request. 
   It would always be good to have additional funding in law enforcement, but we're proud of how robustly we are funding law enforcement, and particularly for State and local law enforcement, which is $1.7 billion above the President's request. Those funds help with the local law enforcement, including prosecutorial, incarceration programs, and many others across the board. While this bill is well in excess of the President's request, much of that is for funding for law enforcement above last year's levels. 
   The other provision of this motion to recommit would fund the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program at the level authorized. Let me just suggest that the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program is a privileged account in this bill. We began funding through subcommittee at $375 million. In full committee, it increased to $405 million. On the floor, this program was again increased now to $460 million. It is certainly getting its fair share of funding relative to other accounts in the bill. 
   Indeed, if this motion to recommit were passed and were acted upon, we would have to go back and cut State and local law enforcement, FBI, DEA, and meth programs. We would have to cut law enforcement funding that puts police on the streets, that hires additional FBI agents, additional DEA agents, and funds meth programs. 
   If we approve this motion to recommit, we would really have to go back and cut all of that funding. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren).

   Mr. MOLLOHAN. The Davis-Kirk amendment to the 2007 farm bill would erase sugar policy measures that are designed to save taxpayers funds and prevent the U.S. sugar market from being overrun with subsidized foreign sugar. The economic impact in Minnesota alone of the U.S. sugar industry amounts to over $1.3 billion per year. Nationwide, over $10 billion is generated in economic impact from this industry. 
   While I sympathize with Members who are experiencing job losses in their districts, I would urge them to consider why job loss is happening. It is not because of the price of sugar. Food manufacturers are paying less for sugar today than they paid when Jimmy Carter was in the White House. 
   Now, the Davis-Kirk amendment would eliminate the market balancing provisions that we put in this bill. And this is really a safety valve to deal with the possibility of sugar coming in from Mexico, which I am not convinced is going to happen. So instead of dealing with this in a forfeiture way, which is the way the current system works, what this will do is it would allow us to deal with excess sugar that might come in from Mexico, and it would be done only as needed. 
   So we are not sure what is going to happen. Right now, the price of sugar in Mexico is higher than in the United States, and all the reports I am reading, they don't have any extra sugar in Mexico. So we are not even sure that this is a problem. 
   The Department has put this CBO score in there to try to screw us up with this program. They have been doing this for years. They have been trying to kill this program off. We have a mechanism here that makes sense, because we will put the sugar into ethanol, which speeds up the fermentation process and creates more ethanol in the process, this is corn ethanol plants, and it just makes sense. It is going to save us money, and it will make sure that we can maintain this industry. 
   They also in this amendment have a forfeiture penalty that would add insult to injury for American sugar farmers, as desperate farmers would have to pay back to the government 6 percent of their potential proceeds from the loan after the U.S. market prices have collapsed, if that ever would happen. So I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.
