<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding the time. 
   I wanted to ask Mr. Markey a question, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to ask him how many votes the Democrats have in this Congress, and I believe it's 233. If I am not badly mistaken, it takes 218 to pass any piece of legislation in this body. 
   So I don't understand why we are doing the smoke-and-mirrors game and the joke game of trying to say that Republicans are blocking this bill. They have got 218 votes. They can do anything they want to. They have changed the rules immediately when they want to. They can do anything with 218 votes, but yet they can't pass this bill. 
   The reason they can't pass this bill is because they don't want to give us an opportunity to put forth what 73 percent of the American people want, and that's to drill here and to drill now. A quote from Mr. Kanjorski, to give you an idea of what we are talking about, is with a local newspaper, he was talking about the fact that the Democrats had promised to end the war and bring the troops home if they were elected to Congress and it had not come true. 
   Ms. Pelosi had also promised to have a commonsense plan to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas. That's when gas was $2.10. It's now $4.10. And this is what Mr. Kanjorski said: ``We sort of stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.'' 
   ``We sort of stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.'' They're kind of stretching the truth today to make you believe that they cannot pass this bill. The reason they don't want to pass this bill is because they know it's smoke and mirrors. They know it's smoke and mirrors, and it won't have the immediate effect that they are saying. So what they are trying to do is to get something to go home to explain to their constituents why they are not going along with 73 percent of the American people that's saying drill here, drill now, lower our gas prices. 
   They want to have an excuse, and that's their excuse. I think it's true to form to what Mr. Kanjorski said--``We sort of stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.''

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   I wanted to have a quote up here that was from Mr. Kanjorski. And this was in an interview that he was giving to one of the local newspapers or television stations. And he was talking about really the Democrats' promise to end the war in Iraq and bringing all of the troops home, but it relates to their energy policy, too, and what they promised when Speaker Pelosi, then-minority leader in April of 2006, says, ``We as Democrats have a commonsense plan to lower the skyrocketing price of gas.'' At the time it was about $2.10 a gallon. 
   But Mr. Kanjorski said, ``We sort of stretched the truth and people ate it up.'' Well, there's been some truth stretching going on lately in this building, and I think what we've got to realize is that we need to do something to increase the supply other than taking out of our savings account. 
   If you have a shortfall every month and you take out of your savings to make up for that shortfall or to increase the supply of money that you have, you're eventually going to run out of that. We would run out of oil, and we don't need to do that because then we would certainly be at the mercy of our enemies. 
   This is Mr. DeFazio back on January 18 of 2007, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats came out with their energy plan. He said, ``It is sad to see the Republicans come to this. Now they laughingly say this will lead the higher prices.'' At the time, gas was $2.10 a gallon. Today it's about $4.10 a gallon. 
   We told the Democrats then that their energy plan was not going to work, that it was not going to help Americans lower the gas prices and the price to heat their homes. We're telling them the same thing today: by taking out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply is not the way to go. That's not the commonsense plan that Speaker Pelosi promised us back in April of 2006. 
   We don't need to deplete our savings, the energy reserve that we have in cases of emergency like when we used it for the first Gulf war and when we used it for Katrina. We don't need to use our savings. 
   And so with that, I want to say that this is another situation where, Mr. Speaker, the American people have heard the Republican idea of increasing supply, an all-of-the-above policy, and the Democrats are still doing things under suspension when they could do this under regular rule. They've got 218 votes. Mr. Speaker, the reason I think the majority party does not want to do it is because they know their energy plan is a failure. They want these bills to fail that they have under suspension. 
   Let's bring about something to this floor that will let the duly elected people of this country vote on an energy policy that will bring relief to the Americans at the pump. And that policy is to increase our oil supply from our own natural resources.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   And a while ago, I heard the majority leader say that this was not a sham. Well, we've seen this snake oil shop set up before when we've voted on things under the suspension rules, and that's what makes this a hoax. That's what makes this a joke. 
   Half of this House is being shut out, if not all of this House is being shut out, from offering amendments on the floor. The 700,000 people I represent in Georgia's Third Congressional District, Mr. Speaker, had no input into this. 
   And so we can call it what we want to, but it's a red herring. We are trying to put the attention on something that will not increase our U.S. oil production. 
   Seventy-three percent, Mr. Speaker, of American people say let's drill here, let's drill now, let's increase our oil production, let's bring up the supply; that will drive down the cost of our oil. 
   I want to read you a quote, and this is from Speaker Pelosi: ``This call for drilling in areas that are protected is a hoax. It's an absolute hoax on the part of the Republicans and the administration.'' 
   Here's a number for the switchboard in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker. I encourage the 73 percent of the American people that say that drilling is the right thing for us to do, that we should use our own natural resources, not be dependent on foreign oil, that we should let her know because I'm telling you, the Republican minority in this House cannot do anything to make the Democratic majority bring a bill forward through regular order that would give us or have an ability to either amend the bill or have a motion to recommit where the American people could really tell how their representatives feel about increasing U.S. oil production. 
   This is just smoke and mirrors. This is smoke and mirrors so they can go home during the August recess and say they voted on something. This is not an increase in our U.S. oil supply.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, it's interesting to come down here and to listen to the majority party, the Democrats, talk about a new change in direction for our energy policy or something new to do about our troops. 
   News flash: Y'all are in charge. You've got 230-plus votes. You're in charge. You can pass anything you want to. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to stop the whining. Since they took over in 2007, with a new energy policy, H.R. 6, our gasoline has gone up about $1.50 a gallon. 
   So here's what I want everybody to do, Mr. Speaker. I want you to go home tonight and I want you to go to Home Depot and I want you to buy some energy saving bulbs because, in their energy bill, light bulbs are mentioned 350 times, where gasoline was mentioned 6, crude oil was mentioned 12. I want you to go home, I want you to take those energy saving light bulbs, I want you to put them in, and then I want you to drive to the gas station and see if gas has come down, because that's the way their plan is supposed to work. 
   You're in charge. If you're in charge, lead. Mr. Speaker, we need some leadership here. We need to do something to help the American people at the gas pump with these outrageous gasoline prices and crude oil fixing to go to $150-plus a barrel. Do something.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Here is a real chart of what the gas prices have done. You have got the Republican Congress, 12 years, and then you have got the Democrat Congress in just 18 months. 
   But I was really surprised to hear the chairman of the Resource Committee talk about exporting Alaskan oil. There has not been any Alaskan oil exported in 8 years, 8 years. And we talk about, you know, if we are going to drill, I want to know--and this is shameful, but this is snake oil. This is snake oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, what the American people are being sold today is snake oil. They set up a snake oil shop about 2 weeks ago over here, and it was shut down by the Republican minority because we would not go along with a suspension bill that did not allow drilling. 
   Here we are right back again, trying to set up another snake oil shop with new ingredients, new facts that are being stirred around in the same thing to try to come up with a different result. 
   It is not going to come up with a different result because we are not going to cave in to these snake oil salesmen. We are going to stand up for the American people and demand that we drill, that we open up our areas, that we use our own natural resources, that we don't go hat in hand to foreign countries, that we don't give Hugo Chavez $178 million a year, that we use our own resources. And we are not going to be tricked by these new escapades that are being put on by the majority party today. 
   I feel like I am watching a ``Whose Line Is It?'' Because they are off on so many different things that I don't even know, Mr. Speaker, if they have read their own bill. 
   They call it the DRILL bill. This is not about drilling. This is about tricking the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can pay attention to their words, because I want to show you, this is a quote from January of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I just want to ask you one question and give you time to rebut it, and I will leave. 
   To my friend Mr. Ryan, you mentioned not being able to use our technology. In the energy bill that we passed in January of 2007, section 526 really limits the government agencies' ability to use fuels that could come from our technology. It says we cannot use these fuels, such as oil from shale, fuel made from that, for NASA, our military or other government agencies. 
   Could you kind of rectify that and how that relates to what you are saying? Because I agree with you, we have some of the smartest people in the world here that can look at some of the technology that has been in place in Europe for years of coal-to-liquid. But how does that translate in your energy policy, compared to what you are saying about the technology? Because I certainly agree with you about the technology, but I don't necessarily agree with the energy policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you. 
   As we continued listening to my friend and colleague Mr. Ryan talk about the amount of land that is open for drilling, it is only 3 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf. That is only 3 percent of it. There are only 6 percent of the Federal lands on shore that are open to drilling. Now, these oil companies may hold some of these leases, but why would you want to drill on something that did not have oil? I don't think that makes good sense. 
   He is talking about the $14 billion tax. Well, you know, I am not the smartest guy in the world, but I had an economics teacher, Colonel Walford, in high school, who made it very clear to me that taxing a producer or manufacturer did not lower the price to the consumer. You don't have to be an economist to understand that if you raise taxes on somebody, it is not going to lower the price to the consumer. 
   Now, the other thing is that the majority has been in control for 17 months. When they took over, the price of a gallon of gas was $2.26. Right now it is up over $4. I believe it was in April of 2006 that then Minority Leader Pelosi, now Speaker Pelosi, made the statement that the Democrats had a commonsense plan to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas. Now, it was probably $2.08 then, right at $2. So I don't know where this plan is. 
   They passed an energy bill in about January of 2007 that Mr. Ryan referred to, and in that energy bill they had specific language that said our government could not use certain alternative fuels. So they are saying one thing and then doing something else, and it is real confusing to the American people. 
   But I have something I want to unveil tonight, Mr. Speaker, for the American people. We have got some of it up here. What this is, Mr. Speaker, there have been all kind of petitions on the Internet. I went into a service station in my district and there was a petition there on the counter about the price of gas. There are petitions all over. Our constituents have an opportunity to go on the Internet and sign these petitions or go into their local grocery store or gas station and sign a petition for drilling, against drilling, for any variety of things as far as what the energy costs are that are affecting the average person. 
   So as I thought about this I said, you know, we need to make this simple. We need to make it so we have a petition for the House of Representatives. We have 435 Members here, and the American people need to know how their Representative would vote.     
   What would they be voting on? American energy solutions for lower gas prices, the things that we can control, our resources. 
   You know, China and Cuba are fixing to start drilling 45 miles off the coast of Florida. That's our natural resource, we could be drilling there, but we are not. So we have got 97 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf that we control we are not drilling on, 94 percent of the Federal lands that we have in this country, we are not drilling on. So we have got a real simple thing, bring onshore oil on line, bring deepwater oil on line and bring new refineries on line. 
   You might realize or might not realize that we haven't built a refinery since the late 1970s. We import, right now--this is probably going to surprise some people--we import 6.9 billion gallons of refined crude oil that's gasoline into this country every year, because we do not have the refining capabilities. 
   We had a motion to recommit, I believe, on May 22 that Mr. Conaway offered that said, within the 90 days, that the government would identify three locations on some of our military bases that have environmental problems, maybe, that the BRAC has closed immediately and in 90 days identify three of those to build new refineries. The majority voted against it. They stand and say one thing, but their actions do something else. 
   We need to build and expand our refineries, and we need to make this to where our oil companies are willing to invest. But when you import 6.9 billion gallons of gasoline and probably about the same amount of diesel fuel, that we come in. 
   What we have got is a petition here, and this petition starts out with Alaska at large, it goes out through Alabama and goes all the way through every State in this Union, and we have got everybody a district line. 
   Now, we just kind of, we had it back here in the corner today and some people came by and said hey, what you got, and I told them it's a petition. What the petition says, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' 
   That's pretty simple. It's not convoluted, it doesn't have anything to do with anything other than Americans providing their own resources for our energy. Now, what's wrong with that? We are a country that is known for our resourcefulness. 
   Mr. Ryan mentioned the technology. Germany, back in the late 1920s, had technology that converted coal to fuel. That was back in the late 1920s. Surely technology has come to where it's better. We have got over a trillion, that is a trillion with a ``T'', barrels of shale oil out west, a trillion, a trillion, and we are not doing anything with it. 
   In fact, not only are we not doing anything with it, but Mr. Udall from Colorado last year passed an amendment that said we couldn't do anything with it, that we couldn't drill, and it passed this House 219 to 215. You might remember, I believe that was the stolen vote. But those are circumstances that we have got, and so we want the American people to know where their Congressman is at. 
   We have got this petition, we are going to update it, every day we are going to have it back on the floor. I have got two pencils with me today, two markers. If anybody is listening that's still in town, wants to come down, they can certainly come down. I will give them some time to speak and they can tell their constituency why they want us to support us using our natural resources, our resources to provide energy for our people. 
   I will yield some time to Mr. Burton of Indiana.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Let me say this, the American people sometimes get confused, just as you spoke about, the bill that was in the Senate. They don't hear all of the things that were in that bill. That's one of the reasons I wanted to make this as simple as I could. It is not confusing. This is not confusing. 
   If anybody calls their Congressman and asks them if they signed this petition--and, by the way, the one petition I found online, I think, was American Solutions had over 500 now people, I think it has been up for less than 2 weeks, have already sent in and said we want to drill. There is a radio station in Tampa, Florida, that has started sending drill bits to Members of Congress and Members of the Senate to show their support for drilling. 
   This is a radio station in Florida that's doing this, and I imagine it would probably catch on all over the United States, and we will probably have more drill bits. I hope they will send a whole set that we will have to remind these people that we need to rely on our own resources. 
   That's the reason that we made it as simple as we could. All it says is, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production.'' Ninety-plus percent of the Republicans in this House have consistently voted for more domestic oil production. Eighty-six percent of the now majority party have consistently voted against more domestic production. This is going to put everybody on equal footing. 
   Everybody has an opportunity to sign it. I hope we get 435 Members to sign it and then, Mr. Burton, we can get on with what you offered to Mr. Ryan that we could come together, because we really don't have an opportunity to come to the floor in front of the American people. We only have a certain time where we can do it. 
   Maybe we ought to get a 2-hour thing where we could all come down here and talk and see if we can't straighten some of these facts out, because the facts are totally different from what I am getting from land management and evidently what somebody else has gotten from land management. 
   Right now I am proud to yield as much time as he might take to my good friend from Georgia, Dr. Price.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, and it is real simple, too. It can't be confused with anything else. American energy solutions for lower gas prices simply reads, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' It is real simple. 
   And what you were talking about, Dr. Price, is we are not going to drill in these leases that don't have oil. And when you've got I think it is 1.76 billion acres in the Outer Continental Shelf, and we have only opened up 3 percent of that. We have got 700 million on shore of Federal land that we have only opened up 6 percent to. 
   And let's look at this. Let's remember back because Mr. Ryan made a statement that it would be 10 or 15 years before we get any oil, and then it would be only 40,000 barrels a day. Let me remind the American people of this. In 1995, this Congress passed drilling in ANWR. Then President Clinton vetoed that bill in 1995, 13 years ago. Today, by conservative estimates, we would be getting 1 million barrels a day out of ANWR. Today. 
   Now Senator Schumer on the other side of the hall made a statement last week that if we could get Saudi Arabia or OPEC to increase production of a million barrels a day, it would reduce the price of gas 50 cents a gallon. Well, isn't that swell. That we are going to go to some people that haven't always been our friends, and we are going to say to the OPEC nations that we want them to drill. We want to use their natural resources, but we don't want to use ours. That doesn't make good sense. So just remember if President Clinton had not vetoed that bill in 1995, we would be getting a million barrels a day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. This might be a long-term plan, but you have to start some time. There has been a proposal by Senator McCain to give some temporary relief with a gas tax holiday during the summer to allow some people some extra spending money. It is not a great amount, but it is something. 
   We could also take off-road diesel and let people burn it on road. If you remember after Hurricane Katrina, there was a shortage of diesel. They didn't have any diesel and the EPA and the IRS got together and said all right, let's start burning this off road and let them use it for 30 days, and then I believe we extended it for another 30 days until we got the supply of diesel back. 
   So there are some commonsense things that we can do immediately. And Dr. Price hit on this. The day I believe that we pass some type of bill in this body that said we are going to look after our own solutions for energy from within our own natural resources, this oil speculation would come down. You wouldn't even have to put the first drill bit in the ground. Right now they understand that the majority that is in  control of this Congress are being held hostage by the radical environmentalists and that we are not going to do anything such as this with long-term planning about our energy future. And while we all want to conserve, we cannot conserve ourselves out of the dilemma that we are in right now. And so we have got to do something. We have to have some initiative to go forward. And right now, we are laying around in the fetal position talking about a commonsense plan that we had 2 years ago that we have not done anything about. So it is time for action. 
   You know, I have seen a knee-jerk reaction to everything up here. You let the least little thing happen, and we will have a knee-jerk reaction to it. And that is something. We have had tragedies that we have had. We put $140 billion down after Katrina, $62 billion in 2 weeks that we addressed down there, and it wasn't that we responded fast enough. So we have a habit of throwing money at things but not providing the boots on the ground or the substance to back it up. 
   Well, this is something that we just can't throw money at. This is something that calls for action. We, as the duly elected people by our constituents, we are the representatives of this country, and they sent us here to do something, not just lay here in a fetal position. And I yield to Dr. Price.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Yes, closed it down. 
   Going back to Hurricane Katrina and the fact that a large number of our refineries are on that gulf coast which is subject to hurricanes, it seems like we would take some proactive decisions and look at other places where we could put some of these refineries where they would not be as subject to hurricanes. 
   Once again, the people in New Orleans could not spend as much money as we sent down there as fast as they could. They needed action. They needed boots on the ground. They needed physical people down there helping them. 
   So we have an opportunity now to do something physical. We can put 435 pairs of boots on the ground right now and let the American people know that we are here to help. And what we are going to do, we are going to be at the forefront for making sure that we give the ability to extract oil and natural gas and clean-burning coal and any type of energy that we can from our own natural resources. 
   Now the Republican plan that Leader Boehner and others have put out talks about the on shore, online and that is estimated, and that is the shale and ANWR, that would save anywhere from 70 to $1.60 a gallon.     
   And if you look at the deepwater drilling, the OCS, that would be between 90 and $2.50 a gallon. And then the new refineries. And Dr. Price, before you got here, I made a statement that we import 6.9 billion gallons of gas every year, plus probably just as much diesel. But if we built a new refinery, it would save us 15 to 45 cents. So taking just a conservative estimate, that's about $2 a gallon that that would save us. 
   Now, if you look at the Democratic plan that they had, sue OPEC. Well, I don't think that's going to bring us in anything to reduce the price of gas. 
   They want to launch their seventh investigation into price gouging, their seventh. They've already had six investigations of price gouging. 
   They want to launch their fourth investigation into speculators, the fourth one. And they want $20 billion in new taxes on oil producers. 
   Now, here again, I've looked at all those things and I've kind of weighed both sides, and their savings is zero. Nada. Ours would be about $2 a gallon. 
   Is it going to happen immediately? No. Is it going to start happening immediately? Yes. 
   And so, what I wanted the American people to do with this, Mr. Speaker, is to allow them to see who's on their team for bringing down the price of gas, and who's on their team for using our own resources, rather than sending our President into foreign lands begging for other people to increase their oil production. 
   Dr. Price.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. But Dr. Price, that's the problem that the majority has because a lot of their base is the radical environmentalists don't care if gas goes to $10 a gallon. They don't want us driving SUVs. They really don't want us driving cars. They want us riding bicycles or motor scooters like you would see in China or somewhere in an Asian country. They don't want us driving. And they don't care how high gas gets. That doesn't matter to them. 
   And so that's a problem that the majority is facing. And I think one of the reasons they have not been quick to act is the fact that that has been a large part of their base. 
   But hopefully, the American people are going to realize that they can have a voice in this. They can 
   have a voice, and that they can see, on a chart, how their person stands; are they for U.S. energy independence or not? 
   And so that's what we have given, a plain visual of them to be able to see. 
   I yield to you.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. And I think you're right. And Mr. Burton's been here a lot longer than you and I have. But we have seen what complete authority is in this body, and really one person controls any legislation that comes on to this floor. So it wouldn't matter. 
   And we saw an example of that when we had the votes to pass the FISA bill, the national security bill. We had the votes to pass that in a letter that the Blue Dogs had sent to the Speaker. And our side we had enough to pass a good FISA bill that would have protected America, but we couldn't get it to the floor. 
   And so I think you're right, Dr. Price. I think there are many Members on the other side of the aisle that realize that we need to be looking at our own natural resources that would vote with us for a good plan, for a good energy program. But they'll never have the opportunity to do it. 
   And so that's the reason I felt the need to have this chart, so at least they can tell their constituents, hey, look, if leadership would bring this up, I'd be with you. But they won't bring it up.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. And we can get out of the fetal position and start some action. And that's what we need to be doing. 
   And you brought up a great point. Cooking oil, the fat, the grease pots that are there that people are actually going and robbing these things and making a biodiesel fuel out of it. 
   We've got some companies up in northeast Georgia that are making biodiesel out of chicken parts. The ingenuity is out there. We have just got to feed that and make these people have some ideas to come up with it. And we're not doing that. And that is an immediate thing that we could do. 
   The other thing we could do is propane. You talk about natural gas. You know, propane conversion was going very well in this country. And it's clean burning. It was going great. And then the EPA said no, you've got to do these specific tests on every different type of engine, on every different make of car. 
   And rather than going to the people that are making these propane conversion engines, these natural gas conversion engines, the hydrogen cell, we need to be putting every dime we've got towards technology and the hydrogen cell, because this is something that is very real that would really solve a whole bunch of our energy problems. But, rather than the government going to them and saying, how can we best help you develop a conversion energy from gasoline to natural gas, or from gasoline to propane, gasoline to a hydrogen cell, what can we do to help you? We don't do that. We put regulations on them and taxes that burden them from doing anything.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. These are top exporters of gasoline into the United States in millions of barrels. Now these are exporters to us in gas, not crude oil, in gas. 
   United Kingdom, 147 million barrels a year. That's about a billion gallons; the U.S. Virgin Islands import 990 millions of gasoline to us; France, 470 million gallons; Canada, 445 million gallons; the Netherlands, 441 million gallons; Norway, 353 million gallons. 
   And let me say this, 20 years ago, Norway--it may have been a little bit longer ago than that--Norway was kind of dependent on foreign oil. And Norway, they're basically a tourist, fishing, snow skiing country. They are now the second largest exporter of crude oil in the world because they said we're going to drill and use our own natural resources. 
   Germany. We import 250 million gallons of gas every year from Germany; 310 from Russia; 410 million from Italy, and 231 million gallons of gasoline we import from OPEC countries.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Think about this. Think about the number of jobs that would come here, that we would have ourselves bringing new refineries, expanding them, drilling, taking this shale out of the ground. These would create good-paying American jobs. We have a lot of people from this country that are in OPEC countries and in other nations that are working on these rigs, they're making big money. They could be doing the same thing right here in this country. 
   And we've got about 5 minutes left and so I want to just--I will end my part, and I will let everybody have a little bit of time. 
   I want to end my part in saying that I have tried to come up with as simple a way of getting information to the people of this country, Mr. Speaker, as I knew how on drilling. Because like I said, I have heard and gotten e-mails from this petition on this site, this petition on that site, and the one most people are doing is the American Solutions site, which I think has over 500,000 signatures now about drilling. You have got radio stations in Florida sending drill bits. And then I listen to all of the talk down here, and it is so confusing for people to understand exactly what we have voted on, what got enacted, what didn't get enacted. 
   So I wanted to come up with the simplest thing I could, and I came up with this petition: American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Brings onshore oil on line, bring deepwater oil on line, bring new refineries on line. And then it's simply asking 435 Members--we're giving 435 Members an opportunity to sign a petition, this is our energy petition, that says, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. And that's about as simple as we can get. 
   Dr. Price, would you like to close?

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS FOR LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, again, we come tonight to talk about something that is on all Americans' minds tonight, and that is the price of energy. We have been here for the last couple of weeks talking about the problem that we have with the energy prices and especially the price of gasoline in this country. And we are unable to break a deadlock, it seems like, in the House, Mr. Speaker, to have the representatives vote for a bill that would really increase energy production. 
   And I have got a few charts that I'm going to put up here now. These charts that I put up just represent a little petition that I had made up for the Members of this body. I had been contacted, as many of you, Mr. Speaker, have heard me say before, that I was contacted by many constituents that asked me if I had signed off the Internet petitions about drill here, drill now, pay less. There have been several petitions about wanting to bring down the price of gas. 
   In fact, I was in a local service station. I got my gas. I went in to buy some other things. And there was a petition there on the counter. It said, ``sign here if you want to lower gas prices.'' And I'm assuming the proprietor of that business did that to keep people from hollering at him about how much they were paying for their gas. But after reading this and learning that over about 1.5 million people had signed the petition on the Internet telling Congress, hey, look, we want you to drill here, we want you to drill now, I came up with the idea, Mr. Speaker, that I would come up with a petition for the Members of this body. 
   We are hearing from our constituents. And right now, about 73 percent of Americans are telling us, drill here. Drill now. We want to lower our gas prices. We want to be more dependent on our own natural resources than we are on foreign resources and be independent of other people to supply us with our energy needs. 
   So I came up with a petition. It says ``American energy solutions for lower gas prices.'' It includes bringing onshore oil online, bringing deep water oil online, and bringing new refineries online. A lot of people, Mr. Speaker, do not realize that we have not built a refinery in this country since 1978. In order to do that, we have got to do something to persuade these refining companies to bring refineries online, to do something to streamline the regulation process and the permitting process to be able to do this. 
   When the Republicans were in the majority, we did do that. We brought about a bill that offered an opportunity to streamline and to actually put some of these refineries on some of the military bases that were going to be closed. I came up with a petition. I had the petition over here. It is a House of Representatives energy petition. It says ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' 
   Now that is too simple, Mr. Speaker, for a lot of people in this body, in that it's one sentence, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' That's pretty simple. There's no discharge petition. There's no legislation that goes with it, Mr. Speaker. It's just an opportunity for not only the 435 voting Members of this body, but also the other seven delegates from U.S. territories around the world, to let their constituents know how they feel about increasing U.S. production to lower the gas prices. Well, we have sent at least two e-mails to everybody's office. We have talked to probably 230 or 240, maybe 250 people on this floor. So far, we have had 192 Members sign this simple petition. It says, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' 
   Now, if you're sitting at home--Mr. Speaker, if anybody was sitting at home watching TV and wanting to find out if their Congressman had signed, Mr. Speaker, they would go to house.gov/westmoreland. And, Mr. Speaker, on this Web site, we have a list of all those Members who have signed. And we have a list of those who have refused to sign. And if your Member is not in either one of those lists, then they have not signed. 
   So everybody in here has had an opportunity to do this. So far, 192 Members--and as I said, it's very simple, nothing, no piece of legislation, it's just a simple comment to the voters at home to let you know how the people in this body, because we are the ones, Mr. Speaker, that are going to have to take some action to make this happen. 
   Last week the President recalled or withdrew the Presidential ban on offshore drilling. Now, it's up to this House to do the same thing. We have to withdraw the congressional ban to explore and to do the offshore drilling. But so far, we've refused to do that. In fact, every bill that has come to this floor, including the Democrats' energy bill of January of 2007, has been either under a closed rule or under suspension. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, you know that being under suspension, you have no ability to amend the bill, there is 20 minutes of debate normally on each side, probably not even a subcommittee or a committee hearing on the process. So these bills have come with little input from all the Members of this body. 
   What we have called for, what the Republicans have called for, is for the Democrats to bring a bill to this floor that is an open rule bill. That means a bill, Mr. Speaker, that would allow all 435 Members of this body to put forth ideas, because the total solution is not drilling. The total solution is not conserving. The real solution is all of the above, a complete energy plan that would call for drilling on our Outer Continental Shelf, that would allow us to drill on Federal lands, do coal-to-oil conversion, create oil from the shale in the Western States, wind power, solar power, all of the above. 
   But so far, the Democratic majority, Mr. Speaker, has refused to allow those type of bills to the floor so everybody can have input. Now, I see here one of my colleagues, the gentleman from California, who just got back from a trip, Mr. Speaker, to some of these regions that we're talking about. And so I would like for my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) to get up and maybe tell us a little bit about his trip to some of the area that we believe we have some of the largest oil reserves in this country.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, this is a poster that we have, and this is the poster that really gets my blood  kind of hot, and I think it does for most other Americans, too. 
   When we realize who we are dependent on, when we talk about being dependent on foreign oil, exactly who are we talking about? I think this poster will give the American people an idea of some of the people we are talking about. 
   This poster says, America, get out your checkbook. In a recent interview on Al Jazeera, Chavez called for developing nations to unite against U.S. political and economic policies. What can we do regarding the imperialist power of the United States? We have no choice but to unite, he said. Venezuela's energy alliances with nations such as Cuba, which receives cheap oil, and are an example of how, and this is a quote, ``we use oil in our war against neoliberalism.'' 
   Here is a picture of Fidel Castro and Mr. Chavez. This is the interesting quote. Or as he has put it on another occasion, and this is Mr. Chavez talking and that was in the Washington Post, ``We have invaded the United States but with our oil; not with guns, but with our oil.'' 
   And here is the other part that most Americans do not realize, rather than having good-paying American jobs, rather than having the revenue from these oil leases come into this country and come into our pot, our government, our general account, rather than the royalties coming into us and us being able to lower our gas prices for all Americans, we write a check every day and this check is from American families and businesses to Hugo Chavez for $170,250,000 a day, a day. Not a week, not a month, not a year, $170,250,000 a day. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. If you remember, and Mr. Speaker, I am sure you remember this, H.R. 6 in January of 2007, which was the Democrat's energy bill, they precluded the American government, our agencies, from using the renewable fuels. And so that is an incredible thing. Part of the solution is going to be using and making these renewable fuels more affordable for all of us. But yet the biggest user of these fuels under section 526 of that bill, we are precluded from even using them.

   To the gentleman from Georgia, let me say, you have talked about process. I have talked about process. We have all come to this floor to talk about the process, and the fact that it is a broken process. The only thing that can come out of a broken process is a flawed product. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have to have the people of America get involved to help with this. We have to have the people of America engage. They have got to be part of the process, and they are going to have to engage and call their Congressman or Congresswoman to let them know, get out of the fetal position and let's do something.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. You are exactly right. 
   I wanted to read this one quote, Mr. Speaker, that I think will give the American people an idea of exactly what is going on because back in April of 2006 then minority leader, now Speaker Pelosi made a statement, ``Vote for us,'' the Democrats, ``because we have a commonsense plan to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas.'' 
   At the time gas was probably $2.23 a gallon. Right now it is about $4.08. This was a statement that was made by Mr. Kanjorski recently when he was campaigning. He was talking to one of his local papers. Here is what he said, and this was in reference to bringing home the troops out of Iraq, but it is just as good a reference to the energy crisis that we have. He said, ``We sort of stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.'' What a comment to make. ``We sort of stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I think the people have chewed on this enough, at least I hope that they have chewed on it enough. Mr. Speaker, if I could speak to the American people, which I know I can't, but if I could, I would say if you've had enough, let your Congressperson know about it, that you are ready to do something. You're  ready for this body, this duly-elected body to put forth a plan to bring down not just the skyrocketing price of gas, but of food. Because as we have made efforts to have biofuels and ethanol, the price of corn has gone up. The price of all petroleum products have gone up. And what we are faced with is a gallon of milk costing more and a loaf of bread costing more, and they sort of stretched the truth. Well, I'm saying they stretched the truth a pretty good ways if they are talking about a commonsense plan to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas. 
   I see another one of my good colleagues, the gentleman from Marietta, Dr. Gingrey.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank the gentleman. I too did a tele-town hall tonight and talked to about five of my counties. 
   The last person on the line was a gentleman by the name of Ken. Ken asked me, he said, why can't you all come up with a solution together? Why can't you do that? 
   I said, Ken, that's a great question, and I tried to answer Ken the best I could, but it was hard to answer it without getting into floor procedures and the parliamentary procedure. Basically what I tried to tell Ken and the other 500 or so people that were on the call is that, listen, when you have 218 votes in this body, you can do anything you want to do. You can have a good idea. You can have a great idea. You can be 100 percent right in your idea and your thoughts. 
   But if you don't have 218 votes, you don't have anything. You can't even get it to the floor. 
   That's what's happened here, even though 73 percent of the American people polled said, look, let's drill here, let's bring down our price of gas, let's become more dependent on our own natural resources rather than giving $170 million in American jobs to Hugo Chavez, let's invest in our own futures, let's invest in the future of our children and grandchildren. 
   That's what they are saying. When somebody like Ken asked me that on a call, why can't you get along, we can't even get our point out. As Mr. Gingrey from Georgia said, this is the only way we have got to do it is come to the special orders on the floor of the House and try to convince the American people to get involved. 
   You know, we are a government of, for and by the people, but if the people aren't engaged in it, then it's not going to work. Seventy-three percent of the American people have answered polls and said, look, let's drill. But, yet, the majority party, who represents probably a little over half of the American people, have said November. But the Republicans, the minority, who represent the other half of the American people, have not had an ability to put their ideas on floor. 
   We have discharge petitions, and a discharge petition is something if you can come up with 218 signatures, supposedly, it would get to be on the floor. We had one the week of June 9 that said No More Excuses Energy Act of 2007. Reduce the price of gasoline by opening up new American oil refineries, investing in clean energy resources such as wind, nuclear and capture carbon dioxide and making available more home-grown energy through environmentally sensitive exploration or the Arctic energy slope in America's deep-sea energy resources. 
   Then on the week of June 16 we had another discharge petition, which is over here every day for Members to come sign that says, Expanding American Refining Capabilities on Closed Military Installations, reduces the price of gasoline by streamlining the refinery application process and by requiring the President to open at least three closed military installations for the purpose of siting new and reliable American refineries. We even had that in a motion to recommit that was voted down. But this is over here readily available to be signed every day. 
   Week of June 23, the repeal of the ban on requiring alternative fuels, as I mentioned before, we have a ban on alternative fuels for our government agencies. It reduces the price of gasoline by allowing the Federal Government to procure advanced alternative  fuels derived from diverse sources such as oil shale, tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology. 
   The week of July 7, the Coal-to-Liquid Act, reduces the price of gasoline by encouraging the use of clean coal-to-liquid technology, authorizing the Secretary of Energy to enter into loan agreements with coal-to-liquids projects that produce innovative transportation fuel. Take the burden off of aviation fuel, off of our military. 
   You know what? This creates American jobs. This puts people to work. 
   The week of July 14, the Fuel Mandate Reduction Act of 2007, reduces the price of gasoline by removing fuel blend requirements and onerous governmental mandates if they contribute to unaffordable gas prices. It's right over here every day for people to sign. 
   This week, American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act, reduces the price of gasoline by opening 
   the Arctic energy slope to environmentally sensitive American energy exploration. The development footprint would be limited to one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the refuge. Revenue received from the new leases would be invested in a long-term alternative energy trust fund. 
   Those are opportunities that each Member of this body and each delegate of the U.S. territories across this world have an opportunity to sign, yet we don't even have the 218 yet. So these are opportunities. 
   When people go home on these resources, and as my gentleman, my friend from Georgia said, we get out on a Thursday about 2:30 while other people are hard working trying to earn enough money to buy their gas, but let us hear from you. If I could speak to the people, I would tell them, we need your help to move this.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the gentlelady from North Carolina. 
   I want to thank the Speaker, too. I didn't realize who the Speaker was until just now. But I want to thank the Speaker for what we did a couple of weeks ago in a 2-hour Special Order where we had bipartisan participation. And I think the American people, Mr. Speaker, enjoyed it. I know that you said you enjoyed it. I enjoyed it, and hopefully we can do that again. 
   I want to comment, the gentlelady from North Carolina made a comment about the Democratic majority calling on the President to do something. Well, he did do something. He removed the executive ban on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf, and he called on Congress to do the same thing. We have yet to do that. 
   But just the mention, just the mention of that, oil went down $10 a barrel. Then just the mention, the discussion, even though it was more snake oil than anything else, that the majority had last week on a bill that they called DRILL for some reason, oil went down again. 
   And so I think that, and if you look at the spike in oil prices, and I don't have the chart up here with me tonight. I do have the chart that shows the 12 years of the Republican Congress of gas going from $1.44 to $2.10. In the 18 months that the Democrats have been in charge of Congress it has gone from $2.10 to $4.11. 
   Let me give you just a little bit of background about that, because if you look at a chart in May of 2007, the speculation in the oil prices just shot up, and for good reason. 
   We had an amendment on this floor that Mr.--I believe that was the gentleman from Colorado that said, no more drilling for shale oil. Two trillion barrels. And I believe, Mr. Speaker, that is more than Saudi Arabia has in crude oil that we have got in our western States in shale oil, and this Congress, by a very narrow vote, said nope, we are not going to take that out. We are going to leave that two trillion barrels of oil in there. 
   It was at that time that we saw the spike because what people realized is, hey, look, they are not going to take care of their own resources. They are not going to increase their production. They are going to be dependent on other countries to supply it. 
   And then, on the reverse, just the mention of drilling dropped the price of oil. 
   I would like to yield some time to the gentleman from Georgia.

   And Americans all over this country are wondering why, when 73 percent of them say drill here, lower our gas prices, they want to know why. And I want to give just a little insight into why. 
   I want to read you some quotes, and this quote is from the Sierra Club, and you can go to probably their Web site or at least the FEC reports and see which Members have gotten money from this group. But this is the Sierra Club. ``The Sierra Club opposes any general program to lease Federal oil shale reserves for production purposes. The Sierra Club opposes development of the oil resources on the Outer Continental Shelf.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, before I begin my remarks, I would like to call on my fellow Members to keep the gentleman from Georgia, Congressman CHARLIE NORWOOD, in your thoughts and prayers. As many of you know, CHARLIE has suffered from cancer for some time and has fought valiantly, just as he did when he recovered from a lung transplant several years ago. 
   Today CHARLIE announced that he is going to decline further treatment and return home to Augusta, Georgia, where he will receive hospice care in his home. CHARLIE NORWOOD has served the people his entire life. He has served his Nation as a soldier in Vietnam. He served Augusta, Georgia, but also as a dedicated father to his children, and a husband to his loving wife Gloria. 
   Since 1995, he has ably and some would say tenaciously represented the people of eastern, northern Georgia, but his service and his wisdom has benefited us all. To me he is not just a great Georgian and a great American, he is a great friend. He served as a mentor to me and to many others in this House. And I know that everyone, Mr. Speaker, here has CHARLIE and Gloria in their thoughts and prayers. 
   He said today that he is turning it over to the Lord's hands, and I know that he can be in no better place than that. I look forward to working with CHARLIE again. I look forward to him getting back. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we are talking about the budget and the economy here today, because CHARLIE was a great champion, is a great champion, for the taxpayers of this country, fighting for smaller government, less spending and lower taxes. 
   In these hallowed halls we hear the word ``compassion'' when we are talking about spending other people's money, when we are talking about disbursing the hard-earned tax dollars of American workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, we talk about how important this spending is, how much it is going to help people. Certainly there is no end to the good and well-meaning projects that we could fund. We all want well and qualified students to have the resources they need to go to college. We all want to find an answer to cover the 47 million people who do not have health insurance. We all want to see the benefits that come from new roads, expanded public transportation, infrastructure improvements and economic development projects. We all scrape and fight to ensure that our constituents get their fair share of the Federal pie. 
   But as we consider the massive spending obligations that our government faces in coming years, everyone in this House, Republican and Democrat, liberal, moderate, conservative, can agree that we cannot stay on our present course. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the baby-boomers near retirement, we will soon face a scenario where there will not be enough workers to support the entitlement spending slated for Medicare and Social Security. We have talked often in recent years about the funding shortfall that Social Security faces. We know that Social Security will run out of money in less than 50 years. 
   Perhaps we have focused on Social Security because it seems to be the more manageable problem. As dire as the Social Security situation is, our shortfall in the Medicare program is eight times larger. That should concern not just Members of Congress, but all Americans. 
   The Medicare shortfall will affect not just retirees and those retiring in the next 10 years, it also is of concern to the younger generations. How will they pay for their parents' health care and long-term care without the guarantees of Medicare?  
   Mr. Speaker, how would their generation afford a pay-as-you-go system for their parents' generation when there are only two workers supporting every retiree? And finally they must ask themselves, will Medicare be there for me when it is my time to retire? 
   These are serious questions that demand serious answers. That is why I think we need to refine what we consider compassionate in this House. I would argue that it is compassionate for us to do a much better job of making tough decisions on spending in today's Congress to save programs not only for present generations, but for the future generations of Americans. 
   Quite frankly, to maintain current benefits after the baby-boomers retire would require crippling levels of taxation that would grind our economy to a halt and put all of our Federal programs at risk. In our effort to be compassionate today, we are spending tomorrow's money. At our present rate we are going to leave future generations with nothing but IOUs. 
   The best thing that we can do to save Medicare and Social Security for future generations is to reduce the growth of the programs and maintain the growing economy that allows us to sustain tax revenues and keep these important entitlements afloat. 
   The tax cuts of the past 6 years have served this purpose. I think the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Iowa have explained that very well. Last year the Federal Treasury took in more money than it ever has before, because our tax policies have allowed Americans to keep more of their money, and they have allowed U.S. businesses to flourish and expand despite the strain caused by the technology bubble, the tragedy of September 11, and the cost of the war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, the tax cuts boost the economy. In order to preserve the tax cuts, we have to reduce our spending. Certainly we have to cut back on earmarks and local projects, and I certainly hope we heed President Bush's call to cut the number of earmarks in half. 
   But that is not going to be enough. We must curtail the growth of entitlement spending, or else cuts elsewhere in the budget will never offset those exploding costs. We have to fund our national priorities, but we must be more selective in what we consider priorities.     
   We took an important step last year when we saved $40 billion in the Deficit Reduction Act. That legislation required courageous leadership, and we are going to need more of that kind of leadership in the future. 
   So to sum it up, the tax cuts boost the economy. A strong economy fills Federal coffers, and tax revenues allow us to fund programs important to all Americans so long as we learn to live within our means. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from California for leading this important discussion. In his time here in the House, he has proven to be a leader on these issues, and I appreciate his experience as a CPA, as a businessman, and one who has furnished jobs and helped this economy grow. I appreciate this time he has yielded me.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit with instructions. 
   One of the most confusing areas of public life for most Americans involves to what extent a person may express their personal religious views. Everyone believes they have complete religious freedom and yet the media often reports instances where courts or administrators say people may not express their religious faith. The unfortunate result of this confusion is that people tend to self-censor their behavior. 
   In 1997, the Clinton administration sent out guidelines to all Federal agencies that specifically detailed an employee's right to religious expression in the workplace. As then-President Clinton said in his remarks on the executive memorandum, ``Religious freedom is at the heart of what it means to be an American and at the heart of our journey to become truly one America.'' 
   America continues to see ever-growing and diverse forms of religious expression, and unfortunately we have also seen an increase in the attempts to undermine religious freedom and expression. 
   So, as we consider this bill, we should be clear that the Federal employees do not have to check their faith at the door of their workplace and are protected under this bill if they do report violations of the current Clinton-era guidelines. In fact, it is often their faith that makes them the compassionate social worker in the employment office, the loving teacher in the Head Start program and the caring medical professionals treating our wounded soldiers.  
   There is nothing more personal than a person's faith, and our Federal employees deserve to know that they cannot be forced to check their quality of life at the door. As such, this motion provides that it is an abuse of authority for Federal agencies to prevent a Federal employee from blowing the whistle on instances of retaliation against permissible religious exercise and expression in the workplace. 
   The definition of permissible religious exercise and expression is drawn from President Clinton's 1997 memorandum to Federal agencies regarding religious expression in the Federal workplace. It includes, for example, the ability of Federal employees to have a Bible on their desk, wear a religious emblem on their clothing, or to express their views to other employees. It also includes provisions protecting against discrimination, harassment and coercion. 
   I believe this is an important addition to this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to support the addition of this language. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, April 28, 2006, a press release by Anita Lowe: These skyrocketing gas prices are a reflection of the Republican energy plan. We need a long-term strategy to lower gas prices and meet our energy needs. Yet Republicans passed up a golden opportunity in major energy bills last year. Democrats have a plan to give American families the relief they deserve. Democrats, Madam Speaker, have been in charge for 16 months and gas prices have gone up over $1.25 a gallon. 
   April 18, 2006, in a press release, then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: But  the Republicans' bills clearly have done nothing to lower gas prices as the price of a barrel of oil has settled above $70 a barrel, the highest price in our history. 
   Today, Madam Speaker, oil closed at $114 a barrel. Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices taking America in a new direction. We're ready to see this new plan. I don't understand why the Democratic leadership won't bring out the new plan, why there is not an outcry from their membership to see the new plan.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Yes. A Congress working for all Americans is the Democratic promise. And what the Democratic promise says is, ``bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups with appropriate referrals to other committees. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level. Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate, consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.'' 
   It also says that the suspension calendar should be restricted to noncontroversial legislation. I would like to remind my friend from Indiana that all the legislation that we've had thus far in the 110th Congress that dealt with energy has either, number one, been brought up under a closed rule or under a suspension rule. The closed rule means no amendments. The suspension rules mean no subcommittee, no committee, no amendments, just a straight 20 minutes for each side. 
   And I've got some other points I want to bring up, but I'll let you talk about these empty promises that has come about.

   And while the troops face fire, the Democratic leaders fiddled. They slowed down the process even more by sitting on the bill for days.

I said, Well, I know that you are going to keep my back covered and that you are going to be with me if you tell me that you are with me until I get out of the foxhole or until they drag our dead bodies out. 
   That's the kind of guy he was. If he told you that he was with you, then he was with you. That's the type of thing that he exerted towards the veterans of this country is that he was with the veterans. I don't think there could be any greater honor on that veterans building in Augusta than Charlie Norwood's name, to let the veterans know and understand that he has always been with them, that he went through  many adversities with his health, a long time of trying to get over an illness.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to stand up in support of my colleague from Georgia's amendment. 
   I spent 12 years in the Georgia House in the minority. What I tried to do for that 12 years is change the process, because the process was broken. When the process is broken, the product is flawed. 
   When I came to Congress, I came as a freshman in the majority, and found that the process was still broken. So I found myself going from being in the minority trying to change the process, to being in the majority trying to change the process that the majority was using. 
   Now I find myself back in the minority still trying to change the process, because the process in Washington is broken. 
   I think Mr. Gingrey's amendment highlights that, in that we adopted rules in this House on first day, but we keep waiving those rules when those rules don't fit what we want to do. Now this is not to say anything about a Commission on Climate Change. But when you let public opinion, and you let political winds determine public policy, then the taxpayers of this country pay for it. 
   That's exactly what the majority party is doing. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we used to have a majority party and a minority party. I think, now, some people in this body think they are a monarchy, that they control everything, that the process should just be overlooked. 
   The gentleman's amendment talks about this process and who has authorization and who has oversight. If you will remember when we first opened up and we had the first 100 hours or 100 days or 100 amendments or 6 for '06 or whatever it was, we didn't go through any regular process, no regular order. So we have seen this body go from what the minority, now the majority, used to complain about us. 
   You know, my momma used to say to me, Lynn, if your buddy jumped off the cliff, would you jump after him? Well, I am going to ask, I am going to ask the side over there, if we jumped off a cliff or no matter what we had done, are you saying, well, you all did it. That sounds like a bunch of kids playing in a sandbox. 
   We need to stop the things that are wrong with the process today, no matter who used to do them. No matter what's been done in the past, let's look at today. Let's see if we can't make a difference. 
   That's what I ask, that we go through the normal process. I think the gentleman from Georgia's amendment gets us back to that place. It puts the Rules Committee, hopefully, back in a light to where they understand that we are not going to stand for the continual waiving of the rules that this House adopted. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I just want to say that I am certainly not in favor of, Mr. Chairman, increasing this bill any more. In fact, I think we really need to look at where it is at. At $27.6 billion in discretionary funding, that is $1.9 billion or 7.5 percent more than the President requested, and it is $1.2 billion over fiscal year 2007. So it is about, I guess, $700 million more than the President requested. 
   We have been on this floor, Mr. Chairman, and have heard the majority brag about how they were spending less than the President requested and that they had actually cut it and it wasn't as much as the President had requested. 
   Well, here is one that is more than the President requested. And it is adding money for the Climate Change Commission, the sense of Congress. We are looking at maybe not becoming dependent on our own oil supply and requiring and leaning more on the foreign oil supply. 
   So I hope that we would not look at this as, I guess, doing something that needs to be done. It is a process of spending more money. 
   If you look at the 302(b) allocations for fiscal year 2008, Mr. Chairman, $83 billion. And most Americans, including myself, don't really understand what $1 billion is. There are very few people in this country that are even worth $1 billion. This spends $83 billion more than the 2007 enacted budget levels. 
   I have heard the majority say, well, we have got this increase because these programs were starved to death during the last 6 years. They were just starved to death. Well, the reality is domestic discretionary spending has increased 40 percent since 2001. 
   Let me say this, and I spoke about it before in my last conversation, the process is broken and the product is flawed. Let's recognize that and don't pass another flawed product because the process is not breaking itself; we are breaking the process because we are the ones that the people elect to put in charge of the process to make it run correctly.

   Harriett Woods, a devoted mother, wife, grandmother, politician, author and community activist, passed away at her home in University City, Missouri, this February of leukemia. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, she went on to attend the University of Michigan. It was there that she became the first female editor of the school's highly esteemed student newspaper. 
   In later years, her career and political life proved to be an uphill battle  against more popular-known male politicians. Her political career began as a stay-at-home mom. She went to the city council with a complaint about a noisy manhole cover. When they ignored her, she pushed forward launching a successful petition to have the street closed. Causing the attention of the local press, she earned a job to run a community public affairs panel. Soon after, she was elected to the University City Council where she served for 8 years. She followed that up with two terms in the Missouri State Senate. 
   Harriett Woods ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1982, but her name became well known throughout the State. It helped her 2 years later to become the first female elected to statewide office in Missouri when she held the office of Lieutenant Governor. It was a post she held until 1989. 
   She remained active in politics and her local community throughout the rest of her life, focusing primarily on women's issues. From 1991 to 1995, she was President of the National Women's Political Caucus. Her dedicated work even earned her a spot on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

   Willye B. White was quoted as saying, ``A dream without a plan is just a wish.'' It was this belief that led her to become the first American to have competed in five Olympic track and field teams, a feat still unchallenged. 
   Willye White competed in five consecutive Olympic games between 1956 and 1972. At the young age of 16, she won a silver medal in the long jump competition at the games in Melbourne, Australia, historically marking the first time an American woman ever medaled in that event. She earned her second silver medal in the 1964 Tokyo, Japan, games by participating in the 4-by-100-meter relay. 
   Born in Money, Mississippi, she was raised by her grandparents and fought through the daily struggles of the civil rights movement. Her love of sports emerged around age 10 when she discovered the joy of running and jumping. Overall, she competed in 39 international teams, four Pan-American Games teams and five consecutive U.S. Olympic track and field teams. 
   After her competitive career ended, she stayed active in the sport through coaching and other activities. She represented track and field on the U.S. Olympic Committee, coached athletes in the National Sports Festival in 1979 and 1981, coached and managed at the 1981 World Cup Track and Field Championship Games in Brussels and Rome, and she served as head coach for the 1994 Olympic Sports Festival. 
   Beyond coaching, she also founded the Willye White Foundation which helps children develop self-esteem and become active members of their communities through athletic participation. She has earned numerous awards throughout the years and is a member of eleven sports halls of fame. 
   She sadly lost her battle with pancreatic cancer in February. So, today, we proudly honor her life with the naming of this post office in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois.

   We often come to the floor to talk about our brave soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan; but today I am proud to speak about a hero, a highly decorated Korean War veteran, Lewis G. Watkins. 
   Staff Sergeant Lewis G. Watkins was born in Seneca, South Carolina, on June 6, 1925. After graduating from Greenville High School, he joined the Greenville Police Department. Furthering his public service, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1950. After his training in Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton, he was sent to serve in Korea. 
   Staff Sergeant Watkins fought valiantly during his only tour of duty. On October 7, 1952, his unit was attempting to take an outpost from the enemy. While leading his men up a hill and fighting off heavy small-arms fire and grenades, he was severely injured. Pushing through the pain, he successfully led his team further up the hill. 
   It was then that he noticed a grenade had landed nearby. Pushing his comrades aside to protect them, he instinctively grabbed the grenade to throw it out of harm's way. Unfortunately, the bomb exploded in his hand and he was mortally wounded. His heroic actions on that hill saved the lives of his fellow soldiers; and it was for this act of bravery and courage he deservedly, albeit posthumously, was awarded the Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. His other awards include the Purple Heart, the United Nations Service Medal, and the Korean War Service Medal with two bronze stars. 
   Staff Sergeant Lewis G. Watkins' life and military achievements are to be commended. He fought and died for his country; and today we honor his heroism, his self-sacrifice, and his inspiring leadership by naming this post office after him.

   With the recent tragedy of Virginia Tech fresh in our minds, we take this time to remember the many victims of needless violence in our country. 
   The devastation of families, victims and entire communities in which these tragedies occur is beyond calculation. Too often, victims' loved ones are left alone with their loss and feel overwhelmed with the devastating experience that has altered their lives forever.  
   No one should have to cope with that loss alone. In such crushing times as these, families and friends look for sources of strength to sustain themselves. They also need ongoing support in dealing with the criminal justice system, which can be especially overwhelming during this period of grief. 
   The need for sources of strength are often found through a variety of support services, including counseling, crisis intervention, professional referrals and assistance in dealing with the criminal justice system. These organizations play an essential role in preserving the memories of victims of murder. 
   After the story of the murder fades, victim's family and friends are often left to cope without their loved ones alone. Thankfully, these counseling organizations provide the necessary support to the families and friends of murder victims so they can continue with their daily lives. 
   These personal assaults on our citizens are also an assault on all of us. We must remain diligent in our efforts to curb violence. Our murder rate in this country is simply too high. People watch television, movies and play video games where murder is often glorified. Many of our youth engage in pastimes where they are exposed to violence at an early age. However, there is no age where it should be appropriate to introduce murder into anyone's life. 
   It is incumbent upon all of us to recognize the selfless support groups in our communities who work tirelessly to help the thousands of friends and families of murder victims in this country every year. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 223.

   Mr. Speaker, County Mayor Claude Ramsey has a long list of accomplishments to show for his three terms as leader of Hamilton County, Tennessee. From reforming the public education system to creating jobs in the area, Mayor Ramsey has constantly addressed the needs of both the business community as well as the general public. 
   Mayor Ramsey turned Hamilton County's public education system into a model for other counties to follow. Mayor Ramsey rallied support from the neighborhoods. Nine thousand people participated in an education summit and task force to identify the issues and challenges facing the department. Eight key initiatives, including target graduation and reading rates, increased technology, and early education programs, were formed. When fully implemented, the county's public education system will be one of the very best in the country. 
   Mayor Ramsey is constantly looking for new business and industrial recruitment and has made economic expansion a priority during his administration. He was able to secure almost $3 million in grant funds for expansion of local industries, which led to hundreds of millions of private investment and the creation of 2,000 jobs. He was also able to receive funding for the Center for Entrepreneurial Growth, a program started by Mayor Ramsey, to create more technology-based jobs in the community. 
   Hamilton County has received high praise for the changes that have been made, for instance receiving an AA+ rating from Finch, Inc. In 2003, Mayor Ramsey was presented Chattanooga Area Manager of the Year, an award presented annually to an executive whose management skills have profoundly influenced the outstanding performance of a key element of American business, industry, government, or nonprofit activity. 
   Mayor Ramsey has also addressed important topics such as literacy, obesity, public littering, and the creation of parks. 
   Making himself open and available to the community, Mayor Ramsey is very active in local agencies, such as the Orange Grove Center and the chairman of the Board of Associates at Chattanooga State Technical Community College. 
   As Mayor Ramsey rounds out his third term as county mayor, he continues to be an active and committed leader to the citizens of Hamilton County. The programs which he has put into place will be his legacy. They will continue to provide for the community for decades in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to point out that the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) would like to be here today to make a statement, but he had to remain home for a family emergency. We wish Mr. Wamp and his family the best. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of H.R. 1260, which honors Mayor Ramsey for his admirable public service to the people of  Hamilton County and the State of Tennessee.

Well, if you don't want to increase the troop size, which the undemocratic majority evidently does not want to do with this resolution, and you don't want to stop the funding, then what do you want to do? You want to stay the course. I think the American people said in the election, we don't want to stay the course. 
   I think that our military leaders, we hear this resolution when the other side talks about it, they talk about supporting our troops. And I am sure General Petraeus is confused to get approved unanimously in the Senate and hear this resolution about supporting our troops and yet we don't want to follow what he has said we need to do. General Casey agrees with this and he has been confirmed to a new position. And so how can we tell our men and women in the field that, Hey, look, we support you, but don't listen to what your commanders have to say. We've got something different. We're going to micromanage the war from Washington. 
   A lot of the people that are going to be voting on this resolution have never been to Iraq. They have never been to Afghanistan. They have never seen some of the situations that our young men and women are put in for freedom-loving people all over this world. I don't know how they could actually vote on it if they have never been, but I guess they will. Because they are trying to paint a picture of having your cake and eating it, too. We support our troops but, look, we don't want to change our way of what we're doing. We don't want to try to help you with more troops, to try to help you save your life over there and securing these areas that you risked your life in going in to take, knock the enemy out, and then have to leave and let the enemy come back in and be even stronger. What kind of message does that send? 
   This is not about President Bush, because I think President Bush has tried every way, Mr. Speaker, he knows how to make this a successful campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he continues to come up with new ideas through the help and the advice of his military commanders to win this war on terror. This is a global war on terror. Some people from the other side seem to believe that if we pull out of Iraq that the Iraqi people are going to go back to tending sheep and herding goats. That is not what is going to happen. If we pull out of Iraq, what is going to happen is you are going to see more bloodshed than we have seen in a long time in this world, and it is going to be the innocent Iraqi people who stuck their finger in that purple ink and went and voted for the first time in their life that are going to be the ones to suffer, the ones that said, we believe in freedom, we believe in governing ourselves, we support the coalition forces here because we believe that they're coming to free us from this tyrant that we have been under. Those are the ones that are going to die. Those are the ones that are going to suffer the most. Those are the Iraqis that are losing their lives today because they want freedom. 
   Our men and women in uniform, those blessed souls that are in Iraq and Afghanistan and are losing their lives, they volunteered to put their lives in harm's way not only to protect our freedom in this country, not only to protect this Republic that we have but to spread freedom and democracy all across the world to every human being that loves freedom and liberty. These brave men and women need our support. They need our encouragement. But what they don't need is a smoke-and-mirror resolution that is done for political reasons and because of political promises made on a campaign trail. They don't need that. They need real encouragement and support from this Congress. Let's do something to give them that and not do things that strengthens the enemy, discourages our troops and really and truly, I believe, goes against the Constitution. When we all took the oath of office, we made an oath to the Constitution, not to anybody else. Let's uphold that. Let's respect our Commander in Chief and the generals in the field.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Ms. Blackburn. I really want to ask you a couple of questions, if I could, just to have a little conversation here. You talked about taxes and what was being done. How about the alternative minimum tax, the AMT, that was put in under the Democratic majority back in the late sixties or early seventies, that was really targeted to try to get 28 millionaires out of 250 million people that live in this country, to target 28 people, to come up with this alternative minimum tax that says, you know, if you fill out your 1040 and we don't feel like you paid enough tax, in other words, if you had too many deductions or if your tax really wasn't where we thought it needed to be, then you have to pay the alternative minimum tax. 
   I think the lady from Tennessee may have some numbers. I don't know. I have heard the number that as high as 32 million people are going to be affected, 10 percent of our population or over 10 percent of the population is going to be affected by something that the Democrats did to get 28 people to pay taxes. It should have been a little more simple than that, shouldn't it?

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. That is exactly right. Here is the Web site right here: rsc@mail.house.gov. And you can go to the Hensarling Web site, our chairman, and let us know how you feel about the AMT. If this thing has affected you, we want to know about it, because we are going to make sure that we do everything that we can to make sure that this AMT does not continue to affect more and more of our taxpayers that go out every day and work hard for their money. And, by the way, they are probably still at work right now trying to earn some money. 
   Getting back to the Employee Intimidation bill, is it going to be an open rule or a closed rule? I don't want to talk inside baseball or get down in the weeds here, but are we going to be able to offer amendments? Am I going to be able to offer an amendment to perfect this bill? Or is it going to be a closed rule like we have been having where the people of the Third District of Georgia or some of the people from the lady from Tennessee's district or the gentleman from Texas' district that has no say-so in the process? Have you heard if we are going to be able to perfect this bill? Or is this bill perfect? Is this bill perfect and doesn't really need any perfecting?

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. As my colleague from Georgia just said, I was looking forward to that 5-day workweek, and so far, since January 4, I believe we have experienced one. Here it is, 2:25. And I don't know of many people from the Third District of Georgia that are home right now. Most people are working. 
   The chairman of the Financial Services Committee said his people were falling sleep. They must be staying up too late at night because it is not from overwork. As my colleague from Georgia said, I think in the last 2 days we have worked an hour and a half. 
   When the Republicans were in charge, I remember getting home at 10:30, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock at night from a hard day's work. And when the Democrats took over, I had to really kind of refocus on how to get back to my apartment because I had never seen the daylight hours. 
   So I want to ask the Democrats on the other side of the aisle, if you are going to say something, let's do it. Let's make sure that we do it, and that these are not just empty promises that you told the American people to get into the majority.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (REGULAR ORDER LACKING UNDER DEMOCRATS -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I just wanted to come back and talk a little bit more about the majority and the work schedule and the work ethics that they seem to be putting forth. I could come up and read my BlackBerry and my schedule to you. I don't know if that is exactly what our constituents had in mind, was electing us and paying us to come up here and go to receptions and go to dinners and travel around ourselves. That  is understandable. I think what they sent us up here to do was to do the people's business. 
   The gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) came up and talked about regular order. I just had to come back, Madam Speaker, to address regular order. I have almost forgotten what regular order is because since we have taken over, since the Democrats took over January 4, I guess we have had maybe this bill and one other bill that actually went through regular order. 
   We had an organizational meeting for my committees, and I think I have had one other meeting in one of the committees, two hearings or three hearings in another committee, not actually about any of the specific legislation.     
   In fact, the bills that have come to the floor have been taken out of two of the committees that I serve on to be brought directly to the floor without any kind of markup. 
   So I nicknamed this Congress, Madam Speaker, the smoke and mirrors Congress, and I think that they have done, and I am talking about the majority party that is in control now, have done a wonderful job with smoke and mirrors and fooling the American people. 
   We did a smoke and mirrors on the minimum wage. We did a smoke and mirrors on the war resolution. We have done several smoke and mirrors, and we continue to do smoke and mirrors. 
   It is just like the 5-day work week. They never address the 5-day work week. Where is the 5-day work week? Since the first week of January, we have had one 5-day work week. We may be going to have committee hearings, and we may be going to go to all these parties and receptions and other things, but when are we going to work? Because most of my constituents are at work right now. In fact, most of them, some of them, possibly started at 6 o'clock this morning. A lot of the airline people work a 5:00 a.m. shift. A lot of them start at 7:00, but we start at 10:00, and I have not had a hearing earlier than 10 o'clock, and today we finished the legislative business at 2:15. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I hear all these things, and I hear some good ideas, and I think the people do want us to work, but let us not campaign on one thing and then come to Washington and do something else. I think the people deserve more than that. 
   Also, I wanted to address the regular order thing. I am elected by 700,000 people in the Third District of Georgia, and they expect some representation up here, and I do my best to do that. They want a voice in the things that happen on this floor, but yet I have been unable to offer an amendment, unable to offer an amendment when the rules of the House clearly state that every Member of this body has the right to amend a piece of legislation. But when the Rules Committee meet, they waive that rule. 
   It is like the smoke and mirrors PAYGO that we got. People are like, oh, yeah, I like that PAYGO. They cannot increase the deficit or anything without making sure that the money is there to pay it. So, man, we love that PAYGO. The problem is that the Rules Committee, in the bill that came that involved that, waived that rule. Smoke and mirrors. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I am going to let people rest now. I see that Mrs. Blackburn is here to start her Special Order, but I just want the people, Madam Speaker, to understand that we are up here to do the people's business and not just to talk a good game, but to act a good game. So hopefully they will see that we want to earn ourself back into the majority, and they will have the confidence in us to lead this country once again.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS FOR LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I just wanted to start out by saying that I know that I can't talk directly to the American people, but I hope that if anyone is out there listening that they would listen to my comments that I make to you. 
   Madam Speaker, I guess about 2 weeks ago probably I started getting some phone calls about different petitions on the Internet and other places about the prospects of America becoming more energy independent, that we would not be dependent on foreign oil sources, and that we would be able to use our own natural resources to meet our energy needs. 
   And people began to ask if I had gone and signed them or had seen them. One was on americansolutions.com, which offered to increase domestic oil drilling. There was one about a gas holiday. There were several about developing alternative energy sources. But there were some interesting petitions against drilling by Democratic Senator Ms. BOXER, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. 
   As I walked into a service station in my district, there was a petition on the counter, Madam Speaker, that said: Sign here if you want to let your representatives know that you're for lowering gas prices. And I'm assuming that the proprietor of that station had it there to keep people from talking bad to him about the price that was on his pump. 
   But what I decided after looking at all these different petitions is that I would come up with a petition so the American people could understand where their representative was at. We know where our constituents are. I think on the American Solutions petition they are at like 1.7 million people. So we can kind of understand where the American people are at. They want us to be independent. They want us to increase our U.S. oil production. 
   So what I decided to do was come up with a petition, and what this petition says is: American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil online; bring deepwater oil online; and bring new refineries on online. Realize, we have not built a refinery in this country since the late 1970s.     
   And you may not realize this, because we're always talking about crude oil, but you might not realize that the United States imports 6.2 billion gallons of gas and 4.6 billion gallons of diesel every year. We import these from the United Kingdom, U.S. Virgin Islands, France, Canada, Netherlands, Norway--which, by the way, Norway is now the third largest exporter of crude oil, and back in 1965 they were energy dependent on foreign oil and they decided that they would open up to drilling in the North Sea. They are now the third largest exporter of crude oil. But we import refined gas from them--Germany, Russia, Italy, and of course the OPEC countries, which don't even really have that much refining capacity, Madam Speaker, but yet we buy refined gas from them. 
   So I got a petition, I've had it over here on the wall, Madam Speaker, for probably about 2 weeks now. There are 435 spaces for the Members, and then there are seven spaces for the delegates from the U.S. territories. And I'm happy to say that we've had 191 signatures. Now, this may be too simple for some people because all it says is, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' And so we need your help, Madam Speaker. We need you to sign. I don't think you're on it, Madam Speaker. 
   But we've got a Web site, and it's our Web site at house.gov/westmoreland. And on there we have everybody that has signed, and we have everybody that we've talked to that said they would not sign. So we've got two columns, we've got a signers and a non-signers. And then also, just to let you know, we have notified every office here at least once, we will do it again next week. And some people said have, well, Congressman, they ask me how long have you been working on this? And I say, well, about almost 2 weeks. Well, how come you only have 191 signatures? Well, Madam Speaker, I'd ask people that ask me that question, Sunday, when they're at church, try to talk to 450 people on a Sunday, it's almost hard to do, especially when you get in different conversations with folks. So if you want to understand, house.gov/westmoreland, Madam Speaker, that's where somebody would go if they wanted to see where their Congressman was at on this simple petition that basically just says, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' 
   I would like to yield some time to my friend from Indiana.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS FOR LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Indiana. And I want to get 300 signatures because I would like for the American people to know that way more than just a simple majority is behind them for making sure that, not necessarily those of us that are our age, but our children and our grandchildren will not have to go through the things that we're going through today. Because in 1995, this Congress passed drilling in ANWR and President Clinton vetoed it. And by all estimates today, 13 years later, we would be getting one million barrels of oil a day. 
   And as Senator Schumer said over in the Senate about 2 weeks ago, if we could get OPEC to increase oil production by one million barrels a day, it would lower the price of gas 50 cents a gallon just like that. 
   We don't need to be sending our President over to foreign countries--and especially those that are not that friendly to us--with hat in hand on bended knee asking them to use more of their natural resources to provide us with oil when we won't use our own natural resources. 
   In talking about that, because this is the one thing that gets people fired up, Madam Speaker, and really gets those lines hot, that they want to find out if their Congressman has signed this very simple one sentence, is that it says, ``In a recent interview on al Jazeera, Chavez''--now this is Hugo Chavez from Venezuela--``Chavez called for developing nations to unite against U.S. political and economic policies. What can we do regarding the imperialist power of the United States? We have no choice but to unite,'' he said. ``Venezuela's energy alliances with nations such as Cuba, which receives cheap oil, are an example of how we use oil in our war against neoliberalism,'' he said. Then there was another date, on March 15, 2005, in the Washington Post, Mr. Chavez says, ``We have invaded the United States, but with our oil.'' 
   Now, that would make your blood kind of boil, Madam Speaker, but this is what really gets people off is the fact that every day American families and businesses in this country write Hugo Chavez a check for $170 million. That $170 million could be going to our country. It could be going to provide energy independence. It could be going to provide jobs and build an industry, put into infrastructure; $170 million a day to Mr. Chavez. 
   Now, what we've been doing this week with the Democratic majority--and let me remind you, Madam Speaker, that it was back in April of 2006 that then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made a statement, and she said, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas.'' And at the time it was about $2.06 a gallon. We are waiting on that commonsense plan to be unveiled. We're waiting on it. And we heard that there were going to be about four energy bills this week. And Madam Speaker, the energy bills that were brought out this week was kind of like putting lipstick on a pig. 
   H.R. 6377, the speculation bill, this is what it says, ``to direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to utilize all its authority.'' In other words, we passed something that's already existing law. That's what we did, we passed something that was already existing law. 
   I want to read to you what happened in some quotes from H.R. 6. H.R. 6, Madam Speaker, was a bill that the new majority passed in January--I believe it was January 18, 2007--shortly after taking over, after they had promised the American people that they were going to lower gas prices. And I do want to read this one quote before I start reading these others. This is from PAUL KANJORSKI, and this was about 2 weeks ago. It said, ``A man was trying to question Mr. Kanjorski about his remarks that Democrats had overpromised during the 2006 congressional elections by implying that they could end the war if they controlled Congress.''     
   ``Now, anybody who is a good student of government would know that that wasn't true,'' Mr. Kanjorski said at an Ashley town hall meeting in August, ``but you know the temptation to want to win Congress back. We sort of stretched the facts, and people ate it up.'' 
   Yep, they ate it up. And right now they're paying a price for it. 
   I want to read you some quotes. These are from January 18, 2007, when we were debating H.R. 6: 
   Mr. PETER DEFAZIO: ``It is sad to see the Republicans come to this. Now they laughingly say that this will lead to higher gas prices.'' 
   Well, gas was $2.23 a gallon on the day Mr. DeFazio made his statement. It's about $4.08 today. So we were probably right. This was no way to lower gas pries. 
   The same day, January 18, 2007, Mr. JIM MCGOVERN said: ``What we are doing today really is responding to the outcry of the American people who are outraged by the fact that in the midst of being gouged by Big Oil ..... '' 
   Well, we have had seven investigations into price gouging, and it hasn't lowered the price of gas. In fact, it has gone up almost $2 a gallon since that statement was made. 
   The same day, JOHN HALL: ``Today we are going to take back the tax giveaways to Big Oil so we can give the American people a break at the pump.'' 
   January 18, floor statement, KATHY CASTOR: ``Instead of giving away billions of dollars to big oil companies which made multimillion dollar profits last year, the new Congress intends to  chart a course in a new direction by investing in alternatives for the American people. This will help America become energy independent and ultimately lower the utility costs for average Americans.'' 
   I would like to tell the gentlewoman that the price of natural gas is twice what it was.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank you for saying that because that's exactly true, and the petition is actually so simple, one line: ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower the price for Americans.'' And you can go to house.gov/westmoreland and see if the Congressman is there. 
   Madam Speaker, you would really have been intrigued at some of the things that I heard about why they couldn't sign it. 
   But I want to continue on. These are quotes from the H.R. 6 debate, which was on January 18 of 2007, after the new majority, the Democrats, had overpromised the American people, as admitted, and now they were coming up with something that was satisfying that radical environmentalist base of theirs, whom they felt like they owed their victory to, at least in part. So they were going to take away the tax breaks and other things. 
   I'm not a big fan of Big Oil. Don't get me wrong. But I had a high school economics teacher, and I didn't pay that much attention in school, but Colonel Wofford at Therrell High School there in Atlanta taught us that taxing manufacturers or producers does not lower the price to consumers. So for whatever that's worth, I will give that to the majority.

   January 18, and these are quotes from H.R. 6, which was their mantelpiece legislation. This was their commonsense plan, I guess, for bringing down the skyrocketing gas that at the time was $2.23 a gallon: 
   Ms. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE said: ``The price per barrel of oil is $50 plus.'' Today I think it's about $140. 
   She goes on to say: ``And so what is this Congress and this leadership doing? It is doing the right thing.'' 
   January 18, floor statement by Steve Israel: ``This dependence on foreign oil, Mr. Speaker, is a glaring threat to our national security.'' 
   I could not agree with you more. But we are more dependent today than we were when you made that statement. 
   Mr. JOHN LEWIS, my colleague from Georgia: ``More than ever we need to get our priorities straight. We need to stop dancing while Rome burns and reverse the damage we have done to our environment. The American people need relief from energy costs.'' 
   And I couldn't agree with you more, Mr. Lewis, but the problem is that gas has almost doubled since you made that statement.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Well, what I wanted to point out, this is what ANWR looks like. It's kind of a frozen tundra. I had some young people up here the other day from a school, and one of them asked me a question, said, Are you for drilling in ANWR? I said, Yes, I am. She kind of frowned. I said, Why? She said, I don't want you to ruin all the beautiful trees up there. 
   I tried to find a tree. I couldn't find a tree on the place. So there's a lot of  misunderstanding out there about what it is. Then you can look at the size of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and then the ANWR part as compared to the whole State of Alaska. A lot of people don't understand that Alaska--we have got a map of it somewhere--it's bigger than Texas. I know Mr. Conaway is here from Texas. Three times the size of Texas. 
   In fact, I will let Mr. Conaway talk about Texas and ANWR and other things, if he would like.

The real shame of this is when winter comes and natural gas is twice what it was. Mr. Peterson from Pennsylvania was down here the other night and really opened my eyes to it. Not only are people not going to be able to leave their home, they are not going to be able to stay warm in their home when the winter comes and the price of natural gas.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend for yielding. And I want to thank the chairwoman, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, for the job that she has done and for what Ranking Member Chabot has done, and the true bipartisan work and the good things that we have been able to do in the committee this year for small business. 
   But while we're talking about that, you know, we need to talk about the one threat that all small business people have come up to me in the last couple of weeks to talk about, and that is the price of fuel. Madam Chairman, I want to tell you that some of them feel like they have been lied to or maybe misled, because in 2006, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent out a memo that said, ``To Assist the Candidates.'' ``Demonstrate your dedication to fighting for middle class families by clearly explaining how you will work to keep down the price of gas if elected to Congress. Hold an event at a gas station or other logical locations where you call for a real commitment to bringing down gas prices, and pledge that as a Member of Congress you will fight for families in your district, not for oil and gas executives that the Republican Congress has fought for.'' And so they went out. 
   And maybe some people were misled because if you look at April 11, 2006, one of the candidates, Jason Altmire, who is on our committee, had a campaign that said, ``rising fuel costs'' that got Jason Altmire, the Democratic nominee for the Fourth Congressional District, calling for alternative fuel sources. ``Altmire made four stops Thursday in the district at gas stations all at prices for regular unleaded teetering at around $3 per gallon. The Democrat blames his opponent and President Bush for the rising fuel costs.'' The price for a barrel of fuel at this time, a barrel of oil is $57. You know, it's $119 today. 
   Small business people have been misled to think that the new majority was going to do something about fuel costs. It's time we have a public outcry that we do do something. If this secret plan is released, if the Pelosi premium is brought down, gas prices are at a record at this time of $3.50 a gallon.

   The fact that gas at the time that they were told this was $2.06 a gallon, oil was at $76 a barrel, today oil is at $119 a barrel, average price of gas is $3.50, they've been misled. And so what we want to do is see that commonsense plan brought to the floor, laid out, that we can all look at and maybe we can work towards. 
   And it's not just raising taxes, it's not buying or riding bicycles, it's not windmills, it's not solar panels, it's got to be less dependence on foreign oil. And we can only do that by using our natural resources to provide energy for this country.

   This one is made July 28, 2005, in a floor statement by Congressman Jim McDermott: 
   ``Republicans have written a bill that favors corporate America over mainstream America. Sixty dollars for a barrel of oil that breaks the backs and the budgets of mainstream Americans is a scandal.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I wonder what Mr. McDermott thinks about $119 a barrel of oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, on April 20, 2005, in a floor statement, then minority leader Nancy Pelosi said this: 
   ``The Republican energy bill is warmed-over stew of old provisions and outdated policies. Democrats have better ideas.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I challenge the Democrats to bring forth these better ideas because since the Democrats have taken control, gas prices are up over $1.25 a gallon. 
   Mr. Speaker, May 23, 2006, in a floor statement by Mr. Frank Pallone: 
   ``As Americans prepare to travel this weekend for the Memorial Day holiday, they should know that Democrats are offering real solutions.'' 
   Mr. Pallone, we need to see those solutions.

Mr. Speaker, according to rule IV, clause 4(a), the privileges of former Members on this floor, it states, ``is a registered lobbyist or an agent of a foreign principal, as those terms are defined in clause 5 of rule XXV.'' Is it true that if a former Member was a registered lobbyist or an agent of a foreign principal, that they could not be on the floor?

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for having this amendment. I have called this Congress the smoke-and-mirrors Congress because of the way the majority party has presented their case to the public, and it has been a process of smoke and mirrors. This seems to be a fuzzy math program. 
   If you have 7,000 section 8 homes in New Orleans, and it's funny, we haven't heard from the people in Mississippi or Florida or some of the other places. This is specifically for the New Orleans housing. Seven thousand section 8 homes. Only 5,000 of them were occupied before the hurricane, and now we are wanting to put all 7,000 back. Yet in New Orleans today, there are 500 that is uninhabited that they can't get people to come back to. So somewhere there is a need to help people that don't seem to be taking that first step to helping themselves. 
   We have people from New Orleans in Atlanta and in a lot of places in Georgia. If they want to go back to New Orleans, I am sure that we want them to be back in their hometown, and that probably the Federal Government would give them some assistance to get back to New Orleans and to know that there are 500 vacant section 8 houses for them to go to. 
   I think the other interesting thing is that if you were in a section 8 house prior to Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Katrina destroyed your home that you were living in under the section 8 program, then you would now be entitled to section 8 for the rest of your life. Maybe for the gentleman from Texas that we would need to say that anybody, and I feel sorry for these people, but anybody that has an unfortunate situation happen to them in their life, that they could come to the government and just give us a list of things that they would need for the rest of their life. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for offering this amendment, and I hope that this House will see fit to support it.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I almost feel like rather than offering an amendment that I need to ask everybody to stand up and we'll hold hands and sing Kumbaya, but I guess it's easy and people are in a good mood and very agreeable when you're talking about spending other people's money. 
   And in this case, we're talking about spending taxpayers' hard-earned dollars where we have very little control over how hard it is for them to make their money, but we spend it pretty easily. 
   This amendment takes $30 million out of the Corps of Engineers' investigation budget. It brings it down to the spending level that the President has requested in his budget request. 
   The Energy and Water appropriations bill is $1.1 billion over the President's request, and this amendment would reduce the funding for the investigation account under the Corps of Engineers by the $30 million, bringing it back down to the President's original request. 
   The investigations and construction funding is used to collect and study the basic information pertaining to local water projects such as flood and storm damage reduction. The funding is also used to restudy projects already authorized by Congress which can lead to additional Federal spending on local projects that have already received Federal funds. 
   Let me say that on some of these projects that we've heard about today from the delays, and Ranking Member Hobson mentioned the MOX project which has been delayed for a number of years, probably that's not only due to funding but in these additional restudies that the Corps of Engineers has had to do on the project. The Corps of Engineers has greatly expanded over the last decade. 
   In addition, according to the administration, the Corps already has a large backlog of ongoing construction work, and the President's budget limits funding for the study and design of additional projects. So, in other words, by limiting new Corps investigations, this amendment would ensure that the current Corps projects move forward at a pace to bring them to completion without further delays. 
   So far there has been at least a $105.5 billion in new Federal spending over the next 5 years that has been authorized by this new leadership, the democratically controlled Congress this year, in enacting the largest tax increase in American history, the Democrat budget allows for $23 billion in spending over the President's budget's request. 
   This amendment is designed to save the taxpayers $30 million, only a small amount, just a small dent, in the unnecessary increase in Federal spending this year, and this again is fueled by the largest tax increase in the history of this country. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I ask that all Members support this amendment. It is a small dent in the large increase in Federal spending.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would just like to comment on the chairman's comment about rules change every day. They do change every day, but when someone has based a project on the prior rules and regulations of the Corps, and they have based their whole project, and proceeded with that project, when the rules change and they come back to reinvestigate, that's no way to do business.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, this amendment would reduce the amount by $481,186,000. It's in the area of construction. 
   Last year, $2.37 billion was spent. The President requested $1.5 billion, and the proposed budget is a little over $2 billion. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have talked about the overspending, and we have just heard about the 404 permitting process and the regulatory process. Let me say that the Corps of Engineers is a great organization. They do a wonderful job. 
   The problem is that they have a general or colonel, depending on what area of the country it is, that rotates in or out, and what we are left with are life-long bureaucrats that control the Corps of Engineers. I appreciate listening to the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member and others as they have promised to get into speeding up the process and going through these regulations and making sure that these projects that are so important to our citizens move along at a pace and not impaired by just red tape and bureaucracy. 
   This construction area is somewhere that we have spent a lot of dollars. 
   The President came back, and as we mentioned in the last amendment that we had, and said, look, we have got such a backlog of projects already, why don't we make sure and get those out of the way before we go on to spending more money. 
   Let me say this, even though we may look at this as a construction, when you put more money into these agencies, it does nothing but build a bureaucracy and broaden the red tape that our citizens have to go through to deal with these agencies. 
   As I made the last comment on the last amendment, there has been at least $105 billion in new Federal spending over the next 5 years that has been authorized, and will be authorized by this new Democratic Congress, the leadership of this House. In enacting the largest tax increase in American history, this Democratic budget will allow for $23 billion in spending over what the President's budget request was.     
   We, as a party, as a former majority party, the Republican Party, understood that people got tired of their government growing at a rate so much faster than the population of this country and the excessive spending that we did. It's time for us to try to get back the confidence of the American people, not just Republicans, or the minority party, but Congress in general. The ratings of this Congress is at a record low, record low. 
   The majority seems to think that they've heard the voice last November of the American people. Well, I hope that they're listening to the voice now because their rating is even lower than what the Republican rating was last November. 
   But this amendment is designed to save the taxpayers about $480 million, and although, there again, the last amendment was just for $30 million, this one's for $481 million, it's just a small dent in the amount of money that we're spending here. But I think it is a small indication to the people of this country that we're willing to be wise stewards of their money. 
   So I ask all of the Members here today if they would support this amendment to reduce the construction in the Corps of Engineers by $481 million.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to point out to the ranking member that he's exactly right. And if you look at the bill, I think it will talk about that specific amounts of this money has been itemized to go to section 107 of the River Harbor Act of 1960; $45 million to go to the Flood Control Act of 1948; $10 million to go to the Flood Control Act of 1946; $25 million to go exclusively for projects of the Water Resource Development Act of 1986; $25 million for the Water Resource Act of 1996. This is all because we have continued to put money into construction, and I hope that what the ranking member was saying is that there's no new projects in here. And maybe this is to finish up some of the projects. Maybe we can go back and finish some of the projects of the 1946 act or the 1986 act.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I'm glad to hear that from the ranking member. 
   But let's have a start. Let's prioritize. Let's tell the Corps with this amendment that we're going to cut this money, and that we need to see a prioritization schedule from them on how we're going to spend it; that we're going to be responsible for taxpayers' money.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is it cuts $18 million from the $278 million authorized under this bill. It is a small cut. Although $278 million is already authorized in current law, it is what the President's request was; and even though we have looked at other amendments and, hopefully, the whole House will see to do some cuts, this appropriations bill is $1.1 billion over the President's request. So this $18 million simply brings back the President's request for the Mississippi River and Tributaries program. 
   The Mississippi River and Tributaries last year was $396.6 million in 2007. There has been plenty of money there, I think, to look at these harbors, look at the flood damage, look at the things that should be done there; and this is a mild decrease of the $18 million. 
   But let me again reiterate, as I did on the previous two amendments, that this is in addition to $105 billion in new Federal spending over the next 5 years that has been authorized by the new leadership in this House. It has been done by enacting the largest tax increase in American history. And this budget that we are looking at for 2008 allows $23 billion in new spending that will be funded by the largest tax increase in American history. This amendment, while being only $18 million, is a small dent. I can't believe that I have been in Congress long enough to say ``only $18 million,'' because that is more money than most American families will see in one lifetime or two lifetimes. It is just a small dent in this year's budget. And, Mr. Chairman, I hope that all Members will see their way to cut this amount of money out of this particular appropriations bill.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   I just wanted to make a few comments about my friend Mr. Ryan, who I listened to many nights, Mr. Chairman, while I was up in the chair where you're at. Many nights, I listened to the 30-something Group get up and rail and talk about all the wasteful spending and about how much money we were spending and about how we had gone into debt and about what the debt was. And I hear Mr. Ryan stand up and talk about economic development. I'm going to tell you the best bills this country has ever had for economic development was the Bush tax cuts. Those were the best economic bills we've had for economic development in this country. Look at where the Dow is today at 13,000-plus. I haven't been keeping up with it, I don't really have a lot of money in the market. But we have busted records continually, and it has been because of those economic growth tax cut bills that we have had and the economic policies of this White House. 
   And as my gentleman friend from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) said, we don't necessarily agree with the President's recommendation. We feel like that's probably more money than we need to spend. But at least it is a recommendation that we need to go back to from the proposal of what the Democratic leadership has proposed. 
   And you know, if you talk about striking any money from an agency's budget, I think you get their attention. The ranking member was telling me that when he was the chairman 2 years ago, he asked for the Corps to send 10 of their most important projects that need to be completed. He hasn't heard from them yet. And so we need to send a message to some of these agencies and say look, you are going to give us the information we want, you are going to be accountable, and you are going to be under some authority. 
   So, I think we need to send that message loud and clear. And although some of these cuts are mighty small, I think they will do a good job in getting some attention. I'm glad to see that the 30-something Group is now, and that the Blue Dogs, or whatever kind of dogs they are, that I listened to also, Mr. Chairman, when I was up there late at night, listened to them for hours at a time talk about wasteful spending, I hope that they will join me in an hour, in Special Orders, when we talk about the largest tax increase in the history of this country and the runaway spending that we now have, even larger spending than it was when we were in charge. I hope they will join me in that hour and we can get up and talk about being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply strikes $184,241,000 from operations and maintenance to the Corps. 
   The amendment would save $184 million, reducing the account from $2.655 billion to $2.471 billion. The account was funded at $1.97 billion in fiscal year 2007. The bill increases this amount by 34 percent over last year's funding level and the amendment would limit this increase to 25 percent. While I may feel this is still too much money, it at least brings some type of accountance that we would want to increase this 34 percent in 1 year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think as already testified today by many Members in talking about the bureaucracy, the red tape, the problems in prioritized spending, the lack of accountability, where better to make a difference and to make a change and to spend something than in the maintenance and operation of this agency. 
   We heard from the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Klein, talk about the problems that he had with regulations, and I know that Florida has a lot of different water problems and a lot of different Corps' interests down there. 
   I was pleased to hear Chairman Visclosky in his comments about bringing accountability to the Corps and bringing about accountability on this spending that seems to be run away. I really enjoyed talking to the ranking member about some of these problems that he has been addressing over the past years as chairman of this committee and how accountability needs to be brought to the attention of Members. 
   I don't know if I have mentioned it before, but this appropriations bill is $1.1 billion over the President's request. I don't know if I have mentioned it before, but there has been at least $105 billion in new Federal spending over the next 5 years that has been authorized by the new majority in this House, the Democratic leadership. And I don't know if I have mentioned it or not, but we have enacted the largest tax increase in American history. 
   This Democratic budget, and I don't know if I have mentioned this before or not, allows for $23 billion in new spending over that of the President's request. 
   And I want to just make a couple of other comments. Mr. Ryan had mentioned economic development. I just want to say that 6 years ago the Dow was at 10,690. Today it is at 13,632. That is a pretty nice increase, seeing how it came on the heels of 9/11, and I think and I believe Mr. Ryan quoted the fact that 7.8 million new jobs since this economic development tax cut legislation has gone into effect. That's more than Europe and Japan combined. 
   The President's policies, economic policies, have been working. And whether we agree with the amount of money that he has spent or not, the economic policies are working and tax cuts do work. 
   And so I would ask that we would send a message to the American taxpayers that we want to cut $184 million out of this bill that is already bloated, over $1.1 billion. And I think we also want to send a message to some of these departments that we are going to hold you accountable and we are going to make sure that you are responsible for the way you spend money and that you are accountable to this Congress, because we are directly accountable to the people who elect us to this position. 
   So I ask Members to support this amendment and keep in mind that last year it was $1.9 billion, that this year the President's request was $2.4 billion, and the proposal is for $2.6 billion.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would simply eliminate the $8.7 million for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program. The 2007 level was $8.7 million, and the President requested $5.9 million for fiscal year 2008. This would simply eliminate it. 
   These funds, this Native Hawaiian Housing fund, has been funded since 2002. So far there has been over $37 million going to the housing fund. 
   In the 2000 census, the Native Hawaiians, and there was approximately 750,000 Native Hawaiians, lived in homes on the island of Hawaii, the average medial value was $209,000. The Native Hawaiians that live in Georgia, and there is 2,200 of them by the 2000 census, their median value home was $111,000. 
   These grants can only go to Native Hawaiians on the islands of Hawaii. I believe that this is probably unconstitutional in the fact that we are doing a set-aside for a racial group, and so I just wanted to point that out. 
   It is a great opportunity to save some money. It is a great opportunity to look and make sure that we are all treated equally and that the 14th amendment of our Constitution is kept intact. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I missed in the rule book where you needed to call any Member or anything to discuss an amendment that you might have, and I apologize for not reading that chapter in the rule book. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, I think I was raised very appropriately from a family that had to watch their money. My father worked two jobs. He was an Atlanta firefighter, and he worked shifts. In one week he'd be gone, work at the fire department during the day and then he'd be home at night. And then the next week he worked surveying during the day and the fire station at night, so we didn't see him for a week at a time. And he would watch every dollar that he had, and I think he did a great job in raising me and my sister and providing for our family. 
   He never really asked for anything from the government, and so I guess that I'm very careful about some of the ways that we spend our money, and especially when it is on a program that I look at as a set-aside program. And whether the gentleman from Hawaii or the lady from Hawaii look at it as a set-aside or not, I don't know. That's their right. And I understand that they may know some things that I don't know. And I can just look at this as a Member of Congress and look at see what the Congresses have done in the past. 
   And for some reason, Mr. Chairman, the tendency for the majority party now is to tell me and other Members that stand up here and try to look after the taxpayers' dollars what the Republicans did. I don't care what the Republicans did. What they did, what other people did in the past doesn't make what we're doing today right or wrong. 
   And so all I'm doing is bringing up the point that this is a set-aside for somebody, for a group of people that are not Native Americans. They're not an Indian tribe. This is a race group, and that's as simple as it is. 
   Now, we can argue all the points that we want to argue, and the learned gentleman from Hawaii is a very smart guy. I know he's probably a doctor in sociology. And he can come down here and talk negatively about me if he wants to. That's his prerogative. 
   But I was asking a learned defense attorney one day, I said, you know, what does it feel like to have a client that you're trying to defend, and all the information and the facts are against you? 
   He said, you know what, you just have to really get up and talk as loud as you can and really be as mad as you can and really talk about anything other than the facts. And I know I've seen that on a couple of occasions here from different people. 
   And so all I'm asking is that we have a chance, in this House, to vote on this amendment. And I think it's fair that we vote on this amendment; that we vote on this amendment to try to decide if we want to give another $8.7 million, and regardless of what they've  gotten from the Republican Congress since 2002, that we could start anew. And so I think it's worthwhile that we can offer an amendment that we can have a vote on trying to take a special set-aside for a racial group to have something different than the rest of the people in this country have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The massive floods that devastated 20 counties in eastern Kansas this past June left thousands of residents out of their homes. Torrential thunderstorms pounded the area beginning on June 26 and continued for 4 days. In the end, the area was hit with 21 inches of rain, causing rivers to flood, forcing county-wide evacuations, schools and businesses to close, as well as causing a local oil refinery to overflow and release 71,000 gallons of crude oil into an already-flooded area. 
   The floods left one person dead and more than 3,100 homes and businesses destroyed or damaged. On June 30, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius declared a state of disaster for 17 counties, which President Bush later declared as Federal disasters. 
   Through the help of local, State and Federal officials and emergency personnel, evacuations were carried out quickly and safely. Order was maintained in the area with the help of the Kansas National Guard and the Kansas Highway Patrol. 
   It is important that we recognize the general support of the many volunteers, private and corporate donors, religious groups and other charitable organizations who assisted the communities in their time of need. The actions of many public servants, neighbors and community leaders helped thousands through this hardship. 
   This resolution expresses our sincere sympathy for the victims of this devastating storm. 
   Madam Speaker, I would give the gentleman from Kansas as much time as he may consume, my good friend (Mr. Tiahrt).

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Percy Sutton, a noted civil rights activist, lawyer and entrepreneur, has had numerous achievements in his lifetime. Today we honor Percy Sutton  with the naming of a post office in his hometown neighborhood of Harlem, New York. 
   Born in 1920 in San Antonio, Texas, he was the youngest of 15 children raised in a family with strong values in education. He found his niche at a young age with the Boy Scouts and rose to the rank of Eagle Scout. He attended Prairie View A&M University, Tuskegee Institute and Hampton Institute, and he earned his law degree from Brooklyn Law School. 
   As a teenager, he learned to fly small planes and worked as a stunt pilot at county fairs. Upon the U.S. involvement in World War II, he enlisted with the Army Air Corps but was rejected because of his race. Shortly after, he moved to New York where he was accepted into the Corps and flew with the legendary Tuskegee Airmen. His military service awarded him Combat Stars as an intelligence officer with the 332nd Fighter Group's Black 99th Pursuit Squadron. 
   Percy Sutton gained national recognition during the 1950s and 1960s as a close friend and lawyer to civil rights leader Malcolm X. Sutton had moved to the Harlem area of Manhattan and formed his own law firm with the help of his brother and a close friend. The area, as well as his firm, quickly became associated with the civil rights movement and current politics of the era. 
   Sutton ran unsuccessfully for public office, so he formed his own Democratic organization with other notable Harlem community leaders called the Harlem Clubhouse. He tried many cases during the 1960s defending the rights of many fellow African Americans in the Southern States. Still heavily interested in public service, he ran for and won an election to serve in the New York State Assembly in 1964. 
   His political career continued through the years and ended in the late 1970s. Over time and while still practicing law, he expanded his business by buying a radio station, the famous Apollo Theater, a local newspaper, and a cable television franchise. 
   Beyond his success in business, he has earned numerous awards for his charitable, civil rights and business achievements. Therefore, it is highly appropriate that we honor him with the naming of this post office. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Tragedy strikes every day as teen drivers, just on the cusp of adulthood, are killed at an alarming rate each year, causing grief and profound sadness for their families and communities. 
   Motor vehicle crashes continue to be the leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults in the United States. 
   In 2005, almost 7,500 drivers between the age of 15 and 20 were involved in fatal crashes across the United States. Many of these deaths are preventable, and it is imperative that we do all we can to improve the safety of our roads and highways for all drivers. 
   H. Con. Res. 165 supports the ideals and goals of National Teen Driver Safety Week, an important event that will go a long way towards educating our young people and their families about safe driving practices. 
   The statistics of teen driving are simply staggering. This age group makes up only 7 percent of licensed drivers but suffers 14 percent of fatalities and 20 percent of all reported accidents. 
   Based on miles driven, drivers between the ages of 16 and 19 have four times the mortality rate than drivers older than 25 and up. 
   Most important of all, the number of teen drivers on the road is expected to grow to over 32 million by 2010, meaning that, unless we take action, this tragic problem will only get worse. 
   National Teen Driver Safety Week seeks to reverse these alarming trends by concentrating national attention on the development and communication of effective interventions to help reduce crashes involving teen drivers. Teens will be taught about safe driver practices that will prevent many of these accidents from occurring. Efforts will be made to encourage teens to wear seatbelts, as nearly two-thirds of all teenagers killed in motor vehicle accidents have been reportedly not wearing seatbelts. 
   Finally, National Teen Driver Safety Week will echo other groups in warning about the dangers of drunk driving, nighttime fatigue and other use of electronic, handheld devices. By educating teens, along with their families, we can possibly make a lasting change in teen driving behavior that will lead to safer roads for all of us. 
   Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 165, supporting the goals of the National Teen Driver Safety Week. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I would just like to offer my condolences to the Gillmor family at this tragic time in their life. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am honored today to speak about a highly esteemed former Senator, distinguished war veteran, astronaut, businessman and educator, John Herschel Glenn, Jr. He is well-known throughout the history of this country through both his career in Congress and his legendary work with NASA. John Glenn has served his country profoundly for decades and remains an active leader in his community. 
   A lifelong resident of Ohio, he attended Muskingum College to study chemistry. Shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, he enrolled in the Naval Aviation Cadet Program and earned a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943. He served his country in World War II as a fighter pilot, flying 59 combat missions. 
   After returning to the U.S., he was transferred to the Naval Air Station, Maryland, where he has soon earned the rank of captain. His military service continued, and he saw battle in North China and Guam. He fought in the Korean War, participating in 63 air combat missions. His experience in combat fighting furthered as he attended additional flight training in Maryland. It was there that he tested flying planes at altitudes very high. 
   In 1957 he completed the first supersonic transcontinental flight, code named Project Bullet. This historic flight was one of many great achievements for John Glenn's career in aviation. 
   While still serving with the Marines Corps, Glenn was assigned to NASA as one of the legendary group of astronauts involved with Project Mercury. 
   As a member of this elite group of astronauts, Glenn piloted the first American manned orbital mission in 1962, which I remember very well. It was the third mission. 
   His mission brought him national fame and recognition as he was seen as an American hero. He resigned the NASA program in 1964 and one year later from the Marine Corps at the rank of colonel. 
   John Glenn entered the private sector working for Royal Crown Cola. But his passion for public service soon got the better of him and he decided to run for public office in 1964. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974 after years of campaign-related setbacks. He served in the Senate for 25 years. During his last term of office, he was invited by NASA to rejoin the space program that he had helped to create, therefore becoming the oldest person to travel into space at age 77. 
   Upon retiring from the Senate, he moved back to Ohio permanently, where he and his wife founded the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at Ohio State University. 
   The institute, which later became the John Glenn School of Public Affairs, educates and prepares students for careers in public and nonprivate sectors. Throughout his military career, his history with NASA, and upon retiring from the Senate, John Glenn has earned numerous prestigious awards, some of which include earning the Distinguished Flying Cross, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. 
   In 1990, he was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. It is with great pride that we continue to honor his service to this country, and to his community through the naming of this post office in his hometown. 
   Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise this afternoon, again, to pay tribute to another remarkable soldier and another true American hero. At the age of only 21, Staff Sergeant David Nord from Ferdinand, Indiana became a genuine war hero. On June 23, 1969, he was killed in Vietnam War action while serving with the U.S. Army. 
   Staff Sergeant Nord was born and raised in Ferdinand, Indiana, sharing his younger years with his one brother and three sisters. After graduating in 1967 from St. Ferdinand High School, he worked in the Ferdinand furniture factory. 
   Staff Sergeant Nord was drafted into the Army where he was assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Camp Blackhorse, Vietnam. With his positive attitude and hard work he rose quickly through the ranks and served as a scout section leader. After serving several months, Staff Sergeant Nord was granted a 21-day home leave, and it was during that time that he married Louann, his long-time girlfriend. Sadly, only three weeks after returning to the battlefield, he and most of his  crew were killed when a grenade hit the tank that he was commanding. He left behind his family, his new wife and a baby, David Lee II, who he never got to meet. Staff Sergeant Nord was also the first member of the Ferdinand Post 124 of the American Legion to be killed in action. He showed outstanding bravery, courageous leadership and heroism which earned him nine medals that were awarded to his family, his wife and his son after his death. The awarded medals were the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Vietnamese Campaign Ribbon, the Good Conduct Ribbon, the Combat Infantry Badge, National Defense Service Ribbon, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Expert Badge with Rifle Bar and the Sharp Shooter Badge with Rifle Bar. 
   It is for those reasons that we name this post office for Staff Sergeant David Nord in his hometown of Ferdinand, Indiana. And, Madam Speaker, I hope that all of our colleagues will vote for this unanimously. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   September has been recognized by the tourism industry as National Passport Month in an effort to educate the public and increase awareness of the importance of having passports. 
   The tourism industry brings in more than $80 billion annually to the U.S. economy. In helping our economy thrive, it also strengthens public diplomacy through each visitor. Similarly, Americans can improve foreign relations by traveling internationally and meeting with citizens of other countries. 
   The opportunities to learn different cultures, view history and exchange ideas are endless for those having passports. Interacting with the global community enables travelers to promote understanding and good will. 
   National Passport Month educates the public on the value and positive impact international travel has on individuals. Without passports, these opportunities could not be achieved. So, therefore, Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to support H. Res. 554.  
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (CAPTIVE PRIMATE SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I found some of the facts today pretty interesting about this monkey bill, this monkey business, Mr. Speaker. I've only been in Congress 4 years, I was in the State legislature 12 years, and I've never had a call about a monkey bite or monkey bites being rampant in my district. I'm sure that it's important. As my friend from Utah stated, don't be real alarmed that your Congress has brought this front and center, the first bill on the floor today in the House of Representatives. You can take comfort, because only one in 38 million, that's your chances of getting bit by a monkey today.     
   Now your chances are pretty good if you are driving a gasoline-powered car, when you pull into the service station, you are going to pay about $4.08 for gas. Now that's for sure. We need to be concentrating on that pain that you're feeling, not the pain of a monkey bite, but the pain at the gas pump that you're feeling. 
   And, you know, we're going to spend, as my friend from Utah said, a half million dollars per monkey bite in this country. Those are expensive monkey bites. Not only are they rare, and that may be the reason they're so expensive is they are so rare; but we could be spending that money towards drilling, towards exploring our own natural resources. 
   That's the reason I came up with a petition. I heard about all of these petitions on the Internet about where American citizens could go and sign a petition to let Congress know how they felt about high energy prices. And I thought, you know, why don't you come up with a petition that the Members of Congress can sign to let the people of America know how their Representative feels about the commonsense issue of providing our own resources. 
   So we came up with the American Energy Solutions for Lower Gas Prices, bring onshore oil online, bring deep water oil online, and bring new refineries online. And just to make it special, I made every Member of Congress a separate line on the petition. And what the petition says is: I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. And there are two pens on it. So I am going to invite everyone to sign it. 
   Mr. Speaker, today when we vote on the monkey bite bill, there will probably be a little over 400 Members, probably around 410 or 412, that will vote on the monkey bite, and I would hope that we would have that many signatures on this petition. There are 435 slots over here for people who have the ability and under the Constitution to vote on this floor, have an opportunity to sign that petition to let their constituents know that they are for commonsense energy practices. 
   You know, the keyword today, Mr. Speaker, in all of the campaigns you hear about is change. I think Americans do want change. I think our voters do want change. I don't know if it is the radical, rock-your-world, turn-everything-upside-down change that some of the candidates are talking about, but I think it is this kind of change, I think it is a change for honesty. I think the American people want to know where their Member or their elected official stands on the issues. And we make them so complicated that every Member of this body can go home and give a good reason why they voted for or against something. This simplifies it so the American people can see the honesty in their Member that says yes, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. That's simple. 
   The other thing they want is common sense. They want common sense. Common sense, Mr. Speaker, is to use our own natural resources rather than going into other countries in the world hat in hand begging for their natural resources. That's not common sense. It is not common sense to be in this body passing a law today about monkey bites when you have a 1 in 38 million chance of getting bit. Or that it is going to cost a half a million dollars per bite, that's not the kind of common sense, that's not the kind of change that American people are looking at. 
   What they're looking at is the commonsense change of us getting out of fetal position in this body, Mr. Speaker, and doing something to lower the price, to lower the pain for them at the gas pump, not reduce the pain from monkey bites.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from Utah. 
   I want to just address a couple of things that have been brought up; use it or lose it, drill it or lose it. That is already the law. That's already the law. 
   We have 68 million acres out of 2.5 billion. Now we talked about common sense, at least I talked about common sense, about what we are doing here. And, I'm sorry, I didn't have time to write down all of the dog bites. I noticed we were quoting all of the monkey bites. But what I will tell you as far as common sense goes, if you were an exploration company, if you were an oil company, would you drill where you knew that there was no oil? I would say no. But evidently the majority, the Democrats, believe that because you have 68 million acres of land, that you need to drill on it. Although 54 percent, 54 percent of the holes that were put in the ground for exploration between 2002 and 2007 were dry. So would you continue drilling on that 68 million acres out of 2.5 billion acres? I don't think so. I think that the American people with common sense would say, you know what, if there isn't oil there, why would you drill? 
   Do you go to the hardware store to buy groceries? I don't think the average American goes down to the hardware store looking for Quaker oats. He goes to a grocery store. 
   And so if you are going to be drilling for oil, the commonsense thing is that you would want to drill where oil is at. 
   We know how many barrels are under ANWR. We know how many barrels of shale, a trillion barrels of shale in the western United States, enough oil in ANWR to last us 50 years at the rate of what Saudi Arabia produces. So there is some common sense, and there is truth that there is 68 million acres leased. But the truth of it is half of the exploratory holes have been dry, so why would you want to continue to drill. 
   We need to open up new oil reserves and we need to make this to where companies want to go and explore for oil. We need to use our common sense and say we are not going to be dependent any longer on foreign oil in foreign places and foreign resources. Let's use our own resources. We have the technology to do it. We can do it in an environmentally safe way. 
   But it is time that the majority of this country is quit being held hostage at the gas pump for gas over $4 a gallon by a small, radical environmental group that is controlling the majority party in this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will bring some energy legislation to this floor rather than the monkey bite bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (LOWER GAS AND ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a moment, before I start with any of my energy remarks, to welcome President Chen, Joy and Sean Chen here with General Protecht that is opening up a business in my district in Barnesville, Georgia. It's great to have them visiting Washington, D.C. 
   What I really want to talk to the people about today, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that it is time that the American people understand where Congress is on providing them with our own resources to bring about lower gas prices and lower energy prices. 
   I have had several constituents and people e-mailing me and calling me, asking me about a number of petitions that were on the Web or that were in service stations or in Wal-Marts or in Home Depots, and they were wanting to know how I felt about drilling onshore, about drilling in deep water and about bringing more refineries on line. 
   So, as I looked at some of these petitions--and some of them I saw--one was on American solutions, and there were others, but the one on American solutions had about 600,000 signatories. Six hundred thousand Americans had taken the time to go to that Web site to sign the petition that said, ``Drill now. Drill here. Less price.'' Less gasoline price. 
   So I thought, you know, that's interesting because we know how these constituents feel, but do our constituents really know, Mr. Speaker, how Members of Congress feel? Because we do things up here to keep the American people from knowing exactly what we do think because we make these issues as to so many different subject matters that we can find excuses to vote for or against most any proposal that is brought to this floor. So what I want to do is simplify it, simplify it for the American people--for our constituents--and, Mr. Speaker, for the Members of Congress. 
   So I came up with a petition for this House of Representatives, and the petition is simple. The petition says: ``American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil on line. Bring deep water oil on line, and bring new refineries on line.'' 
   I've got a petition here. Don't worry. This is one board. We've got five boards. We've got every district, all 435 Members who can vote in this House. We've got a petition, and it says, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' How simple is that? That's pretty simple. 
   So what we've done is we've got this. Congressman Price and myself didn't bring it out until, really, after everybody had kind of gone home up here last Thursday, and we've already gotten 20 signatories. I've got two pens that I'm going to attach to these petitions. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to put them over here by the back door here on the minority side, and I'm going to invite every Member of Congress who believes that they would vote to reduce these prices to come by and sign them. 
   Just to give the American people, Mr. Speaker, a way to look at this, we are going to post, and are going to try to post in as real a time as we can, on different Web pages who has signed it. So, if you want to know who has signed so far, you can go to House.gov/Westmoreland, and you can also go to GOP.gov/energy. Now, these are two Web sites that are going to have posted by the end of the day who all has signed. If you, Mr. Speaker, or if anybody out there might want to know if your Congressman has signed, then you can go to that Web site. 
   We have had all different types of arguments in this House about energy, and the Democrats had an energy bill that they proposed and actually passed that President Bush signed into law in December of 2007. The Democratic majority passed this as one of their big issues in January of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from Utah for yielding. 
   It's quite interesting. I was listening to the rule debate, and the gentleman from New York said that the reason this was being brought up under a rule is to make sure that the process was open and that there were people who had amendments, and I just thought that was quite comical and more of the smoke-and-mirror thing that this majority has put forth. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 1100. This is a great opportunity for us to realize what an earmark is, whether it is recognized by the Chair as an earmark or not, what real pork is, and what a Federal land grab is. 
   This is designed to increase the National Park Service's land inventory. This is ironic considering that the National Park Service currently has an overall maintenance backlog for lands it currently owns. In fact, this very site, the Carl Sandburg National Historic Site, already has $600,000 in deferred maintenance cost itself. 
   The author of the bill said that this was a mission to allow the site. If my understanding is correct, you cannot even see the additional 115 acres from the home site itself. And I don't know if this is going to involve any landscaping or cutting down trees or grading costs or whatever, and maybe Mr. Sandburg did see this, but it must have been on a walk and not from his home. 
   This was not an original part of the Sandburg estate. And if you read the intent of the legislation when it was done, it was to preserve the farm, not to buy up all the surrounding land. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope that my colleagues will understand exactly what this bill is, that they will oppose it and join me in protecting the taxpayers' dollar.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, America began its relationship with the Dutch in 1609 when Captain Henry Hudson, searching for a faster route to Asia, sailed up what is now known as the Hudson River. Although he did not find his way to Asia, he and other Dutch traders quickly saw the potential and opportunity of this country and established the second European settlement in America named Fort Nassau near Albany, New York. 
   Their growth continued, and eventually a large portion of the early eastern United States was settled by the Dutch. The Dutch and the United States have proven to be extraordinary allies over the past 200 years, where in many instances they came to each other's aid at critical times in history. 
   Shortly after the Revolutionary War, the Netherlands presented a risky and courageous act by being the first country to salute the American flag. A few years later, on April 19, 1782, John Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague. He was the first U.S. envoy to the Netherlands and brokered the first loan for Congress from three banks in the Netherlands, which amounted to the entire U.S. foreign debt at that time. 
   Consequently, the Netherlands followed France to become the second country in the world to establish formal diplomatic relations with the United States. Also during this time, John Adams purchased a home that became the first American embassy on  foreign soil anywhere in the world. These ties still remain strong and, in fact, constitute one of the longest, unbroken diplomatic relationships between the United States and any foreign country right up until the present time. 
   The Netherlands have demonstrated its commitment to the United States, even in modern times, by being one of the first countries to ally itself with the U.S. after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was one of the first to assist in the war on terror; and in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, the Netherlands graciously provided Members of Congress access to their unique and innovative perspective on water management and flood protection. 
   I would also like to point out that Dutch Americans have contributed greatly to our fine country and have played a significant role in the life of America. This is exemplified by our three Presidents of Dutch descent, Presidents Martin van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. Dutch Americans have served at all levels of our government and have served us well in this distinguished body, including the two sponsors of this bill, Mr. Hoekstra, and my colleague on the committee, Mr. Van Hollen. 
   Dutch Americans and our rich history have many firsts with the Netherlands, and it continues to strengthen our tie with this true diplomatic friend working side by side with the United States to bring peace, freedom, and commerce in the world at large. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 89.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I am honored to speak today in support of H. Res. 198, recognizing the significance of Black History Month. 
   Each February we express our appreciation of the struggles, determination and perseverance of the African American community of the past and present. February is a time to recognize the contributions of black Americans that have enriched our culture and our heritage. 
   There have been great activists, politicians, artists, writers, poets, scientists, economists, athletes, entertainers and musicians that have all bettered our way of life. These achievements, the achievements of so many, have encouraged today's youth to strive for a more equal and free country. 
   It is impossible to celebrate Black History Month without mentioning such noted leaders as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks. These achievers, and others, have helped make this country what it is today. 
   Today's popular culture is replete with African American icons, through sports, music and the entertainment industry, icons such as Richard Pryor, Halle Berry, Tiger Woods, Arthur Ashe, Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, and Hank Aaron. 
   The music industry alone has influenced our culture for decades, Louis Armstrong, Dorothy Dandridge, Billie Holiday, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Georgia's own Ray Charles, each of whom overcame adversity before and during the civil rights movement just to play their music. 
   When Harvard scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson had the idea to create a week-long celebration of black history back in 1926, his goal was, and I quote, ``to make the world see the Negro as a participant rather than as a lay figure in history.'' Over time, it has become the month-long celebration and commemoration that it is today. It is with great pleasure that I speak today in support of H. Res. 198. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to join me in supporting this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today commemorates the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Founder Juliette Daisy Gordon Low organized the first Girl Scout meeting with 18 girls in Savannah, Georgia. While living in the United Kingdom, Low dreamed of giving the United States something for all girls and envisioned exposing girls to helping their communities and enjoying the outdoors. 
   The organization went through many different name changes, but it was finally renamed as we know it today in 1947. It was later chartered by the United States Congress on March 16, 1950. 
   For 95 years, the Girl Scout organization has provided real-world leadership training for over 50 million girls and young women across the Nation. Today, overall membership includes 2.7 million girl members and 928,000 adult members, working primarily as volunteers. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say  that my two oldest granddaughters are members of the Girl Scouts of America. 
   The important guidance given to girls goes far beyond the eagerly anticipated annual sale of Thin Mints, Tagalongs and Dos si Dos, now made without any trans fat. Through their various programs, the organization instills the ideals of character, conduct, leadership, as well as service to others. They have recently launched a program for girls focused on healthy living that includes education regarding diet and exercise. 
   This important education has been instituted because of the national concern about obesity among children and the knowledge that a program such as this has been proven to lead to emotional and physical well-being. 
   The Girl Scouts organization has long been committed to helping girls of today become leaders of tomorrow through activities that build self-confidence, responsibility, integrity, creative decision-making skills, and teamwork. It can be difficult growing up, especially in today's society. 
   The Girl Scouts is one organization that has consistently guided members to believe that girls can do anything by offering girls aged 5 through 17 a variety of opportunities through their scouting programs. 
   The Girl Scouts are woven into the fabric of American life and have affected girls' lives, as well as their families, in virtually every community in the country. Girl Scout programs continue to expand, taking into account the diverse population of America today. 
   They have initiated outreach programs that strive to include all cultures as part of their mission to foster the qualities on which the United States depends. The Girl Scouts not only reach out to girls in the United States but through U.S.A. Girl Scouts Overseas, it is committed to helping girls worldwide become leaders of tomorrow. Their new vision statement sums up all that is good about this organization by saying, ``Girl Scouting builds girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.'' 
   For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 136. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Alabama for yielding the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I've often said as I have stood up that when the process is broken, the product is flawed. And I appreciate all of the meetings that the chairman and ranking member and others have attended and the time that they have spent. There was only one hearing that I know of in the Financial Services Committee that was held before this bill, and that was to have Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke come and testify. Those were the only two witnesses. And I'm not sure what alternatives are out there, what the plans are for a free market, for capital infusion and not just buying these toxic assets. 
   And I think that's going to be the key to any plan working is the infusion of capital. But the process is broken because there was no markup on the bill. The bill was introduced about 24 hours ago. It's 106 pages. And as we saw earlier in the week with some of the tax extender bills and some of the other bills that were introduced early in the morning, brought to the floor early afternoon, had problems in it, having to recommit, redo the rules. 
   You cannot do this type of bailout of $700 billion without adequate hearings, without adequate testimony, without hearing other alternatives that can be injected into this that we could do some of the things as the net operating loss, how that can help a business. Doing away with the capital gains tax, the repatriation of money to come back into this country. The last time we did that, $350 billion came in. 
   These banks need cash. They need capital. They do not need somebody buying these assets when they still have mark-to-market. They still have accounting rules that don't allow them to have the amount of money they need to loan to small businesses and individuals to keep our economy going. 
   This is a rush. We need to defeat this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I felt compelled to say something after the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from New York talked about bureaucracy. It's easy to pick on bureaucracy. I ask any Member of this House that has talked to any constituencies, whether it's about a Social Security issue, a veterans' issue, Department of Homeland Security, FAA issue, to talk about it, and they will tell you that they had trouble with the bureaucracy, that they were having to call your office because they had trouble with the bureaucracy. This government has grown at a pace way beyond our population. 
   As we know, once somebody gets in a position in government, what they try to do is to expand that position, to get another secretary, to get an assistant secretary, an executive secretary, and so forth, because they are trying to build their power base. 
   So, yes, you ask any citizen that was affected by Katrina on the gulf coast if we have too much bureaucracy in our government, because a lot of those individuals down there that were hurt by that hurricane have yet to get assistance, or the full assistance they need, because of the bureaucracy in Washington D.C. So don't say that the bureaucracy is just something easy to pick on. 
   Let me say this. The gentleman from California is very earnest in wanting to get $10 million. Now, $10 million may not sound like a lot to a lot of people, but it's a lot of money. I will tell the gentleman from New York that commented on what was causing a deficit, yes, the war is causing the deficit, some part of the deficit. But what is causing the deficit, this is a moment of truth, is overspending, overspending. 
   Yes, the public did speak last November, and what they said is, you Republicans who have always stood up and said, government is too big and we have too much spending. Yet we were the ones up here increasing the size of government and spending too much money, it's time for us to reclaim the brand of being fiscal conservatives and watching after the taxpayers' dollars. That's exactly what this amendment from the gentleman from California does. 
   Our base, the Republican base, does not like to spend money or does not like to see government grow, because we think that the entrepreneurial spirit is that we can take care of ourselves better than the government can take care of us. The unfortunate side for our base is that the majority base thinks that the government can do a better job of looking after people than people themselves. 
   So that's the dilemma that we find ourselves in, that we have got one side that's trying to reclaim their brand, trying to make people realize that we really are who we say we are and doing the things that we are supposed to be doing in cutting the size of government and reducing spending. The other side is saying, here we are and here we are to take care of you.

   You want to listen to somebody that has expertise in this. And I don't think anybody has more expertise in intelligence than a local sheriff does, somebody that has been involved in trying to find some criminals. And the gentleman from Washington has certainly done that. He has brought his professionalism here to Washington.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Mr. Price. I appreciate you yielding your time to me. I appreciate you coming down here with the Truth Squad. 
   Sometimes the truth is many things to many people. But at the end of the day, it's still the truth. As you know, sometimes the truth is ugly. I thought one of the comments you were making about the war supplemental bill, the very truth of what took place to get that bill passed was very ugly. 
   In fact, this new ethical majority that came up, I felt, was pretty interesting, that, you know, one of the things was not leaving the vote held open to change the outcome, which we have seen several times, that it actually happened; the earmark reform, which is another smoke and mirror that has gone along. Then I think one of the other things was this big lobby reform about buying votes, and I think they called it a ``culture of corruption.'' 
   But I think what we have seen since January is actually an in-house culture of corruption and the fact that they had to buy 218 votes. So that's something that's unique to the situation, because, typically, you don't think about using other people's money to buy votes, but that's what they are doing. They are using the taxpayer dollar, and, like you said, Congressman, it's up into the billions now. I believe it was $20 billion that it cost them to get that 218 vote. 
   Let's talk about something else for a minute, because, I think the new majority party labeled the 109th Congress the do-nothing Congress, and we have labeled this, being the Truth Squad, and the honest people that we are, the smoke-and-mirrors Congress. 
   So I want to talk about some of the empty promises, some of the smoke and mirrors that we have all been talking about. One of the things we can all relate to is high gas prices. Mr. Price, it's hard to believe that we talk about the good old days of gas being $2 a gallon. But we don't have to go back that far to where gas was $2 a gallon. 
   I want to read a few quotes if I could, for you, to the people and to the Speaker. This was a quote: ``Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices ..... join Democrats who are working to lower gas prices now.'' This was a quote from now-Speaker Pelosi back in April of 2006, and I believe that gas was probably around $2 a gallon then. Now the Americans are paying $3.49 a gallon in California. That doesn't seem like that much of a reduction in the price of gas. In fact, it looks like almost 100 percent increase. 
   Another quote: ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices ..... we have offered legislation that would actually do something about the rise in gasoline prices ..... '' This is a quote from Mr. Hoyer. That was back in 2005. I don't know what the gas prices were then in Maryland, but I know today in Maryland they are $2.98 a gallon. 
   So these are some more empty promises; and not only empty promises, we got to see on some of the votes of the leadership, for the majority party, exactly how they vote. 
   If you look at the ANWR drilling, no, no, no. No, no, no. If you look at the refineries, where we wanted to expand our capability of our refineries, and be able to refine more oil, no, no, no. I am anxious, aren't you, to see what their result is going to be? I am ready for the answer. 
   They have left us hanging long enough. They have left us hanging for 2 years, and 1 year, as to what their answer is going to be to relieve these gas prices, to lower them. If anything, since the election in 2006, the gas prices have gone straight up. 
   So, you know, either they don't want to do what it takes to lower the gas prices, they don't know what it will take to lower the gas prices, or the very economic policies they have adopted in this 110th Congress have caused the gas prices to go up.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I found two more quotes I found interesting: ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices.'' Now, this is Mr. Jim Clyburn from South Carolina who said that on July 6 of 2006. Gas prices in South Carolina are now $2.81. 
   There is another one that says: ``With gasoline and other prices rising, America's middle-class families deserve better ..... Nobody thinks $2.50 a gallon is cheap; it's still expensive.'' Now that came from the Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel on June 2 of 2006. So, evidently, gas prices  were around $2.50 then. Now, in Illinois, they are $3.23. 
   So, do you think, being the Truth Squad, that this could just be smoke and mirrors to get people to believe that they had some kind of answer to reduce these gas prices to make Americans make it easier for us to meet our energy needs here within this country, without going to foreign imports? 
   So that seems to be the indication that this is just more smoke and mirrors that the 110th Congress, then the minority, was telling the American public to become the majority. It's kind of like a barking dog behind the fence. As long as that dog is behind the fence, he is going to bark and say and do things to make you think he is going to get out and get something done. But when you open that gate he becomes a little whimpering Chihuahua, does nothing. I think that's what we see in here, a bunch of little Chihuahuas whimpering around. 
   I do thank you. I thank you for your time. I think the gentlelady from Tennessee may want to add something to that. I appreciate the opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I feel like Bill Murray in ``Groundhog Day,'' the movie. I've only been in Congress for 3 years, but my respect for Mr. Abercrombie has grown. I try to take experiences with people I have differences with and learn. He is one of the most patient people that I have seen up here, and the fact that he took a big problem and has ate it just a little at a time, I admire that. And I want him to know how much respect I do have for him for his tenaciousness, and I hope I can be just as tenacious with things that are important to my constituents as he has been and also the gentlewoman from Hawaii. 
   Let me say that from what we have heard today, it reminds me of a story of some gentlemen down in the Okefenokee swamp that were going coon hunting. If you're not familiar with coon hunting, you use dogs and you go at night, typically build a campfire, and you all sit around and talk and gossip and share stories and some other activities sometimes while you're waiting for the dog to tree. One night this old World War I veteran was down there in the Okefenokee, and he had a wooden peg leg. It was pretty cold that night, and the dogs were out running; so he laid down and he got a little too close to the campfire and he burned off about 6 inches of that wooden leg. Well, when the dog started barking and they had really treed the coon, he was the first one up. And he got up, and he said, ``Come on, boys. Old Sam has treed one.'' And he started running off across the field with that one leg about 6 inches shorter. And after two or three steps, he turned around and he said, ``Watch out, boys. There's a hole every other step.'' 
   Well, there are a few holes in this, and I want to try to plug up those holes today as far as what the ability of Congress is able to do and what our Constitution says. 
   So I rise today to oppose the legislation. I want to try to go into what this bill actually does and how it relates to what I feel like our Constitution says and what the limits of our Congress is. 
   Every aspect of this bill from its goal to its methods, I think, undermines the  idea that we are one that has come from many people. I think the legislation is divisive and will give a group of U.S. citizens special rights over other citizens based solely on race. 
   Our Constitution seeks to eliminate racial separation, not promote it. How can we promote equality while separating our people? 
   Some people here today have characterized this legislation as nothing more than a kind gesture to Native Hawaiians. This is not the case. This bill will not only create a new race-based government but it will allow rights and privileges to Native Hawaiian descendants throughout the United States that their neighbors and friends throughout this country do not enjoy. 
   The Federal Government today will decide what is best for 20 percent of the Hawaiians who have Native Hawaiian ancestry. The Federal Government should not and cannot create a new Indian tribe for ethnic Hawaiians. Congress does not have this power. The Bush administration has rightly promised to veto the bill if it passes because it will ``discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people.'' 
   This attempt to divide America sets a frightening precedent for separating groups of Americans based on racial backgrounds. This bill is irresponsible, I believe, and simply unconstitutional. 
   My good friend from Oklahoma got up and spoke about that the leaders of the State want this legislation. Well, in 2006 there was a survey done of the Hawaiian people by a nonpartisan grassroots institute of Hawaii that found that 69.89 percent of Hawaii's residents want to vote on a Native Hawaiian government before it is considered at the national level, and 80.16 of Hawaii's residents do not support laws that provide preferences for people groups based on their race; 68.3 percent of residents in the First Congressional District, Mr. Abercrombie's district, want that vote; and 66.95 percent of the entire State opposed the 2006 bill to create a Native Hawaiian government.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to honor the memory of a great American, Felix Sparks, who recently passed away at the age of 90. Mr. Sparks' commitment to our country began in 1940 when he joined the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Division. He would go on to fight bravely in World War II, earning a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts. During the war, he even helped liberate 30,000 people from the infamous Dachau concentration camp. 
   Upon returning to the States, Felix and his wife, Mary, settled in Colorado. Still wanting to continue his service to our country, he then joined the National Guard. He would remain active in the Guard until 1970, when he retired as a brigadier general. 
   Besides his exemplary military service record, Mr. Sparks also excelled as a civilian. He had a brilliant legal mind. This was reflected in his appointment to the supreme court of Colorado at the age of 38, making him the youngest justice in the State's history. 
   His expertise was water law, which he applied as director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board for over two decades. 
   Considering his years of selfless public service to his State and to his country, I believe it is a fitting tribute to name a post office in Colorado in his honor. Hopefully, his life will serve as an example to others to follow.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today to honor the memory of Army Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce, a true American hero. 
   Larry Pierce was raised in Taft, California. He would have graduated from Taft Union High School in 1959, but he chose to enlist in the Army in 1958. Seven years later, having achieved the rank of staff sergeant, Larry found himself in Vietnam as the squad leader of a reconnaissance platoon. On September 20, 1965, his squad was on patrol when it was ambushed by hostile forces. Thanks to Staff Sergeant Pierce's leadership and courage, the squad successfully repelled the attack, driving the enemy away. While in pursuit of the enemy, Pierce's squad came across a dirt road. It was on this road Sergeant Pierce discovered an anti-personnel mine. Knowing it would destroy the majority of his squad who was not aware of its presence, Sergeant Pierce threw himself completely on top of the mine. In this act of unbelievable bravery, Sergeant Pierce saved the lives of all his squad, while sacrificing his own. For his actions he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He left behind a wife and three children. 
   Sergeant Pierce represents the very best in the tradition of service and selflessness of our Armed Forces. It is fitting that we name this post office in his hometown of Taft, California, in his honor. Surely, his story can live as an example of what it truly means to be a hero.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, this bill that was introduced last night at 9:45 has the same MO as the other lies that the Democratic Party have told the American people. 
   I quote here from A Congress Working for all Americans, something put out by the then-Democratic minority trying to become the majority. ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process.'' More smoke and mirrors to get elected. 
   In fact, Mr. Paul Kanjorski stated it best when he was talking to a reporter about the promises the Democrats made on the campaign trail, ``We sort of stretched the truth, and people ate it up.'' They have stretched the truth. 
   Speaker Pelosi in April 2006, said, we have a plan to lower the skyrocketing price gas prices. It was $2.06 at the time. Now, as you know, it's over $4. 
   But Mr. DeFazio from Oregon told the truth. He said, ``It is sad to see the Republicans come to this.'' Now they laughingly say this will lead to higher prices. 
   The energy bill they passed in January of 2007 has caused gas prices to double. This is a sham.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Florida for yielding, and when I came to the floor today, I didn't come here to speak; but, you know, my father was a fireman for 26 years for the City of Atlanta. In fact, he died in an alarm. I know what it is like for these firefighters to answer the alarms. He suffered a heart attack while turning off an OS&Y valve in a pit. It was 18 degrees that December morning. I know what it is like for those firefighters. But, you know, my father never belonged to a firefighters union, and that is what this is. This is basically a union bill and payback to the unions. 
   But, you know, Georgia is a right-to-work State. We have a 10th amendment to our Constitution. I was very disappointed to hear from the chairman that this thing passed out of committee 42-1. That breaks my heart. That really breaks my heart that those Republicans were on that side. I don't know what the majority thinks about the 10th amendment, but I believe very strongly in it. This has something to do with States rights. And I am sorry and I am very disappointed that this House will do this under suspension and there won't be any opportunity for amendments or this thing to be looked at.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank my friend from New Jersey for offering this amendment because I did not know that this would open up the types of discussions that it has, but I think it's great for this body. 
   My friend from Ohio, Mr. Ryan, who, Mr. Chairman, I stood up on that podium and listened to many nights with the 30-something group, that talked about the spending of the Republicans, I hope he will come back now and talk about the largest tax increase in the history of this country. He talked about dividing Members, and I stood there, Mr. Chairman, right where you're at, and I listened to the rhetoric that was designed to divide Members. 
   And talking about a spending and what's a good investment, I don't know when we were in the majority party why the things we weren't doing wasn't a good investment. Now, all of the sudden spending $11 billion more than the President's recommendation is a good investment. So spending more money is a good investment, and he's talking about that we borrowed money from foreign countries. I don't agree with that, but you know what, they probably won't borrow money from a foreign country. You know what they're going to do, Mr. Chairman? They're going to go up on your taxes. They have passed and are passing appropriations bills, other pieces of legislation that's going to cause this country to have the largest tax increase in history. 
   So I want to thank him for bringing this up, and I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for bringing this up because this is a perfect example that we have to prioritize, and we all have different ideas about prioritizing. We all have different ideas about who's writing a budget, if it's a good investment or if it's wasteful spending. 
   So, I support the gentleman's amendment because I don't think that those children in Alaska, regardless if a Member of my party says it or not, or the children of Hawaii need special exception and more money than my kids, my special need kids in the Third District of Georgia. 
   So I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding, and I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment. We've listened to the other side talk about, I guess, some of us maybe being disingenuous or doing different things with this amendment. And the gentleman from Ohio talked about a fringe group over here, and I'm happy to be part of that fringe group. The Republican Study Committee I guess is who he was talking about in that we're trying to look after the taxpayers' money. 
   For the past 12 years, I would have to admit, although I've only been here three of those years, that we spent too much money. We expanded government too much, and we didn't do what we should have been doing. But it's good, because I think a lot of people woke up after the last election and realized that we had lost our brand of being fiscal conservatives, being responsible with the taxpayers' money, because it's not our money, it's their money, they work hard for it every day, and that we need to be more responsible with it. 
   And I think that the President got that message. And in this budget, he cut the funding for the writing instruction. It's $23.5 million, or a very, very small percentage of the $152 billion budget that the majority party is offering for this appropriations bill, which is $11 billion more than the President offered. And, you know, it doesn't hurt to zero a program out if it's not working or not doing its job, or if the money can better be spent somewhere else in a different program, something that has more advantages for more people. 
   Under titles II, III and IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Federal Government provides extensive support to States and operates numerous programs designed to enhance teacher recruiting and training. 
   While many of these programs provide important services, States would be well served to receive this funding in the form of a block grant with increased flexibility to use these funds on the programs most needed in that State. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know from talking to my local school board superintendents and school board members that they certainly agree with that. No Child Left Behind, while working in a lot of situations, has cost them more money, really, to implement those programs than they receive in Federal dollars because a lot of that money is, has to be spent in a certain area. 
   This would be an opportunity that we could take this very, very small amount out. The President recommended a zero. It was funded at $21.7 million last year, so there's been a 10 percent increase this year, and just zero the program out. 
   And so it's a pretty simple amendment. It puts back the writing instruction program back to zero, where the President put it, and I hope that my colleagues will finally decide, let's vote for one thing that actually cuts something. 
   I know one appropriations bill, Mr. Chairman, we were talking about, and I believe the chairman of the committee said they had cut 250 programs. And I asked for a list of those programs. Haven't received it yet. So, hopefully this will encourage him to support this amendment, because it is zeroing out a program, and also get me the list of the other 250 programs that this Congress has cut so far this year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you. 
   And while I stand to ask the Members to also support this legislation that the gentlelady from Guam has introduced, I think it's interesting, though, that we're here today talking about the carcasses of sharks, Mr. Speaker. We debated the other day on the floor monkey bites, and we have had some quite interesting conversations on the floor about legislation that's important and important to the American people. 
   But I find that the one subject that we're not talking about on the floor of the House, or at least not being able to debate on the floor of the House and have had any legislation come forward on the floor of the House that we could really debate and get into a debate and talk about statistics and reality is the fact of drilling and becoming more energy independent. That is something, I think, that is concerning most houses and most families right now. 
   And the fact that, Mr. Speaker, the price of a gallon of gas is $4.11, $4.11, that's a sticker shock that we can't seem to get our head around and get  our hands on is that a gallon of gas today is costing $4.11. And the reason it's costing $4.11 is because we are still completely dependent on foreign oil. 
   Now, while I know that there are a lot of people at home sitting around considering what their chances of getting bitten by a monkey might be or their care and real concern about a shark carcass, I think they're more concerned about a gallon of gas, the price of that. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I would encourage you to encourage the rest of the members of the majority party, those that are in control, to have a good discussion, a good debate on a piece of legislation that would allow drilling on our Outer Continental Shelf in the areas of the West that have shale oil, off the coast of Alaska, and ANWR where we know that there are billions of gallons of gas. And not only that, but we're fixing to be in a natural gas crisis. 
   Natural gas is about twice what it was, I believe, last year, and if that's the case, people are not going be able to heat their homes. And so while we think that driving is expensive now with gas at $4.11 a gallon, imagine having home heating oil or natural gas to heat your house for your family and your bill is going to be twice as high as it was. Well, Mr. Speaker, you won't even be able to drive to a warm place. 
   And so these are some concerns that we need to be talking about now. Not only are we into the immediate crisis of high prices of gas, but we're in the crisis to come of our home heating oil and natural gas. 
   So I hope that while we take these things serious about the carcasses of these sharks, chances of getting bit by a monkey, that we would consider our dependence on foreign oil and what we can do to become self-dependent. It's all of the above. It's going to take some conservation, but we cannot conserve our way out of this. It's going to take looking at new technologies for wind and for solar. But we cannot build enough solar panels nor enough windmills to supply this country with its energy needs. 
   We don't need to be doing away with our coal-fired plants because 85 percent of the power of this country, Mr. Speaker, comes from those coal-fired plants. We need to be looking at new exploration, new ways to increase the oil production of this country so that we might be more energy independent and not so dependent on the people around this world who are mainly and most of the time not our friends, Mr. Speaker. 
   So I hope you will take that message back--and I know you will--to the majority and hopefully we can bring forth some legislation that we can discuss and see if we can't get gas prices down for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Guam and her comments about bipartisan and working together and coming up with a common solution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am all for that, but what we've come up with in the past is very limited debate. We've had bills come to the floor with no amendments. We've had bills come to this floor that had no committee hearings. Now, that, to me, is not working together or with bipartisan support. 
   So, if we want to have this bipartisan discussion, let's have it on the floor. Let's have an open rule on an energy bill, an open rule energy bill. What a great way to preserve what this body was meant to be, a place where representatives of the people came to debate and discuss and to talk about things that were affecting their constituents. 
   But half the people in America who are represented by Republicans in this body have not had an opportunity to even offer an amendment to some of these energy bills. We've not even had an opportunity to come down and speak on this floor because of the limited debate. 
   If we want to work out a solution, if we want to hear all the ideas from all 435 Members of this, so all the people in this country can have some input into this process, let's have an open energy bill that went through regular order and went through the subcommittee and the committee process, had a rule that was written where we could all have some input.     
   I'm for that kind of bipartisan support, and I know you are too because you are a very sweet lady. 
   Now, let me go on to say one thing: There was a poll that came out today I thought was very interesting. The percentage of voters who give Congress good or excellent ratings has fallen to single digits for the first time in Rasmussen reporting tracking history. 
   This month, just 9 percent say Congress is doing a good or excellent job. Mr. Speaker, I think we need to form a committee to go find that 9 percent of the people to find out where they've been because we are not doing a good job, we are not doing an excellent job. We are doing a very poor job of addressing the needs of the American people and what's affecting their pocketbook and the ability for their family to survive today. 
   We've got gasoline that is up $1.76 a gallon since the end of 2006. A loaf of bread is up 23 cents, or about 23 percent, than what it was at the end of 2006. A gallon of milk is up almost 30 percent, Mr. Speaker, since the new majority came in. The Dow Jones has lost about 20 percent. The stock market is down $53 billion in the wealth of the stock market. Real net worth is down $2.51 trillion. The real per capita gross domestic product is down. Inflation rate is up. Unemployment rate is up. The real average wage is down, Mr. Speaker. We are not doing a good job. 
   Part of the reason that bread is high, that milk is high, that the stock market is going down, that inflation is up is because of the oil crisis that we're in right now because we are totally dependent on foreign oil. And I would like to close with this, as a quote from the Department of Minerals Management Service that's in the Interior Department. The director says, ``The agency estimates that offshore drilling could produce 1.8 billion barrels of oil and 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.'' And we're going to need that natural gas, Mr. Speaker, when these home heating oil and natural gas bills come due for people trying to stay warm this winter. The director would not say how much more oil and gas he thinks the lands could produce, but he said that experience has shown that once companies begin drilling on land, they often find more than expected. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have about 2.5 billion acres of Federal land and offshore that we could be drilling on; 68 million of that has leases that oil companies have leased. And we certainly--and I say we, I'm talking about the minority--do not think that Big Oil does not play some part in this. But the reality of it is we cannot expect Big Oil to go out and drill on leased land that has no oil or no gas. You do not go grocery shopping at a hardware store. 
   We need to open up this land that is available, that the Department of Interior, that the Minerals and Management Service says that there is gas and oil there. We need to open up this land to let people drill on, to let people get our natural resources out of the ground rather than us being dependent on going to foreign countries on bended knee with hat in hand asking them to sell us their natural resources when we refuse to use our own.  
   So Mr. Speaker, I will close with this, that we do want to work. We want a bipartisan solution. Because we think the answer is all of the above, it's more conservation, it's more use of wind and solar, but it's also drilling. It's also using our own natural resources. It's using clean coal. It's using an environmentally sensitive way to get this natural resource out of the ground. And we welcome an open rule bill that comes to the floor that all 435 people and the seven delegates that represent people in our territories and our States in this great country that we live in, to come have an open, honest debate about what we can do to solve our energy policy, to come together, to work together. That's the kind of change that the American people want, not the radical kind of change that has been offered so far in this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend for yielding again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I got the whip report today and was looking over some of the bills that we're going to be going over today and this week. And I felt like, Mr. Speaker, it might be good just to remind our colleagues maybe of what all we're going to be doing this week so they can get their staffs down and start looking at this real hard. 
   I was hoping that we might be talking about some ways to improve our energy management because what has happened so far on this House floor by the majority has simply not worked. We voted, I guess, almost 6 weeks ago now, to stop sending oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and so thus far I believe, today is July 8; so at 70,000 barrels of oil a day, that's over half a million barrels of oil that we have kept from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and yet gas is at a new record of $4.11 a gallon. So that's not working. 
   The energy bill that the majority passed in January of 2007, which we called the ``No Energy Policy,'' has actually turned out to be a no energy policy because gas has gone from $2.35 a gallon to $4.11 a gallon. And light bulbs, or the CFLs, was mentioned over 350 times in that bill, and we have now learned that you can't dispose of those things because of the mercury in them, and they are only produced in China. 
   So we have got a long way to go on correcting our energy situation in this Congress, and for some reason the majority just keeps turning its head. 
   But I just felt like for some of our colleagues that are listening today they might know that we have already heard today that we amended High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act. We're going to get a chance to vote today to authorize the Preserve America Program and Save America's Treasures. We are now authorizing the Secretary of Interior to lease a portion of the visitor center to be constructed outside the boundary of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in Porter County, Indiana. I know that's a big one. You all need to be looking at that, Mr. Speaker. 
   Number four, to amend the Dayton Aviation Heritage Preservation Act of 1992 to add sites to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Park, and I know that's an important piece of legislation. We're also going to do the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act. And we're going to name three post offices today. 
   Now, tomorrow we are going to get into the real meat of some of this stuff. We've got 12 more suspensions, which are bills that really just come to the floor with about 20 minutes of debate, I believe, on either side, no amendments, not structured to any rule. We are going to look at the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act, and I know, Mr. Speaker, these people at home will be glad to know that we're doing that. And then we have got to  honor the goal of the International Year of Astronomy; celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first American woman in space, Dr. Sally Ride; the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act; commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Space Foundation; commemorating the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Homes For Heroes Act; America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act; Community Building Code Amendment Grant Act; Lead-Safe Housing for Kids; and Money Services Business Act. 
   And then we have got one real bill that's going to be subject to a rule, Mr. Speaker: the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act. So any Members listening to this might want to get their amendments ready for that, and I don't know if we can amend that to talk about energy. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I just thought it was important that we discuss here among ourselves what we are doing in this Congress this week. People are paying $4.11 a gallon for gas at the pump. People are having to make decisions about whether they can go to work or go visit a loved one in a hospital. We need to be discussing our energy crisis because this is not something that just happened. 
   And, look, we are not innocent in this. We had 12 years. We could have led the charge. But I remember back in April of 2006, then minority leader, now Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, said, ``Elect us. The Democrats have a commonsense plan for lowering the skyrocketing price of gasoline.'' 
   Please bring out that plan, Mr. Speaker. Bring out that commonsense plan so that we can see what can lower the skyrocketing prices because since that plan has not been revealed, gas has gone from $2.35 to $4.11. 
   So while we are talking about all these important things today, and I know the American people are sitting on the edge of their seat to see if these things pass or not because of the effect it's going to have on their lives, I think if they could honestly have a good, bipartisan debate with an open rule, a good energy bill that all the people could come that represent the people all over this country to come in and discuss what we can do to give them relief at the pump.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my colleague for yielding to me. 
   Just to my good friend from Guam, I don't have a problem with what you said because it sounds like we have had a bite of the apple, the new majority has had a bite of the apple. People have seen their gas prices continue to go up. So why not come up with a bill that we could put on the floor, to have an open rule, because there is nothing more important in this country right now, not just because the price of gasoline is $4.11 a gallon. This is a national security issue. We are writing Hugo Chavez a check to the Venezuelans for $170 million a day. This is a national security issue. This is an economic issue that we are talking about. This is affecting our stock market. This is affecting our gross national product. This is affecting a loaf of bread. This is affecting a gallon of milk. This is something we need to be talking about. 
   So I'm glad to hear that you've taken notice that our plan of 2005 has not been totally successful because it has not been totally implemented yet. But I am more than willing to have a discussion on this floor, open rule, energy package. Let's write one. Let's let it go through regular order. Let's let it have amendments. Let's let it have discussion. And I think if we could do that, then we maybe could come up with something that could succeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, Lord, I don't even know where to start. I've sat here for the last 45 minutes and listened to the Blue Dogs. And I appreciate them very much because there's about 40 or so of them, I think, and they could do a lot to help us, Madam Speaker, with the energy problem. I just hope that they will stand fast. 
   I listened to my colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Ross). And I'm on his bill because it brings about more energy independence for this country, Madam Speaker. And it's interesting that the Blue Dogs talked a lot about all the things that we have done thus far, at least that the Democrats have done thus far, the majority, Madam Speaker. And I don't even know how to start to unravel some of the facts that have been laid out here tonight. There were some facts that I agree with, but there are some facts that are very, very misunderstood, and hopefully during this hour sometime, Madam Speaker, we can put some truth into it. 
   It's interesting that I heard some of the Blue Dogs talking about increasing oil production. And I know that in May of 2007 there was an amendment that we passed that prohibits us from drilling shale oil, where there's two trillion barrels of oil. Two of the speakers here tonight voted for that amendment to keep us locked out of that acreage out west where the shale oil is. 
   And Madam Speaker, if people could see this chart, May of 2007 is when the biggest spike in the oil prices happened. And I think that's a time when the speculators saw that this Congress was not going to do anything about our own oil production. We refused to do it. And I think the speculators took great advantage of this and said this is a country that's not going to look to their own resources, they're going to be totally dependent on foreign oil, so we'll do with them as we wish. 
   What has happened over the past, I guess, 3 or 4 weeks is people have been calling our office and calling me, Madam Speaker, and asking me if I had signed a petition; there have been several of them on the web page about ``drill here, drill now, lower prices.'' There's petitions on there from the Sierra Club and other environmental groups about not allowing people to drill. And as I got these petitions, and especially when I was at home, Madam Speaker, one day and I saw a petition on the counter of a gas station, and I guess the owner of the station had it there to give people something to do rather than talk bad to him about the price of gas, but it was a petition that said, ``Sign here if you want to lower gas prices.'' And so I came up with an idea that what I would do is start a petition, Madam Speaker, in this House where the American people could know how their Congress person felt about increasing the oil production in this country to lower their price that they were paying for gas at the pump. And so we came up with this very simple thing. In fact, there is no legislation attached to this, there is no discharge petition, there is just a simple statement where Members of Congress can make a statement to their constituents, Madam Speaker, much like our constituents have been making their thoughts known to us by signing these petitions online and at local convenience stores. This simply says, ``American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil online. Bring deep water oil online. And bring new refineries online.'' 
   And I put everybody's district, all 435 and the seven delegates that we have that represent territories of the United States. It gave people the opportunity to sign. And it simply says, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' And I don't care if it's the production of biodiesel fuel, biomass, oil, whatever it is, to make us less dependent on foreign oil. 
   And we've listened to a lot of the Blue Dogs tonight, but none of those Blue Dogs have signed this petition. And Madam Speaker, I have often learned in life that your walk has to match your talk. And some people say, well, this is just a political statement. It's not a political statement at all. We've had some Republicans sign it, we've had some not sign it. We've had some Democrats sign it, we've had some Democrats not sign it. 
   If you want to know if your Member has signed it, you can go to House.gov/westmoreland. And on that page we have those that have signed it and those that have refused to sign it. If you don't see their name in either spot, then we're going to take it that they did want to sign it, we've just not had a chance to talk to them personally, Madam Speaker. 
   But we believe that your walk should match your talk. And so we do have some Democrats on there, some people--Neil Abercrombie from Hawaii, a great leader, we have Mr. Cazayoux from Louisiana, Mr. Melancon from Louisiana, some from Texas--that are on here because they believe that we need to increase our oil production to lower the gas prices, and we do. That's just a fact. We heard about all these biodiesel plants, and those are great. But you know what? Until we start using our own natural resources--we see what the speculators did when we voted not to. 
   Now, oil came down $4 a barrel. It came down, and I understand one of the reasons it came down is because Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, Madam Speaker, sent a letter to the President saying we need to get into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a reserve of our petroleum that we have, millions of barrels of oil that we would have in an emergency, in a crisis, in a disaster. She wants to release that, which means to me, Madam Speaker, that she realizes that we need more oil, we need more production. But because of the radical environmentalists that have controlled the majority, or at least influenced the majority greatly, they cannot afford to do what we need to do politically; it's not politically correct for them. 
   I think that the American people, Madam Speaker, are tired of us in this body being politically correct. They just simply want us to do what's right, the things that we swore, took an oath that we would do, and that is to protect the American people. 
   And as the Blue Dogs said tonight, this is not just an economic policy, this is a national security interest that we have. And we've got to own up to our responsibility and make sure that we live up to the challenges that our constituents have given us by electing us to this body. We have got to act. We've got to get out of the fetal position, and we've got to act and do some things that will bring about some relief at the pump. 
   A lot of them in the past 45 minutes or the last hour or so have talked about all the great things we've done. Well, with all the bills that have been passed, I haven't noticed the price of gas coming down one dime. It's almost like putting lipstick on a pig. You can make it look good, but it's only going to be a pig. So we can make things look good, we can make things look like we're doing something, but all we're doing is just making a nice window for people to view at. It's time that we got down to some hard decisions. And there are some hard decisions that have got to be made. 
   And there are things that we are doing. We have put up discharge petitions--and I say ``we,'' I'm talking about the minority party--but they're there for everybody to sign. The week of June 9, we put a discharge petition, ``No More Excuse Energy Act of 2007.'' What that would do is it would reduce the price of gasoline by opening new American oil refineries, investing in clean energy sources such as wind, nuclear, capturing carbon dioxide, and making available more home-grown energy through environmentally sensitive exploration of the Arctic Energy Slope and America's deep-sea energy reserves. Now, what that takes is 218 Members to sign that discharge petition. We hear a lot of talk, but we don't see a walk.  
   The week of June 16, H.R. 2279, Madam Speaker, Expand American Refining Capability of Closed Military Installations. It would reduce the price of gasoline by streamlining the refinery application process--which in 2005 was passed by a Republican Congress and later stripped out by the new majority--and by requiring the President to open at least three closed military installations for the purpose of siting new and reliable American refineries. A lot of people, Madam Speaker, might not realize that we import refined gasoline of almost seven billion gallons a year, almost the same amount of diesel fuel, Madam Speaker, that we bring into this country because we do not have the refining capabilities. Not a refinery has been built since 1978. 
   The week of June 23 it was H.R. 5656, the Repeal of the Ban on Acquiring Alternative Fuels; reduce the price of gasoline by allowing the Federal Government to procure advanced alternative fuels derived from diverse sources like shale oil, tar sands, and coal-to-liquid technology. 
   Do you realize in the energy bill, Madam Speaker, that was passed by this majority, that Federal agencies cannot use these alternative fuels? We heard a lot tonight from the Blue Dogs about using alternative fuels, increasing alternative fuels, but yet we will not let our agencies use it. 
   The week of July 7, this week, H.R. 2208, Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Act, which, Madam Speaker, happens to be authored by a Democrat, reduces the price of gasoline by encouraging the use of clean coal-to-liquid technology, authorizing the Secretary of Energy to enter into loan agreements with coal-to-liquid projects that produce innovative transportation fuel.     
   There shouldn't be one Member of this body not on that discharge petition to say let our oil go. 
   The week of July 14, we are going to have H.R. 2493, Fuel Mandate Reduction Act of 2007. It will reduce the price of gasoline by removing fuel blend requirements and onerous government mandates if they contribute to unfavorable gas prices. Right now part of the problem that we have with the high gas prices in areas in California and other cities that don't meet the attainment is the boutique fuels that we have. 
   The week of July 21 brings H.R. 6107, the American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act. It will reduce the price of gasoline by opening the Arctic energy slope to environmentally sensitive American energy exploration. The development footprint will be limited to 1/100 of 1 percent of the refuge, and revenue received from the new leases would be invested in a long-term alternative energy trust fund. 
   The week of July 28, right before we go on the August recess, H.R. 6108, Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act of 2008, reduces the price of gasoline by enabling the United States to responsibly explore its own deep ocean to produce American energy. The bill would grant coastal States the authority to keep exploration 100 miles from their coastlines, and it would also allow States to share in the revenues received. As Mr. Cazayoux said today, it helps Louisiana protect their vital coastline and all the great natural resources that they have there. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to now yield to my friend Mr. Roskam to hear his comments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank you for your comments. And just a couple of points that you made about the amount of money that we give to some of the people who are not friendly to us, even in our own hemisphere, we give Hugo Chavez $170 million a day. 
   I hear the other side complain about what Big Oil makes, and I don't know.  Big Oil, according to the records and stuff I read, make about a 10 percent profit, and I am not saying if that's good or bad for their business. But what do they think Mr. Chavez is making off of $170 million of U.S. dollars every day? And, listen, he is not our friend. 
   And the other thing that the gentleman has brought up is a great point, and we heard it today and I heard it on the floor earlier today that we need to all work together. Well, I agree we do need to all work together. But when the majority party brings the energy bills to the floor, some under suspension, when there's only 20 percent of debate on each side, no amendments, no committee hearings, no subcommittee hearing, no regular process, how are we all working together, Mr. Speaker? 
   Mr. Speaker, you know if we are going to all work together, if we're going to all be part of the process, if all the people in this country--this is a republic. It is a representative form of government. And if I don't have an opportunity to amend or give input into the process, my people are shut out of the process. If there are no amendments, nobody on this side of the aisle and many people on this side of the aisle, the people they represent are shut out of the process. 
   So let's do all come together. Let's have an energy bill on the floor that can work, this open rule. We can have 435 plus the 7 delegates offer changes, offer solutions, as Mr. Roskam just did, about the people that have come up with solutions in his district; as Mr. Scott did previously about the biofuel in his district. We all have good ideas, but when we are shut out of the system, you can't work together. And I don't know what part of that the majority doesn't understand. 
   I would like to now yield to my colleague from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my colleague from Georgia. That was a great test. I think anybody, anybody in the United States should be able to pass that test, Dr. Gingrey. I am glad you put it up, because that simplified it. 
   This is something, this little simple petition, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans; 435 lines. So far, we have 191 signatures. This is just telling the American people we are ready to do all of the above. If you want to find out if your Member has signed this simple petition, much like the petitions that many of these people have signed, Mr. Speaker, that are listening to us, have gone on the Internet and signed petitions saying, Hey, drill here, drill now, lower our prices, and bring the U.S. back to being dependent--back from being dependent on foreign oil, go to House.gov/westmoreland and you will find out if your Member has signed, refused to sign, or is in the category of not making a decision because, Mr. Speaker, I feel like the American people are going to have to make the majority party understand that they want some change. 
   See, in April of 2006, then minority leader, now Speaker Pelosi made a statement that the Democrats had a plan. They had a commonsense solution to the skyrocketing price of gas. Of course, gas was about $2.05 then. So we are still waiting on that solution. We are still waiting on that commonsense plan. It hasn't been unveiled yet. 
   Although, in January of 2007, H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act, Dr. Gingrey, was passed in this House. The Republicans called it the ``no energy'' policy. I will read you some of the key words. This was a 300-something page bill. Crude oil was mentioned five times in that bill. Mr. Speaker, gasoline was mentioned 12 times. Exploratory drilling was mentioned twice in a 316-page bill about energy independence. 
   Offshore drilling was mentioned zero; domestic drilling, zero; domestic oil, zero; domestic gas, zero; domestic fuel, zero; domestic petroleum, zero. Gas price or gas prices, zero. Common sense, zero. 
   Now what was mentioned was greenhouse, 103 times. Green building was mentioned 101 times; ecosystem, 24 times; climate change, 18 times; regulation, 98 times; environmental, 160 times; geothermal, 94 times; renewable, 333 times; swimming pool, 47 times, because there was a swimming pool safety bill in the Energy Independence and Security Act. 
   Lamp, CFL, the new fluorescent lamps, 350 times. Three-hundred fifty times. Contains mercury. Only produced in China. We can't even dispose of it. If you drop one, you need to put on a mask, evacuate the house, let it air out until you can clean up a broken light bulb. 
   This was the commonsense plan, I hope not, that then Speaker Pelosi, then Minority Leader Pelosi was talking about bringing up, because gas has almost doubled, or more; maybe doubled when this commonsense plan came out. 
   But I want to read you one thing before I yield to my friend from Illinois. This was a statement made on January 18, 2007, the day, Mr. Speaker, this bill was passed. It says, ``It is sad to see the Republicans come to this. Now, they laughably say that this will lead to higher prices.'' That was Mr. Peter DeFazio from Oregon on how the Democrat's 2007 energy bill would affect gas prices. ``It is sad to see the Republicans come to this. Now, they laughably say this will lead to higher prices.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I'd hate to say this, and I hate to say this, but we were right. It has led to higher prices. It has led to oil going out the roof because now the speculators in this world know that we, as a country, are not going to become energy independent as long as the leadership continues the course that they are on right now. 
   I'd like to yield to my friend from Illinois, a great leader in the energy battle and somebody that I think has made some real movement in the policy here, and that's Mr. Shimkus.

So what I hear you saying is we need to take the politics out of this, and we need to put people in front of power, and we need to put process in front of politics and do something that will move this country toward energy independence, rather than just staying in the fetal position, so-to-speak, that we have been in, and being held hostage by radical environmentalists who the majority may feel is a big part of their base. I don't want to put words in your mouth.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I think it is interesting, you mentioned the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the letter that Speaker Pelosi wrote to the President. It is interesting that oil came down $4 a barrel. Now, if it will come down $4 a barrel on just a letter going to the President asking him to take the crude out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, think of what it would do if we voted in this body to drill without even sticking a drill in the ground. These speculators would run for the hills. And so I think you make a great point. And trust me, if we didn't have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we would not be getting oil from our enemies because they would know that they had us down. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, we have got just a few more minutes here, let me just say this. I think what you have heard tonight is that this is an all-of-the-above solution. It is all of the above. But a very important part of this is this country producing oil, to increase our oil production. 
   Rahm Emanuel on TV said, yes, increasing oil production is part of the solution. The Speaker has acknowledged that increasing oil production or at least having more oil is part of the solution. But as my colleague from Texas said, we don't need to take that out of our savings account. We need to bring it out of our natural resources, out of the ground. 
   Senator Schumer in the Senate about 3 weeks ago said that if we could just get Saudi Arabia to increase oil production 1 million barrels a day, it would drop the price of gas 50 cents a gallon. I don't know if that is true or not, but at least on the other side of this building some of the Democratic leadership understands that increasing oil production would bring down the price of gas. 
   I don't know why it is so hard to get a bill like that to this floor. I think the reason is strictly politics. It is strictly the radical environmental groups that has a grip or their claws into this majority. 
   And so I think what is happening is we are putting power above people, we are putting politics above process. Because as these gentlemen have talked tonight, with these ideas that they have shared they have not had one opportunity to offer one amendment on the energy bills because they have been brought either under suspension, under a closed rule, no committee hearings, no subcommittee hearings. The process has been broken. And so when the process is broken, the product is flawed. 
   Let me just close with this: www.house.gov/westmoreland. Mr. Speaker, go there, see if your Member has signed this simple petition that says I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower the gas prices for Americans.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I come to you today to help with some statistics that I thought you might be interested in. The fact is that we have a new majority. We have had a new majority now for about 18 months or so in this body. I wanted to give you some statistics about what has happened since the new majority has taken over. 
   A gallon of gas has gone from $2.35 to $4.11, an increase of $1.76. A loaf of bread has gone from $1.14 to $1.37, a 23-cent increase. A gallon of milk has gone from $3 to $3.76 a gallon. Dow Jones has gone from 12,463 to 11,812, losing 651 points. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people I think were misled with the new majority. But I think business and Wall Street and the price to consumers is now telling the tale of exactly what high taxes and the threat of high taxes and the willingness to be energy dependent is costing the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in recognizing Philip Baddour, Sr., and his extraordinary contributions to Goldsboro, North Carolina. A steadfast business and civic leader, Mr. Baddour served on the Goldsboro City Council from 1979 to 1995 and owned several downtown businesses. 
   Mr. Baddour passed away in April 2002 at the age of 87. As a young man, he served in World War II. After the war, he returned to Goldsboro, North Carolina, where he married his wife, Louise, and was the father of four sons. 
   He was known for his love of the community and affection for what he called the ``little man,'' the average working person in Goldsboro. 
   As the son of Lebanese immigrants, his desire to give back to the community that had welcomed him when he was just an infant took many paths. He served as a director of Wayside Fellowship, was active in Boy Scouts, Lions Club, and St. Mary's Catholic Church. 
   Mr. Baddour's popularity as a public servant was a result of his compassion and interest in helping his fellow citizens. He also felt it his civic duty to wisely spend the taxpayers' money while delivering needed city improvement projects. His legacy of sacrifice and service to others is a wonderful example to his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, and the citizens of Goldsboro. 
   With gratitude for his devotion to the Goldsboro community, it is particularly fitting that we would rename the William Street Post Office in his honor. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to support today H.R. 3233, naming the postal facility in Piney Woods, Mississippi, the Laurence C. and Grace M. Jones Post Office Building. 
   Laurence Jones was well-known in Mississippi history for founding the Piney Woods School in 1909. After graduating from the University of Iowa, he returned to his home State of Missouri, where he was sought out by a local Baptist church to create a school for black children. 
   Jones found himself by himself in an abandoned sheep shed with no students, but one day a small barefoot boy arrived seeking a lesson. The next day, this young boy came back with two friends. This simple and small beginning grew over the years to what is now a premier educational institution, teaching 300 high school students on a 300-acre campus. Piney Woods is the country's largest African American boarding school and the oldest continually operating African American boarding school. 
   Laurence's wife, Grace, was also an educator. They met in Iowa, where she had established a similar school for black children. Upon moving to Mississippi, she helped raise funds for Piney Woods and also taught classes. They believed in the importance of providing these youths with the educational opportunity they deserved. 
   Laurence and Grace Jones were pioneers in the education system in the early 1900s. Their historic achievements are worthy of this recognition, and I am pleased to support H.R. 3233.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2276 honors the life of a young man who fought bravely for his country and made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. Corporal Christopher Esckelson was killed during combat action in Fallujah, Iraq on December 28, 2006. He was less than 1 week shy of reaching his 23rd birthday. 
   Christopher Esckelson felt personal anger after September 11, 2001, when his country was brutally attacked, and he knew immediately he wanted to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to defending his country, it was a way to earn money for college. His plans included attending medical school. His dream of becoming a doctor, however, was cut short on a 5-day mission fighting insurgents in a war-torn Fallujah. 
   Corporal Esckelson was a squad leader of 12 men and suffered a direct hit during a mission. His leadership skills were proven day in and day out while in Iraq. He knew the risks involved and experienced the horrors of war. But his determination to fight and win was evident. He was fearless on the battlefield. 
   Christopher never had the chance to return home safely from the war or attend medical school as he planned, but he will surely be remembered in his community by the naming of this post office in his hometown of Vassar, Michigan. I am pleased to support H.R. 2276 in naming of the post office for this valiant soldier.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, CPL Stephen Bixler was a proud and loyal American who served his country while fighting the war on terror. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending freedom when he lost his life on May 4, 2006. Corporal Bixler was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on August 17, 1985. As a student at Suffield High School, he was known as a ``shy, soft-spoken, very dedicated young man and very patriotic, in a quiet, determined way.'' During high school, he was involved in athletics and was a member of the indoor/outdoor track team as well as the cross country team. His love for the outdoors and helping others was exemplified during the time he was a Boy Scout and his hard work and dedication was shown when he became an Eagle Scout.     
   In July 2003, Corporal Bixler's sense of dedication to his community and country led him to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. He was an ambitious man who was able to accomplish much in his short, but meaningful, life. 
   As a result of his exceptional military skills, drive, courage and strength, Corporal Bixler applied for and was selected as a member of the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion. He volunteered willingly for his second tour in Iraq because he knew his fellow marines needed his help. Tragically, during his second tour, on May 4, 2006, he was killed by enemy fire in Fallujah. 
   His decorations include the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Humanitarian Service Medal, Armed Forces Terrorism Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Purple Heart Medal. 
   We can never show adequate appreciation in honoring the brave men and women who give their lives in service to our country. However, Corporal Bixler's name is etched on the Wall of Honor in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC. 
   In addition to the memorial wall, naming this post office in his honor is a fitting and meaningful tribute to a proud marine who served selflessly on behalf of his hometown and his Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Mr. Shimkus, and thank you for doing this. I am glad to hear all of the discussion today. As Mr. McCotter was just talking about, the Democratic plan, I guess, or their policy, was H.R. 6, which was part of their monument pieces of legislation this was going to change the direction of this country. As we see by your chart, they definitely have changed the direction of gas prices in that they are skyrocketing up. We heard so much before they got in charge about the commonsense plan that they had. So H.R. 6 was their energy bill. 
   If you look at H.R. 6, and, Mr. Shimkus, I did a little word search and found that crude oil was mentioned five times in that bill, which was well over 300 pages. Gasoline was mentioned about 12 times. Domestic drilling was not mentioned. Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf was not mentioned. But what was curious was that swimming pool was mentioned 47 times because there was a piece of swimming pool legislation that was added to the bill. So swimming pool was mentioned about seven times more or eight times more than gasoline. Then the other interesting thing is 350 times in that bill was lamp or light bulbs. 
   So I have a hard time explaining. I just spoke to a group of farmers Saturday morning at a breakfast and they were asking me about fuel prices. As you know, the price of diesel is up well over $4 a gallon. When I tried to explain to them the Democratic solution to our energy problems and our dependency on foreign oil, I don't think that they believed me. I read them the bill, I read them the things that were in the bill, and I am having a hard time convincing them that I am telling the truth. 
   So I am proud that you're here and that these other members are here so I can have somebody to go back and say, Look, I told you I am telling you the truth. This is their policy. It is a nonpolicy. Their commonsense plan that they had to reduce our dependency on foreign oil and to bring down the rising gas prices has done nothing but cause them to go up almost 50 percent. 
   So I thank you for doing this, and I hope that by me sitting here listening to some of my other colleagues, I can get some ideas about what to go home and tell the people of the Third Congressional District of Georgia. 
   What really is their plan? Did they really have one? As it turns, it seems if they had one, it has certainly backfired on them and, shamefully, the American people. 
   Thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how I am always so lucky, or unlucky, I guess, to speak after the majority leader's minute, which is probably the longest minute I have ever seen. But to listen to him talk, you know, this weekend I bought a TV from somebody that was as good a salesman as Mr. Hoyer. I didn't need the TV. It was too expensive, and I really didn't want it. But after talking to the salesman, I ended up thinking I needed it and I could afford it and it was what I needed. So I bought it. 
   Mr. Hoyer and I have had this conversation on the floor before, and that is that you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. So the American people were sold a bill of goods last November, and they are continually being sold things in this Congress. 
   I come from Georgia. We have the HOPE scholarship, Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest tools for education that I think has been done. It comes from a lottery, which a lot of people oppose, but a lot of young people in Georgia are now able to go to college. What we found in Georgia was that when the State started paying for the college tuition, that the tuition went out of sight. It was another funding means for these institutions of higher education to charge more. 
   Now, the majority leader said that tuition in Maryland had gone up 43 percent in 4 years. Well, if he thinks that is something, wait until this bill passes. Because what is going to end up happening is that when the government starts loaning the money and paying for this, those tuitions are going to skyrocket, because the people that are getting it don't really care how much the tuition is. 
   Let me say this: When I bought this TV that I didn't need, that I couldn't afford, I got down to the bottom dollar of what I thought that I could afford. Of course, this great salesman walked away because he said, do you know what? If I can't make some money, I am not going to do this. We ended up negotiating. What ended up happening is that I paid up more than what I wanted to. He took less. 
   But a bank is not going to loan money if they can't make money. We hear a lot of back and forth on this floor. We don't know who to believe and who not to believe. Let me tell you the truth. If a bank, a lending institution, cannot make money, they are not going to do business with people. So the reality is that the private sector is going to get out of making these loans, which is probably the last stop we have of having any type of accountability to it. The government is going to start doing it all. If the banks will not loan it at this interest rate because they are losing money, and the government will, then that means, again, here is the thing, if we continue to govern our political correctness, the taxpayers end up holding the bag. They are going to end up holding the bag on this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York was making a great argument for the bill itself, but we are talking about the rule. We are talking about the ability of every Member of this body to be able to amend the bill. We go through a committee process here, well, I shouldn't say all the time, because in the 110th Congress, it has been very rare that we have gone through a regular order. But in this particular case we did go through a regular order as far as the bill going to Government Reform. 
   I had an amendment. The amendment was pretty simple. It said, notwithstanding the fact that the District of Columbia would get a vote on the floor of this body, but that the intention, and the end result, was for them not to have representation in the United States Senate. 
   Now, that was fairly simple. In fact, I believe it passed Government Reform unanimously. My 700,000 people that I represent in Georgia had an opportunity to amend this bill. 
   But because of the closed rule that we have today, an amendment that was passed, agreed to by both sides, put in the bill in Government Reform, has come to the floor without it. 
   You know, this was hyped up to be the most ethical Congress. I haven't seen any proof of that. It has been hyped up to be the most open Congress where all Members would have an opportunity to participate. We certainly haven't seen that. 
   This is government almost by gradualism. We are gradually getting to where the leadership of the majority party wants to go. I believe that is to give D.C. the ability to have Members of Congress. 
   Now, this little book right here, the gentleman from New York was quoting parts of the Constitution, but he didn't quote all of it. Because in here I think it lays out very plainly who is to vote on the floor of this House and who is to have representation in this House, and who is to have representation in the United States Senate. 
   I think this is the first step. I think my amendment made it clear that the intention of this bill was not to gradually give them the ability to have seats in the Senate. But because it made it so clear and described so clearly the legislative intent of this body, they won't allow it to be in the bill, because their intention is to go further. 
   I would hope that one day we would. I hear people's lips, I hear things coming out of people's mouths. I see lips moving, talking about bipartisanism: we are going to be bipartisan; we are going to let everybody participate. 
   I haven't seen that in action. Let me say this, I don't think anybody has ever written a perfect bill, a bill that couldn't be adapted or expanded or explained a little bit better, a bill that couldn't be made better, a bill that couldn't be perfected. 
   In fact, if you read the rules of this House, it talks about amendments and  perfection and perfecting the amendment, perfecting the bill. That is all we want an opportunity to do. I think everybody in this body, all 435 of us, I think the people that we represent, all they want us to have is an opportunity to try to help perfect the bill or make it better. 
   So far, we have been shut out of that process. I think it is a shame. As my friend, Mr. Bishop, said, a lot of people don't pay any attention to the process up here. But when the process is broken, the product is flawed. 
   I think the closed rule on this important bill is an example that this is a very broken process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Mr. Kuhl for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, National Safety Month is an important month. We all strive for safety, so it is important that we name a month, a week, a day, an hour for our safety. But right now, it is a shame that we can't have National Independence from Foreign Oil Hour, right now that the price of gasoline and price of crude oil is affecting every hardworking man and woman in this country. So I would hope that the majority, while recognizing these important days and weeks and months, would just have an hour where we could come into this House and discuss our energy policies. 
   In January of 2007, the majority passed an energy bill. At the time gas was probably $2.25 a gallon. It is now up to over $4 a gallon. So while we are going to pass 20 suspensions on this floor today, where most of them, the majority of them, won't even require a roll call vote, we don't have any time that we can discuss our energy policy, at a time where we are so dependent on foreign oil. 
   On May 13, Senator Schumer in the Senate asked the President, who was heading at the time to Saudi Arabia, to ask for an increase in their oil production, knowing that an increase in their oil production would probably cause a decrease in the price of crude oil. Yet with over 97 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf not being drilled on and about 94 percent of the Federal lands inside this country be not being drilled on, surely he and the rest of the Democratic Party, and especially this House leadership, would understand that drilling domestically would bring down the price of crude oil, which in turn would bring down the price of gasoline. 
   As I have said before on this floor, if we could have a 1-hour debate, and I would like for it to be longer than that, we could all debate and talk about all the different ways that we could help curb the price of our gas, whether it be converting coal to oil, whether it be exploring for natural gas, talking about nuclear energy, or the many other things that we could do right now ourselves. We can control our own destiny as far as what crude oil prices are and what the price of gasoline is by not being willing to do our own exploration, our own drilling in our own country, where we have many, many, many natural resources we could use for fuel. 
   So while he is combating or at least trying to combat the President on going to OPEC asking them to do more oil production, they must think it kind of comical that we are not willing to do our own drilling, our own exploration, and depend on our own natural resources to lower our price of gas, while China is fixing to drill 45 miles off the coast of this country for oil exploration, because China is a country that understands the importance of not being dependent on foreign oil. As they have gone across this globe dealing with other countries as far as using their natural resources to provide for their energy needs, we are sitting here on trillions of barrels of oil and coal that we are refusing to use ourselves. 
   So while I think that this very important designation of National Safety Month is important, I would hope that the majority here and the leadership in this body would devote at least an hour of our time in this House in front of the American people, Mr. Speaker, to let the American people see what effect this ``commonsense plan'' that has been touted by the Democratic majority is having to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas, and that was back in April of 2006 when this was being promoted. 
   I am sure that the American people, Mr. Speaker, would enjoy just a 1-hour conversation on that so we could unveil this plan, because certainly the  plan that was passed in January of 2007, of this year, was either not the real plan or it is a failed plan and we need to be talking about a new plan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from California for yielding. 
   As he mentioned, it is interesting that we are setting aside land for wilderness area to be managed by the Federal Government. It came out of the Committee on Natural Resources, but we are not using all our natural resources right now. We are not using some of the oil reserves that we have in ANWR. We are not using the oil that is on the Outer Continental Shelf. We are not using the shale coal that we have that we can convert to oil. We are not using the clean-burning coal to the best of our ability. We are not drilling for natural gas. 
   So we have natural resources in all parts of our country that we are not taking advantage of, and the reason that we are not taking advantage of it is because the new majority in the 110th Congress is being controlled or partly controlled by the radical environmentalists that don't want us to drive a Suburban or an extended cab pickup. They don't really care if gas goes to $10 a gallon. 
   So I would like for this House to concentrate on the majority of Americans who are tired of paying $4 a gallon for gas. They understood that when the new majority was elected, and you go back to April of 2006 and then minority leader, now Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, made the statement, that the Democrats had a commonsense plan for bringing down the skyrocketing price of gas. 
   Now, I think at the time, Mr. Speaker, gas was about $2.20 a gallon. I never thought we would lament or say, man, can you remember back when gas was $2 a gallon? But that is what it was when the Democrat majority said they had this new commonsense approach for bringing down the skyrocketing gas price. 
   Since that time, gas has almost doubled. It has almost doubled. So where is that commonsense plan? Where is it that we are using some of our natural resources to increase the supply of production that we have in this country, rather than being so dependent on foreign oil? 
   Now, the problem is that the majority passed in January of 2007 an energy bill, and that energy bill, which many on our side of the aisle called the ``no-energy bill,'' went into effect. So we thought that that was the secret plan. Mr. Speaker, we thought that was this commonsense approach. 
   Once we looked at the bill, we saw that gasoline was mentioned about five or six times, that crude oil was mentioned about maybe 12 times, and that nothing was mentioned about domestic drilling, nothing was mentioned about increasing the production or using our natural resources to make us less dependent on foreign oil. But what we saw were words like ``swimming pool'' was used 47 times, ``lamp'' or ``light bulb'' was used 350 times, ``renewable energy'' was used a number of times, ``greenhouse gases'' was used a number of times, but nothing was really in that ``no-energy bill'' that helps us today. 
   I think we see evidence of that today with gas being over $4 a gallon. There was nothing in there to help us bring down the price of gas, number one, and that was where the commonsense approach was to be, was to bring down the skyrocketing price of gasoline. Not only did we not bring it down, it has doubled. 
   So where is this commonsense approach? I think the American people are ready to see it. I know my constituents are. When I go home, just like we have been home during the Memorial Day break, I had people ask me, what are we doing about increasing our domestic production? What are we doing about having the ability to become less dependent on foreign oil? 
   I have to explain to them the ``no-energy bill'' that was passed by this Congress and the things that it mentioned and the things that were there, and really and truly, Mr. Speaker, they think I am lying to them or kidding them, that that is the commonsense plan that the majority had, because it wasn't a plan at all. It was some type of smoke and mirrors that was sold to the American people. Now that gas is more than twice what it was, what are we to tell them? Because I have not seen anything come out of the Democratic side. 
   Now we have come up with an energy proposal that makes sense. It allows us to use some of our natural resources. What the other part that my constituents don't believe is that we as a government will not allow drilling off the coast of Florida, and yet China is fixing to start drilling 45 miles off our coast.     
   They can use the slant drilling technology and probably get deeper into our oil reserves. Now, what are we to tell people? What am I to tell my constituents that this Congress is doing about that? They are doing nothing about it, not one single thing. 
   We are naming post offices, we are coming up with wilderness areas and many more days of honoring somebody or recognizing a week or recognizing a month, but we are not doing anything on this House floor, nor have we done anything on this House floor, to really bring down the price of gas, crude oil or come up with a commonsense plan for that American worker out there that's going to the pump, costing him $100 to fill up with gas. 
   Now, I don't know the answer to it, but I would suspect that if we pass some type of legislation that said we were going to start drilling, whether it be in ANWR, Outer Continental Shelf, wherever it is, that the oil speculators, that the bottom would fall out of that because people would say, you know what? They are finally doing something to become less dependent on somebody else's oil production. 
   So we don't have to hold them hostage anymore, and those prices would come down, just at the fact that we passed the legislation--not that we put the first drill bit in the ground--but just that these oil speculators and the American people saw that their elected officials were wanting to do something to take a positive step that we can meet our own energy needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to ask, what's wrong with that? I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I think that the people that elect us deserve to know what our plan is. The Republican side has come out with a plan. They say, look, we are going to take advantage of our natural resources. We are going to take advantage of the things that we were God given in this land. We are going to take advantage of our oil reserves, of our natural gas, of our abundance of coal. 
   We are going to take advantage of those things, and we are going to use the technology that we have been so good about coming up with. We are going to take and convert this shale to oil, which Hitler did in the late 1920s--in the late 1920s--and we don't think that we can do that today?  
   There is a problem, and we need the courage, the political courage and the political guts to stand up and say we are going to--or at least I hope the majority party will go--we are going to go against those people that we owe so much to for being in the majority, and say we are going to do what's good for the American people. We are going to use our own natural resources. We are going to do what the people that elected us expect us to do, and that's what's the best for them, not the best for special interest groups. 
   I just hope that during this next conversation that we have on these upcoming bills that we will be on this floor discussing this issue, because we have not really had a debate on it. I wish that the majority party would bring a bill to this floor and have an open rule so we could vote on some of these things that are so important. 
   The truth of it is that our constituency doesn't really know how we believe on some of these issues, because the majority has never given us the ability to vote on it. Let's vote on drilling on ANWR, just a straight up or down vote, not anything else tied to it. Let's drill on our natural gas. Let's vote on our natural gas drilling, not anything else tied, just an up or down. Let's drill on the converting of coal-to-liquid oil. Let's vote on that, just an up or down, rather than tie so many things that's so confusing to the American people. 
   That's what I hope we will do.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (SABINOSO WILDERNESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you for yielding. 
   To my other friend from California over there, I know that the gentleman is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, and I think that subcommittee has jurisdiction over the drilling in ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf. Right now only 3 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is leased for oil and natural gas, and only 6 percent of the Bureau of Land Management public lands are leased. 
   So I think that it would be a good opportunity for the gentleman, for just my suggestion, that we look at that. I know that it has been looked at many times before. 
   The gentleman mentioned about the Republicans being in control for 12 years, I was only here for 2 of those years, so I was quite disappointed too that we never passed a comprehensive energy plan. You know, I am very concerned about that, and I hate that. 
   What I am proud of is that right now that we have come up with an energy plan that would help with our dependence on foreign oil, and maybe it took 12 years for us to wake up. I certainly hope that the majority party that's in  control now, that it doesn't take them 12 years to wake up to understand that we need an energy policy. 
   Now, if it's going to take them 12 years to wake up, we will be paying $12 a gallon like they are paying in the Netherlands or $9 a gallon like they are paying in Germany. I know that would make some of their base awfully happy if we were paying those gas prices, but your average American family, the man and the woman out there trying to make a living and trying to provide for their family, does not like paying $4 a gallon for gasoline when we are not doing anything, anything to reduce our dependence on that foreign oil. 
   I agree with Mr. Nunes from California in the fact that we need to bring some bills to the floor. We are doing 20 suspension bills on this floor today. The U.S. Congress is addressing 20 bills on this floor today, that most of them will be passed by a voice vote, and most Americans won't even know what we did. 
   Some of these pieces of legislation should be going through a regular rule, a regular order of process, where we can come in and make some amendments on some of these. There may be in these wilderness areas, there may be some spots where we have the potential for natural gas or oil, where we have potential for solar, where we have potential for wind power. Those are being restricted on just about every one of these pieces of legislation that we are doing today. 
   So let's have an open, honest--that's another promise that the majority made to the American people, that this was going to be the most open, honest Congress in history. I hate to say this, and I was only here for 2 years when we were in control, but that's not true. That's another falsehood and whether they did it purposefully or not, that this is not the most open, honest Congress that this country has ever seen, and it does not or has not or not yet come up with a commonsense approach to bring down the skyrocketing cost of gasoline when it was $2.20 a gallon, and now it's over $4 a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   It was mentioned a while ago about all of the different land that was available for oil companies to drill in, that they weren't taking advantage of, and I would like to quote some figures, Mr. Speaker, for you and for the American  people to hear because one of the things, I guess, that is part of this secret plan for our energy is to tax oil companies. Somehow the majority has got in their mind by taxing companies, the price of their product is going to come down. I don't understand that, and I know that most of the people in the Third Congressional District of Georgia do not understand that, and I am sure there are probably people all over the world that don't understand that. But that seems to be their answer to everything, is to raise taxes. 
   When you talk about, Mr. Speaker, domestic oil and gas production, in 2006 the top 27 U.S. energy producing companies paid $81.5 billion in corporate Federal income taxes. That is $81.5 billion in corporate taxes, an 81 percent increase over 2004. In addition, they paid $3.1 billion in State and local government taxes. Those 27 companies paid 21 percent of the total corporate income taxes collected by this Federal Government in 2006. These 27 companies paid 21 percent of all the corporate taxes paid into the Federal Government. 
   Yet these 27 companies make up one one-thousandth of the domestic corporate filers. And yet they paid 21 percent of all the total corporate Federal taxes paid into our treasury. 
   Total non-income taxes paid in 2006 by the big 27 was $8.2 billion, and that was a 46 percent increase over 2004. Excise taxes collected by these same 27 companies on behalf of the Federal, State and local governments total $48.1 billion in 2006. 
   In 2006, these 27 companies were responsible for 44 percent of the total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production, and 81 percent of the domestic refining capacity. 
   For fiscal year 2006, $10.48 billion was collected in the form of bonus bids, rent and royalties from oil and gas companies operating on Federal lands. 
   The OCS, the Outer Continental Shelf, covers 1.7 billion acres of which 85 percent is off-limits to drilling. However, the Minerals Management Service broke records for bonus bids in several recent OCS lease sales. Last summer in the western gulf off the shore of Texas they received more than $289.9 million for tracts totaling 18 million acres. In February 2008 they received $2.6 billion for leases covering approximately 2.7 million acres in the Chukchi Sea. And in March, they received $3.7 billion in bonus bids in the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
   The CRS estimates that ANWR production would deliver $191.1 billion in corporate income tax and royalty to the Federal treasury at today's prices. 
   So while they may not be drilling, you can see that 85 percent of the Federal land is off-limits. Maybe the land that they have to drill on doesn't have any oil reserves under it, any natural gas under it, any coal under it. That would be something, Mr. Speaker, for the chairman of the subcommittee to tell us, if there are any oil reserves or natural gas reserves or coal reserves under this 85 percent of Federal lands that does not have the ability to be drilled under. And then if it does have reserves for oil or natural gas or coal, maybe he could tell us, Mr. Speaker, why we can't drill there, why it is off-limits, what technology are we missing to be able to drill in an environmentally friendly way. 
   So yes, some of these companies do have land that they may be able to drill on. But as we see that this is a profitable thing for the Federal Government, to allow those companies to drill domestically, we can see the amount of money that it brings in. And goodness knows, the way the majority party loves to spend money, they passed a thing called PAYGO, the American people pay and we will go spend it. Now this is a great opportunity to get more revenue coming into our treasury by allowing us to take advantage of our own resources that we have in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OZARK NATIONAL FOREST -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to bring up some more points about the Federal lands since that's one of the main things that we're talking about here today is Federal land. Coming from the Committee on Natural Resources and, Mr. Speaker, being privileged enough to be on the floor today with the subcommittee chairman that has authority over this, we have a problem in the fact that the majority, the Democratic majority keeps making what I think are false arguments about oil companies having the ability to drill on Federal lands right now. 
   The problem is that, and this is the reality, that 97 percent of the Federal offshore areas and 94 percent of Federal onshore areas are not leased by the government. 97 percent of offshore, 94 percent of onshore. The government is stockpiling these leases, not the oil companies. 
   And I'm not being a big defender of the oil companies. I just know that the truth is the truth. It's many things to many people. But at the end of the day, it's the truth. And the truth is that they are not stockpiling these leases. 
   The truth is that raising taxes on them is not going to bring down the price of gas. Oil companies are, indeed, drilling on these leases, which have oil in them, and when there's a pipeline close that they can ship this oil. You know, we haven't built a refinery in this country since the late 1970s. So that would be, Mr. Speaker, a perfect bill to bring to the floor where we can refine more oil. 
   We keep putting these boutique fuels on the market, and I forget, but I think there's probably 16 or 18 of those boutique fuels now, three different grades. We don't have the ability to refine even the crude that we have. So a novel idea is, why don't we build some refineries where some of these leases are, or where we know there are some oil reserves? 
   You see, if these leases and this available land that's out there does not have oil on it, why would somebody want to drill in a dry hole? 
   And so, if the government is only leasing this land that they know is a  dry hole, how can they expect the oil companies to get oil out of it? 
   Well, that's a pretty novel idea. And the fact that we have the leadership in this House, the Democrat leadership, the Speaker of the House sending President Bush a letter demanding that he ask OPEC to do more production, to do more drilling, when we're sitting here in this country, with 97 percent of our Federal offshore areas and 94 percent of our Federal onshore areas with no ability to drill on it. They must have felt that was kind of interesting. 
   We cannot produce, and I say we, this country cannot produce its own energy dependence by asking the companies that have the leases here to drill on land that does not have the oil. 
   Now, with more than 2 billion acres of Federal lands not leased, how can these oil companies find the oil? 
   We know the oil is under there. But if you're not going to lease the land, you've only leased the land that doesn't have the oil, and then you're saying that the oil companies aren't drilling on the land they have, when the land they have does not have the oil. I'd like to hear the answer to that one, Mr. Speaker. 
   We have got to open up these lands for us to be able to become dependent on our natural resources and not the resources of others. I think it's a great question, Mr. Speaker, that all the American people would ask is, is there oil under this Federal land? 
   Is there environmentally safe ways to drill it? 
   Is there natural gas there? 
   Is there shale coal there? 
   Is there coal that can be converted to oil there? 
   If it's there, let's go get it. ANWR, today, I think it was released, 10.4 billion, that's billion with a B, barrels of oil. 10.4 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, we could use that natural resource that this country has to bring down the price of gas for the hardworking men and women of this country. And, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the American people will get an answer from the Democratic leadership about this commonsense plan, because surely the bill that was passed in January of 2007 was not that commonsense plan. Surely they are holding this commonsense plan for some reason. 
   And so I'm asking, the people of the Third District of Georgia are asking, and, Mr. Speaker, I think the American people are asking, where is this commonsense plan?

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS FOR LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, it's good to be here tonight, and I wanted to come and talk about something that's concerning Americans all over this country, and that's the price of gas and what we're doing about it here in this body, this decisive body that's supposed to be decisive, that takes action when we find our country in need. 
   I wanted to talk a little bit about something that happened to me shortly a couple of weeks ago I guess, and I started having people, Mr. Speaker, e-mail me and ask me questions about signing different types of petitions on the Internet, drill here, drill now, lower prices, several other ones on the Internet, so Americans could let their Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, know how they felt about these skyrocketing gas prices that they had been promised by the new majority that they would get control of. 
   So I was in a service station down home, and there was another petition laying on the counter. I'm assuming that the proprietor of that service station put that down to give people something to do rather than beat him over the head, but it was a petition: Please sign here if you want to see Congress lower gas prices. 
   So I came up with an idea, Mr. Speaker. I said, you know, the American people are letting us know, as their representatives, how they feel. We need to let them know how we feel. And so I came up with this petition that's pretty simple. What it says is: American energy solutions for lower gas prices; bring onshore oil on-line; bring deepwater oil on-line; and bring new refineries on-line. 
   We have not produced in this country, Mr. Speaker, a refinery since the late 1970s. We now import about 7 billion gallons of gas a year. We also import about the same amount of diesel. So we don't even have the refining capacity to refine what we import. 
   So I did this, and I made a little petition. You can see it over here. It's got spots for 435 people plus the non-voting Delegates to sign. So far I'm pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, we've got 188 people who have signed this. We've got three Democrats, three brave Democrats that have signed it: NEIL ABERCROMBIE, PATRICK MURPHY, and Mr. Speaker, I believe HENRY CUELLAR was the last one from Texas. And so these are brave people that understand that we have got to do something. 
   The majority says, well, it will be 10 years before we ever get oil. We've got to start today. If President Clinton in 1995 had not vetoed the drilling in ANWR, we would be producing 1 million gallons of crude oil for this country every day. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, what this is about--and by the way, this is very simple, because what it says is, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower the price of gas for Americans. And Mr. Speaker, if anybody wanted to know if their Member was on the petition, they could go to house.gov/westmoreland to see if their Member is on there. We've had two Members that did not sign originally, and Mr. Speaker, they were put on the would-not-sign list. They have heard from their constituents and have come back and are now signed onto the petition. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is very important for people to understand where their Members of Congress are at on the energy issue. You're going to hear all kinds of excuses. You're going to hear all kinds of different regulations they want to put in place, all kinds of different taxes they want to put in place. This petition is too simple for most Members of this body to understand because it only says, I will vote to increase oil production in the United States, our own natural resources, to lower gas prices for Americans. That's all it says. 
   And if somebody wanted to know, Mr. Speaker, they could go to house.gov/westmoreland, and see exactly where their Member of Congress was at because, listen, Mr. Speaker, we hear about change from just about every candidate running, but we are going to have to be forced to change by our constituents. Because as you've seen since the new majority came in in January of 2007, there's been nothing done. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the American people if I could to help us bring about change by notifying your Congressman and say get out of the fetal position and let's be called to action.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order under clause 2(a) of rule XX that the vote just ended was held open for the sole purpose of reversing the outcome. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair has considered whether the new sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX should be enforceable in real time. 
   The black letter of the rule is not dispositive. It uses the mandatory ``shall.'' It might just as well say ``should,'' inasmuch as it is setting a standard of behavior for presiding officers. For this reason the Chair thinks it more sensible to enforce the rule on collateral bases, as by a question of the privileges of the House. 
   A set of ``whereas'' clauses in the preamble of a resolution could allege the facts and circumstances tending to indicate a violation more coherently than they could be articulated in argument on a point of order or in debate on an appeal. The resolving clause of a resolution could propose a fitting remedy, rather than requiring the instant selection of a remedy in the face of competing demands for vitiation of the putative result, reversal of the putative result, or admonishment of the presiding officer. 
   The Chair finds that the new sentence in clause 2(a) of rule XX does not establish a point of order having an immediate procedural remedy. Rather than contemplating a ruling from the Chair in real time, the language should be understood to establish a standard of behavior for presiding officers that might be enforced on collateral bases.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In his hometown of Lebanon, Missouri, Steve Allee was known not just as a rural postal carrier at the Lebanon Post Office, but also as a dear friend and loving family man. He came from a family of letter carriers. His father was a highway contract driver, and his cousin is the postmaster in Stoutland, Missouri. 
   Mr. Allee was a dedicated post office employee for over 15 years until the tragic loss of his life while on the job on August 20, 2007. On that tragic day, Mr. Allee was going about his daily routine of delivering mail until a torrential rainstorm began. He was attempting to cross a bridge over what is normally a dry creekbed, but due to the rainfall, the creek had become flooded. Mr. Allee perished as his vehicle was washed away in the rush of water. This serves as an example of how public servants in the course of their everyday duties are sometimes thrust into dangerous and, in this case, deadly circumstances. 
   We acknowledge Mr. Allee's service and his sacrifice. He will be deeply missed by all the people's lives that he touched. 
   With this, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this fitting tribute to a dedicated postal employee who lost his life in the line of duty.

   I rise today in support of this resolution expressing support for the designation and goals of National 9-1-1 Education Month. Every day across this great Nation, lives are saved thanks to this simple, yet vital, support service. 
   Recommended in 1967 by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice and established a year later by AT&T, 9-1-1 has continued to evolve as an integral part of America's vital emergency response and homeland security. Each year over 200 million calls are received by the 6,000-plus public safety answering points across the country. These calls come from people of all walks of life, young and old, wealthy and poor. As this service is a vital access point for the public to reach a public safety official during a time of need, it is critical that we continue to educate our citizens on the services 9-1-1 provides and the appropriate uses of the number. 
   We must also continue to modernize this vital tool. There is a growing population of citizens, otherwise unable to communicate clearly, who are learning to communicate through new technologies such as text, video, and instant messaging. We should strive to connect the use of emerging technologies to the 9-1-1 system.  
   Madam Speaker, once again, increased awareness and understanding of this service will help save lives and increase national security. For this reason, I support this resolution and ask that my colleagues do the same.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 20 Sussex Street in Port Jervis, New York, as the E. Arthur Gray Post Office Building. 
   A native of Port Jervis, Arthur Gray spent a lifetime serving his community, State, and country. He was well-known in the community, first as a high school basketball star, then as a veteran of the Second World War who later became a local funeral home director. 
   Mr. Gray accomplished a lot by the time he was elected to his first term as mayor of Port Jervis in 1978. Described as generous and always willing to lend a helping hand, Mayor Gray was the longest serving mayor in the history of Port Jervis, maintaining his position for five and a half terms until 1988, when he was elected to represent the 34th District in the New York State Senate. 
   His commitment to the community extended far beyond his office doors. He was a former member and chairman of the Port Jervis Community Development Agency, a former member of the Orange County Economic Development Agency, former chairman of the National League of Small Cities Advisory Council, and participated in numerous local boards and organizations. 
   Sadly, Arthur Gray died on April 10, 2007, at the age of 82. A loving husband, father of two, grandfather, and truly dedicated public servant, Arthur Gray exemplified civic duty and social responsibility. His contributions to his community and beyond will not soon be forgotten, and I urge that we accept this bill memorializing the tremendous life of this man.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I am glad the gentleman who has just left was talking about the energy prices, because that is what I want to talk about, too, the energy prices. 
   I was elected to Congress 4 years ago, and I came up here and you really think you are going to be dealing with some smart people. It took all I could muster up just to graduate from high school. I did attend college for 2 years. But I have come up here and I have found out that evidently a lot of people in this body don't understand either business or the economy or economics or something, because I keep hearing about the majority wanting to bring down gas prices, but they want to do it by raising taxes and taxing oil companies. 
   Now, the gentleman just spoke about getting the President's help. Well, I think he has tried to help. I think he has put together some good proposals, but they don't want to do any drilling. 
   On April 24, 2006, Speaker Pelosi put out a thing, they were trying to get into the majority, and it said: ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' And at the time, gas was probably $2 a gallon and, as the gentleman stated a while ago, it is about $3.80 now. Oil was probably $60 a barrel, and it is about $120 a barrel now. But you passed H.R. 6. That was one of the first 100 Hours, one of these great proposals, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
   Well, we did a little research. In that bill, which is over 300 pages, ``crude oil'' is mentioned five times. Over 300 pages, ``crude oil'' is mentioned just five times.     
   ``Gasoline'' is mentioned 12 times in over 300 pages. 
   ``Exploratory drilling'' is mentioned twice. 
   ``Offshore drilling'' is mentioned, none. 
   ``Domestic drilling'' is mentioned, none. 
   ``Domestic oil'' is mentioned, none. 
   ``Domestic gas,'' zero mention. 
   ``Domestic fuel,'' zero mention. 
   ``Domestic petroleum,'' zero. 
   ``Gas price'' or ``gas prices,'' zero. 
   The word ``commonsense,'' zero. 
   What is mentioned is ``greenhouse,'' 103 times. 
   ``Green building,'' 101 times. 
   ``Ecosystem,'' 24 times. 
   ``Climate change,'' 18 times. 
   One of their favorite words ``regulation,'' 98 times. 
   ``Environmental,'' 160 times. 
   ``Geothermal,'' 94 times. 
   ``Renewable,'' 333 times. 
   The word ``pool'' because, Madam Speaker, there was the Swimming Pool Safety Act attached to the Energy Independence and Security Act. Here is the thing I found interesting. The word ``pool'' was mentioned 47 times; or nine times more than crude oil and four times more than the word ``gasoline.'' 
   ``Lamp'' or ``light bulb'' is mentioned 350 times; 350 times they talk about lamps or light bulbs. 
   So get the picture here. The Democratic plan for lowering gas prices is not drilling, it is not using domestic production, it is becoming more reliant on foreign oil; and it is going to do it through greenhouse, green building, regulation, geothermal, swimming pool safety, and light bulbs. 
   Now I have a hard time when I go home to the people of the Third Congressional District explaining to them that that's our plan for energy independence. And I don't know if I am the only one that is having the problem of convincing my constituents that this is what Congress is doing to lower gas prices. 
   Now just another side note here. Tonight we passed Senate bill 2739, Consolidated Natural Resource Act of 2008, but I see my time has expired.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Mr. Garrett. This has something to do with the Constitution, something to do with what the intent of our Founding Fathers was. I don't think that they had in mind Senate bill 2739 which just passed the House with 117 dissenting votes and they must have had right at 300 who voted for it. It was an omnibus bill that included 61 distinct pieces of legislation, 61, at a cost of $380 million. Sixty-one bills rolled into one, $380 million, 20 minutes debate, voted under suspension. 
   That has got to make Americans proud, Madam Speaker. It has got to make our Founding Fathers roll over in their graves. 
   But the part that really bothered me the most, because I talked earlier about the price of gas and what the majority party's commonsense plan to lower those gas prices was. And I look at this bill, Senate bill 2739 permanently blocks exploration for natural energy resources on millions of acres of Federal land at a time when this country and our entire economy is suffering as a result of these record high energy prices. But yet we permanently block exploration of natural gas. 
   Also, you know, we only own 670 million acres. You know, Congressman Garrett, I don't know what the Founding Fathers had in mind with the Constitution, but I think if they had really figured that the Federal Government would own 670 million acres, they may have put that in there somewhere. 
   One thing they did put in the Constitution was about private property rights. The natural heritage area designations included in this bill restrict, and I think the Constitution talks about this somewhere, restricts how residential and commercial property owners utilize their private property without any notice or warning. 
   It also kicked out and stripped out some amendments put in by the House that would have protected the second amendment, and I believe that may be in the Constitution, it is talked about somewhere, the second amendment. So the right to bear arms and property rights in these natural heritage areas were stripped out of this bill. 
   What breaks my heart even more is that the minority party, who has been standing up here complaining about our energy cost, all we had to get was about 28 more votes and this bill would have had to come under regular order where we could have stood on this floor in front of the American people, Madam Speaker, and debated this bill. But we could not muster 145 votes out of the 199 Members that we have in the Republican conference. That's embarrassing to me. That is just as hard for me to understand and to go home and try to explain to my constituents when I am standing up here night after night arguing about oil and gas prices and the price of energy and what little pitiful bit the majority is doing when my party won't support doing something to make some real change in what we are paying at the pump. 
   Mr. Garrett, I want to thank you for doing this special order on the Constitution, and I hope that you will bring up the private property rights, the second amendment, the fact that we can pass legislation $380 million worth, 61 different bills rolled into one under suspension with 20 minutes of debate. 
   Like I said, Madam Speaker, I know that makes America proud.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from Ohio for yielding and my friend from Indiana for offering this amendment. 
   Let me say this: there seems to be some doubt over there or something from the subcommittee Chair and the full committee Chair about why we don't believe them. Well, in November they kind of snookered the public. They had told them that they were going to give more affordable health care to all Americans, which hasn't been done. They were bring gas prices down, which, hello, if you are out there at the pump, you know that's not true. And then we were going to get away from dependence on foreign oil, which last night we saw that we voted not to do that, but to be dependent on them. 
   So you fooled the public in November; so we don't want you to fool us this time. And I think it is evident that you are trying to trick us when you had two Members go down and talk about the only reason why you are not going back against the Fairness Doctrine is because you don't have the FCC. 
   And let me say you have said that the Republicans are calling this a red herring. Well, I want to say the majority party is looking at the Fairness Doctrine as the one that got away. The one that got away. You all want to recapture that one that got away. 
   So I hope that all of my colleagues will vote in support of this. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for offering it with Mr. Hensarling and Mr. Flake. 
   And I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) for offering this amendment. 
   You know, this is what I call fuzzy math. I think, Mr. Chairman, we need to explain this to people because the chairman of the subcommittee just asked the question, maybe you wanted us to go deeper in the cuts. Well, let me explain to the people, Mr. Chairman, that this is a 9.9 percent increase in fiscal year 2007. This is not a cut. And what the gentleman from Georgia is saying, let's just take 1 percent. Let's give a haircut of 1 percent to this budget. If you do the 1 percent, you will have an 8.9 percent increase. So it is not a cut. That is fuzzy math. That is smoke and mirrors. That is more sleight of hand when you are presenting this that we are asking for more of a cut. All we are saying is let's not increase by 9.9, let's only increase by 8.9. 
   Mr. Chairman, the American people need to be aware that sometimes in Washington when people talk about a cut, they are actually saying they are not getting as much of an increase as they want to have. Now, in a year's time for somebody to get a 10 percent raise or for a family to say, you know what, we can spend another 9.9 percent because we need it, so we will just go borrow the money, the majority says we are not borrowing the money. Okay. Well, I will go out and get an extra job to get more revenue. But the majority says, no, we are not doing it that way either. We are not raising taxes. 
   Well, if you spend more, you've either got to make more money or you have to go in debt. Or you've got to get more taxes in. So I think that is where we have a little bit of a dilemma here. We see the final answer, but we don't see the solution in how to get there, the math problem in how to get there. I can tell you the math problem that is going to get there. It is going to be a problem for the American family and the small businessman, because where this result comes from is the largest tax increase in American history. 
   So don't go for the smoke and mirrors, don't go for the sleight of hand, don't go for the wonderful sales job of we're not going to increase your taxes or increase the deficit, we're just making it happen. 
   Well, that sounds like a fairy tale. Sometimes up here I feel like I am in  Alice in Wonderland. I just want the American people to know that there is a group, that there are some of us that are trying to bring us back from Alice in Wonderland, trying to bring us back to a reality that we need to stop the big spending and the expansion of government.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I just want to tell Mr. Chairman that I hope Mr. Price is listening because it is going to take a lot of truth squad to straighten this out. 
   The chairman over here mentioned the Iraq spending and wanted to see how much we would cut it. Well, when the President sent down the emergency Iraq spending bill the Democrats went ``Yee-Haw,'' let's add $23 billion to it. 
   So I want to quote what the chairman and the subcommittee chairman has said. ``Don't lecture me on spending on the war.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Utah for giving me this opportunity to come and to speak. As I was listening to the gentlelady from New Hampshire speak, she must not have read the American Energy Act. My colleagues and I, at least about 135 of my Republican colleagues and I, have been coming back to this floor ever since August 1, when Speaker Pelosi decided to adjourn this Congress and go on a 5-week vacation rather than address the energy crisis that we have in this country. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's awfully strange that all of the debate, most all of the debate that I have heard on the floor today, has dealt with energy. Yet we refuse to bring an energy bill to the floor under regular order. 
   I think what also needs to be said, Mr. Chairman, and I hope the American people are picking up on this, is that the Democrats have been in control of this Congress for the last 20 months. The Democrats have been the majority, the controlling party in this Congress for the last 20 months. In the House, they have 236 Members, I believe. Close to it. I think the Republicans have 199. It only takes 218 to pass any legislation in this body. In fact, you can have a good idea, you can have a great idea, you can have a lifesaving, wonderful, world-changing idea,  but if you don't have 218 votes, you don't have anything except an idea. If you have the worst bill in the world, or something that really hurts the American people and hurts our economy and our future and future generations, if you have 218 votes, you can pass that. 
   So I guess my question to the majority is that rather than continually laying the blame on the executive branch of our government, and most all Americans know that we do have three branches of government. We have got the executive branch, we have got the judicial branch, and we have got the legislative branch. The legislative branch, who the Democrats are in control of, have the responsibility for passing laws. So we can't help it. It's not our fault. If the unemployment was 4.2 percent, Mr. Chairman, when your party took the majority, and now it's 6.1, we can't help that. This comes from the legislation that you had 218 votes for to pass. 
   Now we can't help it because gas was $2.06 a gallon when you took over, and that it's over $4, or close to $4 a gallon now. It's been as high as $4.50. We can't help that. You were in control. You had the 218 votes to do anything you wanted to do. 
   But what has happened? The Democratic majority decided that rather than have a bill that would go through regular order and have subcommittee hearings and committee hearings and be brought to the floor under a rule that would be an open rule that would allow input for all 435 Members and the seven delegates from U.S. territories to be able to have amendments on the floor to speak to what their constituents had felt and what they had been told at home, they have been brought under a suspension rule. 
   Mr. Chairman, a suspension does not have to go through committee. It does not have a rule. There's 20 minutes of debate for each side. And then you have to have two-thirds of the vote. Well, these have been snake oil or shams or, I guess, covers to hide under, maybe, that you could go home and say that you had voted for an energy bill. 
   I say let's bring it under regular order. If you bring it under regular order, let's give us an opportunity to have a motion to recommit, or an alternative. But the best thing to do, the thing that I think the American people want to happen, is an open rule come to the floor, where we can all--this is a House where we are supposed to come and debate and share ideas. Let this House work its will. Let's vote on every amendment that comes to the floor. Limit it to one amendment per person. 
   If we have to stay here over the weekend, let's hear all the good ideas that will come out of this place. There's not just a certain number of people in this body that have good ideas, there's a lot of good ideas that come from a lot of people, and there's a lot of people here who have good ideas that never get to share them. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I encourage, I encourage the majority to bring out of mothballs that commonsense energy plan that in April of 2006 Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that she had. I hope that she will bring it out soon because not just my constituents in the Third District of Georgia, but constituents, people, citizens all over this country are hurting. So, hopefully, we will get to see this commonsense plan at some point in the near future.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the debate, and I haven't heard of any way that this is going to be paid for, the 130 something billion dollars over 10 years, except for 45 cent a pack increase in the tax on tobacco. So while I heard some Members over there talking about this is going to be a deterrent to people smoking, you better hope a bunch of people start smoking because you're going to have to sell a ton of cigarettes to come up with $132 billion. But then the closer you look at it, you find out that this is, again, smoke and mirrors from this majority in Congress. 
   What this is going to do in 2011 is actually cut doctors' pay 12 percent. Now, if anybody really believes in this room that we're going to cut doctors' pay by 10 or 12 percent, they're kidding themselves. This is another gimmick, more smoke and mirrors, more illusion for the people of this country. 
   The people of this country are smarter than that. When they recognize what this is, then I think that the majority is going to find out that they do not want the CHUMP bill passed.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am confused. The gentleman from Washington has been stating about micromanaging the NSF; and now that I see what this amendment does is not only try to micromanage what they do with their grants and their money, but it is also saying to me that these institutions that get these awards grants for the research from the NSF do not have a complete teaching ability to teach these graduate students how to put their thoughts to a nonscientist audience. 
   Now, to me, we are not only micromanaging the NSF, but now we are getting into some of these schools that receive these grants and saying: You are not doing a full curriculum enough that you can educate these young scientists and these young researchers into how to explain themselves to nonscientist audiences. 
   So I think you can't have your cake and eat it, too. Either we don't want to micromanage, and if we are going to micromanage, who is the ultimate decider of that? And also, are we going to start micromanaging what the curriculum is for these higher institutes of learning that are turning out these scientists? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Lynch). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I don't know how many people have been watching the last hour, and I don't know that I can straighten it out in the next hour. But I do want to start out with something that is kind of elementary, I guess, to most people, but I want to explain the makeup of Congress. And excuse my penmanship.     
   The House consists of 435 Members. The Democrats have 235, and that's because of the loss of the late Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   The Republicans have 199 Members. 
   You can see that the Democrat number is larger than our number. 
   To get anything passed in this body, it takes 218 votes. You can see that the Democrats have more than 218 votes. In the Senate, 100 Members; Democrats have 51, Republicans have 49. 
   The Democrats have had the majority in Congress since January of 2007. And so what that says to me is that all of the stuff that I have heard in the last hour, Mr. Speaker, if they've got all the answers, why haven't they been brought to the floor? 
   Now I'm sure that's a question that many of us are asking because if they are in control and they've got all of the brilliant ideas that's going to save the world, then why haven't they brought them to the floor and put 218 votes up to pass it out of the House? That's got to be a question on a lot of people's minds. 
   Now in order to gain the majority, there were some things said and some things promised during the campaign cycle that led up to the new majority. 
   Here is one of their promises: ``Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.'' 
   This was Speaker Pelosi in a New Direction for America, 2006. 
   Let me say that the sham of an energy bill that was brought to this floor yesterday was presented the night before to the Rules Committee at 10:45. This is just a little example of what we've been faced with and the fact that the new majority won that majority by saying such things as this that the people believed that they would actually carry on. 
   I will tell you that this is not a rule. They did not make this a rule. This was one of those empty promises. 
   Let's look at something else. Speaker Pelosi in 2006 before they gained the majority: ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
   Since the new majority has been in in 2007 and 2008, they have had over 60 closed rules, which means that there are no amendments, you can't bring your ideas here and have them openly debated. The last energy bill that was here was one of those rules. I might add in the 109th Congress when Republicans were in control, we had just about half of that amount in closed rules. 
   Now here is the thing that I think that most people will get a grasp on, Mr. Speaker. This was by Representative Paul Kanjorski when he was in his hometown after becoming the majority. He was in his hometown, and he was asked about the Democrats' promise to bring back the troops from Iraq. And as he was talking--but this kind of relates to everything that has been said by them to gain the majority--before he said this, he said, ``In our desire to win back the majority, we sort of stretched the truth and people ate it up.'' 
   Well, you know, that's something. 
   But then we got to the point where we're at today with the energy crisis. In 2007 when the Democrats took over, gas was about $2.10 a gallon. Unemployment was 4.5 percent. Today, gas is over $4 a gallon and employment is 6.1 percent, but yet they want to blame the Republicans. Now they're constantly blaming President Bush. I don't know, Mr. Speaker, but I have never seen President Bush in this body casting a vote. 
   In fact, if you've studied your government, you know that there's an executive branch, there's a legislative branch, and there's a judicial branch. The legislative branch is responsible for making laws. 
   Now if you go back to the first chart, you can remember that they have more than enough to pass anything that they want to in this body, and they control the Senate. 
   So what is the problem? We don't know. We want to understand why we are constantly being blamed. They talked about the economic problems. They've been in control since January of 2007. They passed a housing bill that gave Secretary Paulson the ability to do what he's doing with some of these bailouts. The majority of Republicans voted against that bill. So when are we going to take some responsibility and stop all of the blame shifting?  
   We've got some Members here tonight that might want to explain some of that to you because it's a problem when the people in control want to blame somebody else for their problems. I heard them mention the SCHIP. Why didn't they proceed with it, continue on with that leadership if they thought that was the right thing to do rather than caving? No idea. I have no idea. 
   Why have they not done some of the other things that they talk about that would help with the economic crisis that we find ourselves in today? Hopefully we will give you some of those answers. 
   Now I would like to recognize my good friend from the State of Tennessee (Mr. Wamp).

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. 
   And I wonder if the $9 billion bailout of IndyMac, the $29 billion bailout of Bear Stearns, the $85 billion bailout of AIG, the $200 billion bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which, under that bill, is some of the ability that they gave Secretary Paulson to do some of these bailouts. Also, the $300 billion exposure that they gave the American taxpayers to expand the FHA to refinance problem mortgages, and now they're talking about a $25 billion bailout for the automakers. So the gentleman from Tennessee has some great points. 
   But let me speak to the energy thing that he mentioned. In the bipartisan bill, there were 25 of the 35 Democrats  that sponsored this bill that voted against it; they were actually cosponsors. But let me tell you where a little of this makeup comes right quick. 
   Energy crisis: ``There is no energy crisis on our side of the aisle.'' And that was from a Democratic House aide that was written in the Politico on August 5, 2008. Also, according to Speaker Pelosi, ``If Democrats relented on drilling, then we might as well pack it up and go home.'' That was from July 11, 2008. Then we've got, ``This is a political month. There's all kinds of things we try to do that will just go away after we leave.'' And that's Representative John Murtha. 
   And if I could, Mr. Speaker, I would recall you to the quote that Mr. Kanjorski said: ``We kind of stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.'' So this makes me believe that what we've done here, just the sham that's gone on, might be just to fool people until after we leave. 
   ``This is all about politics, not necessarily about policy.'' And this comes from Karen Whalen, who is with the Natural Resources Defense Council, that she spoke of in September. 
   Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu, on the Democrats' latest energy plan, said, ``It is dead on arrival in the Senate.'' So when they passed this sham of a bill last night so they can go home and say that they passed an energy bill, even their own party in the Senate recognizes that this thing is dead on arrival. And some of the other comments, it was just politics, it is election-year stuff. 
   Now, this is the last quote I'm going to show you tonight from Speaker Pelosi, but her quote is, ``I'm trying to save the planet. I'm just trying to save the planet.'' Well, we wish that her and the Democratic majority would try to do something to relieve everyday Americans of the pain at the pump that we're facing, the loss of jobs that their economic policies that they've passed since they've been here have created, the fact that gas has been from a little over $2 to over $4, the fact that 17 of the refineries were closed down with Hurricane Ike and the 3,200 drilling platforms because they are in the direct path of hurricanes, when we could be expanding our energy resources to the east coast, to the west coast, to Alaska, where these hurricanes don't normally hit. 
   So keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, that Speaker Pelosi is trying to save the planet and not help the everyday American that is feeling the pain at the pump. 
   Now I want to recognize our distinguished policy chairman of the Republican Conference, the gentleman from Michigan.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the Policy Committee chairman. And you're exactly right, we owe it to the American people to stay here until we can put our partisanship aside, do a bipartisan bill that the American people--and we thought we had that last night with the motion to recommit, with all the Democratic cosponsors that were on it--to have a bill that we could pass, send to the Senate, and hopefully get some agreement on. 
   But you mentioned the process, that the process is important because, you know, when the process is broken, the product is flawed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to get too elementary, but this is a book that we give to children that come to this body, and it says, ``How Our Laws Are Made.'' The beginning of a bill: Propose a bill, introduce a bill, committee action, subcommittee action. The bill is reported, considered on the House floor. Vote the bill. Refer to the Senate. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, this is if we were going through the proper process that our Founding Fathers and people who had the idea--this is the process that was set up, and this is what we teach our young people that come to the Capitol. 
   Now, I will show you the chart that is being used right now by the majority. You have the beginning of the bill, propose a bill. And then you kind of go through the introduction, the committee action, the subcommittee action, and the bill is reported. It basically just kind of comes to the floor of the House. 
   So what we're teaching our kids is not exactly right. And so I think while the majority is in control of Congress, they may want to shift this a little bit and give the children a more accurate depiction of what's going on in the Congress. 
   And I will yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.

   As she showed on this chart here with the unemployment rate going from a little less than 4.5 percent up to over 6.1 percent, the correlation, if you will notice, is with the gas prices. All this has happened since the new Democratic majority took over. 
   When we look at this unemployment, we wonder is it because of record energy prices? Is it because of increased labor costs because of the minimum wage increase? Is it the assault on companies that are making too much profit? Is it the trade agreements that have been ignored? Is it the new government mandates on everything from cars to light bulbs that could be causing this unemployment rate to go up? 
   We need to talk about that for just a minute, and I recognize the gentleman from Tennessee.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the gentleman for that. I have just a few minutes to close. I appreciate all the kind folks that came here tonight to help me with this. 
   But I want to bring up one other thing that will characterize what the Democratic majority has said. I have already quoted Mr. Kanjorski on ``we sort of stretched the truth and the people ate it up.'' I read you quotes from then Minority Leader Pelosi, now Speaker Pelosi, and the things that the American people were told, Mr. Speaker, to be able to gain the majority. 
   But I want to tell you something that is a little more fascinating, and we will have to talk about this again. This Congress passed a card check bill. We all like to be in the privacy of the voting booth. Even if somebody asks you how you are going to vote, you say, hey, that is a personal matter. Because a lot of times the polls will say one thing, the election results are something else, because people get in that voting booth and they decide to do something else; or it may not have been the popular thing to talk about with the people they were with. 
   We passed a card check bill that said if you wanted to become unionized it would have to be an open vote; not anymore a secret ballot, but an open vote. They passed this in this Congress. The bill was introduced by Mr. George Miller. 
   But I want to read you a letter he sent to the Mexican Government in 2001. ``We understand that the secret ballot is allowed but not required by Mexican labor law. However, we feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose. We respect Mexico as an important neighbor and trading partner, and we feel that the increased use of the secret ballot in union recognition elections will help bring real democracy to the Mexican workplace.'' 
   They want to bring democracy to the Mexican workplace, but they want our guys not to have that same democracy that they want the Mexican workers to have. This is right in line with everything that we have heard tonight. 
   This Congress is being controlled by big labor, by environmentalists and by trial lawyers. If you fit into one of those groups, then you should be doing very well. If not, you are like all the rest of us; you are suffering at the pump, you are worried about how you are going to pay your high home heating oil bill, you are worried about your job as the unemployment rate is skyrocketing with the price of gas. You are living under the failed systems we have had in this body. And remember, they have 235 Members. It only takes 218 to pass something out of this House. 
   Quit whining. Get out of the fetal position and do something for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CHARLIE NORWOOD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, CHARLIE NORWOOD was a friend of mine, he was a friend of all Georgians, and he was a friend of every freedom loving person in this world, because he fought hard for you. 
   He was one of the original Republican revolutionaries that was elected in 1994, and he never really lost that spirit, that conservative fever. He agreed with Jefferson that the government that governs least, governs best, and he fought for 12 years in this House to make sure that regulations on business and individuals' lives were at a minimum. In fact, sometimes he called the government's reach into our lives oppressive. 
   Once CHARLIE was quoted in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, as saying, ``If I want to put bad wiring in my house and burn my family down, that is my problem, not the government's.'' 
   That was typical of CHARLIE. He was a witty warrior. When he joined me in the Voting Rights Act, trying to modernize section 5, the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, I had come up with two amendments. One of them had to do with putting the whole country under it, going through the same scrutiny. 
   I met with CHARLIE and CHARLIE said, ``Lynn, I want the modernization amendment to be the Norwood amendment.'' I said, ``That's fine, Charlie, but why?'' He said, ``Because I can do a better job than you can.'' That is the way he felt, and that is exactly the way he was. 
   That is just one example of why I called CHARLIE my ``foxhole buddy.'' When CHARLIE NORWOOD said he was with you, he was with you until the bitter end. You had his word that he would have your back, and his word was his bond. 
   His loyalty and love of country defined him throughout his life. The Valdosta High School football star went on to become a dentist who took his skills to the front lines of Vietnam, where he served his fellow soldiers and his Nation with valor. He served in Vietnam for a year and obtained the rank of captain and won two Bronze Stars. 
   For the next four decades, CHARLIE and his loving wife Gloria made their home Augusta, where they raised two children, Carlton and Charles, and he served his community with a smile on his face when he talked about his grandchildren. 
   So the thoughts and prayers of all Georgians go out to the Norwood family tonight, to let that family know that we are appreciative of the time that they allowed CHARLIE to come up here and to serve with us, to bring joy to our hearts and thoughts to our minds of what we could do to make this country a better place to live in. 
   The one thing that I want to close with is this, Mr. Speaker: In all of the discussions that I got into with CHARLIE NORWOOD about legislation he constantly said, ``Lynn, we have got to do what's right.'' That was his motto, to do what was right, and he did. It was an honor to call him friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, as I listen to the debate on this bill, and I agree with the majority of this bill, I heard the word ``tribe'' used over and over, and I think that was the intent of this, for Native American tribes to be recognized and be given the housing assistance and also the infrastructure assistance and all the things that they need. And I think it is very important that we recognize exactly who these tribes are. 
   What this amendment does, it strikes the section about the Native Hawaiians. Native Hawaiians share none of the unique characteristics possessed by recognized tribes in this country. Native Hawaiians never exercised sovereignty over Hawaiian lands or lived as a separate, distinct, racially exclusive community. All Hawaiians were subject to the same monarch in the late 1800s, regardless of race. 
   Native Hawaiians have never exercised inherent sovereignty as a native indigenous people, and our Constitution seeks to eliminate racial separation, not promote it. How can we promote equality while separating our people? 
   Tribes seeking recognition after statehood must adhere to a process established by the Federal Government. To be formally recognized, a tribe must demonstrate it has operated as a sovereign entity for the past century, was a separate and distinct community, and had a preexisting political organization. The Native Hawaiian people cannot meet these criteria. 
   The time for Native Hawaiians to establish themselves as an Indian tribe has since passed. When Hawaii was considering statehood in 1959, there was no push to establish a tribe. In fact, 94 percent of the people in 1959 supported statehood with no mention of being a tribe. 
   The Supreme Court ruled in 2000 in Rice that Native Hawaiians are an ethnic group and that it is illegal to give anyone preferential treatment on account of their membership in that group. It is unconstitutional to give one ethnic group a special preference over another ethnic group, and the oath of office that we took was to uphold the Constitution. 
   Therefore, I think it is appropriate, and I would ask all Members, to vote to take the Native Hawaiians out of this very important bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from Iowa for yielding. 
   Let me say that the chairman of the committee mentioned the overwhelming vote on an amendment, or the gentlelady from Hawaii did. I remind the House that on Wednesday, March 21, H.R. 835, the Hawaiian Homeownership Act of 2007, was defeated in this House. So I wanted to bring that to the attention of everybody. 
   The gentleman from Iowa said $25 million over the 4 years, and it is actually about $50 million. You know, I will be glad to work with the chairman of the committee or the delegation from Hawaii if they want to let Congress pass something to make them a recognized tribe, but they are not a recognized tribe. 
   All the discussion I have heard today, everything in this bill is about tribes, recognized tribes by this country. So I just ask that you support the amendment and then we will work out any problems that we can after that.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I want to call today your attention to something yesterday. We had a vote 213-212 to adjourn this House without passing a comprehensive energy bill, without being able to vote on drilling. So what I've done, Mr. Speaker, I've got a number here. Call (202) 224-3121. Ask for Speaker Pelosi if you want to make sure that we do something before we leave this Chamber today or tomorrow to vote on drilling; or call and ask for your Member of Congress and find out if they were the swing vote that made us leave this city without voting for you. 
   But I'll tell you what, not only are they leaving Washington, DC, they're going to get on jets on your dime. They're going to fly to Africa and Europe and all over this world on your dime while you don't have money at your house to go on a family vacation, or even go to the store sometimes, they're going to be flying around here. 
   Call this number. Mr. Speaker, I hope they will put it on the Internet. I hope we will let Speaker Pelosi, the Democratic leadership, know we're tired of this. We need to know where you stand. We need to drill for U.S. oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, if this undemocratic, smoke-and-mirrors Congress had been in power throughout our Nation's history, I am not sure we would have much to celebrate this weekend when we commemorate Presidents Day. On Monday, we honor the Presidents who guided our Nation through its toughest moments, Presidents who made tough decisions in the face of public skepticism despite great peril and unimaginable sacrifice. 
   Not all Americans supported General George Washington's campaign against the British, yet our Nation's father led a ragtag band of underfed and underequipped soldiers to victory over the greatest military of its day. 
   Not all Americans supported President Lincoln's decision to go to war to preserve the Union. It seems inevitable today, but, at the time, many Americans would have preferred to save the lives, treasure, and misery and just let the Nation cleave into two. But Lincoln decided to preserve the Union, a Union that, in time, would become the greatest, most powerful nation on earth, even though he had to wage the deadliest war in U.S. history, with 600,000 lives lost. 
   I wonder what the forebears of today's Democratic Party would think of their policy of retreat and defeat? What would they think of the timidity in the face of great danger? 
   What happened to the legacy of Woodrow Wilson, who faced down American skeptics to lead us to victory in World War I? 
   What happened to the legacy of FDR, who faced down American isolationists to defeat the evils of German fascism and the militarism of imperial Japan? 
   What happened to the legacy of Harry Truman, the first President to realize the peril of the Soviets and entered our war-weary Nation into the fight against the spread of communism? 
   The wisdom of their decisions wasn't necessarily clear to all Americans of their day, but the judgment of history validates their leadership. 
   Today, our Commander in Chief sees the danger to our Nation's security and freedom posed by Islamic extremist forces in the Middle East. Many in this Congress choose to believe that the violence in Iraq is a local problem. To some degree, it is, but it is also a problem for the United States. 
   If we were to follow the proposals of Democratic leaders, we would pull out our troops and let Iraq become a failed State. Anarchy in Iraq would give al Qaeda and other extremists a safe haven to train and plot attacks. It was in the failed states of the Sudan and Afghanistan that al Qaeda was able to plan the African embassy bombings, the attack on the USS Cole and the September 11 disasters. 
   The smoke and mirrors Democratic Congress wants it both ways. On the one hand, they say this is a nonbinding resolution. On the other hand, they say this is a first step. 
   Given how Democratic leaders have battled to one-up each other and have allowed their rhetoric to spiral, how can this nonbinding resolution be anything but a first step? 
   How can Democrats stop with the nonbinding resolution if they agree with Senator Obama that lives lost in Iraq have been ``wasted?'' 
   This nonbinding resolution expresses disapproval of the military plan to strengthen our forces in Iraq and give them the resources they need. By the end of this week, every Member of this House will be on the record and answerable to their constituents about whether they are for or against the military plan. 
   My colleagues who vote for this resolution are for one of two things. They are either for retreat and defeat, or stay the course. 
   We all agree that changes need to be made, that changes need to take us toward a stable and peaceful Iraq. Withdrawal would take us in the opposite direction. 
   Let's reject this smoke-and-mirrors resolution and continue to fight, take the fight to the terrorists.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the lady from Tennessee for her leadership in this and for her taking this late hour to come and be part of a group, the Republican Study Committee, that believes in fiscal conservatism, and are willing to stand up and fight, to be called names in this body. In fact, I think the lady and myself and others that have spoken here tonight have been called the fringe because we stand up and want to debate these issues and want to bring the truth to the American people. And to the lady from Tennessee, I just, you know, I think that we need to clarify to the people and let them understand what kind of position, not only us, but this whole House was put in today because less than 24 hours ago, at about 12:30 this morning, this bill, over 3,500 pages was filed.     
   Now, I don't know about the rest of you, and I'm sure the gentlelady from Tennessee, but I was in the bed then, sound asleep, as I'm sure most people were. I got up this morning and got dressed and got on a plane and came to D.C., but the first time this bill was debated and just the rule on this bill was about 5:30 tonight. 
   So put yourself in this position. Your financial officer for your company comes in and hands you a bill like this and says could you look at this and let me know if this is okay to finance this company for the rest of the year, and I need to know by about 8 o'clock tonight. Now, I think it would be impossible for them to do it. I think it would be impossible for any of us to do that. 
   It's been impossible for us to take 3,500 pages, something that weighs over 34 pounds, and try to consolidate that into information that we can base a vote on. It's impossible. 
   Talking about $515 billion. Now, when I was in the Georgia legislature, our State budget for 9 million people was a little over $16 billion, and I thought I realized how much $1 billion was but it was not until a friend of mine, Naomi Morgan, sent me an e-mail today, in fact, and pointed out several things to me. 
   One billion, if 1 billion were seconds and we went back 1 billion seconds, we would be in 1959. 1959 is 1 billion seconds from right now. And when you're talking about that, we just got through  passing a $515 billion bill in less than 24 hours, that's scary, isn't it? And. 
   The other thing is 1 billion minutes, if we went back 1 billion minutes from now, Jesus would be walking the earth. Jesus would be walking the earth 1 billion minutes ago. 
   Sometimes we lose perspective. We've been up here too long when we just throw around the word ``billion,'' but we were asked today to vote in less than 24 hours on a 3,500 page bill, weighs over 35 pounds, and contained $515 billion worth of spending. 
   You know, that shows me that the process is broken, and when the process is broken, the product is flawed. This process has been broken. 
   Now, we were lied to or misled. I'd hate to think that they purposely lied, but I think they misled us and the American people, the majority party, on the first day when they talked about a new open process, a new bipartisan spirit. See, I represent about 700,000 people, as every Member in this body does, and those 700,000 people want to have some type of input into the situation, and you know, unfortunately, I've not had any input in this bill. There has not been any amendments to be allowed. 
   We could not look at all the 9,000 or so earmarks in this bill to see if they were justified, but I do want to tell the American people, because one of the things other than spending too much of their money has been illegal immigration. Now, that is a high topic, and I want the American people, and I think this is very important because every town hall meeting I have and I don't know about you, every town hall meeting I have, every teleconference I have, the hottest topic that we have is illegal immigration. Now, this should really at least let the public know the priorities that the majority party has. 
   $10 million in this bill in that 3,500-page bill over there, $10 million of it went for emergency spending for defense attorneys for illegal immigrants. $10 million of that bill goes for defense attorneys in emergency spending for illegal immigrants; yet we did not fund our troops in Iraq one dime.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I was going to say, and trust me, what you were just talking about as far as meeting these requirements, trust me, this $10.5 million that we're spending on these defense attorneys for these illegal immigrants, trust me, they're going to law you up and keep us from building that fence. 
   And you know, now when my constituents say, Congressman, why aren't we building that fence, why aren't we securing the border, then I've got something I can tell them now. I can give them that 3,500-page bill, of course there's no telling what it would cost them to get a copy of that, 35 pounds of paper there, and say it's in this bill that we will build the fence but only under certain conditions. 
   And I think the gentlelady from Tennessee, or anybody that's had a town hall meeting, would agree that these people do not care about the conditions. The only conditions they want is they want a fence. They want a border. They want a secure country because no country without secure borders is secure. 
   And so that's what the American people want, not stumbling blocks and not something big enough to hide $10.5 million in for defense attorneys in emergency spending. Now, this is emergency spending for the illegal immigrants. We've got some true emergencies, but it's not in defending them. It's in allowing them to come here. 
   So I just hope that the American people, that tonight somehow that we have made a difference or maybe had at least some eye opening with some of the information that we've given them about this bill over 
   here that we were asked to vote on today, and I hope that they will understand that this is not an easy process. 
   But the process is broken, and I will be honest with you, it was broken when we were in charge, but it's lost another wheel. We may have only been one wheel short when we were in charge, but trust me, both axles are broken right now, and it's just being drug along the ground. It is broken. The product is flawed. 
   We need to start over. I would hope that the President would veto this bill. I would hope that he would veto this bill and get us back to the table so we can take some of these things back out, save the taxpayers some money. 
   But I do appreciate, again, the leadership of the gentlelady from Tennessee and her willingness to come here this late at night and try to explain some of this to the American people so that they can have a better understanding of some of the challenges that we're faced with and some of the opportunities that the majority party is taking with smoke-and-mirror bills like we passed today. 
   So I want to thank the gentlelady.

But then when I tell them they put up roadblocks about building the fence and we didn't fund our troops in Iraq, they're going to be upset about that. And then when I tell them about the $10 million in emergency spending for defense attorneys, I think they are really going to be mad about that. 
   I hope the American people get a good grip on this.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (THE PELOSI PREMIUM -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to read to you, Mr. Speaker, a memo from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that was sent out in 2006. This was sent out to the Democratic candidates, and it was obtained by the Chicago Tribune. 
   ``Demonstrate your dedication for fighting for middle-class families by clearly explaining how you will work to keep down the price of gas if elected to Congress. Hold an event at a gas station or other logical locations where you will call for real commitment to bringing down gas prices and pledge that, as a Member of Congress, you will fight for families in your district, not the oil and gas executives for which  this Republican Congress has fought so hard.'' 
   Now those are some pretty interesting comments coming from the DCCC. On May 10, 2006, Baron Hill said this: ``In Congress, I will support measures that will strengthen our economy and lower gas prices instead of rewarding big oil companies and special interest lobbies.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, once Mr. Hill got elected to Congress and voted to raise taxes on the American energy producers, he was somehow shocked when higher taxes resulted in higher gas prices. 
   March 12, 2007, in a press release Mr. Hill said, ``Gasoline prices have increased significantly over the past few weeks, with little explanation for higher prices.'' The explanation for higher prices is because of higher taxes. 
   Mr. Joe Donnelly in a July 3, 2006, interview: ``I will be an independent voice who will represent the people of the second district. Not the wealthy oil and pharmaceutical companies that have bought our Congress and are running our country. We need leaders who will stand up for good jobs, a better prescription drug plan for our seniors, and a real energy plan that will work to drive down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   Mr. Donnelly, I'm sure your constituents and the people of this country are waiting for that energy to go forth in some results. 
   April 26, 2006, press release by Mr. Ed Markey: ``Congress once again has an opportunity to help the American people through this financial pinch.'' Keep in mind, the Republicans were in charge and the Democrats were trying to win votes, Mr. Speaker. 
   ``But by ignoring legislation like the Windfall Profits and Consumer Assistance Act, Congress has shown, once again, that it would rather put the needs of the special interests ahead of the needs of the American people. There is a cost to this kind of corruption in Washington, and it's at $75 a barrel and climbing.'' 
   Mr. Markey, the price today is $113 a barrel, and you have not reintroduced your Windfall Profits and Consumer Assistance Act to Congress. 
   But what have we done? I tell you what we have done. The chairman of Energy and Commerce has got a solution: raise gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon. I don't think that's what the American people had in mind. 
   July 26, 2006, in a town hall meeting, Jim Clyburn, who is now the majority whip, says this: ``Thomas from Orangeburg asks: What are you doing about gas prices? They're ridiculously high.'' Mr. Clyburn answered, ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices. We have outlined our plan in a proposal called Energizing America. I join my fellow Democrats in believing that drilling for more oil is not a long-term solution to our Nation's energy crisis.'' 
   What is it? Buying bicycles? The Pelosi plan? Thirty bicycles for $30,000? Raising taxes? Fifty cents a gallon by the chairman of Energy and Commerce proposal? Five cents a gallon by the chairman of Transportation? A dollar a barrel of oil from the chairman of Transportation? Those are some great ideas. 
   April 27, 2006, when gas was $2.91 a gallon, and I will remind you that it's $3.44 today, a letter to Speaker Hastert signed by 88 Democratic Members of Congress, they said this: ``Just this week, the price for oil increased to over $70 a barrel.'' Don't we yearn for those days of $70 a barrel when it's $113 today? 
   We believe Congress has an obligation to determine the underlying causes behind the skyrocketing prices. Congress has an obligation to take action on behalf of the consumer. Where is the action? 
   All bark, no bite.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (PETITION TO LOWER GASOLINE PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight to address you and the other Members of this body. And I wanted to bring to the attention, Mr. Speaker, the fact that I guess several weeks ago we had calls from constituents and seeing constituents at town hall meetings and other places. They had asked me if I had been on-line or on the Internet to sign some of the petitions that different people had up to bring down the price of gas. They were tired of going to the pump and paying $4 a gallon for the gas. 
   They had heard the promises from the Majority of the 110th Congress made back when they were running for office, that they had a commonsense plan to bring down the cost of skyrocketing gas which, at the time, was about $2.20. It's now about $4.08. So they were mystified as much as I was about what this secret plan was. And so they were going on-line and signing these Internet petitions asking us or letting us know, Members of this body, that they were demanding that gas prices come down, and by doing that, to drill here and to drill now. 
   One of those Internet sites, and there's many, but one is American Solutions. And I understand today, from reading an article, that over a million Americans have gone to that site and said, you know what? Let's drill here, let's drill now, and let's lower gas prices. 
   And so I was thinking to myself because I had gone into a service station to fill up with the $4 a gallon gas in my pickup truck, and there was a petition laying on the counter that said, you know, we want our gas prices brought down. Sign this petition. 
   And I thought, you know, not only is this an Internet, but people that are working at these service stations and I'm sure other places are having these petitions saying, you know, we need our energy costs brought down. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I said, you know, the American people need to know how their Members of Congress feel. We're hearing from them on all of these different petitions how they feel. They need to know how their representative feels. 
   So I came up with a petition. And basically, this petition says, American energy solutions for lower gas prices. And it brings onshore oil on-line. It brings deep water oil on-line. And it brings new refineries on-line. And that's pretty simple. That's about as simple as you can get in this body. 
   Everything we vote on here is so convoluted that many of the Members don't understand what they're voting on, Mr. Speaker. And a majority of the American people do not know. Some of these bills are three and four and 500 pages. And it's hard to consume all that information and understand what is going on. So a lot of Members can have an excuse to vote for or against it because, as Mr. Obey said today on the floor, they make these bills to get 218 votes. So they take these bills and put as many sweeteners in it as they need to to get to 218. So many Members can say, well, it was a bad piece of legislation, but because they put X, Y, or Z in it, I voted for it. 
   I wanted to keep this petition as simple as possible. And so basically, what the petition says, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production, to lower gas prices for Americans. How much simpler can you get? 
   Mr. Speaker, you can't imagine some of the answers from the Members of this body for not wanting to sign this. They're unbelievable. I don't know how they're going to explain it to their constituents, but their constituents have an opportunity to see, and we update this, Mr. Speaker, on our Web site, which is house.gov/westmoreland, W-E-S-T-M-O-R-E-L-A-N-D. We update it after every series of votes, so it will be updated probably in about 30 or 45 minutes. It will be updated and you can go to that Web site. And we had 32,000 hits on that Web site last night, for people wanting to go and see how their congressman felt about it. 
   Now, we've had about 160 Congressmen that have signed this so far, so we're probably about 58 short of getting to 218, which is what you need to pass this. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would encourage all Americans to go to that and to find out how the Members of this House feel about lowering gas prices in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, Congressman Price. Thank you for doing the Official Truth Squad. It is an honor to be here with Colonel Kline. Like he said, the number of our Vietnam veterans is declining every year, and we are fortunate enough to serve with some great heroes from that war in this body. 
   It is interesting that we have talked about micromanaging, we have talked about different people taking on the role of general. Today in the Committee on Government Reform when we were passing out a bill that I feel is unconstitutional to give the D.C. Delegate the ability to vote and also creating another seat in Utah, I was reading the Constitution and I came across the part where it called the President the Commander in Chief. This is something that our Founding Fathers I think had experienced through the Revolutionary War and through the different militias and the different bands of people, that they understood that we needed one Commander in Chief. So they gave that responsibility to the man who is ultimately responsible for what goes on in this country, the guy that, as Harry Truman put it, the buck stops here. They gave the President the responsibility to be the Commander in Chief. 
   Now, we have several people in this body who I think want to be the Commander in Chief. In fact, I think we have got probably over 200 people that think they need to be the Commander in Chief. But the truth of it is our Constitution only gives that to one person. 
   What the Constitution also does is give Congress the ability to put forth funds for this war. If that is what the President decides to do, it gives Congress the ability to do that. It also gives them the ability to declare war. 
   This House voted and the Senate voted to authorize President Bush to use the military force that he has used, and if they don't like that, then they need to do something to call that authority back or to reauthorize or not to reauthorize. But we need to quit micromanaging and interfering with the affairs of our military leaders. General David Petraeus was approved unanimously in the Senate. Then the very next week they are trying to tell him how to run the war. 
   The other interesting thing is, and I think Ms. Foxx spoke about all the pork that is in this supplemental bill to fund the war, which, by the way, I think the President asked for about 3 or 4 weeks ago, so we want to make sure we do have these funds for our troops and not just keep prolonging it. But it would be good to hurry and bring this bill to the floor, since they have called it an emergency spending bill. But as Ms. Foxx pointed out, there are several things in there that really aren't what I would consider emergency spending. 
   One of the other things that has been taken out of that is the Iran language. I don't know if you had seen that or Colonel Kline or any of you had seen that, but they have taken the Iran language out of it. 
   I wanted to quote something, Congressman, because I think this is kind of what we are seeing out of the majority party, is they will say one thing about one situation and something counter to that on something else. 
   Here is what was said about the Iran situation: ``I don't think it was a very  wise idea to take things off the table if you are trying to get people to modify their behavior and normalize it in a civilized way.'' 
   That was a quote from Representative Gary Ackerman, talking about that if we tied the hands of the President, that it would take away any threat off the table that he might have to use against Iran to make them follow the U.N. resolution or some of the things that we have asked them to do. I think that is very unusual, or at least concerning to me, that on the one hand they are tying the President's hands on what he is doing in Iraq, but they don't want to tie his hands on what he is doing in Iran. 
   Hopefully one day we will see some decisive leadership come out of this Congress. I think that the Republicans gave 12 good years of leadership, and I hope that the American people will miss that one day, as bad as we were at times. I hope that they will miss that and want to put us back in that position where we can earn our way back into the leadership of this country. 
   But I certainly hope that in the next year and a half that we don't do things that will ruin our reputation with freedom-loving people all over this world, that the American people don't keep their word. 
   Colonel Kline, I can't help but just think about that picture of that last helicopter leaving South Vietnam and those people standing on the top of that government building with their hands reached out, knowing that after our troops pulled out because of political pressure that some of those people were probably murdered and massacred the next day, or at least within the next 30 days.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, when we use the term ``slow bleed,'' let's think about what that means. If you are going to torture your enemy or want somebody to have the most painful death possible, you give them a 
   slow bleed. You let them bleed out very slowly. You are a doctor and you know that can be the most painful death in the world. 
   That is what they are doing, is a slow bleed. It is going to be a painful death, not only for our military and for the victory we want to have in Iraq and Afghanistan, but for those people that the colonel is talking about. And those people have been our allies in this. Those are the people that believe with all their heart and mind and soul and every breath that they want to breathe freedom and liberty. Those are the people that believe in what we believe in, and they have pulled alongside of us to make this work. Those are the first ones that are going to be slaughtered. 
   So thanks for giving me the opportunity to come down and speak, and thanks for doing the Truth Squad. I just look forward to continuing this debate one day.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. To get 22 million people to smoke, I don't know how much money we will have to appropriate to a ``get smoking campaign.'' We have been spending millions and millions of dollars, as the gentleman from Arizona knows, trying to get people to recognize the health effects of cigarette smoking and to quit. So I think for the Democrats to have this proposal, and I understood the gentleman from Arizona to say, too, that not only is the 61 cent cigarette tax misleading that it would fund the program, that they have a cliff that this program falls off of after 5 years and 6 months. 
   We have got the chart right here that shows that this is really more smoke and mirrors trying to get around the PAYGO in the fact that this is fully funded for the first 5 years and 6 months, and then after that, it drops off about 80 percent. And you can see over here the red line goes down. 
   Now, anybody who believes that we should let these families get on this health insurance program and then pull the rug out from under them is not fair. In fact, what has happened, when this program was first initiated under Republican control in 1997, there was a need there to help people who made 200 percent or less of the poverty level, and that is about $42,000. So we said, If your children are uninsured, we have got a program that can help you. And we let the States administer it. 
   There are over, I believe the gentleman from Arizona, I don't know if you quoted this or not, but I think there is probably close to between a half million and a million children in the United States today that were eligible and had not been insured yet by these States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. That's right. That is a great point. The Republican Congress, in 1997, when they came up with this program, and they funded this program, it was a block grant to the States. And they thought that the States would be there looking after these children that belonged to families under the 200 percent poverty level that didn't have health insurance to give them some affordable, or at least some, health care. But what happened is these States didn't work hard enough to go out looking for these children, so they said, Look, we'll insure adults.     
   Then you learn from your mistakes. This program has been going on 10 years, and I think the President and the administration saw some of the errors that were in this program and tried to correct them and want to correct them in a new bill. 
   What it would do is say, look, all the States are going to be at a 200 percent poverty level. What has happened is States such as New Jersey and others have gone in and gotten waivers to go up to 300 and 400 percent, and that has caused a disbalance in some States that have taken their block grant, that have insured the children, spent the money wisely, and then others that have taken advantage of the system.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Eighty thousand dollars-plus. To me, this program was intended for those poor children that were in a situation with a family of four making $42,000 that could not afford the health insurance, so the government stepped in and said we are going to help you out. 
   We as Republicans want to see these children insured. We don't want to see the program being abused as is being done now. So I think that is the point that is so hard to get back to, is the point that we want to do this. The President has increased the funding. 
   But, you know what? It is one of those things that I think the gentleman from Arizona said this in his opening comments, the name of the bill sounds so good. There are a lot of smart people up here that make these pieces of legislation have great names, that you just feel like I can't vote against this because of what it is named. 
   This bill's original intent was to help the children in families of four that makes less than $42,000. We are now trying to make it now where families that make up to $84,000 can taken their children off of private insurance and immediately put them on this government program. 
   Let me say this: I think this is the first step to national health care. I don't know that that has been brought out enough. But if you go back and look at the national health care program that the Clinton administration brought up in 1993, if you look at what one of the Presidential candidates said, if we can't get the whole enchilada, let's try to do the kids first. This is going back to that.

And the fact that the negotiations on this bill has gone on between Democratic House Members and Republican Senate Members. They have not even opened up a dialogue with the chairmen of Energy and Commerce or of Ways and Means to look at pay-fors for this bill.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Well, I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Texas for his participation and for his willingness to come here tonight and to lead it with the expertise that he has had as former chairman of Energy and Commerce and that he has now as the ranking member. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Altmire for his willingness to participate, and I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
   While we don't necessarily agree on a lot of the facts, I think it has been a good example of why we need to have committee hearings. I was glad to hear that the gentleman from Michigan's bill is going to actually have a markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee, so I think that's a positive step in that we're finally, hopefully, having the majority ask for the minority's input. 
   It does concern me a little bit as to what Speaker Pelosi said today in her quote, that she is going to continue to do these things under suspension. Mr. Speaker, I believe that that is out of fear that we will come back with a motion to recommit. 
   Let me say this: While we're talking about gas today, we cannot regulate ourselves out of this crisis. While we came down today to discuss, I thought, some U.S. oil production and drilling, it's good that we got into some of the other things that the majority is saying are causing these gas prices to go so high, but even from listening to them about this not affecting it immediately, we need to look to the future for our children and for our grandchildren. So I hope we'll continue this discussion. 
   Again, I want to thank all of the parties who participated. 
   Mr. Altmire, I will yield back to you. 
   I think the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) would like to say something.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I guess I may not have posed my question just exactly right, but my question would be to you, this is a 10-year process. This is a 10-year process, and I'm assuming that each acre of land that has been leased, by whoever leased it, is in some part of this process of obtaining production or getting permits in order to produce. And my question is, do you know of any of the 68 million acres that are not in some process? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. A very complicated chart, and I'm not going to attempt to explain it all, but I will say that the purple is the pre-leasing process. Your orange is the leasing process. The blue is the notice of staking process, and then the green is the application for permit to drill. And if you will notice these little red blotches on here, these are points of entry for people who want to start litigation during this process. 
   In 1992, the Democratic majority extended the leasing process from, I believe it was either 3 or 5 years to 10 years. And so I think a Democrat majority realized that this was a very burdensome process and could not be done in the time period that these oil companies have been given and extended it to 10 years. 
   So, you know, I just think that when we talk about 68 million acres, out of the 2.5 billion acres that are available that we could be drilling in, that it's not fair to say that, you know, use-it-or-lose-it, when the people that have leased it are somewhere on this chart trying to make this land that they have leased be productive for U.S. oil production.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. But I do think if you do say the 68 million acres out there, that they need to either use it or lose it, and the reality is that they're trying to use it. They're just in some part of this process, and you know, even if it's the Corps of Engineers, I know there're several sites where the Corps is actually being sued, and these companies have to wait on the Corps to work through their lawsuit before they can get back into the permitting process. And then there's other stumbling blocks that they have to go through. 
   But I just find it interesting that the Democrat majority in 1992 was the one that extended this to 10 years because they understand that the trouble and the amount of paperwork and filings and permitting process that you have to go through, and then the same party would come back and say, well, there's 68 million acres out there that they're not using and so, therefore, they need to lose it when they are actually within the law, within that 10-year period, and as far as I know, each and every one of them that have obtained the lease are in some part of this process.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I disagree with that because I feel that what the American people want us to do is to increase our oil production. I think that they want to see something like the gentleman from Texas talked about in 2005, that this government could come together and we could streamline. I mean, we've got enough smart people in our government that could streamline this process some to bring it about, and I know that the gentleman's in favor of that, and I look forward to working with you and Mr. Barton to be able to streamline this so we can get production on the ground quicker. 
   Now, let me say that, you know, being from an agriculture State in Georgia, there's certain areas of the State that we grow apples. There's certain areas of the State that we grow cotton. There's areas of this country that produce more corn than other areas, and you wouldn't plant corn, let's say, in the north Georgia mountains because you wouldn't get near as good a yield as you would maybe in Nebraska or somewhere else. 
   At the same time, out of 2.5 billion acres of land, and knowing the area that's in the ANWR, and knowing the 2 trillion barrels of shale that are out West that we know are there, why wouldn't we open those up and give companies an opportunity to go out there? And it would not take 22 years to increase our oil production in some of these areas, and later on, we'll be showing a map of how much quicker I think we could get this oil into our refineries, which brings up another point, and then I will sit down because the gentleman from Texas has been so kind to yield. 
   But the other thing we need to talk about tonight I think is the increased refinery capability and the fact that, in our country, we've not built a refinery in 30 years. And we are right now importing almost 7 billion barrels of refined gas into this country and about the same amount of refined diesel. So, with that, I will sit down.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I just want to point out to my friend that this cause is not, you know, the spike that we usually see is not some type of temporary disruption, but it's a demand from all over the world, not just this country, our demand has gone down some. It's not just this country. But if you look at China and Asia and India, their demand for this oil is going up every day. And if you look at where the world's supply of these imports that come into this country, if you look at Nigeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and then if you look at our ability and all the different types of untapped domestic resources that we have, we could get over and help ourselves by producing this. 
   And so, just like you said, it's not just the supply and demand, it's the fact that we have to import all of this when we have these untapped domestic resources at our hand right here for us to use. And I think that's the reason 73 percent of the American people are saying, hey, look, use some of this stuff. 
   And with that, I yield back.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. If I could use these last few minutes to kind of straighten out a few points, at least my opinion. 
   Mr. Rahall mentioned that the ``use it or lose it'' legislation was pro-drilling. And I had the chart up, and I thought we were in complete agreement that the 68 million acres that are leased are in some process of permitting. So that is not a pro-drilling bill. If it was a pro-drilling bill, then what we have done would have been to reduce the regulations to allow this to speed up. 
   And let me say this. We have not exported any Alaskan oil in 8 years. And what this brings to highlight, and I hope the gentlemen from Michigan and Pennsylvania will take note of this and the fact that we have had so many conflicting facts here. This is a good reason that we need to have committee hearings, subcommittee hearings, committee hearings, and open debate on this floor. The energy bills that we have passed so far have come under suspension. So there have not been any committee hearings on it. 
   Speaker Pelosi said, ``We are trying to get the job done around here.'' This is her defending the use of suspensions. ``And we work very hard to build consensus, and when we get it, we like to just move forward with it, as we did on the Medicare bill,'' which was a suspension bill we don't even need to talk about. But this is not about a tool; it's about the legislative process and how we get a job done. 
   We have seen tonight and, Mr. Speaker, I think the American people have seen tonight that there are so many conflicting reports that we need to have committee hearings. We need to go through regular process so we can debate these bills on the floor. 
   The last comment I will make, in 1995 President Clinton vetoed drilling in ANWR. By today's projections from Energy, they said that we would be getting 1 million barrels of oil a day today. That was 13 years ago. We would be getting 1 million barrels of oil. And quoting Senator Schumer, from the other side of the aisle, he said an additional 1 million barrels of oil a day produced in this country would lower gas 50 cents a gallon. 
   So the gentleman from Texas sees these things, that we need to go through regular order and let your Committee on Resources have some input.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, it's good to be here tonight. And we're going to talk a little bit about what is on most people in this country's mind, and that's the price of gas, and the price of energy in general. 
   We're going to be talking about gas tonight and the expense that it takes for American families to go on vacation, just go to work, even go to the store, Mr. Speaker. And so I know that's at the forefront of most Americans' minds today. 
   Let me just start out by saying that what we want to do tonight, Mr. Speaker, is just point out a few things that may be not consistent with what's coming out of the majority's side about what we're doing about gas prices and what can be done about the price of gasoline now. And we've heard everything from, well, it will take 22 years to get any oil that's in the ground now, that's in our Outer Continental Shelf or in our national lands to the market. And that's not true. And so we're going to talk a little bit about that tonight. And I'm joined by friends of mine, the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Illinois, and we're going to share some of those things. 
   But first of all, Mr. Speaker, let me explain that about, I guess, a month ago I was approached by constituents in my district, and they were talking to me about petitions, and petitions that were on the Internet, calling and asking me if I had signed petitions. Some of them were ``increase domestic oil drilling,'' which American Solutions had, some are ``gas tax holiday'' that presidential candidate Senator McCain had, ``develop alternative energy sources,'' which is Energypetition.com. 
   And then there were petitions against drilling in ANWR. Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer from California had one, and Mr. Speaker, the Sierra Club, Green Peace. There were different petitions. There was actually a ``cap oil company profits by new government regulations.'' There are some people in the majority that believe that we can actually regulate our way out of this energy crisis, so one of those was Moveon.org. 
   After talking to my constituents about all these different petitions--and they were calling me and asking me if I had signed, they were going to these web pages and either signing or voicing their protest--I was at a service station at home and there was another petition there and it said, ``sign this petition if you want to lower gas prices.'' And I'm assuming that the proprietor of that station was doing that to give people something to do when they were paying for their gas rather than fuss at him. But what it brought to mind is we, in this body, Mr. Speaker, are beginning to see how our constituents feel about this. 
   I know today we were at a press conference where American Solutions presented the minority leader in the House and in the Senate with a petition. And I think later on--I don't know whether it's this week or next week--they're going to present this same petition to the majority leader in both the House and the Senate, it may be even Mr. Reid in the Senate and Speaker Pelosi here in the House. 
   But what I decided to do was to come up with a petition so our constituents would know how the Members in this body--the 435 Members that are elected to be voting Members, the seven delegates from the American territories here--I decided that, you know, it would be good for those constituents to be able to see how their representative felt about increasing our oil production to lower the gas prices because that's one of the things that is going to help us. And it's more of an ``all of the above,'' but one of the key ingredients is just voting or having a vote that we could increase our oil productions, whether that's shale oil, oil coming from biomass--which is a new technology that's coming out today--whether it's drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf, drilling on Federal lands, drilling in ANWR, whatever the case may be. So I came up with a simple petition, and it says, ``American energy solutions for lower gas prices: Bring onshore oil online, bring deepwater oil online, and bring new refineries online.'' 
   And, Mr. Speaker, a lot of people may not realize that we have not built a refinery in about 30 years in this country. And even some of the refineries that are online today produce diesel that has to be exported because it does not meet the new sulfur limits that we have put on some of the diesel fuel that's used in this country. And so I came up with this, and then I made a simple petition, Mr. Speaker. 
   And I think this petition is probably just too simple for some of the people in this body because it's not a piece of legislation, it is simply a statement, Mr. Speaker, to the people that they represent to let those people know how they feel about increasing U.S. oil production. And it simply says, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' And that's about as simple as you can get because I think that's what the American people, Mr. Speaker, want to see is that we're doing something, that we're taking some action. 
   You know, we have voted on several bills in probably the last 2 weeks, ``use it or lose it,'' which a lot of my colleagues from the majority side went home and told their constituents that this was a pro-drilling bill. Well, I disagree with that, it was not a pro-drilling bill; and it was actually very misleading in the fact of use it or lose it, and we'll go into that in just a minute. 
   But so far, Mr. Speaker, we've had 191 Members sign this. We've had eight Democrats, 183 Republicans that have signed it. Of course it takes 218 to do anything in this body.     
   But this is not a discharge petition. This is just a simple pledge, or not really a pledge. It's just a petition that people can sign to let their constituents know. 
   And what we have done to make it easy, Mr. Speaker, for people to realize or to understand if their representative has signed this is we set up a little Web page. It's www.house.gov/westmoreland. And on there we have people that have signed it, we have people that have refused to sign it, and then those that we have not talked to yet that have not signed. So, Mr. Speaker, I would encourage you, if you wanted to know how different Members in your delegation either signed or not signed and just for people would know that they could go to this Web site, www.house.gov/westmoreland, to find out. 
   And it's interesting because of some of the articles and press releases that I have been reading, I guess, for the last week or so, what we have got is we have got people going home saying one thing and then coming back to Washington and doing something else or not doing what they said they were going to do for the people that vote them into office. So I would hope that we could finally make people match their walk to their talk. So I think this is just an interesting tool that people can use to find out if their Congress person is matching the talk. 
   I yield to my friend from Illinois.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Illinois, and I want to just comment on a couple of things he said. 
   Those things that you proposed would create American jobs, good-paying jobs. Most of those refineries are union jobs, and these are jobs that are going out of the country right now because there's not enough work here. And building these pipelines, building the refineries, the oil rigs, the things to convert the coal to liquid, I mean these are American jobs and American money that are going overseas and out of this country. And we hear the majority complain all the time about our sending jobs out of the country. This is what we are doing. And not only that, for people who talk about our trade deficit, and I know my friend from Texas can talk about that, but these are all things that we need to take into account. And like my friend from Illinois said, this is an all of the above. 
   The other thing that that brings up is we know that the three energy bills that were brought to the floor were under suspension. Now, Mr. Speaker, you know what ``under suspension'' means. And just to explain a little bit, ``under suspension'' means that you have about 20 minutes of debate on each side, a total of 40 minutes, no amendments, and typically there hasn't been a hearing, a committee hearing. So while we are passing these bills, and, in my opinion, it's been putting lipstick on a pig because some of these things that we have passed are already the law, just not being enforced, and other things I don't really believe are helping, they are just political correctness that we are trying to do, but there has been no input from  the minority. A side that represents about 50 percent of the people in this country have no input into the process. So I know you would have some great input into the process if we could just be allowed to have an amendment on the floor. But for some reason, the majority is afraid to allow us to have a vote. 
   I want to read one thing that Speaker Pelosi said yesterday about using suspensions. She said, ``We are trying to get our job done around here, and we work very hard to build consensus. And when we get it, we like to just move forward with it, as we did on the Medicare bill,'' which is one of the largest expenditures we have had probably this year in this Congress that was done under suspension, ``as we did with the SPR bill, and the list goes on and on. But it is not about a tool. It's about the legislative process and how we get a job done.'' 
   That legislative process that's being done in this House today is broken. And when the legislative process is broken, the product is flawed. And I think that's what we have seen because if you look at when Republicans took Congress, gas was $1.44 a gallon. When the Democrats took control, it was $2.10 a gallon. And now it's $4.11 a gallon. This is what you get from working with a broken process and doing political correctness over the people and using power and politics over doing what is right. So this is what you end up with.     
   And this is what the American people, Mr. Speaker, are complaining about and rightfully so. Because we have the ability to provide our own energy resources. But because of politics, we are being voted from even having discussions on this floor or taking a vote on anything that we believe would be both a short-term and a long-term. 
   I would like to recognize my colleague from Texas, Mr. Conaway.

If you could just touch on that very briefly.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. But there is still a permitting process that I want to talk about. And the very fact when we hear the other side say that it will take 22 years to get anything out of these wells, you are talking about 2 years to get natural gas. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say that natural gas was about $6.60 a thousand cubic feet last year, and it is about $12 this year. So while we have a lot of Americans feeling the pain at the pump this winter, they are certainly going to feel the pain at home. 
   I want to point out that this chart takes in the leasing process. And this purple area right here is the preleasing process. The orange is the leasing process, and then the blue is the notice of staking and the green is the application to drill. This is on Federal on shore oil and gas leasing and permitting process. Every time you see one of these red dots here, this is a point of entry for legal action. 
   And so you can see that this process is a lengthy process. When the majority talks about 68 million acres in the use or lose it, last night as we had an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to go back and forth for 2 hours with the majority, I think that they admitted that that 68 million acres that they are claiming, and we don't know, Mr. Speaker, where that 68 million figure came from because that was done not by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service but by a committee report from the majority in the Resources Committee. So we don't even know how they came up with the 68 million acres. 
   But the point is that 68 million acres is somewhere in this process. It is somewhere in this process. So the use it or lose it is a very, very misleading statement. 
   I would like to recognize my friend from Texas.

   You are right. What the Republican message has been is all of the above. You know, we believe in conservation. We believe in renewable energy. We believe in wind and solar, but we also believe in the new technology that's environmentally safe that we can use to drill in these deep-water areas of the Outer Continental Shelf that we can use to get shale oil out of the ground in the western States, which this Congress, in May of 2007--and I don't have the chart up here with me tonight--but in May of 2007 is when the speculation market shot sky high on the price of oil because they saw that night in May when Mr. Udall's amendment was passed that said we could no longer drill or mine for the shale oil in the western States where there are 2 trillion, 2 trillion with a T, barrels of oil. 
   It is off limits, and I want to say that H.R. 6, which was passed by this body, under a closed rule, which means there was no amendments, no amendments allowed whatsoever from the minority, that they passed it. We called it the no-energy bill. At the time it was passed, gas was about $2.25 a gallon. 
   I want to read one comment that was made, this is on January 18 of 2007, H.R. 6. ``It is sad to see the Republicans come to this. Now they are laughably saying that this will lead to higher prices.'' That was Mr. DeFazio from Oregon, and this was on the Democrat energy bill. 
   We said then that it will lead to higher gas prices, and we were right. What we are saying now is let's look at all the measures, all the measures. We heard my friend from Texas say, in a 2-year period they were getting natural gas out of the wells at the Dallas airport. This can happen, but in order to happen, we have to get out of the fetal position. We have to get out of that political correctness mode and do what's right. 
   In order to do what's right, we need to have an open-rule bill come to this floor so all 435 Members of this body can have some input and all Americans can be represented in this body and it not just be a closed place. Let me say this, when the process is broken, the product is flawed. 
   This process is broken. We ask the majority--we ask the American people to help us create an open process so all views can be put out. Then all of the above that uses all the tools in our tool chest can be used to lower the price of gas and energy for the American people. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, legislation to allow Delegate voting should have appeared on the 100-hour agenda because it would fit snugly under the agenda's general theme of symbolism over substance. 
   In fact, to bolster their case, the bill's advocates insist that Delegates' votes will be meaningless. But it is not meaningless. We have a written Constitution that clearly outlines who receives a vote in Congress. The principle is as clear as it is simple. The Members will be chosen every second year by the people of the several States. The Constitution doesn't provide exemptions to those rules in cases where it feels good, it is seemingly irrelevant or is politically expedient. 
   Residents of U.S. territories reap the benefits of the world's biggest economy; they are protected by the greatest military in the world, and they have coveted access to the 50 States. Yet territories, by definition, are not States. This status comes with pros and cons. On the one hand, they maintain a greater deal of autonomy, independent identity and self-determination. On the other hand, territories don't get the same representation in Congress as States do. This is a prime example having your cake and eating it, too. 
   There are many reasons to oppose this legislation. For one, it makes no sense in the people's House where representation is determined by population for Puerto Rico's 4 million to get the same vote as American Samoa of 57,000. It makes no sense to give Delegates a vote that doesn't count if it counts. And it makes no sense to pretend that this effort is anything but political opportunism. 
   But those aren't the most important reasons for opposing this bill. The most important reason is that it plays fast and loose with the constitutional limitations on who can vote on the floor of this House. We are not members of a backyard club making up rules on who gets to vote as we go along. 
   When we took this job, we swore to uphold the Constitution, and that is what I am doing by opposing this legislation today. If supporters of this bill think it is important to give Delegates a vote on the House floor, I urge them to draft a constitutional amendment, not a constitutional runaround. 
   I ask and I say to the majority's argument with us, it is not with us, it is with the Founding Fathers and the writers of the Constitution. 
   I ask my colleagues, and especially those from the great sovereign State of Georgia, to oppose this legislation.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the Arkansas River system provides navigation, flood protection, hydropower, water supply and recreation for millions of Americans. This body of water provides a 9-foot navigation channel that is almost 445 miles long and is controlled over this length by 17 locks and dams. 
   Madam Speaker, lock and dam No. 5, which this legislation would name after Colonel Charles Maynard, became operational in 1968. This is a vital piece of infrastructure where almost 9 million tons of commodities pass through it annually. 
   Prior to his work as district engineer in Little Rock, Arkansas, Colonel Maynard served in the Army in New Guinea and the Philippines during World War II and later supported the Berlin airlift as an engineer in charge of construction at Keflavik Field in Iceland. 
   Madam Speaker, Colonel Maynard oversaw many of the Army Corps of Engineers construction projects along the Arkansas River. Under his watch, Colonel Maynard directed the construction of 13 of the 17 locks along the river. 
   Due to his military education, management skills and World War II experience, he was uniquely qualified for his assignment as the Little Rock district engineer. This designation is an appropriate honor for Colonel Maynard's achievements and contributions. 
   I urge all Members to support H.R. 781.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 375, honoring the United Parcel Service and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States, and all across this world. 
   It is increasingly difficult for businesses to survive in today's global economy, and I am proud to offer this resolution honoring UPS as a company that has not only survived but one that has continued to grow and prosper for 100 years not only in this country but all over the world. 
   In 1907, when Mr. James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend to start a delivery company, I am sure that it was impossible for him to envision what his hard work would become. 
   Whether it was purchasing his first delivery car in 1913, becoming the first package delivery company to provide air service in 1929, or using alternative fuels to power its fleet, UPS has continued to embrace technological advancements in order to better serve its customers. 
   Now, 100 years after its inception, UPS is a 427,000-employee global transportation corporation that moves nearly 15 million packages through its network each business day. While UPS is headquartered in my home State of Georgia, its presence is felt in every congressional district and all around the globe. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe it is fitting that we honor this tremendous achievement, and I urge all Members to support this resolution and recognize what brown has done for us.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to read an editorial to the American people, Mr. Speaker, that was printed yesterday in Investors Business Daily: 
   ``Oil Shock. 
   ``When it comes to energy policy, Democrats always talk a good game. But look at their actual record while in control of Congress in the last year and a half. It's been nothing short of disastrous. 
   ``Wasn't it 2 years ago that then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi vowed, if the party took over Congress, to cut energy prices, especially gasoline? 
   `` `Democrats have a commonsense plan,' Ms. Pelosi went on to say, `to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices by cracking down on price gouging, rolling back the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, tax breaks and royalty relief given to the big oil and gas companies, and increasing production of alternative fuels.' 
   ``This is what Ms. Pelosi wrote in April of 2006 as part of her efforts to convince the American people to elect Democrats. 
   ``How's that working for you? The cost of energy, measured by the price of West Texas Intermediate Crude is up more than 70 percent.'' 
   On 12/19/07 President Bush signed into law H.R. 6, which was the plan. It's not working.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Jeremy Todd Charron was a dedicated protector of both his State and country. An intense, goal-oriented young man, he aspired to be a marine since the second grade. After graduating high school, Jeremy fulfilled that dream and joined the Marine Corps, where he proudly served his country for 4 years. 
   After his enlistment term ended, Jeremy's passion to serve his community and protect others led him to join the Epsom Police Department with the goal of ultimately becoming a State trooper. 
   Tragically, on August 24, 2007, after attending two fellow officers' funerals, Jeremy was gunned down while questioning two suspicious individuals. Despite his fatal wounds, Jeremy fought back. He returned fire until he collapsed, forcing his killers to flee and steal a nearby truck that was identified by police and ultimately led to their capture. 
   Leadership was a trait of Jeremy's throughout his short life, whether on the soccer field or as high school class president. He was also known as someone who would defend those who were unable to defend themselves. 
   Jeremy Charron proved his dedication to honorably serving others, both in the military and as a law enforcement officer who ultimately sacrificed himself in order to keep his community safe. 
   On this, the 10th anniversary of the death of Jeremy, it would be fitting to name the Hillsborough, New Hampshire, postal facility in his honor. So I join my colleague from Illinois in asking all Members to support the naming of this post office to honor this American hero.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I just heard some great news down here. We have cut 250 programs. I'm excited because, you know, I used to be in the construction business, and one time we had a superintendent that was not getting his job done, not performing, not getting the houses built on time. And the gentleman we worked for went in one day and he said, Jerry, I want you to go out there and I want you to fire somebody. And Jerry said, Who do you want me to fire? And he said, I don't care. Just fire somebody so they will know who's in charge. 
   We need to fire somebody. We need to cut something somewhere. And I am excited to hear that we have cut 250 programs at a savings to the taxpayers of $6 billion because, what that means to the taxpayers, Mr. Chairman, is that now we've only spent $80 billion more than we did in 2007. So we took the  first step in a long, long journey to get down to where we get back to the level of 2007. 
   I hope that the chairman, Mr. Chairman, of appropriations, the full Appropriations Committee, will supply every Member in this body a list of the 250 programs that have been cut, because I want to see that. I want to be able to take that back home to my constituents and say, You know what? We are cutting the size of government. And here are the 250 programs that we've cut. 
   Now, what I would also like for him to bring me when he brings me the 250 programs that we have cut, I hope that he will bring me a list of the other programs in the other expansion of government that we have done to spend another $80 billion. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, a lot of people may not understand how much a billion dollars is. If you spent a dollar a day, no, if you spent a dollar a second, a dollar a second, it would take you 31 1/2 years to spend a billion dollars; 31 1/2 years to spend a billion dollars if you spent a dollar a second. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope the people of America know that we have spent $80 billion more than we did last year. That scares me. That scares me not only for me. It scares me for my children. It scares me for my grandchildren. And it scares me for my great grandchildren. 
   And so I hope that somewhere we'll fire somebody, just one person, one cut that we can make and let the people of America see it.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I just want to say a couple of things. I know, Mr. Chairman, people watching this on TV probably think they are in the Twilight Zone or caught up in the middle of Alice in Wonderland because you don't know which side to believe. 
   The chairman of the subcommittee said people couldn't sleep or wouldn't be able to sleep worrying about these cuts. Nobody in Grantville, Georgia, will be staying up worrying about the government cutting its own size. 
   We are talking about saving time. We have been debating for about 14 hours $28 billion. I don't know about anybody on the other side of the aisle, but I know that when me and my family sit down and discuss a budget, it took a lot longer for us to discuss our little pittance of a budget than 14 hours to discuss $27 billion. 
   The other thing, we are hearing all of this whining about we borrowed $3 trillion in the last 6 years. We ran up the deficit. And then we hear about we cut the budget $16 billion. Now listen, where I come from, you can't have your cake and eat it, too. We were either wrong in borrowing the money, or we were wrong in not spending the money, but you can't be wrong in both of them. Somebody has to make up their mind. 
   We talked the other night that you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. 
   I would like to say that I think the majority is running out of time, because pretty soon, the gig is going to be up. We tried pinpointing, Mr. Hensarling, Mr. Flake, we tried pinpointing, doing some accurate bombing or cutting on this bill; but that didn't work. 
   Now it's being talked about using the meat-cleaver approach. When I get those 250 programs that have been cut and the $6 billion that has been saved, and the list of the $80 billion that we are spending more, could you send me maybe a method to do some cutting? Because if we can't pinpoint, we can't use a scalpel, and we can't use a meat cleaver, how can we do it? I think that is what the taxpayers want to know. Who is going to stand up for them? 
   We call each other ``my good friend'' and ``my good buddy'' and ``my colleague'' and this and that. What we need to be doing is being a good friend to the taxpayer. We are not being a good friend to the taxpayer. 
   We talk about national parks being closed down, and yet we spend another $7 million expanding the Carl Sandburg property.

I want to thank him and his staff; and also Edward Jones from my staff for all of their hard work and dedication that we have had over the months trying to get the requisite number of signatures. 
   For more than 200 years the United States Infantry has sought to protect our freedom. H.R. 3229 will honor the legacy of the United States Infantry with the minting of a commemorative coin. Eighty percent, as has been mentioned before here today, of American casualties are young men and women who have lost their life in battle were members of the infantry. 
   The Infantry Museum Foundation, in coordination with the United States Army, have already broken ground on this new National Infantry Museum. It has been my honor to visit it, and with General White walk through the street, the World War II street, to see the buildings that will afford our young men and women an opportunity to see what Army life was like during World War II. It also has the parade field which is now under construction, and will be a place where many ceremonies in the future will be held. Also, this building is going to be a green building. It is high tech. There is geothermal heating and cooling in the building. And as Mrs. Capito mentioned, a professional museum planner has worked very hard on this. 
   I would like to tell one story General White told me. In doing some of the exhibits, they have one exhibit where paratroopers are flying on a plane to jump out, and the architect of this one ride told General White, ``I don't know how we are doing on this. A lot of the people who are testing it are getting motion sickness, almost to a point of losing their lunch.'' 
   And General White said, ``Then you're almost there.'' 
   This museum is going to be a place where people can go in and feel the sense of battle that these young men and women feel. 
   And as you know, Fort Benning is the place where about 80 percent of our young men and women go that are going into harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places that we may send them, and it will give a great opportunity for them to go and see some of the legacy that has come before them and also give their families a chance to visit this great facility. 
   So it is with great honor that I introduce this bill, and I want to thank all of the cosponsors of this bill. It was amazing the number of people that I would go up to and ask to sign this legislation that said, you know, I spent 3 months of my life at Fort Benning going through my military boot camp; and so I hope that when this thing is open next year, that these Members that have gone through there and experienced that type of military life will  come down and join us in a grand opening. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to please support this resolution.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, more smoke and mirrors that we are hearing this morning from the majority party about, oh, there is plenty of land to drill in, the big oil companies just aren't drilling. Let me just straighten that out just a little bit. Ninety-seven percent of the Federal offshore drilling sites are off-limits. Ninety-four percent of the federally owned onshore areas are off-limits. Fifty-two percent of the area that oil companies drilled in between 2002 and 2007 were dry holes. We need to allow these oil companies to drill in areas where there actually is oil. 
   I don't know the economics that the majority party has, but if there is no oil, why would you drill there? That does not make sense. If the government would sell companies leases that have oil in them instead of selling them places that turn out to be dry holes, then we would have more oil produced in this country. We imported over 600 million gallons of gasoline last year. We need to add to our refinery capabilities, also.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (THE DEMOCRATS' ``MAGIC PLAN'' TO LOWER GAS PRICES HAS NOT WORKED -- (House of Representatives - March 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, this morning the price of a barrel of oil fell to $105 after hitting an all-time high of nearly $112 in the middle of March. Less than 2 years ago, the Democrats promised Americans that they had a magic plan for lowering gas prices, but since they have been in control of Congress, prices have simply gone higher and higher. But at the time, those prices were enough to alarm Americans when Republicans were in the majority. 
   On the floor of the House and on the campaign trail in districts throughout the Nation, the Democrats seized on those anxieties and pointedly blamed the Republican White House and Congress for rising gas prices. Time and time again, they said they had a magic formula for lowering the cost. 
   On April 16, 2006, the then-minority leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press release, ``The Republican rubber stamp Congress has passed two energy bills, costing taxpayers $12 billion for giveaways to big oil companies. But the Republican bills clearly have done nothing to lower gas prices, as the price of a barrel of oil has settled above $70 a barrel, the highest price in our history.'' The release went on to say, ``Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices.'' 
   Then the next week another Pelosi release said, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices ..... '' 
   When in 2006 the House considered the energy bill to increase domestic production, the Democrats took to this floor in outrage. A Democrat congressman from California said on the floor about the Republican energy bill of 2006, ``It is no wonder their initials are G-O-P: gas, oil, and petroleum ..... It is time House Republicans join us in providing some real relief to the American consumer.'' 
   That same day a Democratic Member from Connecticut said, ``When it comes to solving the energy crisis, President Bush and his Republican Congress have no credibility. If they had only spent the last 5 years working to reduce demand,'' like the Democrats have proposed, ``by raising fuel standards, rolling back the billions of dollars in tax breaks and royalty relief to the big oil companies, and if they were about promoting alternative fuels, as the Democrats have proposed, we might today be on the road to energy independence instead of bracing ourselves for $4 gas prices. 
   Let me put this rhetoric into context, Mr. Speaker. When the Democrats took over both Houses of Congress in January of 2007, gas prices that month ranged from $50 to $60 a barrel for oil. But at the end of 2007, the Democrats' magic plan for lowering gas prices apparently hasn't worked out because today oil is closing at over $100 a barrel. 
   But wait, Mr. Speaker. It gets even crazier. A House Appropriations subcommittee this week will be looking at raising gas taxes 25 to 40 cents a gallon.     
   Seems to me that that makes prices go up 25 to 40 cents a gallon. But what do I know? I've never professed to understand the Democrats' magic formula for lowering gas prices. 
   On gas prices, as on earmarks, spending, and ethics, the Democrats ran as the Great Crusaders. But they've governed as the Great Pretenders. Democrats have proposed nothing that would do anything but raise gas prices at the pump. Just last month, the House Democrats passed another ``no-energy'' energy bill in the form of an $18 billion tax increase on American energy. This marks the fourth time the Democrats have held a vote to raise energy taxes. This sort of agenda will only slow the economy by discouraging domestic energy production and increasing our dependence on foreign nations for our energy. 
   Our Nation needs energy production to keep our competitive edge in the global marketplace. We all want to achieve breakthroughs in alternative energies that will have a growing importance in the future. But we can't pretend that oil isn't by far the most important fuel in our economy. We have to increase domestic production. We need to give American companies incentive to produce, rather than demonizing them for providing a commodity that our livelihoods depend on. 
   Let's put American ingenuity to work in the field. And let's put the Democrat's magic formula back on the shelf.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I too want to thank the gentlelady for this commonsense amendment. I think it does put the responsibility, at least partially, back on those local governments to control themselves. But it is for the same reason that the gentleman from New Jersey got up. My constituents also are concerned about the ability to go to the beaches. No matter how clean we can make them, if they can't get there, then they can't enjoy them. 
   And we had demonstrations the other day, Madam Chairman. We saw truckers driving around the Capitol, at least along the highway here, protesting the price of diesel fuel. And diesel is over $4 a gallon. And it's costing some of these truckers, independent businesspeople, over $1,000 to fill their trucks up. 
   And we've had some promises. And those seem to be empty promises that we've had. And I wanted to come today because, as you know, the average price of gas today is about $3.44 a gallon. The price of a barrel of oil is $114 a barrel. And I wanted to just kind of remind some people, maybe we have forgotten that we have had some promises made to the American people to really bring about some change in our government. 
   I want to read a press release that was dated September 21, 2005 by Speaker Pelosi. ``This is of the highest priority to our House Democratic Caucus because it is a high priority for America's working families. Some people have to work 2 more hours a day to cover the cost of gas that takes them to work, if they are making minimum wage.'' 
   Well, we raised the minimum wage, but gas has gone up well over $1 a gallon since the Democrats took control and since Ms. Pelosi became Speaker.  
   September 28, 2005, another press release by the then-Minority Leader Pelosi, ``Democrats have been working for months to bring down the price of gas at the pump and home heating oil.'' 
   Well, you've been in charge for 16 months, and I don't see what we have done to bring down the price of gas or the price of oil, except we have had some hearings where we question the heads of the oil companies about the profits they are making. 
   The point is, is that gas has gotten so high that the average person is now having to look at exactly where and what meets the best needs of their family, if they can go to the grocery store or not. That is a consideration that it seems like the Democratic leadership wanted to have for the working family. So why are we doing that? We are spending a lot of time on other issues. But we need to be working on this, something that affects the everyday person. 
   April 18, 2006, in another press release, Ms. Pelosi said: ``But the Republican bills clearly have done nothing to lower gas prices, as the price of a barrel of oil today has settled above $70 a barrel.'' Man, don't we wish for those days again? At the time it was the highest price in history. 
   Here is the quote that I think that we really need to get an answer to. ``Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices, taking America in a new direction.'' 
   There is a new direction. And there is a song that goes with that direction. But I don't see a new direction. Or if we were going in a new direction, it's the wrong direction. Where is the Democratic plan for lower gas prices? Is it on the shelf somewhere? Are we saving it for a time when gas gets above $4 a gallon? Five dollars a gallon? What are we saving the plan for? 
   Let's bring the plan out tomorrow. Let's vote on it tomorrow. You can waive the rules. As we have seen in this Congress, we can change the rules at any time that it's convenient when we need it, and we really don't have to pay attention to the rules we adopted when you became the majority. 
   So why don't we bring out this plan? Why don't we have a plan that tomorrow we can tell the American people that the Democrats are going to finally unveil the plan? 
   Now the plan that we have heard so far from the Energy and Commerce chairman, Mr. Dingell, is to raise the price of the motor fuel tax 50 cents a gallon. That just doesn't sound like a good plan. One of the other plans that we had was to buy 30 bicycles at a cost of $30,000. I don't know that that's the plan that the American hardworking family is looking for. I mean, I live in Grantville, Georgia, and I would love to ride a bicycle to work, but that would take me quite a bit of time. I don't know. It might take 24 hours for me to ride a bicycle to work. But I don't know how families are going to ride bicycles to work to get groceries, or to go to the store, or whatever they have to do. Riding bicycles to me is just not that new plan. 
   Now if that is the Democrats' plan, then let's go ahead and unveil it and let the American people see it. I think they want to know what it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Chairman, I need to continue with some of these quotes, because I think they are pretty interesting as to our energy policy that we have, I guess, or the lack of an energy policy that we have right now. 
   July 25, 2006, Mr. Hoyer, then the Democratic whip, says: ``Republicans' failure to craft a forward-looking strategy to deal with the rising costs of fuel over the last 5 years has helped ensure that my constituents would pay a very high price at the gasoline pump today and for at least the next several years.'' 
   Well, I guess he is trying to make that statement come true, because it is continuing to rise over the next years. But it is not under our watch. So, Mr. Leader, I want to tell you that the ball is in your court. You didn't think that we could do a very good job with it. And I am reading these quotes. Evidently the now-Speaker didn't think we could do a very good job with it. So the ball is in your court, and I don't see the ball going anywhere except in the wrong direction. The price continues to go up, and I just think we need to see that secret plan that the Democrats have for bringing down our gas prices. 
   August 16, 2005, a press release by Ms. Wasserman Schultz: ``The unacceptable rise that we have seen in gasoline prices over the past year can be linked in part to the lack of consumer-oriented energy policy in this country. Gas prices have remained at record levels for about 4 months at $2.25 per gallon nationwide.'' 
   Well, I don't know if I am the one that is going to break the news, but right now gas is at $3.44. And this lack of policy that evidently was in effect when gas was only $2.55 a gallon, where is your policy? I challenge you, where is the policy that you had that was supposed to bring these gas prices down that you continually talk about. If you  could just get a chance to get your hands on the ball, that you could score. You could score for the American people and you could get gas prices down. You have got your opportunity. You have had your opportunity for 16 months. 
   September 29, 2005, in a letter to the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Tanner said, ``Gas prices in Tennessee and the rest of the country have literally skyrocketed. Our ever-growing dependence on foreign oil only guarantees that we will have to continue dealing with potentially unfriendly countries.'' 
   News flash, Mr. Tanner and Madam Chairman: I would like to say that there they are still skyrocketing, and we are still more dependent now on foreign oil than ever before, because the majority does not want us having domestic production. They don't want us drilling in our own territory, on our own Outer Shelf or in Alaska, anywhere, really, to get more dependent on our own oil and our own energy. They decided that riding bicycles was the way to go. 
   September 9, 2005, a press release, Marion Berry: ``We can barely afford to fill our gas tanks to get to and from work each day, and our farmers are spending everything they have on diesel fuel just to keep their crops alive. These people deserve some answers and a fair price for their gasoline.'' 
   You know, Mr. Berry, I couldn't agree with you more. You made that statement not quite 3 years ago. Where is your answer? You have been in the majority party for the last 16 months, and I don't see any answers to the questions and the comments and the concerns that you brought up for your constituents or these farmers that were spending way too much money then when gas was $2.50 a gallon. 
   May 22, 2005, in a press release by Mr. Pallone: ``Republicans chose to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Earth Day by approving an energy bill yesterday that raises gas prices. The average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey has increased 40 cents, from $1.66 to $2.06.'' 
   I wish we were back to those $2.06 days, don't you? And I don't know what we are going to do to celebrate Earth Day today, but gas, Mr. Pallone, is at $3.44. So the celebration won't be near as sweet because of the promises that you made to the American people that you were going to bring gas prices down, and they continue to go up.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Chairman, I wanted to continue on to read some of these quotes about the outrage that the majority party had about the prices of gas and oil, and now, as to the outrage of the American people because evidently they felt like there could be a change and that there could be some solution to the price of higher fuel. 
   On September 9 of 2005 there was a press release sent out by Mr. Doyle that said, ``Supply and demand can't account for the spike in gas prices we've seen.'' ``Americans want and deserve stable, affordable gas prices.'' 
   I agree, they do. There have been some broken promises given to the American people about who could produce, because at the time this press release was written, gas was about $2.25 a gallon. It's $3.44 a gallon now. 
   The party of Mr. Doyle has been in charge for 16 months. Where is that accountability? Where is the stable, affordable gas prices that Mr. Doyle said the American people deserved? 
   We haven't seen them. They are in that secret plan that we are waiting to see unveiled. 
   June 7, 2006, press release by Mr. DeFazio, ``Americans deserve an effective, comprehensive solution to the problem of high gas prices and growing dependence on foreign oil. Unfortunately, all they get out of this Republican Congress is a lot of hot air.'' 
   Well, Mr. DeFazio, I think there's enough hot air to go around because evidently this press release was a lot of hot air. 
   Gas prices have done nothing but go up. The majority has changed. There is a new sheriff in town, so to speak, that I have heard when this takeover took place, but what is the sheriff doing?     
   The sheriff must have lost his gun or something, because, Madam Chairman, there has been no action. There has been nothing. We have discussed a lot of things on this floor, but I don't think there has been anything about higher gas prices. 
   July 13, 2006, a press release by ROSA DELAURO: ``The Bush administration and congressional Republicans have failed to bring up comprehensive energy reform, or any piece of legislation, for that matter, that would lower gas prices.'' 
   Well, here it is 2 years later, and I haven't seen anything from the new majority that does anything to lower gas prices or, to quote her, ``or anything else.'' 
   It goes on, ``Addressing these gas prices should be a priority for the congressional Republicans. I urge the Republican leadership to take action to reduce gas prices for consumers.'' 
   I want to do the same thing. I want to encourage the congressional Democrats, Madam Chairman, to do something about gas prices and oil prices. I want to see the magic plan. 
   April 8, 2005, a press release by Ms. DeGette: ``Thanks to the shortsighted policies of the Republican Congress, our economy and the budgets of all Coloradoans are being hurt by skyrocketing gas prices. In Colorado, gas is up to $2.15 a gallon.'' Man, don't we wish we had those days when Republicans were in charge and gas was $2.15. Democrats have been in charge for 16 months, and it is $3.44 a gallon. 
   May 14, 2004, a press release by Mr. Etheridge: ``Gas prices in North Carolina and throughout the Nation are at record high levels. 
   ``A major reason for these prices is the high price of crude oil, which has reached $40 a barrel.'' 
   Man, don't we wish we had $40 a barrel back. 
   ``We need immediate action to lower gas prices.'' 
   Where is the outrage from these people that I am reading quotes from today demanding lower gas prices? I can't hear them. I haven't heard them. I haven't even seen them. 
   April 27, 2006, a press release from Ms. HERSETH: ``We have heard strong words this week about rising gas prices, but words are not enough. Families across America are struggling to fill their gas tanks. They deserve answers and concrete actions, not just lip service.'' 
   Lip service, that's what we've got.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICAN ENERGY NEEDS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, it is great to be back tonight to address some of the concerns that most Americans have today, and that is the cost of energy. 
   Let me start out by saying that I have gotten numerous calls and e-mails concerning the price that the average American is paying for gas today. As most Americans realize, gas is up over $4 a gallon. When the 110th Congress started and the new majority took over, after telling the American people that they had a commonsense plan to bring down the skyrocketing price of gas, and keep in mind at the time it was about $2.20 a gallon, we have seen the price of gas go up to $4.05 now. 
   I have had many people call and ask me if I had signed the petition on several Internet sites, such as AmericanSolutions.com and some other sites that were out there where the American people could go and sign a petition telling us, Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, that they wanted us to drill now, drill here, and bring down the price of gas. 
   And so as I was thinking about that, I thought, you know, we are hearing from our constituents about they want us to do something, to take action, to bring down the price of gas because that's what we do in this Congress, Madam Speaker, is we are here to help the American people, and especially with their pocketbook. 
   So as I got to thinking about that, I said you know we all hear from our constituents, but sometimes our constituents don't know how we really feel because a lot of times these issues are not brought to the floor, or when they are brought to the floor they are so convoluted and so hard to understand that someone could go home and answer their constituency as to why they voted for a bill or why they voted against a bill because you could probably take either side on any piece of legislation that is passed in this body. I said I need to come up with the simplest thing that I can to make sure that the American people understand and there can't be any wiggle room from their Member of Congress where they stand on bringing down energy prices. 
   And so I came up with this petition. What this petition says is ``American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil online. Bring deepwater oil online. Bring new refineries online.'' We have not opened a refinery in this country since the late 1970s. 
   So what I did, this is the petition we have had on the floor all today for Members to sign. What it says is very simple; very, very, simple, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' That's about as simple as it gets. It's not politics. It's not gotcha politics, it is the kind of change that I think the American people want, honesty and common sense. Honesty and common sense. 
   So today we have had a total to date of 126 people out of 435 sign this petition. So 126 out of the 435, and I hope that it will continue. But I hope, Madam Speaker, that people understand that they can go to House.gov/Westmoreland and find out if their Congressman has signed the petition or not. And if not, you might want to ask them why because the thing is pretty clear. It just says ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' 
   That's about as simple as it gets. So we are proud to have this petition and we are proud of the American people, Madam Speaker, for going to these Web sites to sign these petitions to let us know how you feel about paying these outlandish gas prices at the pump. 
   What I want to do is make sure that the American people know how their Congressman feels about the pain they are suffering at the pump. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton).

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (AMERICAN ENERGY NEEDS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from Indiana for being here with me and supporting this initiative that we have. And I want to just hit on a couple of points that Congressman Burton made. 
   You can go to house.gov/westmoreland and find out who has signed a petition that basically just says, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas for Americans. There are also some links to some other sites where you can get some of these energy facts that we're giving you and find the truth for yourself. 
   One of the things that he mentioned was the size of ANWR and where we're drilling. And he mentioned that the drilling site is about the size of Reagan Airport. And it is, in comparison to the total State of South Carolina. Here is the comparison of ANWR to the Continental United States. You can see the size of Alaska compared to the United States. This is the wildlife refuge here, and we will show you, in a moment, Madam Speaker, what this wildlife, the refuge area looks like. 
   Here is the drilling site up here. So you can see that this is, the ANWR, the wildlife is about the size of South Carolina. And where they're talking about drilling is about the size of Reagan Airport, in comparison. You can see how much land is there. 
   The other thing the gentleman from Indiana mentioned was the amount of land; 68 million acres is what the majority party claims is out there, and that may be a true statement. I can tell you that 54 percent of the exploratory holes that have been drilled between 2002 and 2007, 54 percent of them were dry holes. 
   Now, we all want to use common sense. We don't go to the hardware store to buy groceries. So why would you drill somewhere that there's no oil? You wouldn't do it. Or no natural gas. Why would you do that? You would not do it. 
   And so after they do all of these tests that they do that is required by the government for them to do, they find out on these leases that have been offered up by our government that there is no oil. There is no energy resource there, so why are we saying drill there? 
   Now, also I've heard that these energy companies are stockpiling these leases. Well, that's not true. It's already in law that if they don't drill, they lose it. If they do not go with the terms of the lease, they lose that lease. And so if they have a problem with them not drilling where they said they would drill in the time that they said they would drill, according to the lease agreement with the government, that's not their problem. That's our problem, that we're not enforcing the laws that we have. And so, you know, there's a lot of myth going on here, Madam Speaker. 
   But I did want to bring up one thing because I think this is really what gets my blood boiling when I think about our dependence on foreign oil. Let's look at Mr. Castro and Mr. Chavez down here. And I want to read something to the American people, Madam Speaker, and to you and to the people in this House. It says, in a recent interview on Al Jazeera, Chavez called for the developing nations to unite against U.S. political and economic policies. What can we do regarding the imperialistic power of the United States? We have no choice but to unite, he said. Venezuela's energy alliances with nations such as Cuba, which receives cheap oil, are an example of how we use oil in our war against neo-liberalism, he said. 
   Another quote, right down here under the picture of him hugging Castro, or as he put it on another occasion, we have invaded the United States, but with our oil. 
   The next thing over here, Madam Speaker, is a check that American families and businesses write out every day to Hugo Chavez for $170,250,000. That is a day. That money could be coming to American companies and to  American workers and creating Americans jobs and bringing down the price of gas at the pump for Americans. 
   Now, we're writing one of our enemies a check for $170 million a day when we could be using that money to create jobs in this country. 
   The other thing I think is important to realize is that not only have we not drilled and used our own natural resources for our own citizens, but we've not built any refineries. Our refining capability has not been added to since 1978. We have not built a new refinery. 
   Now, we are importing, and listen to this--this is not oil, crude oil that we're importing--we are importing gasoline, a product that has been refined in another country, we are importing about 6.9 billion gallons of gasoline, refined crude oil into this country every year, and probably the same amount in diesel. 
   There is no excuse for us sending our hard-earned dollars to foreign countries when we could be doing it ourselves, and especially, going to the pump and paying over $4 a gallon when this new majority for the 110th Congress had a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing price of gas when it was $2.20.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Well, Mr. Peterson, let me say this. We have that technology, and there was a push in the late 1990s, mid- to late-1990s to convert gasoline engines to propane. Then the EPA put such testing regulations on the emissions testing for these different types of makes and models of cars, a lot of people just got out of the business. It was not a commonsense thing for EPA to do. They should have gone to these people doing the conversions and said, What can we do to make it easier and faster for you to do this propane conversion and the same thing with natural gas?

   And to my friend from Pennsylvania, and thank you for coming down tonight and helping Mr. Burton and myself with this because we know that you are an expert on it and that you have been trying to correct a situation. Even when the Republicans were in the majority, you were the lone voice crying in the wilderness about this; and I really wish we would have paid more attention. 
   But now is the time when natural gas is $13-plus, the price at the pump is over $4, the price of oil in a barrel is up to about $140. And the gentleman mentioned some of the Norwegian countries. And you know Norway, you know, 30 years ago was dependent on foreign oil. And they said, You know what? We're going to do something about it.     
   Norway is dependent on tourism, fishing. I mean, they are very conscious of their natural resources. Today, they are the third largest exporter of crude oil in the world.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I don't want to have to answer that question to my grandkids. 
   If you will remember, this Congress in 1995 passed drilling in ANWR. President Clinton vetoed it. Today, we would be getting 1 million barrels of oil a day from ANWR. 
   The American people do not want us to stay here in the fetal position. They want us to act. And they don't want to hear the excuses that the majority is giving for us not taking action. We need to act, and some of the things that the gentleman has mentioned are so common sense. 
   I mean, we can drill as environmentally sensitive as anybody in this world. Our technology is the best. We've got the smartest and the brightest. We can do what France is doing with their nuclear waste. We can do what France is doing with their nuclear power. We can do what Brazil is doing with the coal-to-oil. We can do what Norway's doing with being environmentally sound drilling. 
   This is America. This is the place where we are the leaders of the world in so many things, and for some reason, we want to have our hat in our hand, going to even our enemies, begging them for them to increase their oil production, use their natural resources, because we are not willing to do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. To the point that you're making, and I think that's what, Madam Speaker, the American people don't understand, the reason the majority is failing to act on our ability to drill in our own lands is that their base wants gas to be $10 a gallon at the pump because they do not want us driving cars, and they want us to be dependent on them. 
   And so they are not doing anything. They are laying in that fetal position in a hunkered-down state because their base does not want this to come down. They don't want us to drill. They don't want us to use the shale-to-oil or coal-to-oil. They don't want us to use the clean coal technology that we have. They don't want us drilling for this natural gas. 
   And this is one of the things that we were just talking about. The gentleman from Pennsylvania mentioned these different organizations. If you receive something in your mailbox about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, you may get some pictures like this. 
   The reality of it is that is a real picture of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge right there. It's a tundra. It's a frozen tundra. It's what it is. I don't even see a tree on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. See, this is a picture of it. It's a frozen tundra. 
   It goes back to the fact that we are continually getting further and further behind. I think the American people, Madam Speaker, are at a point where they're saying we are wanting some action. And that's the reason we came up with the petition for Members of Congress to sign because we are the ones that can create the action. The American people can't create the action. It's our duty to create the action. 
   And so we started the petition, and this is a petition for just the Members, the elected Members of this body. 
   It says: American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil online, bring deepwater oil online. And I guess we need to add natural gas to that, too, because that sounds like something we need to get on in a hurry. But also bring new refineries, bring new capabilities of refining this oil where we don't have to import 6.9 billion gallons of gas into this country a year. 
   And so what we did, we came up with a petition that's simple. This is not hard for anybody to understand, and you can't dance around it. It basically says: I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. And we've got every Member, even the Delegates, a place to sign here. So far, out of the 435 Members, plus the Delegates, I don't know if that's seven delegates or whatever it is, we have 126 signatures. And so it's going good, and you can go to house.gov/westmoreland to find out if your Member of Congress has signed it or not. 
   We're trying to make this as simple as we can, to make us a responsive body, a body of action, rather than just laying here saying ``we can't'' to ``we can.''     
   And I think that the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Indiana have made terrific points here tonight, and I want to thank you all for coming. 
   We've got about 8 minutes, so I'll give you a couple minutes a piece to close, and then we'll wrap it up.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you. And let me just close with saying this: You're probably going to hear later on tonight that there are 68 million acres out there to drill on. Keep this in mind, Madam Speaker, we don't go to the hardware store to buy groceries. We're not going to drill on land that does not have resources under it. If you look at the Outer Continental Shelf and the lands that the Federal Government have inside this country, it is 2.5 billion acres of land. You're going to hear that the oil companies have these leases and they're not drilling them. It is law today that if a company that leases land does not honor that lease agreement, that lease is taken away from them. 
   These arguments will not hold water. It is time to act, and the time is now.  It is time that this Congress turns into a Congress of action that wants to move forward--our being less dependent on foreign oil--and quit relying on our enemies in an unstable region to produce our oil, to produce our energy. 
   So I want to thank the two gentlemen for joining me tonight. I hope you will go to house.gov/westmoreland and see the people that have signed up and believe in the fact that we need to increase U.S. oil production to lower the gas prices for all Americans. 
   And Mr. Peterson, you can close.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (DRILL HERE, DRILL NOW, LOWER PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. It's good to be here this morning and to be back to work on a good Tuesday morning, Madam Speaker, to let the American people know that we are on the job and that we're here to, hopefully, this week work on the price at the pump. We are here to work on America's independence. As we're coming up on Independence Day, on the Fourth of July, we're working on America's independence from foreign oil. 
   About 2 weeks ago, I started getting calls from constituents about signing a petition that was on americansolutions.com, and then there were other petitions I was called about--Internet petitions--where Americans were telling Congress this is what we want you to do: Drill here. Drill now. Lower prices. 
   I was at a gas station in my district, and I went in, and there was a petition there. It said, ``We want to lower gas prices.'' I guess the attendant there was doing that to keep people busy so they wouldn't be hollering at him. So I came up with an idea. 
   The American people are telling us how they feel. Let's have an opportunity. Let's have our own petition within this House, Madam Speaker, to tell the American people how we feel. So I've come up with a petition. There is no legislation. There is no discharge petition. It's just something that each Member of this body can state to their constituents. 
   Basically, it says American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil on line. Bring deepwater oil on line. Bring new refineries on line. The pledge has 435 lines, one for every Member. What it says is ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' It's very simple. ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' That's very simple. 
   Now, I've heard every excuse in the world from people on this floor, Madam Speaker, about why they didn't want to sign it. Well, if people out there are wanting to know if their Member has signed, they could go to house.gov/westmoreland and see if their Member is on there. They can see if they've signed, and they can see if it says that they will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. 
   This is very important. We need to let you know, the American people know, how we feel about the situation that you're in. You're in a situation where you go to the gas pump, and you may have to spend a larger portion of your paycheck than you normally would, but that's only small. We've got winter coming. With natural gas prices as high as they are, you're going to be cold in your home and will not be able to get in your car and drive anywhere to get warm. 
   So it's not just about the crude oil. It's about the natural gas. We have so much off of our coast, so much natural gas, so much oil in the Outer Continental Shelf. Untie our hands, Madam Speaker. Let our oil go. We want to be self-dependent. We don't want to rely on foreign countries. 
   I hope that the American people will help us persuade other Members of this body that we need to vote to drill here, to drill now and to lower prices.

   I just want to clear up one thing. Let's clear the smoke out of the room here and put some facts in the discussion. The Clinton administration awarded the Halliburton contract. Mr. Cheney only extended it. The Bush administration only extended it after trouble in the Middle East broke out.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding. I rise in support of her amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to tell a story for you and other people that might be listening about a gentleman who was a wide receiver for the Atlanta Falcons. His name was Alex Hawkins. One night he didn't come home. He had a history of maybe carousing around and staying out a little bit too late. He didn't come home one night, so he snuck in the door early the next morning, and his wife said, ``Hawk, where have you been?'' 
   He said, ``Well, I got in kind of late last night and didn't want to wake you  up, and I fell asleep outside in the hammock on the porch.'' 
   She said, ``Alex, that hammock has been gone for a year.'' 
   He looked kind of puzzled and he said, ``Well, Honey, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.'' 
   That is what the other side is doing. They have a story, and they are sticking to it. 
   I want to give you, Mr. Chairman, a math problem. Other people who want to work this math problem can, too, but I want to give you a math problem. If you take $53.6 billion and you multiply it times 0.025 percent, Mr. Chairman, will you get more than $53.6 billion? I think you will. I think it will be an increase over that number. So what this amendment does, it gives an increase over last year's spending. 
   Now, did the FBI come in and say, We don't need any more money? I doubt it. So really and truly, if you want to take the kind of logic that the majority is taking because they can't do math very well, then the FBI could have come in and said, You know what? We want $10 billion more. Well, I can't give you that. So in reality, they are cutting the FBI from the request that they made even though they are getting more money.     
   Now, this is fuzzy math, I know, and, Mr. Chairman, for any young people that might be listening to this, I hope you don't get confused. I know all these speeches are somewhat, Mr. Chairman, like an algebra problem, but we are asking, this is an increase? It is an increase over last year for these FBI agents and these police officers. It is not a cut. I don't know how else to explain it. 
   And, you know, I'm sure that Alex Hawkins knew that his wife knew that he was lying, but that was his story, and he's sticking to it. The same thing goes to the majority party. 
   The sad part about this, Mr. Chairman, is when we're all going to realize the truth, and many of us realize it's the truth now, it is when the taxpayers of this country and those family budgets are getting judged.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment. 
   It's interesting to hear about all the savings that the majority party, Mr. Chairman, claims that they have saved. I'm interested to get to the debate on the farm bill so we can hear of all the savings that's in it, and we will see how the next tax increase is going to be explained as some type of offset, or, as they have done so well this whole 110th Congress, is the smoke-and-mirror thing. They do a great job with it. I believe when people do a good job, they should be complimented. I've never seen an illusionist as good, especially convincing people that they are actually getting something accomplished. 
   If this Congress really wants to get something accomplished, we'll pass the amendment from Mr. Jordan, because it's real savings to the taxpayers of $1.6 billion. Now, in the scheme of things, and I never thought I would be up here long enough to say that that's a small amount of money compared to the amount of money that we spend in Congress, but it is a reasonable savings. And not only that, but it's an important first step, the first time in the 110th Congress, and really, I think, probably one of the first times up here that we've actually saved some money, and there's nothing wrong with that. And even though it's a small start, it's a good start. 
   This bill is $3.2 billion above last year, or a little over 3 percent more than it was last year. And while it's a modest increase, a 3 percent increase, I think that we would do much better going back to last year's level and learning to live within that means, Mr. Chairman, than trying to expand the programs.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Chairman, when a student decides to go to college, many families gather all their financial records and sit down to fill out the free application for Federal Student Aid, or the FISA, form. 
   To be eligible to receive Federal student aid, a student must meet certain eligibility requirements. Importantly, one of those requirements is that the student be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, basically, a legal permanent resident. They also have to have a high school diploma or a GED and be enrolled or accepted at a school that participates in the Federal Student Loan Aid program. 
   Given these requirements, it would be expected that a citizen or legal permanent resident that is a high school graduate or GED holder and has been accepted as a student at an institution of higher education would be able to complete the FISA in English; however, the U.S. Department of Education clearly does not think so. I have a higher opinion of our education system than that, and I believe a student that meets these eligibility requirements will be proficient enough in English to complete this form in English. 
   When I learned that this free Federal student application form is available for completion in either English or Spanish, I became concerned that others don't share my opinion of the capabilities of our education system. Even more disturbing is the presumption that the Federal Government would be subsidizing the college education of an individual that does not have the proficiency in English to fill out the form to get free Federal assistance. 
   So, colleagues, my amendment is simple. It would prevent the Department of Education from providing or  processing the free application for student loan assistance form in any language other than English. With the requirements for obtaining student assistance, it is not an imposition to ensure that our tax dollars go to students that are clearly ready to receive and achieve a college education. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Reclaiming my time, I wondered how the other side would answer to this, and quite interesting answers. First of all, this doesn't have anything to do with K-12. And as far as you buying your phone, Mr. Chairman, as far as somebody buying a phone that's got instructions in three or four different languages, they may be sold in different countries. I don't have any idea. But the Federal Government didn't buy that phone for you to use. 
   Now, here's the thing. We're talking about student aid, free aid going to someone who is fixing to go to college that is a legal resident here, either a citizen or a legal resident. All we're  saying is if you're going to ask the American taxpayers to pay for your financial assistance, that you should be proficient enough in the language of this country to fill out the application. Now, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out. And we can throw all these other little things in there about the people that won't get to apply and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't matter. 
   All this amendment says is if you're going to ask the Federal Government to help with financial aid for your college education that we hope you succeed in, and that we want you to excel in, that you can at least speak the language of this country. That's all we're saying. 
   This is a very simple amendment. There's been so much rhetoric over there. I guess, you know, evidently, they're taking this for something that it's not. Very simple, Mr. Chairman. Very, very simple. Do we want to make sure that our taxpayers' dollars go to students who are legal citizens of this country, who have a GED or a high school education, that are applying for financial aid to go to a college in this country to be proficient enough in English to fill the application out in English? It's very simple. 
   I won't belabor this. And I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is trying to get as many of these amendments out of the way as you can. But I certainly hope that my colleagues, and especially all the colleagues who are interested in protecting the hard taxpayers' dollars of this country, and who are interested in getting as many students financial aid that need it, that have the best opportunity to go forward and succeed in their college education and spend the money wisely, that they would support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Lynch). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, this would almost be sad if it really wasn't so comical. 
   I think what a lot of folks are witnessing today is some more smoke and mirrors, another magic show that they may have seen somewhere. 
   We have the chairman of the Appropriations Committee who said that the President's budget would spend 48 percent less this year on education and some other things that he mentioned than 1980, but yet they talk about what kind of spending spree we are on. I can't imagine what kind of spending spree the Democratic majority must have been on in 1980. 
   Let me say this. We keep hearing a lot of history lessons, a lot of history in here. For some reason we don't want to talk about the future. 
   But we keep hearing about the $57 billion from the people in this country that make over $1 million. Now, I really don't know if that's true or not. I am going to assume the chairman of the Appropriations Committee knows if that's true or not. 
   But it's almost like he sounds mad that he can't get his hands on somebody else's money. He says, you know, we can't get that $57 billion, and we want to spend it. I am mad about it. 
   You know what? We are spending too much money on the war on terror. Well, look, I have only been here 3 years, but I know one thing. I know that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the Democratic leadership over there can stop this war today, today. They got 232 votes. They control the purse strings, they can stop it today. 
   The supplemental budget that we passed that our leader talked about was $20 billion more than the President requested. The chairman of the committee said, you know what, I would spend $10 billion more. What's stopping him? He is already spending $11 billion more. What's stopping him from spending $10 billion more. 
   Because you know why? I think they are afraid to tell you that these things that they are investing in, that's what they like to call spending taxpayers' dollars. The things that they are investing in is coming out of the American people's pocket. They are making investments for the people of this country that they don't even have any say in. It's time we wake up.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to ask the gentleman from Texas if he is saying that the coal bed methane clearinghouse in the People's Republic of China is more important than this and maybe doesn't need to be looked at versus the $10 million for this, or developing and producing a television documentary in China on mercury pollution or improving environmental monitoring capacity in the Ukraine, as Mr. Blunt mentioned, that those are more important and might not be a way to redirect money. 
   I heard him make the comment of robbing Peter to pay Paul. I thought that was the MO of the majority party, but I guess Peter has to be rich and Paul has to be poor. 
   But this is something, and I applaud the gentleman for bringing this up, that if we are going to be good stewards of the money, we have got to prioritize our spending.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Cantor amendment. We all had campaigns this last November, and my opponent kept calling the 109th Congress the do-nothing Congress, and I want to officially name the 110th Congress as the smoke-and-mirror Congress. 
   We have consistently heard from the other side about the minimum wage and the average American. We have heard about global warming. In fact, I think the Speaker even testified today on global warming, and yet we see the abuse of power that is going on here in the fact that we have not been through regular order on a lot of the bills that have passed here, especially in the first 100-hour program. 
   We were going to have a 5-day work week which I am not sure that we have had one yet. We are going to be productive in the fact that we are flying up here and all Members, all 435 Members in this body have to fly back up here on Mondays to vote on naming a post office or wishing somebody a happy birthday, rather than being at home with our constituents and our families. 
   Now, I have learned something else today or over the last couple of days that evidently the 757 is the smallest aircraft we have that can haul one person. It seems to be that the military would have some sort of other plane that could haul one person to California that would be more fuel efficient, take less than a 16-person crew and cost less than $22,000 an hour. 
   I am very fortunate in I live in Georgia and I live about 45 minutes from the world's busiest airport in Atlanta, and so I can actually leave Reagan and get home in about a 3-hour period of time. I am very fortunate. 
   But I have flown home with many Members, my fellow Members in this House, some of them are going to Atlanta to fly on to Oklahoma or on to Texas, even had one colleague that was going on to California, having to stop in Atlanta. We are not all fortunate to have nonstop flights to our district. 
   I fly many times with Mr. Miller from Florida or Mr. Ross from Arkansas or others that have to make stops and have to make transfers of planes, that have to sit in middle seats.     
   We don't get to eat chocolate. We can have our choice of some crackers or peanuts. We don't have a crew of 16 at our disposal. 
   So as we sit in those middle seats because of the last-minute time that we have to catch a flight, many of us might think that, you know, we need someone to lead us by example. So I would call on the Speaker to lead by example, to put some meaning into the things that I have heard being said from the other side of the House. 
   You know, I keep hearing the word ``bipartisan,'' I see people's lips moving. I hear these words coming out of their mouths. I just haven't seen any action on it. 
   I keep hearing the word ``conservation.'' I hear the word, I see the lips moving, but I don't know if this is a good example of being a conservationist with our fuel and with our air quality. 
   I keep hearing ``being compassionate,'' haven't seen it. So there are a lot of things that I think can be done by a leader by setting an example. 
   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just like to ask that somebody step up to the plate and lead by example.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend from Washington for yielding. 
   You know, I am going to try to hurriedly plot these dots so you can connect them. But I want to go back because what I would call this Congress is the smoke and mirrors Congress. We have heard denials from the gentleman about what the real intent of this designation was and that the picture that we have here does not speak for what it is. 
   I think, Mr. Speaker, most people can look at this photo, and you can call it wild and scenic if you want. It looks fairly wild; but scenic, I don't know. I haven't been there either. Let me say this. I think we need to get this into perspective as to the smoke and mirrors that has been going on in this Congress. 
   I want to read a quote. Mr. Kanjorski was being interviewed by a paper in the town of Ashley. Mr. Kanjorski in his remarks said Democrats had overpromised during the 2006 congressional elections by implying they could end the war if they controlled Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is the result. It says, ``Now, anybody who is a good student of government would know that was not true.'' Mr. Kanjorski said that in an Ashley town hall meeting in August. ``But you know the temptation to want to win back Congress--we sort of stretched the facts, and the people ate it up.'' 
   I think we are seeing a continuation of that. We are stretching the facts that this is wild and scenic. Now, I think you go back, and this could go back to May of 2007 when we passed the Udall amendment in this House which prohibited the mining of shale oil out west. At that point in time, even by the majority charts, the price of crude oil went sky high with speculation because finally the speculators realized that we were not going to do anything to meet our own energy needs. 
   Just since President Bush lifted the executive ban and since he had the press conference yesterday about drilling, just the very mention about lifting the ban, starting to drill and starting to look at our own production and our own resources, the price of a barrel of oil has dropped over $10 a barrel. 
   Now we can do something here, but this is just another nail in the coffin for us that people are going to see that we don't want to increase energy production. Let me tell you something, the people up north had better understand that the price of natural gas and home heating oil is double what it was last year. So now if you get cold in your home in the winter, you are not even going to be able to afford to drive somewhere warm. 
   So this, I think, if you look at it and if you look at the overall connection of the dots----

It is going to continue to give the world and other countries the idea that we are going to be dependent on their foreign oil, and it is another example of: Well, we may have stretched the truth, and the people ate it up.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I thank my friend from Washington for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is almost comical. It is almost comical to have the gentleman on the other side of the aisle talking about the credibility that the Bush administration brings to this project. I have heard the gentleman give Bush no credit for anything. For anything. 
   I hear him giving the Navy and the Coast Guard credit, the administration's Secretary of the Interior, whatever it is, credit. He has never given the Bush administration credit for anything. 
   We had WHINSEC, which is in my district, talking about giving the military credit and the ability to put forth good judgment. He said, no, we're going to expose all the people that are attending this college, this facility, to help bring about peaceful negotiations and peace in Central America. 
   This is almost comical. And I will tell the gentleman that you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. We are exposing what this project is about, and they are grasping at straws to use the argument that they are saying and giving the credibility to the Bush administration when they have never given him credit for anything.

   But this, what you're talking about the, the Outer Continental Shelf, the U.S. coal, the shale oil, those are things that we know we have. And the funny part about what they want us to do about using alternative fuels, there was section 526, if you'll remember, in a defense bill that said that the U.S. government could not use alternative fuels. So, you know, which is it? Do they want us to or not? 
   And so, you know, that's where we're caught, and that's what a lot of people, I think, to my friend in America, don't understand that we're getting a lot of conflicting things from the majority side right now.

That is the reason that I came up with the petition because there were so many people that were signing petitions on the Internet, drill here, drill now, lower prices, other locations, that I knew we will never get to have a straight up or down vote on the drilling, onshore, offshore and adding refineries. And so that's the reason I wanted to come up with the petition. 
   And I appreciate the gentleman making the point. This is the only way the American people will ever know how their congressman feels is by his or her signing this petition, because they will have no chance to have that simple of a vote. 
   And what this petition says, I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. And you know, some things may be too simple for some of these legislators to understand. They keep wanting to make it complicated. It's not complicated, because to sign that pledge and they know that they're never going to get to vote on it. I think it would at least let their constituents know that they have some feeling for them when those people ride up to the gas pump and feel that pain at the pump.

   This was from Greenpeace. They say, Let's end fossil fuel use. For decades, we have relied on oil, coal, and gas to meet our ever-increasing energy needs. And now we are facing the consequences for our actions in global warming. 
   You know, 85 percent of our energy consumption today is supplied by fossil fuels. This is the base of the majority party, and this is what is driving our energy policy in Congress today. And I think what the gentleman has gone through, especially with the coal and the shale to oil to liquid, just reiterates the Democrats' position almost precisely what Greenpeace stated on their Web site.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Have a safe trip. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for this, and sorry, but he had to take a little trip. 
   And I want to go back, first of all, and just talk about the petition for a minute and the fact that I had been contacted by several of my constituents, Mr. Speaker, asking me if I had gone on to some of these web pages and signed the petition that said, one said, drill here, drill now, pay less. There were some others. I don't know the particular names. And then I was in a service station/grocery store that had a petition laying on the counter where you paid. It said, Sign this if you want to lower gas prices. 
   And so what I found is that the American people were doing everything that they could, Mr. Speaker, to let us know, Members of Congress, the people who are sworn to take action to help our constituents, the people were telling us. But there was no way for them to know how we felt about reducing the price of gas because under the new majority, we will never have an opportunity to vote on these things because they know if they brought it to the floor that it would pass and it would hurt their base, the radical environmentalists.  
   So I tried to come up with something as simple as possible because I believe in simplicity and people can understand the simplicity. 
   So I came up with my own petition, Mr. Speaker. And this petition was for the 435 Members that have the ability to vote in this House and then the delegates from some of the other territories. And it says, American energy solutions for lower gas prices. Bring onshore oil on line, bring deep water oil on line, and bring new refineries on line. 
   A lot of people might not realize with the refinery part of it that we haven't built a refinery in this country since 1978, 30 years since we built a refinery. A lot of people would be amazed to know that we import from Canada, Great Britain, Norway, a number of other OPEC nations, 6.9 billion gallons of refined gasoline into this country every year, about the same amount of diesel fuel because we cannot even refine what crude oil that we've got. 
   So I have made these boards up. I have had them up now, today is Friday, and we have had them up 4 days this week and 1 day last week. And it is so simple that it is confusing a lot of people on this floor. It says, House of Representatives energy petition. I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that you understand that. I understand that. But some people must not understand it because we've only had 170 people sign it. And so if this bill comes to the floor, which I don't think--and by the way, the Speaker said today that she's bringing four energy bills next week, and I'm going to talk about them in a minute and give you some kind of idea how they're going to help. 
   But this is real simple, it just says that whoever is representing you will vote to increase our U.S. oil production. Because see, we shouldn't be in a position--because to me, we're the greatest Nation in the world. And Mr. Speaker, we shouldn't put the leader of the free world, the President of this country, in a position to where Mr. Schumer from the Senate or Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, is asking him to go hat-in-hand to countries that are basically our enemies and asking them to increase their oil production to use their natural resources for our benefit. 
   Now, somebody is not thinking clearly. We don't need to put our President in that position. We don't need to be asking anybody anything when in this country in shale oil in the western States we have 1.5 trillion barrels. That's more than Saudi Arabia has. And so why in the world do we want to be in this position? 
   So I came up with a petition. Right now we have 170 people that have signed the petition. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to give the American people an opportunity, and I know I can't talk to them, but if I could talk to them, if I could address them, I would tell them for real energy solutions that they would want to go to www.house.gov/westmoreland and see if their Congressman has signed this petition. 
   And when you call them, you might get some dancing, some shuffling around. There is no dancing, there is no shuffling. It's one sentence. One sentence: I will vote to increase U.S. oil production and lower gas prices for Americans. I will be quiet about the petition for a minute. Here is the address. 
   I will say one thing about one individual that signed this. And his name is Neil Abercrombie, and he's from the great State of Hawaii. Neil is the only Democrat that has signed the petition. He's the only Democrat that has signed the petition. And he knows that at some point in time, we have got to start. And he knows that the party line that, you know, there's 68 million acres out there that's been leased, and that's true, but there's 2.5 trillion acres that could be leased, Mr. Speaker. But this Congress has passed bans that says you can't. The President has said he's willing to take off the executive order if Congress would move to take off our order. We're not going to move on that. 
   So I want to congratulate Neil and all of the people that he represents for him having the courage. And he's given some of the greatest speeches on the floor of this House that I've heard in my 16 years of legislative experience, not just in here but in the State of Georgia. So Neil, my hat's off to you and you should be congratulated. 
   I want to talk about for just a couple of minutes, I know I have got several of my colleagues here to join me, but I wanted to talk for a minute about what the Democrats have done so far in the 110th Congress. Because see, back in April, and if you will remember the gentleman, Mr. Shimkus, had a thing up about when the Democrats took over this Congress in 2006, that oil was about $56 a barrel. What happened was when they were running for office, Speaker Pelosi said back in April of 2006, Democrats have a commonsense plan for lowering the skyrocketing price of gasoline. 
   Now, keep in mind that the skyrocketing price at the time was about $2.26 a gallon. Man. Did you ever think you would long for the days when gas was $2.26 a gallon? 
   Anyway, we have yet to see that secret plan. They have brought out some plans, but I don't think they've really brought out the secret plan yet. 
   I want to quote a little bit here from the Democrats. They passed a price gouging prevention, and you can see right here. Here is the Democrats' philosophy on lowering the gas prices: Sue OPEC. That's gone a long ways. Launch the seventh investigation into price gougers. The seventh investigation. Mr. Speaker, I think the American people want us to get out of the committee hearing, the investigation mode, and get into the action mode. We're in the fetal position mode right now. 
   Launch the fourth investigation into speculators, $20 billion in new taxes on oil producers. Mr. Speaker, that took an economic genius to figure out that raising taxes $20 billion on a producer or a manufacturer is going to lower the price to the consumer. 
   Halt oil shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would save a nickel a gallon. So their price, it brings it down from $4.08 to $4.03. 
   But I want to read you some of the quotes. 
   This was the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act, H.R. 1252, that the Democrats in this body passed on May 23, 2007. May 23, 2007, was when this was passed. ``This bill has been around for over a year. So let's stop the excuses. American people don't want arguments about that process. They want relief at the pump, and that's what we're doing today. Lookit, today Members of the House have a very simple choice. Vote to stand up with consumers, your constituents, who are paying record gasoline prices, nationwide average, record prices, or vote to protect big oil companies' enormous profits.''     
   That was Representative Bart Stupak on May 23, 2007. 
   When this was passed, oil was $65.77. As you saw earlier, it's $136-and-change now. At the time this was passed, the national average was $3.22 a gallon. It is now $4.08 a gallon. So you see the price gouging does not work, Mr. Speaker. 
   Another comment: ``Mr. Speaker, again, the American consumers need us to act, they want us to act, they demand that we do act. Now is the time.'' Congressman Bobby Rush on May 23, 2007. I think that action was just a charade because it has not helped the price of our gas. 
   And so while we look at these things, we've got to understand that the things that the Democrats are wanting to do does not do it. 
   Now, let's look over here at what my petition does or at least asks to do on the Republican side. Bring onshore oil online, ANWR, shale, anywhere from 70 cents to $1.60 a gallon; bring deepwater oil online, OCS, 90 cents to $2.50 a gallon; bring new refineries online, 15 cents to 45 cents. That would bring it down probably to about $2.10 a gallon. These are actions. These others are charades. 
   And so I think the American people, Mr. Speaker, are tired of the charades. But let me just identify one more charade that we've had, and Mr. Speaker, that was when we had H.R. 6022, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008. This was passed on May 13, 2008, and you can see, halt oil shipments to the strategic petroleum, a nickel. So this is the bill. 
   Here was the quote from Chairman Dingell: ``While there is no guarantee that putting this oil onto the market rather than into the SPR will lower  prices, even such a modest step could potentially prick the speculative bubble now characterizing oil markets.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, it didn't prick anything because evidently it made them mad because it has gone up. But let me tell you what will prick that speculative market. What will prick it is when we vote to put a drill bit in the ground, and just by us voting to put the drill bit in the ground, the speculation will stop. 
   Representative Peter Welch, the lead sponsor, said this: ``When we have reduced oil going into the SPR in the past it has proven to actually have a direct and immediate impact on lowering the price of gas at the pump from 5 cents to 25 cents a gallon. 
   ``And basically the question for us is whether or not, even as we have to proceed with long-term debates about our future energy policy, is this Congress going to be willing to take a short-term step that has the potential to bring down energy prices.'' 
   Congressman Welch, there was not a lot of potential there because prices have gone up. 
   Representative Nick Lampson from Texas, somebody that should know about drilling and the benefits that drilling would do to bring down the price of energy: ``This bill provides a quick first step, maybe not much, but at least it's an action on the part of our Congress. 
   ``Suspending the SPR will put an additional 70,000 barrels of oil on the market each day. It could help reduce prices at a critical time for us in our country.'' 
   It has not reduced the price at all. 
   Representative Jason Altmire: ``This Congress has to act. And we are going to act today. And we are going to save the American people a quarter on the gallon.'' 
   So, when you go into the service station to fill up tomorrow or the next day or tonight, ask them if they've heard that we have passed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008, because I can promise you your gas will not be 25 cents a gallon less than what it was on the day we passed this. 
   I'd now like to recognize my friend from North Carolina, the battering ram as some people call her in here, but she's one of the most fierce legislators that I've ever met in my career, and the congresswoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Ms. Foxx, after these bills come to the floor next week, or if we ever do get a chance to see them, we're going to have to bring back the old truth squad to make sure that the American people, Mr. Speaker, get the truth. 
   It's now my honor to yield to a friend of mine that came in shortly after I did to Congress, and if I could name anybody in this Congress a taxpayers's friend, I would have to name JOHN CAMPBELL. And so I yield to him.

<DOCNO>Mr. WESTMORELAND. (REAL ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Thank you, sir. 
   You know, I want to just show the American people: We're not going to immediately drill ourselves out of the spot, Mr. Speaker. But in 1995, the Congress passed drilling in ANWR. President Clinton vetoed it. Had he not vetoed it in 1995 we would be getting one million barrels of oil today out of ANWR. 
   So is this an immediate relief? No. It's immediate relief from, I think, the speculation and the amount of escrowing. But this is an all-of-the-above issue. We've got to start drilling. We've got to start doing alternative fuels. We've got to build refineries. We've got to be doing onshore and offshore drilling. We've got to do coal-to-liquid. There are a lot of things we have to do and not just lay here in a fetal position. 
   But this is what really burns me up when I think about being dependent on foreign oil. This is a picture of Mr. Chavez from Venezuela and Mr. Castro from Cuba. In a recent interview on al Jazeera, Chavez called for developing nations to unite against U.S. political and economic policies. ``What We Can Do Regarding the Imperialistic Power of the United States.'' ``We have no choice but to unite,'' he said. ``Venezuela's energy alliances with nations such as Cuba, which receives cheap oil and are an example of how we use oil in our war against neo liberalism,'' he said. If you saw it on TV this morning, you saw where he threatened the European nations with no more Venezuelan oil because they passed an immigration law that he didn't like. This guy is not our friend. The bottom, on March 15, 2005, Washington Post; or as he put it on another occasion, ``We have invaded the United States with our oil.'' 
   Now, I'm fixing to show you something, Mr. Speaker, and I don't know if you can see it or not, but maybe you'll get a look at it. But Mr. Speaker, I'm going to show you something that's really going to burn you up. This is a copy of the check that American families and businesses write to Mr. Chavez. Every day, 365 days a year, we write him a check for $170,250,000. Mr. Speaker, that's a crime. We could be writing those checks to American men and women with the jobs that we would create if we would use our own natural resources for our own benefit. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I've got 5 minutes to close. And I want to put up this address, because this address, Mr. Speaker, is for real energy solutions. It's a simple address, www.house.gov/westmoreland. And you can go to that address, Mr. Speaker--and I hope you will go tonight, Mr. Speaker--and see the names on there that have signed the petition, the commonsense petition, a petition that just says ``I will vote to increase oil production to lower the price of gas for Americans.'' That's as simple as you can get, Mr. Speaker. We had 32,000 hits on this Web site either last night or the night before last. Americans want to know where their Congressman represent. 
   And Mr. Speaker, let me close by saying this: So many politicians today that the American people hear on TV are talking about change. And I don't know if it's the kind of change that we're thinking about because, as an American citizen, the change that I hope that Congress or that elected officials would have, Mr. Speaker, is a change that they would be honest, that they would be honest with what they tell the American people and not come to Washington and write a bunch of legislation that's very confusing about what it really means. 
   And I read your excerpts today, Mr. Speaker, that read what some of your colleagues had said about the legislation that they passed and what it was going to do for fuel prices. And some of that legislation was over a year ago, and it has just continued, gas is at $4.08 a gallon. But Mr. Speaker, if I could talk to the American people, I would tell them this: that there will never really be any change in this country, Mr. Speaker, until the people that get up every morning that are citizens of this land, that look in the mirror, and if that person, Mr. Speaker, that they see in the mirror will not change, then we're not going to change. 
   And so sometimes it takes effort, Mr. Speaker, from the men and women out there that watch us and listen to us and abide by the laws that we make to take things into their own hands and to let us know how they feel. Over a million people have signed a petition, ``Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less.'' We're hearing from them. We need to hear from you. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I could talk to the American people, I would tell them, your Congressman and your Senator need to hear from you. You need to know if they're willing to vote to increase the production of oil in this country from our own natural resources, be less dependent on foreign oil and foreign resources, and lower the price of American gas. And you can find out if your Congressman is on that petition or not by going to house.gov/westmoreland. 
   You're going to hear all kind of arguments of why they didn't sign it or haven't signed it, but Mr. Speaker, those arguments are so simple that the argument doesn't even hold up. 
   So Mr. Speaker, with that, I'm going to yield the well and yield my time here, and just thank you for your patience in listening to the truth that's been brought to you. And thank my friends that have come down tonight, my colleagues that have come down to help me, Mr. Speaker, try to explain to the American people that we're serious about bringing them some relief at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the congressman from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congress wields the power of the purse. It can declare war, it can create new laws, but it has no power to alter the laws of economics. No endeavor in the history of mankind has provided more consumer choice, more innovation and more advances than the invisible hand of market forces. 
   As the country song says, everybody wants to drink the free bubble-up and eat the rainbow stew, but in the real world, economics determines how we divvy up finite resources. 
   Under the current prescription drug plan, market forces have worked. Seniors get a choice of the drugs they need while at the same time the cost to taxpayers has come in billions below original estimates. Without doubt, government regulation of prices will limit prices, just as it does under the system used by the Veterans Administration. That is why more than a million veterans have signed up for a Medicare plan. 
   H.R. 4 is another example of Democrats saying the government can make better decisions for the American people than the American people can for themselves. We offer choice; they offer smoke and mirrors and empty rhetoric. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues vote ``no'' on H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding, and I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri for being an honorable gentleman during this tough time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to start with a couple of warnings. First, I would suggest anyone on the Republican side shaking hands with the majority might want to be careful because they have been licking their fingers and sticking them into the political wind. 
   Second, government opinion by polls may lead to short-term success at the ballot box, but in this case it could lead to a catastrophe on a global scale. 
   We in this House best serve the United States, Iraq, and the world community if we establish conditions in Iraq that allow for a somewhat orderly transition to autonomy for Iraqis. A quick withdrawal from Iraq would set off a fuse that would eventually blow up not only Iraq but quite possibly surrounding countries as well. 
   Iraq foreign minister on Monday warned against a quick withdrawal by the United States, saying, ``The dangers could be a civil war dividing the country, regional wars, and the collapse of the state.'' 
   Today when we talk about the Holocaust or when we talk about Rwanda or when we talk about the Sudan, we ask how could good people stand by and let this happen. It is an important lesson to remember as we pull out our voting cards today. Remember, we are trying to help. If we pull out of Iraq, we guarantee that the Tigris and the Euphrates will run red with the blood of innocents. We guarantee a safe haven for the training camps of al Qaeda. We guarantee more free rein for the death squads of Moqtada al Sadr. We guarantee a civil war between Shiites and Sunnis. We guarantee even more or worse instability in the region, perhaps for decades. 
   No matter how we vote today, we are not going to stop the war. We may stop fighting, but we are not going to stop the war. As Indonesian jihadist leader Abu Bakar Bashir said, ``All Muslims should fight to create an Islamic state. There are only two options for Muslims, to win or to die.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I was listening to Mr. Price and Mrs. Blackburn talk, and I was wondering if we had the time to do this. So I went back to the day that the FISA failed, which was February 13, and I looked at it and said this is a complicated bill and there are some issues and things to be worked out and have we had enough time to do it and how much time are we spending on discussing this FISA. 
   And so after listening to you all, I went back and got the schedule for February, and after February 13, on February 14, we did eight suspension bills, which are bills that have very little discussion, and two motions to adjourn. So we were in session that day about 5 hours, but nothing about FISA.     
   And then it seems, too, that we were gone for about 8 days. And then, Congresswoman, when we got back the week of the 25th, we worked 4 days for a total of 15 hours and 5 minutes with no FISA legislation. We did three suspensions on the 25th. We did the public housing on the 26th, which was withdrawn. We did the energy tax on the 27th. And then we did three suspensions on the 28th. And so, that was for February. 
   And if you look at what we've done in March, we did three suspensions yesterday. We did six suspensions the next day. Then we did the mental health, which was a total of about 10 hours that we spent on that. And then today, it's 4 o'clock and we're already out and didn't do anything today. 
   So, I guess my question, then, is, what are we doing? I mean, we, the 109th Congress, was called the ``do-nothing'' Congress. What can this Congress be called? Does anybody have a good name, Congresswoman, that we can call this Congress?

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. The gentlelady brings up a good point. But the Republicans, the minority here, we've tried to bring it to the floor on over a half dozen occasions. We tried to bring it to the floor again today. We tried to bring it to the floor yesterday. And this is the same bill that passed the Senate. And the gentlelady from Tennessee was taking about, it's a hard issue and it's an issue that needs to be discussed. There is no slower body in the world than our colleagues across the hall. I mean, they've been working on a farm bill for a year now. So, I mean, it's a very deliberative body, and they passed this overwhelmingly 68-29. And as the gentleman from Georgia said, there are 21 Members that have said they would vote for this bill. So we tried to bring it to the floor to see if it would pass, but through parliamentary procedure they refused to let us vote on it. 
   And, you know, Mr. Price, if we don't vote on issues, our constituents don't know how we really feel about it. So, you can go home and say, yes, I'm for the security of this Nation, I'm for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, but if you don't have an opportunity to vote on it, it's just words, it's simple words. 
   And so we're ready for some action up here. I mean, we want to see some action on our intelligence to make sure our intelligence community has the very best tools that they need. And not only that, but our corporations, who have been so generous and willing to go along with some of the things that our government has asked them to do to keep our people safe, we need to make sure that they're protected. 
   And so, you know, we're not the party of the trial lawyers; we're the party of the people. And so, I think if we quit trying to protect some of these special interests and start trying to protect this whole country, we would be a lot better off. 
   And I want to applaud our leadership for staying consistent and being constant that we keep this in front of the American people and that we are trying to give the Members of this people's House an opportunity to vote on it.

After they came up with that, if I understand you correctly, you're telling me that a bipartisan group, which included the now-Speaker of the House, were informed of this and that there were some adjustments made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to cover these new groups and new methods of gathering intelligence, but what I hear you saying now is, because this thing has expired, that we're back to September 10, 2001, on our ability to gather intelligence on these new groups.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Chairman, I wanted to read some quotes. This is a quote from Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, 4/24/06: ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   Another quote from Majority Leader Hoyer: ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' This was 10/4/05. 
   On 7/26/06, Mr. JIM CLYBURN, the Democratic Whip, said, ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices.'' 
   We need to see those plans. We need to hear what those ideas are. 
   April 16, 2006, press release, Speaker Pelosi: 
   ``The Republican Rubber Stamp Congress has passed two energy bills, costing taxpayers $12 billion for giveaways to big oil companies. But the Republican bills clearly have done nothing to lower gas prices, as the price of a barrel of oil has sailed over $70 a barrel,'' and I believe it closed over $110 today, ``the highest price in our history.'' 
   ``Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices, taking America in a new direction that works for everyone, not just a few. Our plan would empower the Federal Trade Commission to crack down on price gouging, to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices, increase production of alternative fuels, and rescind the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, tax breaks and royalty relief given to the big oil companies.'' 
   Madam Chairman, I'll say that we have not had any relief from gas prices. Gas prices are a dollar a gallon more today than they were when the new majority took over. 
   We have paid too much attention to windmills, bicycles and solar panels. We need to pay attention to domestic drilling. We need to pay attention to promoting alternative fuels. 
   We have been going in the wrong direction. And if you ask the American people right now, 78 percent of the people say this country is headed in the wrong direction. 
   And, Madam Chairman, I promise you, our gas prices are heading the wrong direction.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Chairman, you know, it's interesting that we came here to talk about a beach bill, and we're finally getting a chance to talk about some energy because most American families are not going to have the money to drive to the beach this year. 
   We look at the price of gasoline right now. And I earlier quoted some of the quotes from the Democratic leadership about how they were going to get a grip and get ahold of the gas prices and bring them down. Well, since they've been in the majority, they have actually gone up $1 per gallon, oil has gone up about 100 percent. And what are we  telling our people at home? I've got to go back and explain to the people of the Third District of Georgia that this week, rather than addressing the price of gas and our energy situation, that we did some beach restoration, which is a very worthy bill; we did some landscape conservation; we named some post offices; and we did some several other suspensions. But I've got to go back and tell them that, when they're standing there at the gas pump almost pumping $4 a gallon into their car, that they need to realize something, they need to realize what the majority plan for our future price of motor fuel is. 
   The chairman, who I have a great deal of respect for, on the Transportation Committee, Mr. Oberstar, who's been here a long time and is very wise, but he projected or at least proposed a 5 cents a gallon hike for our infrastructure and $1 per barrel on oil. The Energy and Commerce chairman is talking about a carbon tax. He's also talking about a 50 cent per gallon tax on fuel. 
   We're talking about taking away these tax breaks from Big Oil. You know, we can take away tax breaks from anybody, but I'm telling you, if you take a tax break away from a company that is manufacturing products in this country, they're not going to just absorb that loss, they're going to go up on the price of their product. So we're talking about maybe 55, 60 cents more a gallon. 
   So I've got to go back and tell my constituents, look, here's their plan: Their plan is to go up another 55 cents or so a gallon on your gas, another dollar on a barrel of oil, take away any tax breaks that the big oil companies have that hopefully they're passing on to you, and your Congress just spent $30,000 to buy 30 bicycles. So they've got a great plan. 
   And I guess this is the great plan that we've heard about in so many of these quotes about how they were going to fix the price of gas. We've bought 30 bicycles at a cost of $30,000; we're going to increase the price of gas 55 cents; we're going to take away the tax breaks for Big Oil so they can go up, increase the price on a barrel of oil. We're not going to do any domestic drilling. We're going to depend on changing light bulbs. We're going to depend on solar power. We're going to depend on windmills. 
   Now, Madam Chairman, I just don't know how much comfort that's going to give the people of the Third Congressional District of Georgia. In fact, I don't know that if I tell them that, that they're even going to believe that, that this body, this House, that is their answer to them paying $4 a gallon for gas. It's just going to be hard for me to sell it. But if they will pay attention to what's going on up here, then I think they'll be convinced that these are the only things that the majority has brought forth. 
   We need to concentrate on being less dependent on foreign oil. We need to look at our own future, our own lands, our own prospects of what we're doing. And as the gentleman from Alaska said, regardless of what you think about fossil fuels, we're going to be using it. And so we need to provide for ourselves. 
   And I think it's a shame that each and every one of us, and I know we're going to be through by 4 o'clock because, you know, we do need to get home, but we're not doing our job. We're not doing the business of the people when we constantly go home and people ask us, help us, help me, help me be able to put gas in my car to take my children to soccer practice, or go to school, or go to the beach. 
   So I'm going to go back and I'm going to say, I'll tell you what, we gave you some help. We're going to raise the price of gas and oil and we're buying bicycles.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for bringing that up because I think every bill needs to be brought to the floor like this, an open rule, so we can have debate. This is a breath of fresh air to have an open rule. I can't remember the last time we had one. So this is a great thing that we have this. This is our republican action in letting people, our constituents, hear our different views on these bills rather than just having it jammed down our throats. So I agree with the chairman on this, and I hope more of these can be brought under an open rule. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like to yield to my good friend from Arizona (Mr. Flake).

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. And I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment because a little ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And so I think what we are doing, like he said, is just making sure that we are perfectly clear to anybody on the conference committee, or any other process that this bill goes through, that we're not to air-drop these earmarks that we never get a chance to discuss. It is very seldom that we get to discuss anything on the floor in the manner that we are being able to talk about this beach restoration bill as we are today. And so I think it is a great thing that we are having this open discussion. 
   Again, I want to comment that I hope that one day my constituents from Georgia's Third Congressional District, which is not that far away from the beach, will be able to have the money that won't pinch their budget to be able to drive to the beach. Right now in Georgia you're paying $3.29 per gallon, which is $1 more a gallon than we paid when the 110th Congress started. And we had all the empty promises and the smoke-and-mirror gadgets that came from the majority that they were going to somehow, that they had some kind of miraculous plan to lower gas prices. 
   We have yet to see that plan. We've talked about raising the fuel tax. We've talked about raising the price of a barrel of oil. We've actually purchased bicycles. And we have done a lot of different things. But the price of gas and oil continues to go up. 
   We had a bailout that caused our dollar to deflate. And that, itself, probably caused the price of a barrel of oil to go up. So I am waiting on that magic wand. I am waiting on that secret that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer and the whip, Mr. Clyburn, all talked about prior to getting in charge. 
   It almost reminds me of a dog inside a fence that is really barking and yelping and wanting to get out and wanting to convince its master that it can go out and do the things that it wants to show that it can do. And then once it gets out of the gate, it just kind of lays down under a tree and scratches its ear or something. 
   So I am ready for some action. I think the American people are ready for action. Bring out this magic plan. Unveil it. Let's see it.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Madam Speaker, I also want to address what the gentleman from Michigan on the other side just got through saying about they are for drilling. Well, if they are for drilling, why is it that they pulled the appropriations bill when there was just a mention of having an amendment to allow drilling? 
   Let me just go back to April 2006 when then-minority leader Nancy Pelosi, now Speaker, said the Democrats have a commonsense plan to lower the skyrocketing price of gas. Where is that plan? Well, the plan was supposed to be, I guess, H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of  2007 which came forth. I am assuming this was the commonsense plan that the Democrats had.     
   Well, you know what? If they want bipartisan for it, if they wanted to vote on drilling, if they want to vote on getting to the Outer Continental Shelf, or if they wanted to be serious about tar sands, alternative fuels, coal-to-liquid, shale oil, then why did we have a closed rule? Why did we shut out half of the American people in this country that have representation in this body that didn't have a voice about an amendment on the floor that did not have an amendment in the Rules Committee? 
   If we're so bipartisan now that this issue has come up and that the majority has not been able to address it, why are we wanting to be bipartisan now? Why weren't we bipartisan when we passed H.R. 6? And let me tell you this: In that bill of over 300 pages, crude oil's mentioned five times, gasoline is mentioned one; exploratory drilling is mentioned two; offshore drilling, zero; domestic drilling, zero; domestic oil, zero; domestic gas, zero; domestic fuel, zero; domestic petroleum, zero; gas prices, zero. Commonsense, goose egg. 
   Greenhouse, 103; green building, 101; ecosystem, 24; climate change, 18; regulation, 98; environmental, 160; geothermal, 94; renewable, 333; swimming pool, 47. And yes, don't forget the popular CFL light bulb, 350 times. 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot regulate our way to energy independence. We cannot tax our way to prosperity. When is the majority party going to understand that we have got to do some of these things that we hear them talking about? 
   It's time to show the American people, Madam Speaker, that we mean business about lowering the price of gas at the pump. I want to quote this, and I think this is a representation of what the Democratic Party did to the American people in 2006. 
   This is a quote from Mr. Kanjorski from a newspaper: 
   ``Now, anybody who is a good student of government would know that wasn't true,'' Mr. Kanjorski said at an Ashley town hall meeting in August. And he was talking about ending the war.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. ``But you know the temptation to want to win back Congress--we sort of stretched the facts, and the American people ate it up.'' 
   Well, I've got something to say to Mr. Kanjorski and the majority party. The people are paying the price for that meal that they had of lies and untruths and half-truths. They're paying the price for it at the pump. 
   It's time we took action. It's time we make it where the American people didn't have to make the choice of visiting a sick relative in the hospital or going to work.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I want to thank my friend, Mr. Gingrey, for doing this and his tireless work on presenting the WHINSEC good faith that they do. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's a shame that every year defenders of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation have to fight for its very existence. But the annual efforts of my colleague, Mr. McGovern, and others to close this important institution at least gives us a regular opportunity to discuss the great work done at WHINSEC in a national forum. 
   It also gives Members of the House a chance to show their support for this educational institution that spreads American know-how and American values to our neighbors and allies throughout Latin America. 
   At least since the administration of Woodrow Wilson, presidents and congressional leaders of both parties have included promotion of democracy throughout our hemisphere and the rest the world as a central tenet of U.S. foreign policy. The last 20 years have witnessed significant global progress in scores of countries. From the southern tip of South America to the northern reaches of Central Europe and throughout the Pacific Rim, the oppressed have become liberated. 
   From the beginning of our Nation, we have belief that the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness comes not from man or from law; those rights are God-given. Thus, we knows as Americans that we can't take all the credit for the growth of liberty and human rights, but we can take pride that our Nation has served for more than 100 years as the loudest voice, the greatest advocate and the fiercest defender of democracy, liberty and individual determination. 
   When we must, we wield the stick. We have fought and shed blood for democracy on the beaches of Normandy, the jungles of Vietnam and the deserts of Iraq. 
   When we can, we wield the carrot. We promote our values to foreign students and our world-leading university system by increasing development through trade agreements and through targeted foreign aid. 
   WHINSEC is a great example of the carrot approach. It's a positive influence through soft power. In other words, it's a positive influence through education and training. 
   WHINSEC is based at Fort Benning, the world's largest infantry training center, which is in my district. Fort Benning plays a huge role in training the U.S. Army, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. Manuals currently used at WHINSEC are identical to those used to train all U.S. Army personnel. WHINSEC operates the most advanced and sophisticated military human rights training program in the world. 
   Comparable training is not available from any other nation or in any other American training facility. Without WHINSEC, Latin American militaries would not have any access to training in military human rights. 
   In the past 20 to 30 years, we have seen great transition in the Latin American countries from the chains of totalitarianism towards the freedom of democracy. We have seen democratically elected governments become more stable, we have seen progress on free trade and more open markets, and we have seen economic growth. 
   It's getting better, but challenges in the region remain. Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez remain vocal adversaries to freedom in the American values. 
   The arc of the universe bends toward justice, and these foes of freedom will fail in time, but the United States must continue to be the lighthouse among rocky waters. We must cooperate, educate, and assist our friends and our neighbors in Latin America. We do that best by supporting WHINSEC and the crucial work that is done there. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat the McGovern amendment and let freedom ring throughout the Western Hemisphere.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the learned orthopedic surgeon from Georgia for yielding me this time. 
   I want to say something to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. When he was talking about an idiot can offer a 1 percent cut amendment, I certainly hope he wasn't talking about my good friend from Georgia. 
   Now if you want to talk about fuzzy math and idiots, we can do that here tonight. Because this bill increases the spending 9 1/2 percent. What the learned surgeon's amendment does is cut that by 1 percent. 
   Now you can say this isn't going to cause a tax increase, you can say it is not going to cost people more money, you can say anything you want to, but the people of this country are smarter than that because they know every day that if they spend more money it is going to cost somebody at some point. 
   So they can say anything they want to. They can talk about all of the fuzzy math, whether it is going to be a tax increase or not a tax increase. But when you spend 10 percent more money, somebody is going to pay for it.

   Mr. WESTMORELAND. I love coming down and listening to the majority leader when he comes down. You know, I was a real estate salesman. I felt like I was a pretty good real estate salesman. And a good salesman loves to hear another salesman. And I think the majority leader could sell an Eskimo ice cubes. 
   But let me say this. He made a statement that the Republicans did not fool the people in November. We didn't. Y'all did. And I think the joke is up. I think the gig is up. I think the foolish is up, because now the ratings of this Congress are at 13 percent, which is about half of what they were when the Republicans in charge. 
   So you're right. You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time.
