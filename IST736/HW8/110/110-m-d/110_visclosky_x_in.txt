   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman, Mr. Space, to express my appreciation for the concern he has for his constituency, as well as the gentlelady from West Virginia, and my colleague on the committee, Mr. Aderholt, who also raised an amendment in the full committee. 
   Again, I appreciate their work and their concern for the people in economic development of not only their individual constituencies, but their region, and certainly would pledge to continue to work with them to address their concerns. 
   Having said that, I would ask my colleague from Ohio to withdraw his amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would reduce DOE's Office of Administration by over $27 million. The bill provides $304 million, a decreased amount under the President's request. 
   The Departmental Administration account funds the guts of the Department; the chief financial officer, human resources, the general counsel, the chief information officer, all are integral to the functioning of the $25 billion operation of the Department of Energy.  
   What I am particularly concerned about relative to the gentlewoman's amendment is that the bill has initiatives that would not be funded as a result of the reductions. 
   There are funds provided in this bill for additional legal counsel to expedite energy efficiency standards for appliances. There has been a significant accumulation of backlog for this work. We can expedite this work and save energy in this country. 
   The bill also funds a review by the National Academy of Public Administration for the contracting in human resources process. Mentioned yesterday during debate, the Department of Energy has been on a high-risk list with the GAO for 17 years. The purpose of the subcommittee of having the National Academy of Public Administration come in is to get DOE off so that they stop wasting and mismanaging money. And I would hate to see that function not occur because of the gentlewoman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge rejection of it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I accept the gentleman's amendment. I understand his concern, as I and Mr. Hobson have grave concerns about the department's record on contracting and project management as well. 
   This bill requires the department to develop an action plan due to Congress that will get DOE off the GAO high-risk list for their contract management performance as soon as possible, as I indicated in the previous debate, where they have been since 1990; follow its own guidelines in Management Order 413.3 for project management; and contract with the National Academy of Public Administration for a review of the departmental contracting processes, which have been a choke point of getting work done. 
   Again, I would be pleased to accept the gentleman's amendment and the record that is established for the department to follow through on GAO's recommendation to examine the root causes of poor contract management.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Udall and also appreciate the fact that he has made a significant contribution to the full Appropriations Committee and also understand the circumstances that he is presented with. 
   Contrary to what I think the belief of some Members are, we have made cuts in this bill, but they were thoughtful cuts, given a number of considerations. I would point out that the means by which the gentleman is trying to secure additional weapons money would cut the Administrator's office and potentially terminate most of the Nation's nonproliferation programs. 
   The nuclear nonproliferation programs are one of the few activities at the Department of Energy that are staffed, managed and run by Federal employees. In the end, Federal employees tend to be generally younger professionals with fewer years of public service and would bear the brunt of any Federal reduction in force. 
   Secondly, I wish that our national labs, which are treasures and do great work, would also be as adamant and as concerned about their security as they are about their budget line. I would ask to submit additional materials in the RECORD, but would point out we had serious security breaches at Los Alamos in December of 1999, June of 2000, November of 2003, May of 2004, July of 2004, in 2005, in 2006. There was an incident in January of 2007 that made Time Magazine. This has got to stop. 
   But the breach that causes me and should cause every Member here the most heartburn is what happened to a gentleman by the name of Shawn Carpenter. Mr. Carpenter worked at Los Alamos, Mr. Carpenter was concerned about security at Los Alamos, and Mr. Carpenter went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to express his concern. He did not go to a local newspaper. He went to the FBI, and he was terminated. There was a trial relative to that wrongful termination. And I would point out that the gentleman who fired Mr. Carpenter, and he subsequently won a judgment of $4.6 million for wrongful termination, got a bonus.  He got a bonus after he fired Mr. Carpenter, and Mr. Carpenter went to the FBI to protect the secrets of this Nation as far as our nuclear security. 
   The third concern I have is some of these moneys would find their way back into the proposal made by the administration that we have eliminated in this bill for a new nuclear weapon. As we have extensively pointed out in the committee report language, since the termination of the Cold War, since regional conflicts such as Kosovo, since 9/11, we have not developed a new nuclear strategy. This is not a time to build a new nuclear weapon. 
   We have significant cost overruns and time overruns on three buildings we were told were needed for stockpile stewardship. None of them are done. All of them are over budget. Now let's take a turn in the road. I am adamantly opposed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, as a Notre Dame grad, I would like to interject myself into this colloquy. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his interest in this area. 
   The gentleman is correct. The subcommittee's objection was to praise the nuclear physics communities adaptiveness in adjusting its facilities plan to our current budgetary realities. It was not meant in any way to define or alter the scope of the proposed facility or limit Michigan State's ability to compete. The subcommittee remains steadfastly committed to ensuring that DOE user facilities are subject to full and open competition and will monitor the process very closely to make sure that all potential competitors are treated fairly by DOE. Again, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding and bringing this matter up.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, as I stated earlier, there is a role and a need for the ARC to assist distressed counties in Appalachia with local economic development and to provide infrastructure requirements. 
   Of the original 223 distressed counties, 74 remain in that category; and clearly the mission of the ARC has not yet been fully realized. The fact is the committee did reduce the administration's request for this account by $30 million and has targeted all of the funds in this bill for those distressed counties. So I would be in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the recognition. I understand the gentlelady's concern and, with the observation that she is going to withdraw her amendment, have a number of points to make but will simply enter those into the Record.  
   Proceeding with construction of nuclear spent fuel recycling facilities at this time is premature. 
   Geologic capacity exists at Yucca Mountain to accommodate much more high level waste than currently permitted by legislation 
   Spent fuel recycling is not economically viable given affordable fresh supplies of uranium fuel 
   On-site storage of nuclear spent fuel is safe for 50 to 100 years, so there is no rush, but there could be cost savings from removing spent fuel from the nine decommissioned nuclear reactor sites.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong objection to the gentlelady's amendment and would point out a couple of things. One, as we stated in opening debate, we very carefully looked at all the accounts in this bill and, among other things, made cuts in over 57 programs to make sure that funds were available for positive programs that make a difference in people's lives. One of those areas is in the area of energy and specifically the high cost of gasoline for consumers across the country. 
   One of the things that we did do is to add money in this legislation, $130 million above the President's request, to provide $503 million for new vehicle technologies and for biofuels. Another area as far as the energy crisis was the change in the overall request relative to climate change and, again, funds were made available for such things as research, development and demonstration of new energy technologies in solar, geothermal, wind, hydropower, fossil and nuclear energy as well as research, development and demonstration of conservation technologies for buildings and industries as well as the deployment of energy conservation through weatherization in Federal buildings. 
   There are a lot of very positive things that we have done in this legislation to advance a positive energy agenda. The gentlewoman's amendment would be hurtful to those efforts and I am opposed to her amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Musgrave). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding very much and certainly appreciate his passion and concern about the health and safety of his constituents and this important issue to him. 
   The problem we have incurred on the committee, and this is not the only regulatory issue regarding FERC that has been brought to our attention, is we are not a regulatory body and obviously have jurisdictional issues that are set aside over and above the issues of substance relative to the gentleman's amendment. 
   But we do appreciate his concern. Certainly we would be happy to stay in touch with him, without making a commitment, that this issue will be resolved through the appropriations process. We do believe that the higher this issue could be raised as far as the public and the regulatory commission, the better off all the citizens of his community are going to be. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman for raising the issue and appreciate the fact that he apparently will be withdrawing his amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but let me first begin my discussion by expressing my sincere respect for the gentleman who has offered the amendment, Mr. Bishop, as well as the two speakers who have followed him in support of it, particularly my colleague on the Appropriations Committee, the chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro.     
   I would point out to the body that this is the second FERC issue that has been brought up on a regulatory matter before the subcommittee on the floor. We have had other inquiries from Members that have not reached this level that are very similar in substance in other areas of the country. I would not pretend to deny that there is a problem, but I am not competent to sort through that fact as I am not a regulator myself, to make a determination, and do not believe that this is a venue to make those particular determinations. 
   The amendment before us undoes the Natural Gas Act for the orderly review and decision making process for energy infrastructure and limits energy development efforts. FERC's consideration of applications to site energy facilities does not imply that the applications will be granted, or if granted, will not require appropriate environmental protection measures. Moreover, all FERC authorizations are subject to judicial review. 
   I do believe that FERC's application process ought to be able to run its course. And again, I regret that I have to stand in objection to the amendment but trust that my colleagues understand the impetus for that.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Again, I stand in opposition to the gentleman's amendment and apologize to the gentleman for having his State of origin incorrect, especially because he is from the great State of Ohio. But I would emphasize that this is the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for the coming year, and we are in an energy crisis and it transcends the cost of the price of gasoline at the pump. It is a true economic situation and crisis that we face. It is a national security issue that we face. My good friend, the senior Senator from the State of Indiana, Senator Lugar, has characterized the energy crisis we face as the albatross around our national security neck. It is also an environmental issue as far as a potential catastrophic climate change that will occur if we do not deal with the issue of CO  
   2.
   This bill makes an investment in solving that crisis we face. It will not solve all the problems tomorrow morning, but it will put us on firm footing to do so in the future. 
   Let's talk about vehicle technology. The bill recommends $93 million for hybrid electric systems, an increase of $13 million over the President's request. Of the increase, $10 million is for energy storage research and development for advanced batteries for electric, hybrid electric, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and $3 million is for independent test and evaluation of all vehicles developed in the upcoming demonstration phase. 
   This bill also includes $49 million for advanced combustion engine research and development, an increase of $15 million over the President's request to restore funding for heavy truck engine research that was eliminated in the administration's request. 
   It does include $48 million, $15 million over the budget, for materials technology research, to accelerate the development of cost-effective materials and manufacturing processes that contribute to fuel-efficient passenger and commercial vehicles. 
   It includes $10 million more than the administration's request for nonpetroleum-based fuels and lubricants evaluation to expand and accelerate research and development for the optimum ethanol fuel. 
   And we also have an increase for technology integration of $6 million in this bill for vehicle technologies and deployment, formerly the Clean Cities Program. We have moneys in here to advance geothermal technology, to demonstrate cost-share industry that will allow accelerated research into new geothermal technologies. 
   We have moneys in here for hydropower; for research, development, and demonstration of ocean, tidal, and in-stream hydropower energy systems. We have made an investment in this bill for electricity supply and delivery research, for applied research on semi-conductor material, device and processing issues, technology acceptance and technology evaluation. 
   We have investment moneys in this bill for solar energy research, and the gentleman from the State of Massachusetts talked about that briefly, to develop cost-neutral designs and technologies to better integrate solar heating and lighting into building designs. We have made an investment in this bill for facilities to research, test, and demonstrate the new renewable technologies. 
   It would be a mistake to change these funding levels and turn the clock back as far as trying to make progress to solve the energy problems we face in this Nation.

   I would point out, however, Mr. Chairman, that there are no funds in this bill for that purpose. Indeed, I would remind my colleagues that authorization and direct appropriations for this purpose would also be needed. So I do rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. But I would also point out in a positive fashion that there is $95 million in this bill for the rehabilitation of existing hydroelectric facilities on our waterways. 
   I certainly do think they make a significant, and can make even a greater, contribution to the energy demands of this country. But again, Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, we have had a lot of debate and discussion about this legislation over the last 2 days. I certainly have tried to emphasize that it represents an investment in this country. Some of that investment is represented by cuts we made, over 50 cuts in programs we did not feel were commensurate with the value of the monies that the taxpayers have sent to the United States Government. 
   Many of those other dollars have been invested in programs we believe inure to the benefit of people's health and safety, to the movement of commerce and to the growth of our economy. 
   I am going to be the last speaker on our side on this amendment and would conclude in another vein, and that is the national security of our country. I think most people, when they look at the Department of Energy, believe that you have a Department that spends all of its money on energy and energy research. 
   As our colleagues know, this simply is not true. Only $1 out of about every $10 inure to that purpose. Most of it deals with cleaning up nuclear waste. Much of it is keeping our nuclear arsenal secure, as well as making sure that it is safe and reliable. 
   Our national security is at stake when we consider many of the elements in this bill. We are charged in this subcommittee to try to make wise decisions as to what pertains to people and this country's security and what does not. 
   I would draw attention to a fundamental issue that affects every one of us, and that is the possibility of the nuclear conflict. There is a proposal pending by the administration to build a new nuclear weapon. 
   We had to make what I think is a very profound decision on behalf of the people of this country as to what course of action should we take. We decided, in a bipartisan fashion on this subcommittee, to not proceed for a number of reasons. One is essentially what the perspective of our allies and those who do not have our interests at heart internationally would be if we proceed. 
   In testimony before the subcommittee, former chairman of the Armed Services Committee in the Senate, Sam Nunn, who is only one of two people I have ever met in my 57 years who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, the other being my senior Senator in Indiana, Senator Lugar, said that on the RRW itself, the new nuclear weapon, if Congress gives a green light to this in our current world environment, I believe this will be misunderstood by our allies, exploited by our adversaries, complicate our work to prevent the spread and the use of nuclear weapons. I will not fund additional work on RRW at this time. 
   Another concern we had on the subcommittee is what is our strategy for the use or, hopefully not the use, of those weapons, as well as our strategy as far as eliminating weapons internationally. We have not developed as a Nation and as a government a new strategy subsequent to the end of the Cold War. We have had regional conflicts thereafter in policies like Kosovo. We have had the events of 9/11, and we find ourselves in conflict the most today. 
   We should have a broad national policy, not the policy of the Bush administration or any administration, but a national policy that stands the test of time through various administrations, as our last one did for half a century, and a strategy that also lasts through Congresses controlled by Republicans, Congresses controlled by Democrats over a generation; and that strategy does not exist. 
   I am very heartened that the Armed Services Committee, under the leadership, particularly, of Subcommittee Chairman Tauscher, as well as her ranking member, Mr. Everett, on your side of the aisle, has asked for a commission to study that very issue. 
   I am also very concerned that in the past, beginning in the late 1990s, the taxpayers of this country have been asked to invest billions of dollars in the so-called Stockpile Stewardship Program that I support. It is to ensure this we do not have to perform nuclear tests, but to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. 
   But we were also told, by several administrations of both parties and by the Department of Energy for over a decade, that we need the National Ignition Facility built. Well, it's 6 years behind schedule, and it's 226 percent over budget by a factor of $2.428 billion. 
   We were told by several administrations and the Department of Energy, both parties, that we need the Microsystems Science Engineering and Applications Lab at Sandia National Laboratory. That is currently 29.5 percent over budget. 
   We were told by administrations of both parties that we need a dual-axis radiographic hydrotest facility. That is now 6 years behind. That is 35 percent over budget. None of them have been completed. None of them are going to come in on time.     
   I would grant that the Advanced Simulation and Computational Initiative has taken hold and has produced results and has been a valuable investment. 
   To now, after more than a decade of investment that has not come to total fruition, to make a hard turn in the road and start spending new money on new construction without a strategy would be a mistake. And this subcommittee has made a determination not to waste the American taxpayers' dollars on that project. 
   We have asked, and it began 2 years ago under the leadership of then-Chairman HOBSON, that we have an arsenal of 10,000 nuclear warheads, we have a Cold War complex. We need to rationalize and, in effect, downsize that to meet the new threats to make sure that we are nimble, that we are safe, and that we save the taxpayers as much money as possible. 
   The administration has come back in and said, well, let us build a new nuclear weapon by 2012. And you know what? We're going to take care of the rationalization of the complex, and we're going to downsize and we're going to do that in 2030. 
   My point is, I wish the administration and, in this case particularly, the Department of Energy, had as much aggression and commitment to downsizing the complex as they do on developing a weapon. 
   And what they also would suggest that we do, before we downsize is, well, let's begin construction of this new nuclear weapon in the existing complex. So now we will have the old and we will have the new. And I think everyone, Mr. Chairman, knows the end of that story. Nothing will ever change. 
   It's hard to attach an exact dollar and figure on that critical issue of our national security. But many of the dollars we have saved and not spent, and we have cut in this bill, is to make sure that we take the right approach as far as our nuclear strategy and our nuclear safety, and I am very proud of that. 
   I see the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson) on his feet. And if he would want time, I would be happy to yield to him.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. And Mr. Chairman, I want people to truly appreciate Mr. Hobson's dedication as a member of not only this subcommittee, and as chairman for 4 years, but as a member of the Defense Subcommittee when there was a similar proposal several years ago and he thought it was the incorrect proposal. He stopped what I think was incorrect public policy from taking place. He saved the taxpayers of this country money. 
   And the only reason today I believe we have even a 20-30 proposition from the administration as far as downsizing the complex, that I find totally unsatisfactory but at least it is a proposal, is because of the work that Mr. Hobson did. And I thank him for that very much, and do ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the recognition, and I rise in strong and adamant opposition to the gentleman's amendment. During my remarks, I would like to make three points and also indicate that this project is in the City of Rensselaer, Indiana, at St. Joseph's College. It is for the restoration of a historic theater that continues to be used by the faculty and students of the school, as well as the constituents and citizens of Rensselaer and Jasper County, Indiana. 
   The total cost for the renovation of this project is about $965,000. The request and approval by the subcommittee was for $100,000. I would want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Dicks, as well as the ranking member, my good friend, Mr. Tiahrt, for their consideration of this very important project. 
   The first point I do want to make is that this has great value to the community in which it is situated. While the gentleman who offered the amendment enumerated a whole series of other possible projects in another State, that is not the subject of this amendment. It is the restoration of a historic theater at St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer. 
   It was built in 1914 and designed in revival style, referred to as Collegiate Gothic. It is located in the college's historic district, and the goal of the project is to restore the theater as an attractive, useful centerpiece for the college and the City of Rensselaer while retaining its notable contribution among historic sites and structures in the great State of Indiana. 
   The second point I would want to make, and I would take off on the remarks made by the chairman, is he suggested that we have a right to spend this money. I agree with that assertion. I would take it a step further and say, we have a responsibility to make an investment in this country. We need to invest to preserve the past so we can continue to learn its lessons. We need to invest in this country for our present and for those who live here today. We need to invest in this country and its infrastructure for the future of this Nation and for the children of this generation and those yet to come. We have a responsibility as well as a right. 
   The gentleman from Washington, Mr. Dicks, also mentioned we are here to help each other out. I would conclude by stressing that point. 
   While I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from the Fifth District of Texas, I happen to represent the First District in Indiana, and the last time I looked, society and the purpose of us joining together in a free government is to help each other out and to look out for each others' interests. 
   It is not the government that is paying this money, as the gentleman indicated; it is the people of this country who are paying for this project in Rensselaer, Indiana, that has value, which is the same reason why I think it is absolutely appropriate that taxpayers in places like east Chicago, Indiana, and Hobart, Indiana, expend some of their tax moneys as individuals to help the City of Dallas, for example, with their floodway to ensure that there is not property damage in the future, that there is not loss of life, that there is not injury to others in this country. 
   It is why I think there is a noble reason to ask people who live in Lowell, Indiana, and Chesterton, Indiana, and Gary, Indiana, to help fund research taking place at Oak Ridge in Tennessee. At first blush, why should we have an interest in making that investment? Because it inures to the benefit of not only everyone who lives in the United States, but everyone worldwide. 
   We should get over this concept that we have to be parochial in what we do and get over this concept that we should be selfish about what we are about. We are here to make an investment, and, as the gentleman from Washington rightfully pointed out, to help each other out. 
   So I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment. I absolutely think it is bad policy, and I would ask my colleagues' support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5472, a measure to name a post office in honor of our departed colleague and dear friend, Representative Julia Carson. 
   I would like to thank the 46 Members of the House who agreed to support and cosponsor this measure, as well as Senator Bayh for introducing S. 2534, the Senate companion legislation. 
   I would also like to acknowledge that Representative Meek and Representative David Scott have expressed their support, though they were unable to become official cosponsors of the measure due to its rapid movement out of committee. I would also be remiss if I did not thank the Chair and the ranking member of the full committee, as well as the ranking member and Chair of the subcommittee for considering the bill and reporting it out. 
   Julia Carson was a tremendous human being. She passed away on December 15 after a life devoted to service. And as I pointed out last December, with the solstice upon us, the darkest day of the year, that Julia Carson was a light to everyone she came into contact with and certainly was a beacon in this House.     
   She could be tough, she could be gentle, but she was always effective. 
   It is a tribute to her life and to her service to name this Federal facility after her. And I only speak for myself when I would say, however, that Julia is probably looking in on this, is honored, but asking, why aren't we out helping someone else right now, because that was her life. And I would hope that we all take this moment and this honor to rededicate ourselves to helping others along life's path as this great and wonderful and kind and gentle woman has done. 
   Again, I thank the Chair and ranking member for their courtesy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, my good friend from Ohio, to honor JULIA CARSON and her life of work to the people she represented in her district, to the people of Indiana, and this country. 
   Yesterday on this floor, I talked about the light that JULIA cast upon all of us, whether it was the twinkle in her eye or her burning desire to make the world a better place. This evening, I would like to talk about the strength of her character. 
   JULIA, when she was a young child, had a stuttering problem; but it was corrected and she was not deterred. As a 12-year-old, her mother, who scrubbed floors and took care of families and didn't get paid if she was sick, became ill; and at some point, the money had run out. JULIA went to the trustee's office to seek help, and, ultimately, cornmeal and lard were pushed across the counter to her. 
   When JULIA was 4 years old, for the only time in her life, she met her father. Her father promised that he was going to be a constant figure in her life. He gave her $5, and he was never seen again. Her mother remarried to someone who used to beat her. And often her mother could not come to her school events because he was someplace taking care of someone else's children. And she certainly, being a product of that time and that place, was subject to racism. 
   In an article she wrote in March of 1996, when she was running for Congress, entitled ``My Neighbor as Myself,'' she related one of those instances. And I think it really summed up JULIA, who could be very tough but also have a general touch. She wrote: 
   ``Another more amusing experience with racial stereotyping occurred when I worked with Congressman Andy Jacobs. One particular woman called our office quite often to complain about a wide variety of problems. I tried to be patient with her. 
   ``I never realized that my many conversations with this woman had all occurred on the telephone until one day when she called, quite agitated, to inform me that a horrible thing had happened: a black family had moved in next door to her. 
   ``It took me a minute to overcome my surprise, as she simply assumed that this competent public servant had to be white. However, after thinking about a wide assortment of possible responses, I simply replied, `It is okay, honey. Just give it a chance. I have black families living all over my neighborhood, and it has turned out all right.' '' And you could just see JULIA saying that. 
   In the end, many people would be embittered by experiences like that, but JULIA was not. And as Andy Jacobs, her very dear friend, wrote: From the physical pain of material poverty and the mindless cruel persecution of racism, JULIA CARSON made her choice, a choice of hard work, compassion, and a pleasing sense of humor. And heaven smiled. 
   And I know heaven is smiling on JULIA tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, it is my privilege to submit to the House for its consideration H.R. 2641, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. 
   I want to first thank all the members of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee for their help in bringing this bill to the floor today. I particularly want to thank my partner and ranking member, Mr. Hobson of Ohio, for his extraordinary friendship and cooperation this year. 
   I would parenthetically point out that for the last 8 years, Mr. Hobson has come to this floor as chairman of an appropriations subcommittee to manage a bill. I am wiser and richer because of the advice and counsel of Mr. Hobson throughout the development of this bill, and I thank my friend deeply. 
   This is a truly bipartisan bill that represents a fair and balanced compromise. I believe this is the way our constituents expect Representatives to work together, and I am proud of our bipartisan process. I also want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, and the ranking minority member, Mr. Lewis, for their support. 
   And I deeply want to thank all of the staff of the subcommittee, Dixon Butler, Scott Burnison, Terry Tyborowski, Taunja Berquam, Lori Maes, Kevin Cook, Rob Blair, and Ben Nicholson, for their very hard work on this bill. I want to also thank both Shari Davenport of my office and Kenny Kraft of Mr. Hobson's office. And I would also acknowledge our agency detailee, Chris Frabotta from the Corps of Engineers, for his assistance in putting this bill and report together. These people form a great team and their work has been invaluable. I would also note for the membership that Chris has served two tours of duty in Iraq as part of the Army Corps of Engineers and Taunja has also served our country in Iraq on one tour also with the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   Total funding for the Energy and Water Development in fiscal year 2008 is $31.603 billion. This bill cuts lower priority programs. These spending cuts include 37 programs in weapons under the Department of Energy, totaling $632 million below the President's request, and 20 other programs, totaling $280 million below the President's request. 
   On the other hand, this bill funds the most worthwhile projects and programs at or above the requested level. It reduces some programs that are less valuable or less urgent and redirects funding from previous years that has not been obligated or spent. 
   All our constituents are in shock at the high price of gas. There is nearly half a billion dollars provided in this bill for research, development, and demonstration efforts in biofuels and vehicle technologies. I would also note that this subcommittee has been working to provide additional funding for this critical area for 3 years, first of all, under the leadership of Mr. Hobson and, more recently, myself. We are today funding above the President's request for biofuels and vehicle technologies over fiscal year 2006. Together we again increase funding in 2007, and this subcommittee this year made additional investments in vehicle technologies and biofuels for fiscal year 2008. Compared to the President's 2006 request, the subcommittee has worked in a bipartisan fashion to address the energy crisis by increasing funding for these areas by over 100 percent. 
   These efforts will not bring down the price of gas immediately, but they will help put us on a path to decrease dependence on imported oil and greater fuel efficiency. These are critical steps we must take today. 
   One of the reasons for our current energy price crisis is the past lack of investment in energy. In fiscal year 2006, adjusted for inflation, government funding for energy research, development, and demonstration had fallen to less than one-quarter of its 1980 levels. In the fiscal year 2007 year-long continuing resolution, Congress began to address this by increasing funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy activities at the Department of Energy by $300 million. For example, in fiscal year 2006, adjusted for inflation, government funding for conservation R&D  was 49.2 percent of where it was in 1980. This year it will be 68.7 percent. The bill provides increased funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy that is $400 million above 2007 levels. 
   Energy consumption can be cut in the near term through increased funding for weatherization assistance. This bill provides $245 million in weatherization grants and is an increase of $100 million from the President's request. In addition, the bill redirects fossil energy funding to emphasize carbon capture and sequestration. 
   Increased funding is included for nuclear energy as well, balancing support for licensing new light water nuclear reactors, the kind that currently provide 20 percent of our electricity, for demonstrating the safer Gen IV helium-cooled nuclear reactor technology and for research and development, particularly on the nuclear fuel cycle. 
   Nuclear weapons or weapons material in the hands of terrorists is acknowledged by the President and others to be the number one terrorist threat to the United States. The Department of Energy takes the lead in combating this threat by advancing international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation with an $878 million, or 74 percent, increase to the President's proposed operating level for legitimate nuclear nonproliferation programs. 
   Testimony before our committee has made clear that there are significant opportunities for protecting such nuclear material where it exists, enhancing monitoring systems that detect it should it be moved illegitimately, and transferring it to safer locations. This bill also redirects funding provided in 1999 but never spent to initiate a nuclear fuel bank under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This fuel bank, conceived originally by former Senator Nunn and others, is intended to remove the motivation for countries that wish to rely on nuclear energy to develop their own uranium enrichment capabilities. This is the precise concern that the U.S. and many other nations have today with the country of Iran. 
   Nuclear nonproliferation activities have included parallel efforts for the United States and Russia to dispose of surplus weapons-origin plutonium. The U.S. has pursued fabrication of mixed oxide fuels, so-called MOX, for use in commercial nuclear reactors followed by disposal in Yucca Mountain as its strategy. It is assumed that Russia will eventually agree to follow a similar path. Russia prefers a different path to dispose of its weapons-origin plutonium by using it to fuel breeder reactors. This approach would result in more plutonium, not less. The administration and the defense authorizers ended a direct linkage between the U.S. and Russian programs last year. Therefore, with no expectation of any Russian plutonium disposition occurring under this program, the U.S. MOX facility is no longer a nuclear nonproliferation activity. And very importantly, and I would emphasize this, the subcommittee transfers the project to the nuclear energy program along with enough funding to allow construction to proceed. This funding for MOX will be accompanied by continuous oversight. This subcommittee will closely monitor the progress of the MOX facility. If mistakes continue to be made, the Department of Energy will find it very difficult to make a successful case for any further support. 
   Without question, Mr. Chairman, there is a need for a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy and stockpile plan to guide transformation and downsizing of the stockpile nuclear weapons complex; and until progress is made on this crucial issue, there will be no new facilities or Reliable Replacement Warhead. Only when a future nuclear weapons strategy is established can the Department of Energy determine the requirements for the future of nuclear weapons stockpile and nuclear weapons complex. 
   Further, testimony before this subcommittee has pointed to the potential for the international community to misunderstand development by the United States of a new nuclear weapon. Moreover, for the last decade, the administration has said that stockpile stewardship was a path to maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. Now, with three major facilities that we were told were needed for stockpile stewardship all overbudget, all over their deadlines, and all not completed, we are told ``let's do something else.'' 
   Given the serious international and domestic consequences of the U.S. initiating a new nuclear weapons production activity, it is critical that the administration lay out a comprehensive course of action before funding is appropriated. Major transformation of the weapons complex can only be produced with significant bipartisan support, lasting over multiple sections of Congress and multiple administrations. Given the track record of mismanagement at the agency for projects that have a plan, I don't think it is asking too much for a comprehensive nuclear strategy before we build a new nuclear weapon. 
   People work hard for their money before they pay their Federal taxes. The Department of Energy has squandered vast sums of this money. Project management at the Department of Energy must be reformed. The Department of Energy is the largest civilian contracting agency of the Federal Government and spends over 90 percent of its annual budget on contracts. In 1990 the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, began an annual assessment resulting in a list of programs that are at high risk for waste, abuse, and mismanagement. DOE contract management has been on that list year in and year out for 17-long miserable years. GAO has found that since October 2002, alone, DOE has achieved its performance goal of implementing projects within 10 percent of cost and schedule baselines only about one-third of the time. 
   One of the management failures is the waste treatment plant at Hanford, Washington, where the construction cost overrun now exceeds $8 billion. This is just one example of inexcusable, ineffective, and wasteful project management at the Department of Energy. DOE's inability to effectively manage critical projects has real consequences for our Nation and calls into question their ability to ensure that we are prepared to meet important challenges. 
   In the bill, DOE is directed to work with the GAO to develop a concrete plan to get off the GAO high-risk list. 
   There are also elements in this bill, important ones, dedicated to the environmental cleanup responsibilities of the Department and for the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   I do believe, Mr. Chairman, this is a very good bill and would recommend it to my colleagues' attention and would request their support. 
   Mr. Chairman I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would just make a few comments. One is, I do not believe that Mr. Hobson was on the floor when I thanked him for his sage advice. 
   As he mentioned in his opening remarks, as I did in mine, he has chaired eight times and has brought bills to the floor eight times on appropriation subcommittees. He has been a great friend and a great teacher. I would suggest that the mistakes I make are my own and not a failure of Mr. Hobson or the ably trained staff on the committee. 
   I would also simply point out in all seriousness that the differences, so to speak, between Mr. Hobson and myself on MOX are marginal and at a matter of degrees. We are agreed as far as the failure of the Department of Energy and their management practices. We are agreed that they are forewarned that they had better not make one mistake in South Carolina on this project. And I would very strongly emphasize that the moneys for MOX are where they should be and where I certainly want them to remain, and that is within the energy programs of the Department of Energy because MOX no longer has anything to do with proliferation, and if left in that account, would have eaten half of that very important program alive from a monetary standpoint.     
   I would emphasize this is not simply an issue of money, but keeping that money in its appropriate account, and that is in the energy account at the Department of Energy. Again I would thank the gentleman for his words on this project on this House floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), the chairman of the full committee.

I can assure the gentlemen from both Washington and New Jersey that the committee is aware of this sustainable energy source and will continue to work with and provide oversight of the Department of Energy to ensure that renewable marine and hydroenergy development, both from the oceans, waves, tides and streams, as well as for energy from hydroelectric dams is a priority of the agency. It is the committees's intention to fund these new technologies for $6 million for research, development, and demonstration for new waterpower technologies. 
   Part of our approach to the energy crisis is the support of a broad range of energy and conservation technologies so that we have the best chance of meeting the challenge before us. A diverse energy supply for portfolio is key to providing reliable electricity for all of America's homes and businesses.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. Westmoreland. 
   First of all, he did indicate that he was concerned about reinvestigations. I would simply indicate to my colleagues that the world changes every day, and there are times when we need to reassess the circumstances so that we can spend the taxpayers' dollars as wisely as possible. 
   The fact is that the Nation's investment in our water resources infrastructure has declined over the last three decades, from $6 billion per year to less than $4 billion in constant dollars. 
   If the tragedy in New Orleans has taught us anything, I hope it is that we have neglected our infrastructure. If the suffering of the residents in the gulf doesn't illustrate the point, simple fiscal prudence should. The cost of recovery in New Orleans will far exceed what it would have cost to provide additional flood and storm protection. 
   There are large cities that face high and increasing risk of catastrophic flooding. Sacramento is just one example. 
   We have high-hazard dams with safety issues. There are countless communities that do not have flood protection commensurate with the risk to those communities. 
   Much of our infrastructure is reaching its design life. Over 50 percent of the locks and dams owned by the Corps of Engineers are in this category. Aging infrastructure brings increasing costs, yet the funding for accounts at the Army Corps for this particular function have been flat over the last 30 years. 
   Circumstances have changed from the time much of our infrastructure has been designed, development patterns have changed, transportation networks and requirements have evolved. Yet we are not investing enough today to maintain what we already own or complete projects that are in progress today, much less plan for the future needs for the safety of our citizens and economic viability of our transportation system. 
   Due to insufficient funding, schedules are slipping and costs are growing, as we piecemeal these projects, if we do not act in a timely fashion. 
   There is a significant and growing backlog of civil works projects. Current estimates are as high as $60 billion. Funding for studies and investigations must be adequately funded so that we can proceed with these very important projects. And given the backlog in construction projects, the funding for investigations account is less than the current year. 
   The bill focuses funding on completing ongoing projects and maintaining existing infrastructure. However, it is very important, obviously, to plan for the future. 
   I would ask that my colleagues oppose the amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, but I don't disagree with everything he has enunciated in his defense of his position. 
   The two previous speakers before the gentleman talked about red tape and delay in the regulatory process with Army Corps. I would assume that every member of this subcommittee has had those meetings with the Corps, and we are certainly trying to rectify that problem on the theory that the sooner projects can be completed, the more benefit will enure to the taxpayers of this country and its citizens. 
   The gentleman's also right to enumerate the large backlog that we have on construction and other Corps facilities in this country, and that is one of the things that we are trying to address in this bill. 
   I would point out that the approach that we have taken, not just for the fiscal year 2008 bill, but in the last several years under the leadership of then-Chairman HOBSON, was to make sure that we face the challenges of the future in a very disciplined and rigorous approach that encompasses a broader context. 
   The bill continues the financial management contractor reforms to ensure that the Corps manages its budget to the best interest of the taxpayers. The recommendations include direction that the Corps continues to take action in considering additional factors as they proceed in the planning process. 
   And again, it has been the custom of this subcommittee in designing and structuring bills for the last several years to look at projects and marshal our resources so that some are completed, as opposed to bumbling on forever. And I wouldn't argue with the gentleman about that concern. 
   We have, again, done that in this bill to make sure that those additional construction dollars that the gentleman seeks to remove from the bill are put to good and rigorous use. And I would point out that this is not an abstraction. This goes to the core of people's health and safety. 
   Two floods ago, on the little Calumet River in Northwest Indiana, we had a gentleman in Highland, Indiana, lose his life. He was only one life in one flood. But for that man, and for his family, and for that community, it was a tragedy. We are constructing a flood control project that insures that that never happens again.  
   That's why we have flood control programs in the city of Dallas and its vicinities, to make sure that when you have significant events, as we have had this week in the State of Texas, that you do not have loss of life and, hopefully, you can diminish the loss of property. 
   We have huge commercial centers, ports like Long Beach, ports like the city of New York, ports like Baltimore, up and down our coast. We want to make sure that the commerce of this country moves as efficiently as possible, so that our economy grows and we can provide good paying jobs for all of our residents. 
   We have a State capitol in the most populous State in this country, Sacramento, California, one dike a way from a catastrophic event as far as the loss of human life and the destruction of properties. 
   Those are the types of projects, and those are the types of priorities that we are attempting to get at in this bill. And that's why these moneys are set aside, and would be opposed to their removal from this bill.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   I again would reference some of his words where he indicated that $18 million is no small sum of money. It is a very significant sum of money, and I  would agree with him. It is a significant sum of money, and it is very important to the programs that comprise the Mississippi River and Tributaries Program. And my concern is, if you would, carving out a particular geographic region for this particular cut and would emphasize that while it is but one geographic region and water system within our country, there are consequences of the amendments because channel improvement programs in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee would be affected. There are levees for the Mississippi River in States like Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. There is a flood waste system in the State of Louisiana, and there are operation and maintenance costs. 
   These are all significant and important programs dealing, again, with the priority of people's health and safety, the movement of commerce, and the protection of property. 
   I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. Mr. Chairman, the water and related resources account funds Reclamation's core missions of delivering water to citizens of this country, to those who till the soil in our country, and for generating hydropower. 
   Given the growing need for water supplies in the 17 Western States of this country, I certainly believe it is critical that the Nation invest now in water reclamation and reuse projects for the future. 
   This account also provides very important funds for rural water supply projects for tribal and rural communities, contributing to meeting the United States' trust responsibilities to Indian reservations through the delivery of safe drinking water. 
   I share the gentleman's concern about health programs in the United States, and I can't think of anything more important than ensuring that people in 17 different States of this country have clean water to drink. And how shortsighted it would be to cut programs that provide clean drinking water for human health, so that we can spend untold sums of money on their health care after they get sick. If you want to talk about something that is penny-wise and pound-foolish, we have found it this afternoon. 
   This is a health amendment. If we take these moneys away, we will do a disservice to the health of the people who live in these regions. As with the Corps of Engineers, Reclamation's infrastructure is aging, and it has increasing requirements for proper and adequate maintenance of its infrastructure. 
   But 17 States cover a large area and swath of the continent. But I'm just wondering which citizens in which communities are we going to tell we just can't help you this year because we might have accepted the gentleman's amendment. Are we going to tell people in Wichita, Kansas, the Wichita Cheney program that maybe they're not going to get all of their money? 
   Are we going to tell people at Lakehead, Nevada that well, we had to make a cut of $55 million, and you're just not going to have the resources you need? 
   Or people in Oregon for the Crooked River project, are we going to tell them well, there's just not enough money now? 
   Are we going to, in the State of Colorado, tell people in Pine River that we had to make a cut? 
   In Texas, are we going to tell people for the Canadian River project that there just wasn't enough money to go around, or at Moon Lake in the State of Utah that we're sorry, Congress dropped the ball? Or for the Colombia River Basin project, that somehow there was a shortfall in us meeting our responsibilities? 
   The gentleman's correct. This is a health amendment. This is clean drinking water for people who live in 17 States in the United States of America provided through infrastructure that is aging. We have a responsibility to invest in that, and that is why I'm strongly opposed to the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I would like to actually talk about the bill, and I would like to talk about the underlying merits of what Mr. Hobson and I and the members of the subcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee have tried to do. 
   In this particular title, we are talking about the Bureau of Reclamation, and we are talking about people's health and well-being. Part of that does include the wise stewardship of the moneys that are provided. From the debate that has taken place today, you would think that the only thing we are worried about is spending money and worried about the quantity of the money that we are spending as opposed to the quality of the underlying act and the work that the agencies do. And I would draw, Mr. Chairman, my colleague's attention to page 48 of the report that goes into great detail, and I am going to read it. 
   The gentleman has an amendment before us to cut $1.236 million from the bill. And the fact is, over the last several years our subcommittee, under the leadership of then-Chairman Hobson, as well as myself, have done everything possible to make sure that the moneys being spent by the Bureau of Reclamation are being spent wisely. 
   And I read from the report. ``In fiscal year 2006, the Committee directed the Department of Interior to submit, with its fiscal year 2007 budget request, a detailed 5-year budget plan for each of the major budget components, including water and related resources, California Bay Delta Restoration program,  Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, and Central Utah Project Completion.'' 
   Because the concern of the subcommittee then, and as it is as of this moment, is that the public's moneys are being spent with quality as well. 
   ``The Department subsequently informed the Committee that it would be unable to provide a 5-year plan for fiscal year 2007 and intended to make the initial submission with the fiscal year 2008 request. The Bureau failed to make that submission either, and now informs the Committee that the 5-year plan will be submitted at some undefined time in the future.'' 
   The patience of the subcommittee, the patience of the Appropriations Committee is not without limit. And as a result, in the report language we note the Committee's extreme frustration with the Bureau's inability to provide a 5-year budget plan, the act contains a provision that transfers $10 million, not $1.236 million, but $10 million from policy and administration to water and related resources if the 5-year plan is not submitted within 60 days of date of enactment. We are certainly not afraid to move moneys around, and in this case, to the tune of $10 million, if the good judgment of this committee is not abided by. 
   So I would emphasize that this is not just a matter of quantity of money, it is quality of money. And that is what we are about. That is why I am adamantly opposed to the gentleman's amendment.     
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   I appreciate what the gentleman wants to do. We certainly share a concern about global warming. We also share a desire to ensure that we have a viable nuclear industry in the near term as well as the long term. Where there would be a difference of opinion is the balance that needs to be struck in this legislation to accomplish both of those goals. 
   I would point out that the legislation that has been reported to the House has done everything possible to ensure that the nuclear industry can move forward. For example, we have fully funded the President's request for $494 million for Yucca Mountain to make sure that they can meet their deadline for the submission of a license for the waste repository in June of 2008. The industry clearly needs the repository. 
   The House bill includes $167.8 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, something that I think the gentleman would agree is critically necessary as far as the licensing procedures in the shorter term. This is a $17.1 million increase over the administration's request, more than 10 percent more. And I would point out that in the continuing resolution for fiscal year 2007, this was one of the few accounts that this subcommittee specifically also increased. We also include $15 million within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear engineering scholarships that were proposed for termination by the administration, because if we do not have new, bright talent in those educational facilities under scholarship, we are not going to have a future. 
   And we did include moneys for Nuclear Power 2010. It is the same level as the current fiscal year. I would point out, Mr. Chairman, that this is a direct payment to utilities undergoing the NRC license process and no other sector of the energy portion of this country receives this type of Federal assistance. 
   The gentleman would take the money from Generation IV nuclear energy systems by having the moneys reduced. I would point out that the subcommittee went to great lengths to increase moneys for Generation IV. We are supportive of the light water reactors that are going to be coming online in the near term. We want to make sure we have that next generation of reactors online as well for the future, one that can not only provide electrical industry to our Nation that is needed but also potentially produce the hydrogen for the new economy we are looking for. We have provided those moneys and would not want to see them cut. 
   Additionally, we had a debate and conversation earlier today about the mixed oxide program that previously had been designated a nonproliferation item. We have correctly moved it into the Energy Department as far as their accounts and would point out that $689 million between unobligated balances, between the spending for '07 and between what is included in this bill, is included for MOX. 
   So we have been more than generous, and I also think we have struck the right balance to ensure that we do have an industry starting up in the near term and one that has a long-term, safe future for the generation of energy in this country.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to respond to the question raised. First of all I would point out that the funds that are provided are at this year's fiscal level. It is not a cut. It is a cut from the President's request. 
   The other observation I would make is I believe that the Department should be in the business of science research and development and not exclusively be paying for companies to license new reactors, so that would certainly do justification.

I would point out that there was a $70 million increase, and I would not want to engage in quibbling as to whether it is a second, third or fourth generation, but do believe there is a strong public purpose for demonstrating the commercial viability of the thermal-neutron gas reactor for the very purposes that the gentleman is concerned about and that I share his concern, that is, climate change and global warming and energy sources, where we can generate the electricity in this country as well as potentially produce hydrogen. We ought to start down that road sooner rather than later, and again in a balanced fashion along with 2010.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlelady's concern about research for nuclear energy in the future. I also appreciate the courtesy as far as her willingness to withdraw the amendment. 
   The concern that the committee had is that the administration came in originally with a $405 million request. During hearings, the administration also suggested that all $405 million was for just research. The concern we have, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks during general debate, is contract management at the Department of Energy. And certainly it's not the fault of the gentlelady's, and I know she shares our concern, but there is a very bad track record at the Department of Energy; and the fact is they have been on a high-risk watch list for the General Accountability Office since the year 1990.     
   I would point out that the committee learned that the Department of Energy's use of technology readiness levels in the global nuclear energy partnership technology development plan does not apply readiness in the manner consistent with the recommendations in the General Accountability Office report of March of this year. 
   So, looking ahead as far as potentially incurring huge long-term costs on behalf of the taxpayers, we have suggested that the administration take a step back, continue to do very necessary and very vital research, but let us take all deliberate speed as opposed to a rush to judgment and oppose her amendment, and I appreciate her consideration in withdrawing it.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, and would observe for the House that, again, I am not in total disagreement with some of the assertions and points that he has made. 
   The fact is, there is no silver bullet as far as solving the energy problems we face today and in the future. He is absolutely correct. That is why the subcommittee has significantly increased funding for biofuels. That's why the subcommittee significantly increased funding for vehicle technology. That's why the subcommittee increased funding for other types of renewables. The gentleman references solar and wind, for example. That's why there's an increase in the hydrogen account. That's why there's an increase as far as maximization of power produced with hydroelectric facilities. 
   And so what we're trying to do is to strike a balance, and again getting back to my earlier comments about quantity and quality, we are concerned and spoke about it in the bill language, as well as the report language, about the fossil fuel program. I certainly, for one, absolutely believe that we need to do more on the issue of capturing CO  
   2, and we have done that in this bill. We need to do more as far as in sequestration of that particular gas, but we have to do it intelligently. 
   The fact is, a FutureGen program that has been initiated under the Department of Energy, from my perspective, took a very bad turn in the road as people continue to look at adding bells and whistles, and we had a colloquy on that particular issue earlier in the day as well. 
   I would point out that FutureGen, according to the committee report, needs to be refocused as an integrated gasification combined cycle plant with carbon capture and sequestration and drop the ambiguity of other, less critical research components. The committee believes that by streamlining the design to demonstrate these factors, critical goals can be reached in a more timely and fiscally prudent fashion. 
   So what we're trying to do in the bill is to have a broad range of new energy sources accelerated through increased funding. We have done that with fossil but have not done so blindly. We want to make sure that that money is spent wisely, given the fact that nearly 50 percent of this country's electricity is generated today by coal-powered plants. I absolutely believe that we should pursue this research and would reluctantly oppose the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would eliminate all nondefense funding for Yucca Mountain. High-level radioactive waste exists in over 38 States. I believe it is irresponsible to leave it where it is forever, and it is essential to have a repository where it can be safely left for up to a million years while the radioactivity decays away. 
   This waste comes from maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile and from spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors that generate 20 percent of all electricity in the United States. 
   Yucca was chosen by Congress in 1982 as a permanent geological repository for high-level waste and billions have been spent to characterize the site and prepare for licensing and construction. 
   Failure to open Yucca Mountain and take custody of commercial spent nuclear fuel will cost the taxpayers over $7 billion by 2017 when the repository could open. Cutting funding and delaying the filing of a license application by only a year will simply exacerbate the problem and increase this cost by more than a half billion dollars. 
   Failure to proceed with a reasonable approach to disposing of spent nuclear fuel will cause the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to stop licensing new nuclear reactors and extending the licenses of existing plants. Every new and extended license must satisfy the waste confidence clause. So this amendment will constrain our ability to grow our economy without emitting any more greenhouse gasses. In the coming years, it will choke off nearly 20 percent of U.S. electricity generated by nuclear power plants. 
   And, again, we have tried to strike a very reasoned balance in this bill as far as funding for the repository and other programs to initiate a sound nuclear industry in the short term, and I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. 
   And I want to acknowledge that we in Congress authorized the loan guarantee program for advanced technology that addresses clean air and climate concerns. The Federal Credit Reform Act explicitly states that loan obligations can only be made to the extent there is an affirmative action on the part of the Appropriations Committee. 
   The Federal Credit Reform Act provides that new direct loan obligations may be incurred and new loan guarantee commitments may be made for fiscal year 1992 and thereafter only to the extent that, one, new budget authority is provided in an appropriations act; and, two, a limitation on the use of funds for the cost of a loan guarantee has been ``provided in an appropriations act''; or, three, ``authority is otherwise provided in appropriations acts.'' 
   However, it is the implementation of this program that has raised the concerns of the committee. Our fiscal year 2008 bill does not provide loan guarantees for the nuclear industry. The request for guaranteed loans from the Nuclear Energy Association, subsidized by the Federal Government, is very large. It overwhelms what the bill provides for the entire energy community. The administration had asked for a total of $4 billion for the nuclear energy industry and the coal industry. This does not come close to what the Nuclear Energy Association has indicated they need. The Nuclear Energy Association indicates a need for $25 billion in Federal guaranteed loans for fiscal year 2008 and more than that in fiscal year 2009. The ``system,'' meaning the DOE loan guarantee infrastructure, cannot accommodate a request of this size at this time. 
   I would also point out that the fiscal year 2006 joint continuing resolution included $4 billion in Incentives For Innovative Technology loan guarantees for the Department of Energy to execute, without defining which technologies to target. The Congress did not limit the use of this initial $4 billion for nuclear projects. The administration chose not to make these loans available to the nuclear community.     
   I believe in the ``go slow approach.'' We should take all deliberate speed for the new DOE programs. I recommend this approach to the Congress on this one based on my continuing concerns about how DOE has managed it to date. I am, however, open to new information about the industry's plan for innovative technology deployment and discussion about how DOE can implement the program. I pledge to work with the gentleman to see if we can come to an agreeable solution.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment and would note that the gentleman from Wisconsin in his earlier remarks used the term ``slush fund.'' I would note that a slush fund connotes a fund raised by a group for corrupt practices as bribery or graft. I'm certain that the gentleman didn't mean to imply that. 
   Slush fund can also mean money once raised by the sale of garbage from a warship to buy small items of luxury for the crew. I'm sure the gentleman didn't mean that, either. 
   A slush fund can also mean a fund used by a group of office workers for entertainment, but I don't think the gentleman meant that. 
   A slush fund could also be a fund raised for undesignated purposes. I would not be so presumptuous as to speak for the gentleman from Wisconsin, but I assume that was the import of his remarks, and in this case that would also be an incorrect assertion. 
   The subcommittee worked very hard for the first 6 months of this year to assess what the investment needs are for the United States of America, its citizens and its economic future. As I have mentioned earlier, and we had graphics to support the assertion, we have an aging infrastructure in the United States of America. Anyone who is on the roads, anyone who travels by air, anyone who travels by rail, anyone who travels on water understands that. And today we are particularly concerned about the aging water infrastructure. 
   I for one, and I believe all of the members of the subcommittee, am very concerned that much of the infrastructure in place as far as operation and maintenance is past its designed life. That pertains to almost half of the locks and dams in this country. We have not dredged many of our harbors, whether they be for recreation, which is an economic purpose as well, or for commerce to their authorized depths, let alone to the depths needed to ensure that they can operate effectively and cost efficiently, and this work must be done. 
   What we have created here is an investment fund for operation and maintenance, and I for one am proud that we have increased in that account more moneys to invest in the economic prosperity of our country, whether it pertain to navigation channels, locks and dams, or other water infrastructure. 
   I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment because I believe the actions we have taken in the subcommittee will save the American taxpayers' money. 
   I would first note that all A-76 studies performed by the Corps of Engineers have been won by Corps employees. So the first question is: Why do it? 
   The Corps is working under also an arbitrary numerical quota to review certain numbers of jobs in certain time periods without research and analysis. It would suggest that this is an arbitrary requirement put into place by the Office of Management and Budget, and there is a doubt, at least in this Member's mind, that it has been subjected to analysis at OMB. 
   I also believe that historically there has been opposition in this body to privatization. That has been bipartisan. I would point out that from a monetary standpoint, that the cost of these studies often exceeds the benefits; and of those functions that are easily contracted out, the remainder are difficult to separate into contractible and governmental function groups. 
   The fact is that the committee recommendation allows the Corps to continue with high-performing organization studies which follow the same study process, with similar results,  without incurring the additional time and costs associated with contracting competitions. 
   So what we would want to do is to use those high-performing organization studies, apply less cost to the taxpayers and to move this process along. I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in support of the resolution. 
   Ever since the author Rachel Carson ushered in the advent of environmental awareness with her book ``The Silent Spring,'' Americans have understood that we owe it to future generations to be good stewards of the planet and the environment. As in the case with every problem, we should work toward a solution not by asking how little must be done, but rather by asking what is the right thing to do? 
   As the chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, I feel I have a unique perspective on the issues contained in this resolution.     
   As chairman of the Energy Subcommittee on Appropriations, I respect BP's foresight. Their investment of a half billion dollars, in collaboration with the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana to increase energy production through renewable biofuels is a worthwhile goal. These fuels have the potential to increase our domestic fuel capabilities and strengthen our national security by reducing our dependency on foreign oil. 
   As chairman of the Water Subcommittee on Appropriations, I also fully appreciate the treasure that is the Great Lakes system, including the potable, clean fresh drinking water, and its venues for recreation and refreshment. I also appreciate that the Federal Government has made a commitment to the Great Lakes States over several generations to improve water quality and reduce pollution. 
   It is my hope that, while it appears BP has the legal authority to potentially increase discharged materials into Lake Michigan, they will act responsibly, refrain from doing so, and reconsider their permit.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (UNITED STATES-POLAND PARLIAMENTARY YOUTH EXCHANGE PROGRAM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 377, the United States and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program Act of 2007. I am the sponsor of the House version of this legislation, and I would like to thank my 13 colleagues, including the gentleman from Connecticut, who are cosponsors of the measure. 
   I would especially like to thank the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Indiana, Richard Lugar, for originating this legislation and introducing it in the other body. And I would be remiss if I did not thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega), as well as the ranking member of the full committee, the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), as well as Mr. Lantos and the members of the committee for their consideration of the measure. 
   It is my sincere hope that this legislation will become the foundation for future youth exchange programs around the world. As technology and transportation makes the world more and more interconnected, it is essential that our youth and future leaders have firsthand experiences in other cultures when making decisions. A lot can be learned about a different culture from a book or a picture, but it is not nearly the same as living, studying and working in another culture for an entire year, which is what the U.S.-Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program will enable youths from American and Polish high schools to do. 
   Senator Lugar has been a guiding light in promoting cultural exchange programs between America and countless other countries throughout his tenure, and it has been my privilege to work with him on this legislation. The Senator's genuine interest in the cultures of the world is reflected in all his actions, and he understands the priceless value of cultural exchange programs as embodied in the U.S. and Poland Parliamentary Youth Exchange Program. This program will have a profound effect on the youth of our two countries, and it can only strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the United States and Poland. 
   I too am very proud of the Polish community in Indiana's First Congressional District. This proud community is an integral part of the greater northwest area community in Indiana, and enhances the culture of my district in countless ways. I am happy that the U.S. and Poland Youth Exchange Program will allow all facets of the Polish culture to be experienced firsthand by American youth. 
   Madam Speaker, we should not delay in this opportunity for our youth to be immersed in Poland's rich culture and in this opportunity to share our culture with Polish youth. And I would urge my colleagues to support the measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3997.  
   Madam Speaker, in 1991, when Congress was considering repealing the Glass-Steagall Act and its regulatory framework, Representative JOHN DINGELL stated that repealing the Glass-Steagall Act would usher in a ``golden age of thievery.'' Mr. DINGELL has been proven correct. 
   As recently as September 15, President Bush was saying that ``Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength,'' and that ``We have a flexible and resilient system that absorbs challenges and makes corrections and bounces back.'' Henry Paulson was saying that the current turmoil in markets and financial institutions ultimately would ``make things better.'' 
   Now suddenly, we have a crisis. The Bush Administration would have us believe that this crisis is a sudden accident of nature, that it just happened, and could not have been prevented. This crisis is not an accident of nature.  The stage was set for this crisis with the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999, but this crisis is not the result of a single error in policy. It is the direct result of years and years of deliberate and cynical exploitation by the captains of an unregulated industry, aided and abetted by an Administration that has willfully failed to enforce our laws and regulations, and that has selected individuals from the very institutions that need oversight to watch over their friends and former colleagues. This crisis is what happens when you set the foxes to guard the henhouse for 8 long years. 
   Now we are being asked to solve this crisis that has been building for most of the last decade in 7 days. But is the solution being foisted on us really going to help Main Street? Or is it simply meant to clean up Wall Street's mess, cloak the Bush Administration's abysmal failure to protect the people of this country from financial predators, and further enrich those whose covetousness has caused this problem? Is it going to help the people we represent, or is it going simply add to the profits of foreign banks? 
   Additionally, the Washington Post of September 27, 2008, reports that the six largest banks in the world are going to emerge from this crisis even larger than before. But what about the small community banks that have been following the rules and dealing fairly with borrowers, and who will bear the brunt of the financial dislocation caused by irresponsible financial giants? Why are we leaving our smaller banks to fend for themselves, while bailing out foreign banks? Why does the Royal Bank of Scotland, with $3.5 trillion in assets, need welfare from the American taxpayer? 
   The Bush Administration is rushing us into spending $700 billion without stopping to think things through, because there just isn't time for thinking. They say, trust us, this is necessary. 
   I've heard this before. 
   To me it sounds like what we were told about Iraq: that we had to go to war right away, because of the Weapons of Mass Destruction that Saddam Hussein possessed. Oh, that's right, they didn't exist. We were told ``Trust us.'' 
   It sounds like what we were told when we had to pass the Patriot Act immediately to allow the government to eavesdrop on our private communications and to get the list of books you checked out of the library without probable cause; because there was a risk of terrorism. We were told that we had to fall in line quickly and trust the President. 
   Now it's ``trust us'' again. I didn't then, and I don't now! 
   What about the people we're supposed to be protecting? Contrast the President's urgency to help the minions of Wall Street with his disdain for the most vulnerable members of society: our children. During the last two years we asked President Bush to help provide health insurance to 4 million additional children in our country. He refused to do so-- twice--but now he says we have to bail out 4 million brokers in 7 days. 
   Where was the bailout when real people, the people I am here to represent, experienced financial crisis? 
   When LTV went bankrupt and thousands of people lost their jobs, President Bush didn't sound the alarm. All I know is that Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers made $34,832,036 last year. 
   When many Bethlehem Steel retirees had their pensions cut, did President Bush provide a helping hand? All I know is that when Stan O'Neal retired from Merrill Lynch, his compensation package was worth $161.5 million. 
   When National Steel went bankrupt, did this Administration ask for a bailout? All I know is that Freddie Mac's Richard F. Syron made $18,289,575 in 2007. 
   When Republic Steel went bust under this Administration, they ceased to exist. On the other hand, AIG ceased to exist after a federal bailout, and no one asked Martin J. Sullivan of AIG to give back the $14,330,736 he was paid last year. 
   Let us also look ahead. This year, we are projected to have a deficit of $407 billion, on top of our national debt of $9.68 trillion. Our Inland Waterway Trust Fund will be broke by June of next year. Our Highway Trust fund needed an infusion of $8 billion this year because it was out of money. Medicare is slated to be insolvent in 2019. Today we're being asked to provide the titans of Wall Street $700 billion that we will have to borrow because no one wants to pay for it. Think of our poor children, and I mean that literally. And think about the next administration that will have to live with the consequences of this Wall Street bailout for its entire term. 
   It is clear that the problems in our current financial system are not temporary aberrations in an otherwise healthy system, and will not be easily addressed with a one-time infusion of cash. I know that I am not alone in saying this. On September 25, 2008, 200 independent economists who don't work on Wall Street, who don't work for the Federal Reserve, who don't work for the U.S. Treasury, signed a petition stating that this plan could create perverse incentives, that it is too vague, and that its long-run effects are unclear. Gary Aguirre, a former employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission, points out that as much as half of the $700 billion dollars could be wasted if there is not careful oversight over the valuation of the bonds we would be buying, resulting in a $350 billion gift to Wall Street. 
   Now, these economists and Mr. Aguirre may be wrong too, but they have a lot more veracity with me than the supposed experts promoting this bailout plan, who are from the same institutions that created this mess in the first place. Given the gravity and systematic nature of our problems, and given the lack of information with which we have been provided, I believe that Congress should be deliberate and conduct a comprehensive examination of alternative solutions. 
   Chairman DINGELL was right: We are now in the golden age of thieves. And where I come from we put thieves in jail, we don't bail them out. We should reject this proposal.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I appreciate the chairman yielding very much. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6045, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2008. I am a very proud sponsor of this legislation. 
   At the outset, I want to express my heartfelt gratification and thanks to my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) for his lead in cosponsorship of H.R. 6045. Mr. LoBiondo and I have been partners in this endeavor since 1997. 
   I would also like to thank the Committee on the Judiciary chairman, Mr. Conyers, as well as Mr. Cannon, Ranking Member Lamar Smith, chairman of the subcommittee Bobby Scott, and subcommittee Ranking Member Louie Gohmert for their strong support and efforts on behalf of this important legislation. 
   Finally, I would like to thank the 170 bipartisan cosponsors of this measure and the law enforcement organizations that have expressed their strong support. 
   If I could take a step back, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act was introduced in November 1997 after meeting with Northwest Indiana chiefs of police and hearing that many gang members and drug dealers had the protection of bulletproof vests, while many police officers did not. I was even more troubled to learn the reason why so many officers do not have access to bulletproof vests. It was because they are prohibitively expensive. A good vest can cost in excess of $500. Many small departments, as well as larger ones, simply cannot afford to purchase vests for all of their officers, a fact that sometimes forces officers to purchase their own. 
   Our original legislation was signed into law by President Clinton in June of 1998, and as you know, the purpose of the act is to protect the lives of law enforcement officers by helping State and local government equip them with bulletproof vests. Bulletproof vests and body armor have saved thousands of lives since the introduction of the modern material; however, they cannot protect the lives of those who do not have access to them. 
   The Fraternal Order of Police have stated that ``body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an officer can have and often mean the difference between life and death.'' 
   The grant program has directly benefited every State and territory of the United States, and this critical program provides State and local and tribal law enforcement officers with needed protection by aiding the purchase of protective equipment. 
   In closing, I again want to thank my good friend Mr. LoBiondo for his strong leadership and work on this measure over the years and the police officers who risk their lives for us every day, all of us. They are the mothers and fathers, and they are the sons and daughters. It is our obligation to the officers and their families to give them access to the equipment that will safeguard their life. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues for their strong support of this measure.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I want to set the stage for what is occurring on the House floor at this point in time because it is my privilege to submit to the House for final passage H.R. 2641, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008, with its supplemental report. 
   On July 10, the Appropriations Committee approved the supplemental report unanimously by voice vote. As I have said before, this is a good bill and it merits the support of the entire House. 
   I would emphasize that the money spent in this bill, whether enumerated originally by the administration or by the Congress, are investments, investments in our national security, investments in our energy security, and investments in the health and safety of our citizens. They are investments to  create a climate and to build the infrastructure that encourages the development of new, good-paying jobs in our country. 
   To the extent we have made changes in the administration's priority, the changes have been to enhance the effectiveness of the programs in this bill and to complement them. 
   I would like to give two examples. All one needs to do is look at the West Sacramento Flood Control Project as proof that we are dealing with fundamental issues, like ensuring people and their families' lives are secure and their homes and their businesses are protected from devastating floods. In Tennessee, the Center Hill Dam is another project that Congress has funded to control flood waters and generate clean, safe and efficient hydroelectric power. 
   There are also examples of administration funding requests that originated in Congress years ago. For fiscal year 2006, Congress designated funds to support activities at the supervisory control and data acquisition test facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory. This system has proven itself so useful in helping to improve the reliability and robustness of the electric power grid that for fiscal year 2008 the administration has included the project as part of its project request. If nothing else, this shows how the executive and legislative branches can work together to fund important projects for the Nation, regardless of who initiated support for the idea. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we consider today's supplemental report to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, I urge my colleagues to keep these factors in mind. The specific projects enumerated in this report serve a purpose: To improve the quality of life for our citizenry and to make advances on key priorities facing our Nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would simply make the observation that for collectively the decisions made for congressional changes in the administration's request represent about 1 percent of the total funding for the Department of Energy in this bill, and they were very thoughtfully made. And whether they be, in this instance, in Dubuque, Iowa, or any other community around the United States, it is certainly the committee's position and belief that those investments are urged for the greater good of everyone living in this country, and that is certainly to the advantage of every taxpayer in the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time and will begin my remarks in opposition, first of all, by again thanking my friend and colleague from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), all of the members of the subcommittee, and the staff, who have done a very good job on this bill and improved the circumstances for people's safety, health, security and employment opportunities. 
   I would like to make a couple of points. The first is, we've heard a lot about the expenditures that are enumerated in this legislation, and that certainly is worthy of debate. What has been lost today, but was covered earlier this year when the bill originally was on the floor, is the fact that there are significant cuts that have been made in this bill to programs that we felt could be either eliminated or reduced because they did not have the same value and merit as those contained in the legislation we're considering today. 
   And I would note that there were 37 different DOE weapons programs that were cut. There were an additional 20 programs, two in the Army Corps of Engineers, two in the Bureau of Reclamation, three within the independent agencies, and 13 others in the Department of Energy that were reduced because we did not feel that they cut mustard and did not make the same significant contribution to our country.     
   As far as our infrastructure, and I would want to focus on that for a few minutes, the investment in our water infrastructure, for example, in this legislation represents a little bit less than 20 percent of the overall spending. But I would note that in 2005, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that nearly 50 percent of the Corps of Engineers-maintained locks are functionally obsolete using a design life of 50 years. Many of our communities do not enjoy the benefit of adequate flood protection. 
   We think of moving the commerce of this country. We think of people's safety. We are woefully behind. There are numerous channels and harbors throughout our Nation, across this country, that are not maintained at usable depths, much less at the authorized levels. Again, for every ship that uses a channel or a harbor not at depth, they are coming in and they are leaving lighter. That is less efficient as far as the economy of our country. 
   The Corps of Engineers' backlog is $50 billion. One thing that I would note for the membership here is that during the last several years under Mr. Hobson's leadership as chairman, one of the things that we have tried to do is, if you would, to focus funds on some programs to meet that backlog, to make sure that some projects ultimately are completed. 
   I would also point out that the committee is mindful of the responsibility that we all have in Congress regarding ensuring that Federal funds are spent in a responsible manner. This committee has been at the forefront of changes to the fiscal management of the Corps of Engineers. 
   In light of the challenges involved in modernizing this Nation's water resources infrastructure, we have required, again, over the last several years, a more disciplined and rigorous approach to fiscal and contract management by the corps. This bill continues financial management contracting reforms to ensure that the corps manages its budget in the best interests of the taxpayers. The recommendations include directing that the corps continue to take action in considering additional factors as they proceed in the planning of projects. 
   Outside of water infrastructure, we do have the Department of Energy that encompasses obviously more than three-quarters of the spending in this bill. As was noted when we brought the bill to the House floor, regrettably, as a citizen, as a public official, I would note that since 1990, the Department of Energy has been on the high-risk list of the GAO for project management. 
   That is all of our money. One of the things that we have, again, attempted to do in this bill is to begin to force the issue with the Department so these major construction projects are brought in on time and on budget. 
   As I mentioned, and I will close on this note, in my remarks at the beginning of the debate, we started today, the money spent in this bill, whether they were enumerated originally by the administration or by the Congress, are investments, investments in our national security and in the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. They are investments in our energy security, which is now in economic crisis, a national security crisis and an environmental crisis. We have increased funding for biofuels. We have increased funding for vehicle technology. We have increased funding for renewable energy research. I am proud of the subcommittee's work in those areas. 
   We have made investments in the health of our people, in that if you have clean water to drink, you are going to enjoy good health. If you do not, you are going to become very sick. We have also looked at the health of those citizens around our country who live in and around former weapons sites and the nuclear cleanup that is going to unfortunately still take decades to accomplish. These are investments in the safety of our citizens. Think about those dams in this country. Think about one of those locks failing. Think about the gentleman in Highland, Indiana, who lost his life when the Little Calumet River flooded. 
   They are investments to create a climate and to build the infrastructure of our Nation that encourages the development of new, well-paying jobs. To the extent we have made changes in the administration's priorities, whether they be by earmarks or changes in programs, those changes have been to enhance the effectiveness of the programs in this bill and to complement them. 
   Mr. Chairman, for all of these reasons, I certainly am opposed to the gentleman's amendment, I would ask my colleagues to oppose it, and I would ask for my colleagues' support of the underlying legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I want to thank the gentlelady. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1423, the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center Lease Act, as amended. I am proud to sponsor this legislation, and I thank Mr. Donnelly for joining me as a cosponsor. 
   I also do want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young, the chairman of the subcommittee, as well as the ranking member, and especially the exceptional staff of the subcommittee and the full committee of Natural Resources for their consideration and good work on this measure. 
   This measure will grant the Secretary of the Interior the authority to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a joint partnership with Porter County. This partnership will allow the National Park Service and the Porter County Convention, Recreation and Visitor Commission to develop a plan to maximize the efficiency of the Visitor Center at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and enhance the visitor experience. The measure also will provide funding to develop exhibits for the center. 
   Additionally, the bill will help us enhance the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in the most affordable fashion possible. It will permit, but not require, the Secretary of the Interior to accept donations of lands located outside the present boundaries of the Lakeshore if they are contiguous with the park or separated by only a right-of-way. At present, the Secretary of the Interior cannot accept such donations. This provision makes a minor technical correction that has no financial impact, and will allow this natural treasure to expand by the generosity of those wishing to enhance the Lakeshore. It is my sincere hope that this legislation will continue our efforts to protect and enhance the Lakeshore, and to ensure that all Americans can benefit from the park. 
   The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is an incredible natural treasure, as was mentioned, comprised of about 15,000 pristine acres along the southern shore of Lake Michigan in the midst of an urban environment. With its vast array of flora and fauna in northwest Indiana, a short distance from downtown Chicago, the Lakeshore receives over 3 million visitors from that urban area each year. 
   The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore owes a great deal of gratitude to Dorothy Buell, who was instrumental in its establishment and development. Buell devoted much of her life to saving the dunes. In 1952, she founded the Save the Dunes Council to obtain dunes land and to give it to the National State Park so that the unique habitat could be preserved and enjoyed by the general public. 
   In 1992, Buell's extraordinary contributions to the dunes were recognized when the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Access and Enhancement Act was signed into law, thereby naming the park's visitor center for her and commemorating her vision, dedication and work.     
   The Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center is an excellent facility for providing environmental education programs and recreational activities. Visitors can enjoy displays and exhibits. 
   I am very proud of the continued investment in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore by the National Park Service staff, our local communities, and Lakeshore volunteers in Indiana's First Congressional District. They seek to preserve, protect, and restore the Lakeshore and surrounding resources for an enhanced quality of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the members and the leaders of the committee and subcommittee as well as the staff, and I ask my colleagues to support the measure.

   While April 4 marks a sad day in American history, it is my hope that, as a nation, we will continue to reflect on the actions and accomplishments of Dr. King. Let April 4th be a day on which we celebrate Dr. King's life, study his teachings, and honor his legacy. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was born on January 15, 1929, and grew up in Georgia, attending segregated schools throughout his early education. Overcoming these unjust beginnings, King went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts from Morehouse College in 1948, a Bachelor of Divinity from Pennsylvania's Crozer Theological Seminary in 1951, and a Ph.D. from Boston University in 1955 before becoming pastor at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. 
   Dr. King was actively involved in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and championed efforts for racial equality. In 1955, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery bus, Dr. King led the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott, the first nonviolent demonstration of the Civil Rights Movement. There, his steadfast adherence to nonviolence and unwavering devotion to the struggle for equality in the face of threats to his life propelled him to the leadership of the Civil Rights Movement. 
   In 1957, Dr. King was elected President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), where he drew inspiration from Christianity and the teachings of Ghandi to be a major leader in the Civil Rights Movement. In the ensuing decade, Dr. King was feverishly active in the struggle for racial equality, constantly traveling the country to orchestrate and participate in demonstrations and delivering the inspirational addresses for which he is renowned. In that time he also penned five books and many essays, consulted to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, Dr. King was assassinated on the evening of April 4, 1968, on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he planned to lead a protest march to show solidarity with striking garbage workers the next day. 
   The nonviolent manner in which Dr. King fought for fundamental freedoms, such as desegregation and the right to vote, has had a lasting impact on the psyche of this country. Perhaps the greatest example of Dr. King's leadership and legacy is his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which he gave in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington in 1963. In that speech, Dr. King spoke about his dream for a nation where his four children would not be judged by the color of their skin, but by their character. 
   Mr. Speaker, Friday may be the anniversary of the death of one of our nation's greatest citizens, but I also hope it is a day on which we can reflect on the positive changes that were set in motion due to Dr. King's work. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. raised the conscience of America. He made our nation reexamine our commitment to freedom and liberty, and he did so with a message of peace and non-violence. To this day, Dr. King's work, message, and legacy remain imprinted on the minds of those who carry on his noble cause across America, from Montgomery, Alabama, to Northwest Indiana.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I greatly appreciate the chairwoman yielding to me, and I do rise in respectful opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   The fact is we ought to ensure our security as a Nation. To best do that, we need to develop, in a bipartisan fashion, in a fashion that exists over a number of administrations, over a number of Congresses regardless of who and which party controlled both those branches of government, a comprehensive post-Cold War, post-9/11 nuclear strategy. 
   My concern, because that $6 billion that the chairwoman accurately suggests we do spend on a nuclear weapons complex, is a complex that we have to re-examine and to characterize. If we begin the construction of a new weapon in place, we simply exacerbate the current problems. 
   In the end, we ought to develop a strategy and then determine the types and the numbers of weapons we need. And not just in the sense of nuclear, but conventional, as well as other aspects of what that plan should be as opposed to having a set number of weapons and of various types and then constructing a strategy around them. 
   The Energy and Water appropriations bill that was passed and is in effect as part of the omnibus package for fiscal year 2008 indicates that's exactly what this Nation should be about, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the gentleman's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3222 and thank Chairman MURTHA and Ranking Member YOUNG for the fine bill they have crafted. I would particularly like to highlight one item that is not in the bill. It's funding for the Administration's proposal to build a new nuclear weapon, the so called Reliable Replacement Warhead. The Administration proposed funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations measure for the warhead. They also asked for $30 million for design and development of the warhead in H.R. 3222. 
   In conjunction with my Ranking Member, Mr. HOBSON, we did not provide funds for this proposal in the Energy and Water Bill. I thank Chairman MURTHA and Mr. YOUNG for their foresight and correct policy decision in also eliminating funding for this program in H.R. 3222. 
   Profound decisions on the use of nuclear weapons stockpile need to be made--this is a serious and fundamental responsibility. Plans need to be articulated with specificity before this Nation should consider proceeding with the President's call for a new nuclear weapon. 
   First, there is a need for a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy and stockpile plan to guide transformation and downsizing of the stockpile and nuclear weapons complex--and until progress is made on this critical issue, there will be no new facilities or Reliable Replacement Warhead. Only when a future nuclear weapons strategy is established can the Departments of Defense and Energy determine the requirements for the future nuclear weapons stockpile and nuclear weapons complex plan. To date no Administration has developed and articulated a policy that takes into account the changes in our world situation since the end of the Cold War, the advent of regional conflicts such as we've seen in Kosovo and the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  
   Further, testimony before the subcommittee has pointed to the potential for the international community to misunderstand development of a new nuclear weapon by the United States. Moreover, for the last decade, the Administration has said that Stockpile Stewardship was the path to maintain the safety, security and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. Now, with three major stockpile stewardship facilities all over budget, over their deadlines, and not completed, we are told, ``Let's do something else.'' 
   Given the serious international and domestic consequences of the U.S. initiating a new nuclear weapons production activity, it is critical that the administration lay out a comprehensive course of action before funding is appropriated. Major transformation of the weapons complex can only be produced with significant bipartisan support, lasting over multiple sessions of Congress and multiple Administrations. I don't think it is asking too much for a comprehensive nuclear strategy before we build a new nuclear weapon. 
   The Administration has proposed funding to begin engineering and cost studies of a reliable replacement warhead. In this, they have got the cart well before the horse. No funds should be provided for this activity. Future funding should only be considered following the adoption of a new strategic weapons plan for the Nation whereby the President establishes the anticipated threat environment and the role of nuclear weapons in addressing the projected threats. The strategic weapons plan must then guide a new nuclear stockpile plan before it can be determined if and when a reliable replacement warhead is needed. 
   In closing, I again want to thank Chairman MURTHA and Mr. YOUNG for their wise and positive decision in this matter.  
   The Chairman. No general debate is in order. The bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. 
   No amendment to the bill may be offered except those specified in the previous order of the House of today, which is at the desk. 
   The Clerk will read.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I would, first of all, like to thank Chairman Obey. Under his leadership, the Appropriations Committee, and this Congress, has moved quickly to bring resolution to the fiscal work left undone in the last Congress. 
   I would also like to thank my partner, DAVE HOBSON, who just spoke a moment ago, and all of the members of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for their dedication and cooperation. And while I am at it, I would associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Hobson relative to the negotiations with the other body. 
   I am disappointed that we are here today finishing a CR from last year. I would have liked my first role as the chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee to be focused on next year's responsibilities, instead of cleaning up the fiscal mess that was left to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, most importantly, this bill provides $300 million to improve the Department of Energy's ability to proceed with vital renewable energy and conservation research and development. This will allow the Department of Energy to pursue more technologies that would hold promise for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and the importation of foreign oil while supporting the growth of our economy. 
   Given the energy crisis facing our Nation, and the implications it poses for our economy, our environment, and national security, these investments in energy research simply could not wait any longer. 
   This measure also provides $200 million to bolster physical science research. This increase is a first step in a long overdue improvement in government support for research into physical sciences.  
   Looking ahead, I hope to work with my partner, Mr. Hobson, as well as again, all of the members of the subcommittee. And I would indicate to my colleagues that I remain very concerned about the size of our weapons complex and the lack of progress being made to rationalize it in conformity to existing treaty agreements and current international circumstances. 
   Given this, and several other major initiatives being proposed by the Department of Energy, coupled with its fundamental failure to bring major projects in on time, let alone under budget, I will ask for the subcommittee to carefully and judiciously examine all major initiatives being undertaken so that we may fulfill our responsibility as good stewards of the people's money.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage the gentleman from Texas, my good friend Chairman Edwards, in a colloquy, and I would like to thank the chairman for agreeing to engage in this. I also want to thank Mr. Stupak for his continued support and dedication on the issue of steel safety, and look forward to working with both gentlemen on requiring that all iron and steel purchased by the Federal Government be made in the United States. This will keep Americans safe and help our country prosper. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand that there is a provision in this measure that requires American steel producers, fabricators and manufacturers to have the opportunity to compete for steel funded through the Department of Defense under this act. While I am encouraged and grateful for this provision and believe that it is a critically important aspect for all government procurements, frankly, I do not believe it is enough. 
   China disobeys international trading rules, for example, and the playing field is not level. Therefore, it is not possible for our steel producers to compete fairly. 
   This last April, the Congressional Steel Caucus held a hearing on substandard steel from China. We learned from U.S. Customs and Border Protection about how our government does not have an established process to monitor the safety of steel imports. We also heard from representatives of the domestic steel industry about how some Chinese steel companies do not adhere to international standards and guidelines when they manufacture steel, and that the steel may be used in our military barracks, veterans hospitals, and other vital infrastructure. 
   I also would mention that this last October it was reported that substandard Chinese steel was used in the construction of a gymnasium at San Pedro High School in California, prompting the California Department of General Services to post an alert on defective Chinese steel tubing fabricated for school construction projects. 
   Last year, China had a major earthquake and we saw pictures of how their schools and hospitals survived. We cannot wait to take action on this issue until a hospital or school collapses in the United States. Does it cost too much to require the use of American steel if it saves lives? The government that we fund must set an example and make sure that the buildings we build use American steel that can stand the test of time. 
   When considering the construction of facilities that hospitalize, house and take care of our veterans, we owe them every possibility to ensure their health and safety. We owe them the requirement that safe American steel is used, and that is why Representative Stupak and I have raised this issue. 
   Again, I thank the chairman for engaging in this colloquy and for his good work on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I truly want to thank Mr. Oberstar for his leadership and for what he is trying to do today. 
   What I would like to do with my time is first of all to respond to a couple of the observations made by my good friend from Pennsylvania on this legislation. 
   I would agree, I believe the chairman would agree, that the industry has to continue to evolve. It has to continue to grow. But today, the industry is here and the people of the United States are here. What Mr. Oberstar, what the chairman is trying to do is to make sure as the industry evolves and becomes more efficient and more profitable, which we all want, that people are considered equally. 
   Secondly, he mentions that this is simply a fight about one transaction and one community, the City of Chicago. He is incorrect in his assertion. The fact is there is a transaction pending. It highlights the need for this legislation. While he suggests the congestion of Chicago, I would point out that every one of those trains in Chicago happens to go through Lake and Porter counties, Indiana, which I represent. 
   The gentleman also suggested that there might be some costs attached to the industry if this act passed, $25 million here, $40 million here. The fact is we voted in this Chamber to the auto industry $25 billion. We voted within the week to give the battery industry a couple of billion dollars. People are tripping over themselves in this place, tripping over themselves in this place, to give millions of brokers and bankers $700 billion. What about people? What about the people of this country? That's what Mr. Oberstar is trying to say, instead of the railroads and the people, let's have some equity as far as these future considerations. 
   I would simply point out this is somewhat personal to me. In 1977, my mother was hit by a train. She survived the experience. But more pertinent to this debate, the Surface Transportation Board indicated that railroads historically have not paid more than a small share for grade separation.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Five to 10 percent of grade separation because grade separations, and this is the STB, primarily benefit the community and not the railroad. 
   Well, in northwest Indiana on July 8, three people died in a crossing accident in Gary, Indiana. On July 25, in northwest Indiana in the community of Griffith, there was a rail accident where three additional people were injured. In Portage, Indiana, this month, on September 3, another woman was killed in Porter County. There is one person getting killed at a train accident in the 1st Congressional District every 21 days since July 8. 
   I support the chairman's legislation that says let's think about people for a change. Let's have some equity in this so that people and communities are protected, just like the railroads are.  
   Three Dead in Car-Train Crash  
   GARY.--Three people died when a freight train blasted through a car that drove around crossing gates Monday afternoon in Gary's Miller neighborhood, police said. 
   The victims were Marvin Alvarez, 20, of Gary, and Nicole Thomas, 21, and Rosie Godines, 18, both of Hobart, according to a spokeswoman from the Lake County coroner's office. 
   The busy scene at Miller Avenue and Lake Street devolved into turmoil in the hours following the 5 p.m. wreck. Irate mourners scuffled with police officers and attacked cameramen from television news crews. An officer appeared to fire a Taser on a sobbing, shrieking man who joined a group of people fighting with a man who appeared to be a police detective. 
   All three died at the scene after the southbound Ford Taurus pulled around the gates into an eastbound CSX train's path, police said. None of the victims wore seat belts, and two of them were thrown from the car, said Gary police Cpl. Agnes Roberts. The bodies were covered with sheets near the car as firefighters cut the third body from the vehicle's wreckage in front of witnesses and bystanders gathered along the commercial strip. 
   ``I still can't believe it and I'm standing right here looking,'' said Sandra Mays, of Gary. 
   Mays drove the first northbound vehicle in line behind the gates before the wreck. She was prepared for a long wait before the Taurus came ``out of nowhere'' around the gates, Mays said. She called 911 after the train plowed into the car's passenger side and pushed it about 50 feet east down the tracks. Mays said she could see that all the victims were dead. 
   ``It happened so fast, like something you see on TV,'' she said. 
   Shirley Taylor, of Merrillville, was in the nearby Chase bank when she heard the train's horns blowing and its brakes screeching, she said. The bank manager ran outside to help, but he returned with shock on his face, Taylor said. 
   ``He came over and told everyone there was nothing he could do,'' Taylor said. 
   The victims' relatives descended on the scene about 6 p.m. A small group of furious men alternated between sobbing inconsolably and bellowing profane threats at police, firefighters, clergy, bystanders and news reporters. A man who identified himself as Alvarez's brother struggled with officers. A man threw a rock at a television cameraman. Another man was arrested after a fight in the Chase bank parking lot. He was handcuffed and apparently stunned with a Taser. Gary police were not available Monday night to comment on the fights after the crash. 
   The train's nine cars and two locomotives were headed from Chicago to Columbus, Ohio, said CSX spokesman Gary Sease. No one on the train was hurt, Sease said.   
   Train Hits Truck, Injures Three  
   GRIFFITH.--Three people suffered minor injuries Friday when a train hit a tractor-trailer, knocking a 20-ton piece of construction equipment off the truck bed and forcing the truck into two occupied vehicles. 
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' Griffith Cpl. Ryan Bottiger said. 
   The accident occurred early in the afternoon at the intersection of Main Street and Wiggs Avenue. 
   The front of an eastbound Canadian National train struck the back end of a Grimmer Construction tractor-trailer that was crossing the tracks. The crossing has no gates, but the lights were working, Bottiger said. 
   A westbound train on parallel tracks had just gone through the crossing. 
   The driver of the tractor-trailer, who declined to give his name, said the car in front of him crossed the tracks, and he started to cross. Because of the angle, he didn't see the eastbound train coming. By the time he did, it was too late, and the back end of his truck got clipped, he said. The driver suffered an abrasion to his chin. 
   The force shook loose a 20-ton piece of construction equipment that was chained to the rear of the tractor-trailer. The equipment rolled, gouging chunks of asphalt from the street. It landed on a grassy residential corner and leaked diesel fuel and hydraulic fluid, which crews cleaned up, Bottiger said. 
   The tractor-trailer hit two vehicles that were in the oncoming lane, including the gray Mercury Montego that Merrillville resident John Holliday was driving. 
   Holliday said he was waiting for a westbound train to pass. When it did, a vehicle in the oncoming lane crossed the tracks. Holliday then heard a train whistle and saw the tractor-trailer cross the tracks and get hit, before barreling toward his car. 
   ``At that point, all I could see was a truck coming head first, straight on,'' he said. ``It's kind of a bad feeling, seeing a truck coming right at you.'' 
   Holliday's car was hit on the front passenger side. The airbag deployed, which burned his hand. He saw the 20-ton piece of construction equipment roll off the truck. 
   ``It looked like out of a movie,'' he said. 
   Although Holliday was alone in his car, the other vehicle that was struck had four occupants, three of whom were children. The driver was transported to a hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries and a relative picked up the children, Bottiger said. 
   Bottiger said Friday afternoon he didn't know whether any citations would be issued.   
   Portage Woman, 43, Dies When Hit by Train 
   PORTAGE.--Police are continuing to investigate the death of a Portage woman who was killed Tuesday night when a train hit her. 
   Linda Evola, 43, of 5075 Lincoln St., was declared dead at 11:04 p.m. Tuesday from massive blunt force trauma, Porter County Coroner Victoria Deppe said. 
   Evola was hit by an eastbound CSX train near Don's Motel, 5500 U.S. 20, around 10 p.m. Tuesday, according to a Portage Police Department release. 
   Sgt. Keith Hughes said two engineers on the train saw Evola walking west on the tracks and sounded the train's horn. The engineers said Evola looked up, Hughes said, but she did not move off the tracks. 
   ``At this time it's still unknown whether she intended to do it,'' Hughes said. 
   Deppe said that right now her office is ruling the death an accident. 
   ``She did live near the train,'' Deppe said. ``That was a place people cut through.'' 
   She also said that it does not appear drugs or alcohol played a part, although her office is running toxicology tests.

<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the recognition, and I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment to strike funds in this bill for the meteorological equipment for Valparaiso University. 
   I first want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee Mr. Mollohan, as well as the ranking member Mr. Frelinghuysen, for their consideration of this important project. 
   Mr. Chairman, this earmark is relative to two issues. The first is the safety of people who live throughout the Upper Midwest. 
   A key element to strengthening Valparaiso's meteorology program, as the gentleman from Arizona is correct that Valparaiso is an exceptional university, is the acquisition of Doppler radar. Doppler radar at VU will be very beneficial to the millions of people living along the southern shore of Lake Michigan because that area is currently underserved by pinpoint weather forecasting. In addition to Doppler radar, VU will begin daily weather balloon launches. As the only balloon site in Indiana, Valparaiso University will supply critical data to the meteorological community. 
   The notoriously unpredictable weather conditions in this area, lake-effect snow in the winter and severe thunderstorms and tornados in the spring and summer months, make the presence of Doppler radar and data gathered from the balloon station critically important to the region. 
   The amendment also deals with the issue of strengthening our future by investing in science and the young people in our Nation. The global economy is nothing if not competitive, and in order for the United States to remain at the forefront of scientific innovation, we must work with our universities to develop and maintain world-class scientific programs. 
   Valparaiso is currently home to a nationally ranked meteorological program, and we must leverage this resource to advance our national scientific interests, and I believe the university is well positioned to use the funds to continue to be a national and global leader in this field. 
   The procurement of the latest industry standard equipment by VU's meteorological program is also vital to helping students become familiar with the technology they will encounter after graduation as they go on to pursue careers that include the Air Force, NASA and the National Science Foundation. The purchase of new equipment will enable Valparaiso students to conduct more undergraduate research, as they will have access to a greater variety of data and the ability to archive it. 
   I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment, and again thank the Chair and ranking member. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will yield back my time.

   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Chairman, I first of all would like to express my appreciation to Mr. Stupak for all of his hard work on this initiative, but also would like to thank the chairman of the full committee as well as the ranking member for their work on this important bill, as well as the chairwoman of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order. 
   The amendment would require all iron and steel purchased with funds authorized by this act to use only American-made steel. This stems from a Steel Caucus hearing that was held in April, where we learned that the government does not have an established process to monitor the safety of steel imports. We also learned that foreign imports from China, for example, do not adhere to international standards and guidelines when they manufacture steel. 
   If the school construction projects provided under this act are to be truly safe for our children, then we must ensure that the steel used is American. If we buy only American steel for our schools, we will know that it adheres to our safety and quality standards, and would encourage my colleagues to support the Stupak-Visclosky amendment to keep our schools safe and to vote for passage of the underlying measure. 
   Madam Chairman, I recognize the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wilson) for 1 1/2 minutes.

<DOCNO>Mr. VISCLOSKY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and express my profound disapproval of President Bush's decision to increase our troop levels in Iraq. 
   Late last year the President had an opportunity to create a new strategy. The voice of the American people was heard at this past election. The voice of the Iraq Study Group gave the President a bipartisan plan to draw down our troops. New leadership at the Pentagon also could have been a voice of change of strategy. But President Bush did not listen to any of these voices. He decided to escalate our troop levels in Iraq. No time frame, no measurable benchmarks, no end. 
   Mr. Speaker, if President Bush chooses an erroneous path, then it is our constitutional responsibility to show the way. 
   I have the deepest respect and gratitude for our women and men in uniform. I honor their commitment, their courage and their sacrifice.     
   Our troops have done everything we have asked them to do. They overwhelmed the old Iraqi Government and captured Saddam Hussein. They provided security while Iraq formed its provisional government, approved a constitution, and elected a permanent government. 
   Nine individuals from the First Congressional District of Indiana have already given their lives and made the supreme sacrifice for our Nation. These brave men and women will always be remembered: Sergeant Jeanette Winters; Specialist Gregory Sanders; Sergeant Duane Rios; Specialist Roy Buckley; Private First Class John Amos, II; Private Luis Perez; Private First Class Nathan Stahl; Corporal Bryan Wilson; Private First Class Steven Sirko; Specialist Nicholas Idalski; Specialist Adam Harting; and Staff Sergeant Jonathan Rojas. 
   I am so proud of the dedication and service of the people of my State in the United States military. We owe them a commitment equal to their courage. We owe them the courage to act on our conviction. 
   With the passage of 4 years and the loss of over 3,000 brave Americans and countless others who have been permanently injured, I regret to recall that we were told we needed to invade Iraq because Saddam Hussein possessed materials for weapons of mass destruction. None could be found. I regret that  the President felt compelled to justify the invasion by claiming a connection between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein when the 9/11 Commission found this was simply not true. 
   Our situation in Iraq has redirected our Nation from its true mission. The war in Iraq has diverted our attention from the global war on terror. We need to reconstitute our Armed Forces. We also need a strategic redeployment of our forces that will give us the ability to focus our efforts directly on the global terror networks that target innocent people around the world. 
   I voted against the authorization of the Iraq invasion in 2003. There was no plan or exit strategy then, and there are clearly no good options now. Yet the Iraq Study Group provided a bipartisan perspective on some changes in strategy. They called for a drawdown of troops and for intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the sectarian violence there. We need to listen to their recommendations. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is not too late to change our strategy, and the first step along the new way is to prevent the President's escalation of this war. It is time to obligate the Iraqi Government to assume the full burden and consequences of governing their country. We need to listen to the majority of the American people. We need to listen to reasoned voices such as the Iraq Study Group. The time to pursue a new course is now. I support our troops, and that is why I support this resolution.
