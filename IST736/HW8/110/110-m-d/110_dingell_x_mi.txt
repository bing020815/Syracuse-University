<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, today we protect Medicare's future. The rule addresses a provision that was slipped into the Republican Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, in the dark of night. It was not in the version of the bill that was passed by the House or by the Senate. It is yet another example of Republican efforts to choke off Medicare--an automatic ``trigger'' that requires cuts to the program if general revenues contribute more than 45 percent of Medicare's revenues. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have long tried to end Medicare, and failing that, to let it wither slowly on the vine. Newt Gingrich said as much in the 1990s, when he was Speaker of the House. 
   As required by the MMA provision, the President sent a bill to Congress in February with his proposal to meet the trigger requirements. His bill simply shifted costs to patients, and made no improvements to Medicare; a good example of why this ``trigger'' doesn't work. 
   Democrats know how to manage Medicare--my father wrote the original bill creating it, and we have been fighting to preserve, improve, and protect the program for nearly 50 years. We do not need gimmicks like an arbitrary ``trigger'' to do so. 
   Medicare has protected seniors, improved their health, and helped lift people out of poverty. We must ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to their doctor of choice, high-quality hospital care, and prescription drug services. 
   I support this rule; and I urge my colleagues to eliminate the ``trigger'' requirements for the remainder of the year.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in cautious support of the stimulus measure before us. This is an important first step. 
   However, it is the first step; it cannot be the last. I am particularly concerned that increases in Medicaid funding, food stamps and an extension in unemployment benefits are not a part of the package to be considered by Congress today. 
   It is important to note that an extension of unemployment insurance is a tried and true mechanism for not only helping out families in need, but also for infusing much needed cash into the economy. The Department of Labor, which administers the program, has the administrative framework and the know-how to get benefits to people quickly and efficiently. The IRS, on the other hand, does not have the same know-how. Moreover, the IRS will be otherwise occupied; after all, it is tax season. 
   All of this said, I am hopeful that negotiations continue on next steps to strengthen our economy and to provide relief to working families and would like to see the following items considered and ultimately included in any further measures brought before the House. 
   Given the decrease in nationwide job creation and the growth of state unemployment rates an emergency extension of unemployment compensation is critically important. 
   We also need a uniform increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, similar to that approved by Congress in 2003. An increase of this nature is one of the simplest, fastest, and best ways to provide stimulus to states. 
   Making legislation similar to the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund part of the stimulus package would provide much needed assistance to 
   communities, of which there are many in Michigan, that have been hardest hit by the housing crisis. 
   In addition, swift action is needed to assist the over 2 million homeowners who, as a result of the housing crisis, are predicted to face foreclosure over the next year. 
   We need increased investment in schools, roads, water and sewer projects, and other public infrastructure projects that are ready to go, which will put people to work and build or repair needed capital assets while pumping up the economy. 
   In addition to stimulating the economy, we must have a strategy to create good paying jobs and prepare a workforce in transition. As such, some of the top priorities for Congress should be: 
   To promote both health information technology and increased availability of generic pharmaceuticals, both of which have the potential to streamline the U.S. healthcare system, reducing overall healthcare costs. 
   In addition, the tax code should be amended to allow the Federal government to pay for a portion of catastrophic healthcare costs. 
   Congress should support the development and production of advanced technologies. Such technologies also would aid in weaning  our country from its dependence on foreign oil and are key to the American manufacturing industry's ability to compete globally. 
   The House approved a complete overhaul of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program last fall. We must expand the program to cover more workers. 
   We must create a more level playing field for U.S. businesses and workers by enforcing trade agreements, ending the unfair trading practices of other nations, including currency manipulation, and knocking down unfair trade barriers that discriminate against U.S. goods in foreign markets. 
   Again, I commend leadership for acting quickly and decisively in a bipartisan manner to bring this package to the floor. It is my hope we can continue to work together in an effort to stimulate the economy in a manner which will benefit middle-class families and create a 21st century workforce.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I want to place the legislation we are about to consider in its proper historical context. 
   Fifty-one years ago, the Surgeon General first stated that tobacco smoking was linked to cancer. 
   Forty-three years ago, in 1965, tobacco products were for the first time required to carry labels warning of the health hazards to consumers who used them. 
   Fourteen years ago, the chief executives of the tobacco companies were summoned to appear before the Committee on Energy and Commerce to answer questions about their knowledge of the dangers to human health caused by tobacco and their reluctance or refusal to disclose what they knew. 
   Ten years ago, the tobacco companies entered into a master settlement with the attorneys general of the States, under which they would pay out billions of dollars to address the costs of smoking, amongst other purposes. 
   Today, the House will consider H.R. 1108, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This landmark legislation will, for the first time, grant the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and to protect consumers on this particular, difficult matter. 
   It is hard to believe that 51 years after we first became aware of the harmful effects of smoking--and three years after a United Nations tobacco control treaty was enacted--the U.S. government has been unable to take the steps necessary to stem the tide of smoking. With this legislation, we can change that. 
   Cigarette smoking accounts for about one in five deaths annually, or about 435,000 deaths each year. Each day, more than 4,000 young Americans try a cigarette for the first time, and each day 1,000 of these become addicted to tobacco. One in every three of these smokers will die prematurely. 
   With this legislation, we will place sharp and sorely needed limits on access to tobacco products and on tobacco advertising and marketing. 
   Public health organizations have fought for this legislation for 20 years, and I want to commend in particular the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and other of our colleagues in particular, Representatives WAXMAN, DAVIS and PALLONE, who deserve great credit for their diligence and persistence in bringing this legislation to the point where it is. 
   Passage of H.R. 1108 will stand as an historic achievement. I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to vote for the health of America's children and to vote for the health of the American people. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride and pleasure that I bring before the House a strong bipartisan bill that will protect the American public from unsafe consumer products. I have some kudos for my colleagues. I want to commend the chairman of the subcommittee, my dear friend, Mr. Rush, for his outstanding leadership in the handling of this legislation. I also want to praise my dear friend, the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Barton, and all of the House conferees who served so well in working out a difficult bill. Working with them has been a privilege and a pleasure. 
   The House passed H.R. 4040 without a dissenting vote in December of last year, and the House followed with its amendment in March of this year. The resulting conference report represents the most significant overhaul of U.S. consumer product safety laws since the creation of the Consumer Product Safety Commission some 40 years ago under the sponsorship of myself and my dear friend from California, John Moss. 
   Under H.R. 4040, the CPSC will receive substantial funding and staff increases, greater laboratory and computer resources, and a stronger statutory mandate going forward. Industry-sponsored travel by CPSC commissioners and staff will be banned. The presence of lead and dangerous phthalates in toys and other products of children up to age 12 will be banned. 
   CPSC will be required to establish a publicly accessible data base to help consumers report and learn about deaths and serious injuries caused by consumer products. Toys and other children's products will be subject to premarket testing by certified laboratories.     
   The conference agreement also strengthens protections against the import and the export of dangerous products and enhances the tools for removing recalled products from store shelves. 
   To deter wrongdoing, it takes a number of important steps. It increases the  civil and criminal penalties to be sought by CPSC. It authorizes injunctive enforcement of Federal law by State attorneys general. It preserves State common law remedies and California's Proposition 65. It provides important protections for private sector whistleblowers. 
   I want to conclude by pointing out that this is a bipartisan bill and that it was not only the work of my Republican colleagues, but also my Democratic colleagues. I also want to point out that there was splendid work done by my good friend, Mr. Barton, in his leadership in this matter. 
   The Republican staff and the Democratic staff worked countless hours and did superb work. Brian McCullough, Will Carty and Shannon Weinberg on the Republican side; and the Democratic staff, Valerie Baron, Andrew Woelfling, Christian Fjeld and Judy Bailey did extraordinary work. 
   In particular, I want to commend my dear personal friend, Consuela Washington, for leading the staff in such a splendid fashion. From the financial markets to the store shelves, she has been working on legislation to protect consumers for nearly 29 years.

   Mr. DINGELL. I yield myself the balance of the time for the purposes of closing. 
   I want to make a little observation about my friend from Texas. He's too kind to me and not kind enough to himself. He and I have the privilege of leading the Commerce Committee. It's a great committee composed of great Members, and we are proud, indeed, of them all, and we have an extraordinary staff, and they deserve the gratitude of this body for the fine work they did. 
   My good friend from Texas and I have had some fine fights, but we have over the years become great friends, as well we should be. And he has earned not just my respect and affection but that of all of his colleagues on the committee and in this body because he's a fine, decent and wonderful human being. 
   And I know that there were difficult times for him, as there were for all of our other conferees, Mr. Rush, Mr. Waxman, Ms. DeGette, Ms. Schakowsky, Mr. Stearns, and Mr. Whitfield, and I know on one occasion it looked like this thing was going down the tube. But Ms. DeGette and my good friend from Texas (Mr. Barton) got together, and they pulled it together and made it work. And we owe them thanks for that. It's great public service. 
   And we also do for Mr. Waxman, because at a very difficult time, the question of preemption and the level of phthalates was before us, and in a very quick and gentlemanly way, Mr. Barton and Mr. Waxman worked that issue out. We owe them thanks for that. 
   We have given the House a good bill. It's a bill that's going to protect people. It's a bill that's going to not just protect people but kids, and I think we have to give a nod here to Mr. Serrano, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, because without proper funding this legislation is not going to work, and people are going to keep getting killed by shoddy products,  most of which are imports. And we understand that under Mr. Serrano's leadership, there will be $100 million in the appropriation next year for dealing with the problems of this agency. 
   Again, Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. It shows how the House can work together and how the process, when properly used, leads to good legislation. 
   My good friend, Mr. Barton, is an institutionalist, and we're very proud of that. And I pride myself that I, in some small way, am one of those, too. But this is the way the place should work. For hundreds of years, wise men and women have left us the way that this place can and should work, and it's my hope that as we go forward in this Congress and in following Congresses that we will again be able to work as we did on this matter, not just on the Commerce Committee but on all others. 
   Commerce is very proud of its traditions and its history. We're also very proud of our other sister committees and of the good work that they do, and it is a real privilege for me to commend all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and say to them well done for the great work that you have done. All of us have reason to be proud, and all of us have reason to be grateful, and all of us have strong reason to be delighted to see back our old friend Reverend RUSH, who started this whole thing out. 
   And so, Madam Speaker, to my colleagues I say, well done, let's vote this legislation through. It's a great piece of legislation, and it will protect and it will save lives, health, and the security of our people.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (MICHELLE'S LAW -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2851, ``Michelle's Law.'' This legislation protects students that are covered under their parents' health plan from losing their health insurance if they require a medically necessary leave of absence from school. 
   The impetus for this legislation--and the namesake for this bill--is a young woman named Michelle Morse. She was a full-time college student at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire who was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2003. Her doctors recommended that she cut back her college course load while undergoing chemotherapy treatment. She found, however, that if she cut back her classroom hours, she would lose her health insurance because she would no longer qualify as a dependent on her parents' health insurance plan. 
   She could not afford other coverage options, and she was forced to remain in school as a full-time student while undergoing fourteen rounds of chemotherapy. In 2005, she succumbed to her illness. Her mother has since lobbied for laws that would extend the definition of dependents to allow college students needing medical leaves of absence from classwork to retain health insurance coverage on their parents' policies. 
   I am pleased that this bill has bipartisan support. I thank Ranking Members Barton and Deal for their work as well as the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Education and Labor. Special acknowledgment should also go to Congressman Hodes of New Hampshire, who has been a champion for this bill from the start. 
   Michelle's Law would make a small improvement in access to health insurance for individuals who find themselves in the precarious position of being at risk of losing their insurance because they are sick. We clearly have a long way to go to eliminate the growing problem of the uninsured and under insured, but this is a small step in that direction. 
   I am pleased to support this legislation and look forward to working with my colleagues to move it to the President's desk.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6604, the ``Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008.'' 
   This legislation will ratchet back the excessive speculation which has undermined the ability of the commodity markets to enable price discovery, while ensuring a means for legitimate hedgers, such as airlines, to lock in future prices as a way to protect their business from price volatility. 
   Experts testified before the Committee on Energy and Commerce that commodity index speculators, such as pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds, have poured more than a quarter trillion dollars into purchases of a basket of essential commodities such as oil, natural gas, corn, and wheat. Investments tied to the two most popular commodity indexes have skyrocketed 1,900 percent in the past 5 years. 
   This is the one factor that has turbocharged oil prices far above their underlying supply and demand. This bill works to plug three loopholes that have allowed speculation to get out of hand, in markets immune largely from public disclosure, regulation, and transparency. 
   First, the ``London loophole,'' allows foreign boards of trade such as the London-based ICE-Futures, to offer futures contracts in this country for U.S.-delivered energy commodities, such as the West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil Contract, but operate free from equivalent U.S. regulatory oversight. 
   This legislation requires electronic exchanges in London or Dubai to comply with key market integrity requirements as a condition of doing business in the U.S. I will be watching closely to see if this approach works or if stronger medicine is needed. 
   Second, the swaps loophole, allows large investment banks to exceed speculative trading limits on the futures markets. This loophole has been plugged. 
   Third is the Enron loophole that has enabled massive trading on over-the-counter (OTC) markets which are completely dark to regulators. It also involves another loophole for swaps transactions on the OTC. 
   These dark markets have grown so rapidly that the Bank of International Settlements estimates they now involve about $9 trillion in commodities. This is estimated to be about nine times what is traded on the regulated markets. This bill shines light on these dark markets for the first time. 
   It takes a large and important first step towards putting a cop back on the beat. My hope is that this bill will bring prices back in line with underlying supply and demand. Further, I am comforted by Chairman PETERSON's commitment to consider additional measures in the dark markets as more data is available from the CFTC. 
   I want to commend Representatives Stupak, Van Hollen, DeLauro, and Larson, for their excellent work and want to recognize Chairman Collin Peterson, Ranking Member Bob Goodlatte, and their staffs for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I look forward to working with them in conference.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (ANIMAL DRUG USER FEE AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6432. Today we consider important public health legislation that, in the best tradition of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, has strong bipartisan support as well as backing from industry, consumer, and stakeholder groups. 
   I note that this bill has three titles--each representing different bills considered by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. The first title is the ``Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008''. This title reauthorizes a successful user fee program that has allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to safely and efficiently review animal drugs. This part of the bill improves the existing program by increasing fee revenues, providing greater transparency, and setting specific timeframes by which data must be submitted to the FDA. 
   This title of the bill also contains provisions related to the issue of antimicrobial resistance. The Committee worked closely with Members from both sides of the aisle, as well as industry and consumer groups, to ensure that the FDA has the necessary information to examine safety concerns related to the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. I commend Representatives Matheson, Waxman, Pallone, Deal, and Barton for reaching agreement on this important public health concern. 
   The next title is the ``Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2008'' (AGDUFA). This program is similar in design to the ADUFA program, but with a specific focus on expediting the review of applications for new generic animal drugs. 
   A key component of both ADUFA and AGDUFA is additional resources for FDA to protect the public health. The lack of resources for the FDA has been a major focus of the Committee. I intend to address this issue more broadly in legislation being drafted with Representatives Barton, Deal, Pallone, Shimkus, Stupak, and others, that will significantly improve and enhance our food and drug safety system. 
   The third and final title makes two technical corrections to public law 110-85, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. The first correction addresses an implementation problem related to the clinical trials results and registry database, which was expanded in that public law. The second correction clarifies that the FDA should review and approve generic drug applications separate and apart from citizen petitions pertaining to that application. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, and I thank the Members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce for working together to reach agreement on legislation critical to protecting the public health.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for H.R. 3580, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. This is excellent legislation. It contains needed reforms to strengthen the safety of our Nation's drug, device, and food supply. 
   I want to pay a word of compliment to my Republican colleagues and say that we have come to a compromise which I believe is satisfactory in the broad public interest and is an excellent piece of legislation. And I want to commend my friend Mr. Barton and our Republican colleagues for having worked with us well on this matter. 
   On July 11, 2007, the House passed H.R. 2900, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments, by a bipartisan vote of 403-16. The bill was hailed by all as a strong bill that would improve the lives of Americans by ensuring that drugs and devices are reviewed in a competent and in a timely fashion. 
   Earlier this year the Senate passed a similar bill. Since July, bipartisan meetings have been held frequently between the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to reconcile the differences between the two bills. 
   This bill includes two very different user-fee programs, both vital to the timely approval of lifesaving drugs and devices. The legislation would significantly improve our postmarket safety programs, thereby preventing many of the drug and device injuries and deaths that occur today. It fills an important gap in therapies available to one of our most vulnerable and important patient groups: our children. Finally, I note that the period of market exclusivity in the pediatric studies remains 6 months, as in current law. 
   I want to thank all the members of the committee who have worked hard on this bill. They have endured long hours to ensure that this bill would be completed before the expiration of the two user-fee programs at the end of this month. And I want to pay particular tribute to the staff on both sides for their outstanding labors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that if this bill does not pass in the time limits which are imposed upon us by the September 30 expiration of this statute, we will have significant problems here that we may not be able to address because, I would point out, that failure to do so will leave us with a situation where we are going to find that RIF notices will be going out at Food and Drug and the ability to approve new drugs will all of a sudden come to a screeching and unfortunate halt.     
   I urge my friends and colleagues to support this legislation; it is a good piece of legislation, it has the support of all who have worked with it, and I would commend it to the attention and the kindness of my colleagues. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of House Resolution 635, a resolution recognizing the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. On September 13 this year, millions of Muslims throughout the world, and a great number in Michigan's 15th Congressional district, began a month of fasting, prayer, and spiritual renewal. It is an important step for acceptance and tolerance within the United States that Congress, for the first time, is recognizing this exceptional religious observance. 
   During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims engage in self-discipline and purification. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims refrain from common daily activities such as eating and drinking, and tobacco use. Muslims also spend time reading the Koran, contemplating Islam, and cleansing their spirits. Ramadan is also a time to gather with family and friends, both at the nightly iftar, as well as at the conclusion of Ramadan, during the Id-al-Fitr. 
   It is a pleasure to join my colleagues in honoring the celebration of Ramadan, not simply because Muslims are an important and growing part of American society, but also because goals and tenets of Ramadan--self sacrifice, charity, and spiritual renewal--are shared by Americans of all faiths. Hopefully, Congressional recognition of Ramadan will lead to an increased appreciation for these shared values. Certainly, recognizing Ramadan, along with its observance in the United States, contributes to the vibrancy, dynamism, and character of our great Nation.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is not unknown that I have had some reservations about the bill and about the procedure that has brought us to the floor. I note to you, Mr. Speaker, that this is, however, a good bill and one which I support. Indeed, this is legislation which the Nation has to have, and, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote for it. 
   I begin with proper commendations to our Speaker, to Mr. Hoyer, to Mr. Rangel, Mr. Gordon, Mr. Peterson of Minnesota, Mr. Oberstar, Mr. Rahall, and Mr. George Miller of California, the Chairs of our colleagues' committees, for their good work and leadership on this matter, and I do salute you, Madam Speaker, for your leadership here. 
   I would note that the perfection of this matter or how it was handled is not a question before us, but, rather, it is what we should do about a major problem which this Nation confronts. In my extension of remarks, I will talk about the costs of failure to act at this time. 
   This is not a bill that the Committee on Energy and Commerce and my colleagues and I would have written if it had followed the regular order, nor, indeed, is it achieved under the order which we would have followed. Indeed, it is a process which is brought about in good part because of the lack of interest by the White House and, very frankly, the incompetence and the indifference and the arrogance of the other body. 
   I will be voting for this legislation because it contains a number of significant landmark achievements. It will raise fuel economy standards by 40 percent, to 35 miles per gallon, and it will do it in a way which achieves and protects American jobs and it gives manufacturers proper flexibility in achieving our goals. 
   It also closes what has been misleadingly, and I think dishonestly, called the SUV loophole. It expands incentives for the production of cars and trucks that run on renewable fuels, and it will help American factories to retool to build the cars and trucks of tomorrow. 
   I want to, at this time, pay particular compliment and congratulations to two of our very able colleagues and those who have joined them in their efforts to protect this legislation; Mr. Hill of Indiana, an extremely valuable Member of this body, and Mr. Terry, another very valuable Member of this body. These two Members from Indiana and Nebraska have provided extraordinary leadership in this matter in the Hill-Terry bill, and they deserve the thanks and the congratulations of this Congress. 
   This legislation includes efficiency standards for buildings and appliances that will remove more than 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, an amount equal to five times the annual emissions of all cars on the road today in the United States. 
   For those who are concerned about portions of the bill dealing with renewable fuels and renewable electricity generation, I would simply say that this is far from the final work, and the committee will carry forward its oversight on these matters vigorously. 
   I reserve the balance of my time and at this time, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, and I ask that he be permitted to control the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   In the words of President John F. Kennedy, ``The American labor movement has consistently demonstrated its devotion to the public interest. It is, and has been, good for all America. Those who would destroy or further limit the rights of organized labor--those who cripple collective bargaining or prevent organization of the unorganized--do a disservice to the cause of democracy.'' 
   Like my dad, I have always supported working families and am happy to see this bill on the floor today. 
   For the past few years, workers in this country have been under relentless attack by those who seek to abolish their fundamental right to organize. 
   Simply put, the legislation we are debating today will provide that a majority of workers is sufficient for the formal recognition of a union. 
   Quite frankly, I don't see what the controversy is all about. If the majority of employees want to be represented by a union, they should have the right to do so. Labor unions stand for decent wages and benefits and safe working conditions. They fight against poverty and unemployment, and for equal justice and human rights. 
   Unions represent the basic right to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. They provide a voice for individual workers to express their concerns without fear of retribution. Unions understand that raising the bar for workers helps raise the bar for all Americans. We are all much better off today because of the efforts of unions over the years. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and to be here today to vote for it. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in standing up for the rights of hardworking Americans by supporting the Employee Free Choice Act.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 976, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   Ten years ago a Republican Congress and a Democratic President passed a landmark program to reach children who had fallen through the cracks of the health care system. These kids weren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, and their parents, most of whom worked, couldn't afford health insurance on their own. 
   Today this program provides health care for 6 million children across the Nation. Those 6 million kids today are in jeopardy because this successful program will expire September 30. The legislation before us will continue helping these 6 million of our children and extend health care to 4 million more of our young people. 
   This bill is for parents like Ms. Molina, a mother of two children who worked two part-time jobs but still could not afford health insurance. CHIP got her kids treatment for dental work, two sprained ankles, one broken arm, and a severe burn. 
   It's for parents like Ms. Mingeldorff, the mother of a child born 25 weeks prematurely who would have had to turn down a job without health insurance because it would have made her ineligible for Medicaid. 
   This bill is for every child who needs a vaccination, a cavity filled, chemotherapy, insulin, antidepressants, or other life-sustaining health care. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the children in your district and to remember this legislation will provide health care for 6 million who are now deriving that and 4 million more. The issue here is are you for or against health care for the kids under the SCHIP program? 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   We have here before us a bill which gives $35 billion to strengthen and improve children's health coverage. It protects 6 million children today covered by SCHIP. It adds an additional 4 million. It is the largest investment in children's health since the passage of the original Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. 
   It provides $300 million in outreach grants for the States, community organizations, tribal organizations, and national initiatives. It provides a new express lane initiative for one-stop enrollment. It facilitates enrollments for newborns so coverage starts immediately. It does more than this. It revises the current SCHIP program formula to more accurately attract State need in that it follows the House provisions. 
   It provides the children enrollment program contingencies adjustment allotments to States to succeed in reaching the eligible but the unenrolled. 
   It does more. It provides dental coverage for CHIP children. It also provides mental health coverage for children. It provides grant money for diabetes clarification and prevention. It clarifies the coverage of school-based clinic services through the CHIP program. It creates a new option for CHIP programs to subsidize employer options and employer coverage for children whose parents may already have access to coverage. 
   It does not do any of the things that were charged on the other side because it does not change the law that CHIP now has in place. It just offers additional benefits to children under the SCHIP program. 
   It is a program which will cover 4 million more kids. It has to be passed by the first of the next month or else all of these kids are going to lose their coverage. 
   I was at the Governors' meeting in northern Michigan, and the one thing that the Governors were unanimous on is that we need to pass this SCHIP because it is an essential program and an essential part of their program for the care of our kids. 
   It is a piece of legislation that will make this country better. Take care of our kids. See to it that we do the job that we should in making health care available for all of our kids. 
   I yield back the balance of my time, excepting I'm going to save time to yield to my dear friend, the majority leader, to close.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I insert these remarks into the Record in response to some unfortunate remarks made on the House floor regarding a provision in the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, H.R. 976. A statement was made suggesting that a certain provision had been inserted in the bill to solely benefit my home State of Michigan, a statement that could not be further from the truth. The provision for which this accusation was made in reality would ensure that all States would not be penalized due to factors in Medicaid funding that are beyond their control. 
   The Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, is the formula used to calculate the amount of Federal funding distributed to States to offset Medicaid expenses. The Federal Government's share of a State's Medicaid funding is based on the State's per capita income. Put simply, States with lower per capita incomes receive more Federal Medicaid funding; States with higher per capita incomes receive lower Federal Medicaid funding. 
   Due to recent changes to accounting rules, the current FMAP formula needs to be updated. Accounting rules that require employers to pre-fund employee pension and insurance funds may cause a State's per capita income to be calculated far higher than it really is. To  comply with the rules, employers may occasionally have to make large transfers to a pension or insurance fund. This money is counted in the calculation of a State's per capita income in the year of the transfer, even though it may not be paid out for years. When this occurs, a State then appears wealthier than it is, causing the State to lose Medicaid funding. 
   The FMAP adjustment included in the CHIP Reauthorization Act corrects this unfair penalty. It simply ensures that when an employer makes a significantly disproportionate pension or insurance contribution, the State is not denied much-needed Medicaid funding. 
   This adjustment provision is not limited to any single State. In fact it now applies to three States, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. It may well be that many more States will have cause to complain about this soon, unless it is corrected. It would apply to any State in any instance where there is a significantly disproportionate employer pension or insurance fund contribution that exceeds 25 percent of a State's increase in personal income for a year.

   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 977. This resolution, introduced by my friend and colleague Representative Braley of Iowa, encourages  Americans to spend their stimulus payments on American-made goods and services. 
   Our Nation's recent economic troubles have hit both American consumers and businesses hard. I believe that the bipartisan stimulus package passed by the Congress and signed into law by the President will help alleviate some of these troubles, provided that consumer spending is directed wisely. The Braley resolution is an important and quite necessary reminder of the billions of dollars that could uplift the National economy, provided Americans spend their rebate checks on goods and services produced by American-owned companies. Moreover, with import prices rising and the mammoth trade deficit of our country, it strikes me as eminently prudent to encourage citizens to ``buy American.'' 
   As one of the more than 100 cosponsors of H. Res. 977, I urge my colleagues in the House to adopt this sensible resolution, which raises the awareness of Americans about the vital role they play in the Nation's economic recovery.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq War has now entered its sixth year. During this time more than 4,000 soldiers have died, almost 30,000 have been injured, and tens of thousands more will suffer mental scars for years to come. The stress of multiple deployments has strained our military, and our military families. Many of our brightest young officers are leaving the military for careers that allow them to have a family, something that is difficult if not impossible when they are being asked to return to Iraq every 12 months. In addition, the economic cost of this war has been nothing short of staggering. The United States has already spent more than five hundred billion dollars in Iraq, or about $5000 for every household in America. Our children and our grandchildren will be paying off this debt for years to come. 
   After all the lives lost and money spent, this President has still failed to articulate what our mission in Iraq is, and what strategic goals he still hopes to accomplish. That is why I have introduced legislation that would require the President to have our troops out of Iraq before he leaves office, and also why I do not support giving the Pentagon another $162 billion it can use to wage this war for another year after the next President is sworn in. 
   While I do not support further funding for this war beyond the President's term in office, I do support the provisions that have been attached conditioning this funding to a timeline for withdrawal, prohibiting the use of torture, holding contractors operating in Iraq responsible for fraud and other criminal activity, stopping the construction of permanent military bases in Iraq, and requiring the President to submit any long term security agreement he reaches with the Government of Iraq to Congress for approval. For too long this President has been given a blank check with which to pursue his Iraq policies, and I am glad that the House of Representatives will once again attempt to hold him accountable for his mismanagement of this war. 
   It must be pointed out that this vote is not a vote against the troops. Those who are serving our country in Iraq are performing admirably under difficult circumstances. Congress has already provided funds for the Department of Defense and war operations for Fiscal Year 2008. This vote won't endanger the troops' safety in any way, but it does send a signal to the President that he should begin the process of bringing them home. 
   I also support the decision to include in this legislation funding for other important Democratic priorities that will help boost our economy. Overall, these measures make up only a small fraction of the total cost of the bill, but they are targeted to make a big impact here at home. Not only will they give much needed assistance to the unemployed, veterans, and other vulnerable people, but these provisions will play an important role in stimulating the lagging economy. 
   For example, the supplemental package includes a bill I introduced that will place a temporary moratorium on seven regulations recently issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These regulations, if allowed to stay in place, would reduce or eliminate payments for services provided to vulnerable Americans and the institutions that serve them: children with disabilities, people with mental illness, those with multiple care needs, people attempting to transition from an institution to a community living environment, and people with disabilities who need these critical services, such as rehabilitation services and case management, in order to remain in their community. In Michigan, the rehabilitation rule would cut rehabilitation services for 15,000 children with special needs, eliminate habilitation services for another 29,000 developmentally disabled adults and children living in the community, and eliminate access to critical community services and resources for 23,600 adults and 5,100 children who are in supported independent living arrangements or group homes. 
   The supplemental will also contain legislation I cosponsored to extend Unemployment Compensation, a provision that will greatly help the residents of Michigan's 15th Congressional District which I have the honor of serving. The National Employment Law Project projects that from May 2008 through March 2009, more than 162,000 workers will exhaust their benefits in Michigan, and that currently over 64,000 have already exhausted this benefit. By including this legislation in today's supplemental package Congress will be helping 226,590 workers in Michigan who desperately need the extra boost, while also giving a much needed boost to the economy. 
   This bill will also provide expanded G.I. Benefits for Veterans Education, restoring the promise of a 4 year college education to those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. As a veteran of World War II, I know how instrumental the original G.I. Bill was in expanding economic opportunity, growing the middle class, and creating a strong and vibrant post-war economy. The President and some of his Republican colleagues, including Senator McCain, are opposed to providing increased educational opportunities to today's generation of veterans because they fear it will discourage men and women currently serving from reenlisting. I find it highly disturbing that the President and his colleagues would withhold these much needed benefits to those who have served our country so admirably, and I would advise them that the quickest way to fix our military's retention problem would be to put an end to the misguided Iraq war that has so seriously damaged morale. 
   Another provision that I strongly support provides $675 million to assist refugees, with the bulk of that money going to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Iraq. I asked the President to include $1.5 billion in his budget for increased U.S. spending in the region, increased U.S. contributions to United Nations appeals for Iraqi refugees, and increased bilateral assistance for our allies, such as Jordan, that are struggling to deal with huge numbers of Iraqi refugees within their borders. Unfortunately this request was denied, and I am very pleased that I was able to work with my Democratic colleagues to see to it that some of these funds were made available in the Supplemental. 
   No matter what we do here today, the President has made it clear that he intends to keep 160,000 troops in Iraq as long as he is in office. While I am disappointed that it appears the President has no interest in ending the war on his watch, I am pleased the Democratic Congress has gone on record as being opposed to that plan, and has put in place the kind of timelines and restrictions required for us to begin to bring our troops home. I also think it is wholly appropriate to include funding for domestic priorities in an emergency supplemental spending bill. Just as the President's mishandling of the Iraq war has caused a crisis in the Middle East, his mismanagement of the economy has created a crisis here at home for millions of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for a particular provision in the Supplemental Appropriations legislation, H.R. 2642. 
   Included in this bill is legislation that I introduced with Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania. The ``Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008'' is a simple, straightforward bill that would place a temporary moratorium on seven regulations recently issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 
   The Committee on Energy and Commerce recently reported the bill with unanimous support. The House then passed it with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 349 to 62. 
   These Medicaid regulations in question, if allowed to stay in place, would reduce or eliminate payments for services provided to vulnerable Americans and the institutions that serve them. They would affect children with disabilities, people with mental illness, those with multiple care needs, people attempting to transition from an institution to a community living environment, and people with disabilities who need services, such as rehabilitation services and case management in order to remain in their community. The regulations would also eliminate funding for school-based outreach and enrollment, and funding that helps safety net providers care for indigent and under-insured patients in our communities. 
   In my home State of Michigan, the rehabilitation rule would cut services for 15,000 children with special needs, eliminate services for another 29,000 developmentally disabled adults and children and eliminate access to critical community services and resources for 23,600 adults and 5,100 children who are in supported independent living arrangements or group homes. 
   The Administration's arguments for supporting these regulations simply do not hold water. These regulations go beyond any justifiable point to curb abuses in the system. Rather, they represent a misguided effort to shift costs to States and prohibit Federal support for legitimate expenditures on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries. 
   More than 2,000 organizations representing beneficiaries, providers, schools, and States have written to lend their support to this initiative, from ``A'', such as the American Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, to ``Z,'' the Zion Lutheran Elementary School in Nebraska. The chorus of support has been overwhelming.  
   I would also like to take a moment to commend Chairman Pallone and Ranking Members Barton and Deal who worked to prepare the bill for rapid action in Committee and the House floor. 
   I also wish to thank Chairman Obey for including the Medicaid legislation in the supplemental appropriations bill.

   Mr. Speaker, as we consider S. 5 as passed by the Senate, I am pleased to report that both Houses of Congress have again found common ground on stem cell research policy. This is a matter of utmost importance. We have sent this legislation, or similar legislation on stem cell research, to the President twice. The legislation has been vetoed. 
   This is a bicameral bill and our actions are clear: We and the American people will not be deterred from enacting potentially life-saving legislation of this kind. For those suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer's, autism, cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, Parkinson's or spinal cord injury, stem cell research offers both promise and hope, and that is why we must continue this fight and continue this research. 
   The legislation lifts the arbitrary date restriction and expands the number of cell lines eligible for federally funded research. It contains strong ethics provisions passed in H.R. 3, ensuring new stem cell lines are only derived from unused embryos created for human fertility treatments that would otherwise be discarded. 
   I want to be clear: S. 5 does not permit funding for creation or destruction of embryos. This is a critical point. If  not used in research, these stem cells will be discarded as medical waste. 
   Finally, I note that S. 5 includes the text of the Hope Offered Through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act, or the HOPE Act, which is Senate language. 
   At this time I wish to yield now and I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) be permitted to control the time on this side. She has done a superb job in providing leadership on this matter.

   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the legislation. I want to commend and congratulate and thank my two good friends, Chairman Dicks and Obey for their extraordinary leadership. They have produced the finest Interior Appropriations bill I have seen in years, and we owe our two colleagues a great debt of gratitude. 
   First of all, there is a large increase in the Fish and Wildlife Service to address problems like staffing of refuges of which 221 of the 547 have no staff whatsoever. It will provide $56 million which will give our refuges the staff necessary to keep this wonderful system the national treasure it is. 
   It is also a wonderful piece of legislation by giving $223 million more to the Park Service, a desperately needed situation. The Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund is funded at $1.1 billion over the President's request, desperately needed in a time when our Nation is seeing our waters get dirtier and less safe and less enjoyable for our people. 
   The bill reverses years of budget neglect, and provides much-needed increases for public health programs administered by EPA. It increases funding for Superfund toxic waste cleanups, something which is a massive problem to our people, both in terms of safety and the environment. It brings forward brownfield revitalization efforts and addresses the problem of leaking underground storage tanks and will protect the health and environment of the American people. 
   I want to tell my good friend how grateful we are and thank him for what he has done. I would also like to express my support for Eddie Bernice Johnson's amendment to prevent EPA from finalizing a proposed change in existing rules limiting toxic air pollution. 
   This is a great bill and I salute the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks) for his extraordinary ability, remarkable hard work, and great service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could rise in support for the administration's policy. I wish it made sense. I wish it was in the best interests of this country to support that policy. 
   It has been now 4 years since the first American soldier entered the deserts of Iraq, and about 4 years since the President has declared victory. Since then, more than 3,100 Americans have been killed, 24,000 and more have been wounded, and anywhere between 40,000 and 100,000 Iraqis have died. 
   You know, I am proud and grateful that I could have the privilege of serving my country and making some small offering to its success in time of war. I understand how important it is we support our troops there. They have done a magnificent job, and everyone in this Chamber, including this speaker, support them fully. It is regrettable, however, the leadership in Washington that has been less than stellar. 
   Unfortunately, the veracity of this administration and the respect in which it is held on these matters ranks somewhere around that great fantasist Baron Munchausen, the teller of fantastic tales. 
   I am against this plan, if it can be called such, because it is just more of the same policies and programs that have consistently failed for 4 years. I am against this surge because it will not make Americans safer, because it will put more American lives at risk, because it continues to neglect the battle in Afghanistan, and because it completely disregards the necessary diplomatic and political recommendations of the Iraqi Study Group. 
   Twenty-one thousand is too many to kill and too few to succeed. And, more importantly, that number is going to be sent over there away from the adventures that we are confronting in Afghanistan and the troubles that we are seeing in that place, and we are going to send people over there without adequate preparation, proper equipment, and training. 
   Vice President Cheney has told us that insurgency is in the last throes. Mr. Speaker, the national Intelligence estimates said that fanatical terrorism has now, and I quote, ``metastasized and spread across the globe.'' 
   At each possible turning point, the toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue, the dissolving of the Army, the creation of the Iraqi Constitution, the vote for the constitution, the Parliamentary elections, the capture of Saddam, the death of Zarqawi, the Bush administration has told us that victory is at hand. And yet the killing goes on and seems to have risen to new levels and new evidence of risk. 
   I don't believe that we can any more condone this long train of failure which has brought us so little success and such tremendous sacrifice in blooded treasure. It is time that we recognize that our troops are in the middle of a civil insurrection or a civil war. It is time that we recognize that we must turn this situation now over to the Iraqis. The matter will be decided by the Iraqis, not by us. It will not be decided militarily, but rather politically, by the people in the area, and not by Americans who are coming increasingly to be viewed as intruders and to be less liked and less supported. 
   I know that commentators and defenders of the administration will assert that Iraq is too important, too vital to our national interests to be debated or criticized. I happen to think the debate in this body on matters of great importance is the reason that we exist, and it is time that we speak on behalf of the American people to tell this administration: ``Find a new mechanism to prevail in this matter. Find a new way to spend our lives and treasure. Find a new way to see to it that we prevail and that we make this country safe,'' because it is clear that this is not going to happen with the current policy as exemplified by this administration. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I hope that the country will see to it that the President finally hears the message that his policies are failed, it is time to make changes, and that we have to do so in the interest of the United States and world peace

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DO-NOT-CALL IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3541 the ``Do-Not-Call Improvement Act of 2007''. This bill enjoys wide bipartisan support. Along with H.R. 2601, legislation considered by the House immediately before this bill, these measures will strengthen and ensure the continued operation of one of the most popular Federal consumer protection programs ever adopted by the Congress, the registry that allows consumers to list their phone numbers and thereby protect themselves from unwanted telemarketing phone calls. 
   Current rules provide that telephone numbers be removed from the list after 5 years, thus requiring consumers to re-register their numbers in order to fend off pesky telemarketing calls. Most consumers are unaware  of this requirement. And I would observe that it places a particular burden on the elderly, the group most often victimized by telemarketing frauds. 
   The FTC testified before our Committee last month that they would not remove any expiring numbers from the Do-Not-Call Registry, that is, phone numbers will stay registered, pending action by Congress to address this issue. 
   To that end, H.R. 3541 will eliminate the automatic removal of telephone numbers registered on the Registry, subject to certain common sense exceptions, such as at the request of the individual to whom the number is assigned. To maintain the accuracy of the Registry, H.R. 3541 directs the FTC to ``periodically'' check telephone numbers on the Registry against national or other appropriate databases, and remove from such Registry telephone numbers that have been disconnected and reassigned. The Committee intends for the FTC or any subcontractor to check these numbers at least once a month and preferably more frequently as technology allows. Nothing in this bill prohibits the FTC from removing invalid telephone numbers from the Registry at any time. The Committee expects the FTC to work with industry and technology experts to ensure the accuracy of the Registry. The legislation directs the FTC to report to Congress, not later than 9 months after date of enactment, on efforts taken by the agency to improve the accuracy of the Registry. I commend Representatives Doyle and Pickering for their strong bipartisan leadership on this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this strong package of important consumer protections. Let us hope for swift action on H.R. 3541, as well as on the legislation establishing a permanent funding mechanism, leading to quick enactment so that Americans are not once again inundated with unwanted calls from telemarketers.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY FEE EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2601, the ``Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007'', of which I am the lead Democratic sponsor. This bill enjoys wide bipartisan support. Its passage will help to ensure the continued operation of one of the most popular Federal consumer protection programs ever adopted by the Congress, the registry that allows consumers to list their phone numbers and thereby protect themselves from unwanted telemarketing phone calls. 
   Congress originally assigned the task of implementing and enforcing the Do-Not-Call Registry to the Federal Communications Commission, but they proved less than enthusiastic and nothing ensued. Congress then directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to perform these tasks. To date, the Registry established by the FTC includes more than 145 million telephone numbers, and the FTC has initiated 27 cases alleging Do-Not-Call violations, resulting in orders totaling $8.8 million in civil  penalties and $8.6 million in redress or disgorgement. This is a proud record indeed. 
   To maintain the success of this program, however, legislative action is needed. The authority of the FTC to collect fees to support maintenance of the Registry and the related enforcement program expired at the end on September 2007. H.R. 2601, whose lead sponsor is Rep. Stearns, will provide the FTC with a permanent fee structure for this purpose, contingent on approval of the fees in annual appropriations acts. This will provide appropriate oversight over the funding mechanism. The bill also requires the FTC to prepare two reports on the use and effectiveness of the Registry, including allegations regarding abuse surrounding a number of exemptions. The Committee takes these consumer complaints seriously and intends to look into them, in connection with review of the FTC reports. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this important consumer protection bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6604, the ``Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act'' will help restore integrity to commodity futures markets. Lax regulation has allowed prices to become divorced from fundamental supply and demand. Lax regulation has allowed speculative bubbles to form in food and energy prices. And lax regulation has caused billions of dollars in damage to businesses and consumers. 
   Oil prices doubled from $72 per barrel on July 11, 2007, to $145 on July 11, 2008, even though supply and demand was fundamentally unchanged. While excess capacity was reduced and the dollar had dropped, there were no oil shortages, and inventories were ample. Fundamentals alone do not explain a 100 percent price increase. 
   What has changed over the past few years is that oil has been transformed from a basic commodity into a financial asset, and traded for its speculative value by institutional investors who want to diversify portfolios, hedge the dollar, or make a fast buck. The Washington Post reports that speculators control as much as 81 percent of the futures market, up from an estimated 37 percent in 2000. 
   Investment banks and futures exchanges claim that institutional investors are providing badly needed liquidity to the futures market, that futures prices reflect supply and demand, and Congress should not turn them into a scapegoat. 
   Wall Street's commodity brokers told their investors privately, however, that supply and demand did not explain the doubling of oil prices. 
   Just yesterday, Michael Cembalest, J.P. Morgan's global chief investment officer, wrote:  
   the Peak Oil crowd promoting crude oil ..... at $200 should concede what we've been saying: there was an enormous amount of speculation pent up in energy markets (e.g., an 8-fold increase in bank OTC oil derivative exposure in the last 3 years), and it wasn't just the supply-demand equation. Oil will rise again, and we need solutions to energy supplies, but $140 in July 2008 was ridiculous.  
   Yet on the same day, Blythe Masters, Managing Director and Head of Global Commodities for J.P. Morgan submitted testimony before the Senate Energy Committee stating:  
   we fundamentally believe that high energy prices are a result of supply and demand, not excessive speculation.  
   Lehman Brothers told its investors in May that it is seeing ``the classic ingredients of an asset bubble'' in oil. It linked it to an inflow of $90 billion in commodity index investments. 
   The cost to our economy from excessive speculation is destructive. 
   For every penny increase in the price of a gallon of gasoline, consumer costs jump by $1 billion a year, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. The run-up since last September has added nearly $1 per gallon, costing consumers $100 billion absorbing the  economic stimulus package enacted earlier this year. 
   The Industrial Energy Consumers indicate that natural gas consumers paid an extra $40.4 billion this year already. They support this bill. 
   The airlines have lost 36,000 jobs and retired 746 planes this year, while eliminating 635 routes, due to jet fuel prices. They support this bill. 
   Petroleum marketers have seen oil prices come unhinged from supply and demand. They support this bill. 
   Some institutional investors are now starting to unwind their massive positions. Nearly 127 million barrels of oil futures valued at $40 billion were liquidated by institutional investors between July 15, 2008, and September 2, 2008, according to a recent analysis of the CFTC's public data. Oil futures prices plunged $53 per barrel to $92 in only two months, yet fundamental supply and demand was not changed materially in the past 60 days. 
   What did change in mid July is that Congress in both Houses took up legislation to rein in excessive speculation--particularly in the unregulated dark markets--which may have spurred some speculators to get out early. 
   The central issue is whether pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds should be allowed to hijack commodity markets and set oil and food prices, or whether consumers and producers should set prices based on supply and demand. If speculators can drive prices back up to $140, they can really turn the lights out on the U.S. economy. 
   Some may argue that given the crisis in financial markets, this is not the time to start regulating Wall Street. Beginning with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, however, deregulation has allowed recklessness to compromise our entire financial system. 
   The recent collapse of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, AIG, and Lehman Brothers are a product of lax regulation which has led to systemic risk for the entire financial system. 
   This legislation puts a cop on the beat and codifies some of the transparency measures recently recommended by the CFTC. I commend Chairman Peterson and Etheridge, as well as Representatives Stupak, Van Hollen, DeLauro, and Larson for their leadership on forging this bill and urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, the Committee on Energy and Commerce supports the consideration of H.R. 556 by the House today. This bill adopts a number of needed reforms to the process by which the Federal government reviews foreign investments in the United States for their national security implications. The free and fair flow of capital and trade is an important goal. At the same time, we face new challenges in a complex global economy where countries increasingly have clear national strategies on how to compete in order to increase national power and their standard of living. 
   In 1987, the leadership of the Congress was troubled by our nation's rising trade deficit, and decided to craft an omnibus trade bill. Congress passed the Omnibus Trade Act in 1988. The so-called Exon-Florio amendment to the Defense Production Act, written by the Senate and House Commerce Committees on which Senator Exon and Congressman Florio served, authorized the President to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies in instances where the foreign acquisition poses a threat to national security. The President delegated this authority to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. 
   The 1988 Act's Conference Agreement made absolutely clear that the term ``national security'' was meant to be broadly interpreted. H.R. 556 continues in this vein by including ``a security-related impact on critical infrastructure'' and ``whether the covered transaction is foreign-government controlled'' as additional factors required to be considered. The Report filed by the Committee on Financial Services notes that: ``The Committee expects that CFIUS will consider all aspects of a covered transaction to determine if the investment threatens to impair national security.'' I wholeheartedly agree. The Report also makes clear that national security encompasses critical energy-related infrastructure issues. The Energy and Commerce Committee appreciates this emphasis on matters within our jurisdiction and of critical concern to the security of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today takes measurable and concrete steps to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Most importantly, it is a piece of legislation that will be signed into law by the President. And as such, it represents a glimmer of hope that we will be able to get beyond the gridlock that has afflicted us for far too long in far too many areas. 
   Despite the birth pains of this legislation, and there have been many, it is a good bill. Is it a perfect bill? No. But it is good enough to be supported by the Members. More has to be done, and we will do it. This is, then, a good bill. Its core is a series of requirements that will improve energy efficiency of almost every product and tool and appliance that is used in the United States from light bulbs to light trucks. We are requiring a 40 percent increase in the fuel economy of our motor vehicles, and we are doing it in a way that gives manufacturers the flexibility they need to get the job done while preserving American jobs. 
   Congress is establishing specific numbers and targets, including new categories of vehicles, in a comprehensive approach to fuel efficiency. Along with the efficiency standards for homes, appliances and lighting, we will be removing from the atmosphere 10 billion tons or more of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2030. That is the equivalent of taking all cars, trucks and planes off the road and out of the skies for 5 years. 
   This legislation is not the final word on energy security or climate change. We will be needing to do more, and we will. To be specific, I believe that it is possible for us to craft renewable energy requirements for electrical utilities, something which was dropped in the final stages of the bill because of the imperfections of the Senate's work, and a low carbon fuel standard. These are matters we will be addressing next year as we craft comprehensive climate change legislation on which the Committee on Energy and Commerce is now working. But that takes nothing away from today's achievement, which represents solid accomplishment and an essential downpayment towards reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil and reducing greenhouse emissions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&#225;zquez). 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day for America. This legislation blazes a trail by putting small businesses at the forefront of solving our energy problems. It is clear there is no greater obstacle to our long-term economic growth than the rising costs of energy. 
   With this bill, we are not only addressing this challenge today, but also for future generations, and leading the effort will be this Nation's entrepreneurs. This legislation will enable small farmers to produce more clean energy. Small businesses already make up 85 percent of the renewable fuels industry, and this ensures they remain  viable in a global economy. The establishment of the Renewable Fuels Capital Investment Company will only increase the number of small firms involved in producing ethanol and biodiesel. 
   Small manufacturers are also expected to expand their efforts in improving energy conservation. With greater access to capital for developing clean technologies, these firms can use these resources to innovate and create designs to enhance efficiency. When people talk about a green economy and green collar jobs, they talk about small businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, these reforms sustain and expand the efforts of small businesses in adding stability to our energy markets. This will be accomplished by reducing energy usage, encouraging conservation and limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The bill before us shows that meeting the needs of our environment doesn't mean we cannot meet the needs of our economy. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership on this important bill, support its immediate passage, and urge the President to sign this into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DTV TRANSITION ASSISTANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2607, the ``DTV Transition Assistance Act''. This measure will help facilitate the transition to digital television (DTV), a technology which holds great promise for this country. It will allow for more broadcast programming with better sound and picture quality. It will provide new opportunities for wireless technologies on analog spectrum being vacated by broadcasters. And most importantly, some of this vacated analog spectrum will be used to create a nationwide, interoperable broadband network for first responders. 
   With the February 17, 2009, DTV transition date slightly more than 7 months away, however, we must ensure that all Americans are prepared for it. S. 2607 takes a step in the right direction by solving some outstanding problems relating to the transition in a thoughtful manner. 
   Not all television stations will make the transition to digital broadcasting on February 17th. Low-power and translator stations, many of which serve rural, minority, and other underserved communities, do not have a set date by which they must switch to digital. The ``Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005'' established a grant program to help often financially constrained low-power television stations acquire the equipment needed to make the transition to digital. S. 2607 makes those funds available beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2009, rather than in FY 2011, as provided by current law. It also extends the availability of funding through FY 2012. These changes will help facilitate the DTV transition for low-power stations so they can offer consumers th benefits of digital broadcasting. 
   The 2005 Act also established a $10 million program to help translator stations continue providing an analog broadcast signal after February 17, 2009. Such stations are eligible for grants of up to $1,000 toward the purchase of digital-to-analog conversion equipment. That grant program is currently undersubscribed and includes more than enough money to accommodate every translator station. Accordingly, S. 2607 gives the Assistant Secretary of Communications and Information the flexibility to reallocate unspent money from the program to DTV consumer education. 
   Consumer education is the key to a successful DTV transition, and its importance cannot be overemphasized. Television is the predominant medium through which Americans receive critical public safety information and is one of the chief conduits for news and political discourse, as well as entertainment. Therefore, the most critical aspect of the DTV transition is ensuring that consumers are prepared for it. Congress mandated the DTV transition, and it is its responsibility to protect our constituents by ensuring the transition proceeds as smoothly as possible. 
   I am pleased to see the House consider this measure, which will contribute to a more successful transition. I strongly support S. 2607 and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE DUMPING OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE INTO THE GREAT LAKES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution before us. Recently, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management granted BP's Whiting refinery in Indiana broad exceptions under the Clean Water Act. These exemptions will allow BP to increase the amount of discharge of ammonia by 54 percent and its discharge of total suspended solids by 35 percent. This means that an additional 1,584 pounds of ammonia and 4,925 pounds of total suspended solids could be dumped into Lake Michigan. 
   This is simply unacceptable and I thank my colleagues from Illinois and Michigan for bringing the resolution to the floor with the utmost speed. I am dismayed, Madam Speaker. Dismayed that the State of Indiana issued the permits and further dismayed EPA allowed the State to do so. 
   Algae blooms, Madam Speaker, are serious business. Algae blooms, which can be caused by ammonia and total suspended solids, overtake native ecosystems by taking nutrients away from the surrounding plant life and also feed harmful bacteria which remove oxygen, killing aquatic life. This leads to poor water quality and beach closings. Instead of taking action to increase algae blooms, we should be taking action to decease them. 
   According to BP, the company intends to install a diffuser to create a ``mixing zone''--mixing zones are areas where clean water gets mixed with polluted water to further dilute the concentration of pollutants. In 2000, EPA instituted a rule requiring the elimination of existing mixing zones for persistent and bioaccumulative pollution in all the Great Lakes States. The rule required the phase-out of current mixing zones by 2010 and does not allow any new zones to be created. The expansion of the BP facility is not scheduled to be finished until 2011. The exemptions essentially roll back the clock for sound environmental policy. 
   Madam Speaker, those of us from the region have a unique appreciation for the Great Lakes, as we are quite literally surrounded by them. The lakes are a blessing to us. We owe our tourism industry to the Great Lakes--where people come from around the country to recreate, hunt, fish and relax. The lakes as a transportation system provided Michigan and the surrounding States with the means to turn our region into a manufacturing powerhouse. 
   At a time when Congress is finally taking a long-overdue look into a broad restoration and conservation plan for the Great Lakes, the State of Indiana is allowing more pollution into the lakes. And EPA--the lead Agency in Great Lakes Regional Collaboration--is allowing it. This, Madam Speaker, is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing. Instead, restoring and protecting the Great Lakes must be a priority. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support the resolution and again thank my friends, the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from Michigan, for bringing it up.

   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, on Monday I urged my colleagues to support economic recovery legislation, and I continue to urge them to do so today. When I voted against the Gramm-Leech-Bliley Act in 1999 I warned my colleagues that the Government would one day be called upon to rescue failing financial institutions. As angry as I am that my prediction was accurate, I know that on this day inaction is not an option. I still have reservations about this legislation. I do not believe it sufficiently addresses the financial services industry deregulation that allowed this crisis to happen, and I do not believe that it does enough for struggling families. However, I know that the people of this country cannot afford to go another day without action. 
   After our failure to pass this legislation on Monday the stock market suffered the greatest one day decline in its history. The Wall Street executives and investment bankers that got us into this mess surely took a hit, but so too did individual retirement accounts and state pension funds. For example, the State of Michigan estimates that individual investors in the state have lost over $27 billion in the stock market in the last year, and the Michigan Pension Fund lost $2.3 billion on Monday after the House voted down this plan. Should Wall Street decline further and the value of the dollar continue to fall, it will mean greater unemployment, even higher prices for basic commodities, and access to credit for things like college education or home improvements will be even harder to obtain. The impact on the broader economy will be felt by every American. 
   In fact, the lack of credit in the marketplace is already affecting some parts of the broader economy. Auto sales were down 27 percent in the past year, in part because consumers cannot get access to credit for car loans. The automobile financing companies are not responsible for the current credit crisis, but they will be eligible to participate in this program to obtain the credit they need to keep vehicle sales strong. This week I learned about a financially sound manufacturing company in Michigan that is seeking a mortgage to replace its current building, which it has outgrown, with a new facility that will allow the company to expand its operations and add much needed jobs. This company is struggling to even find a bank willing to loan it money. Small and medium-sized businesses did not cause this crisis, but unless this crisis is addressed and the credit markets are restored they will find themselves unable to do business.  
   Despite my lingering concerns that this is not the best possible way to address this crisis, we clearly have to act to avert a much larger economic failure. In the months ahead, we can continue to revisit these issues and work together to adopt measures that restore the regulatory structure that is supposed to protect the financial system from this kind of failure, and that provide much needed assistance to the hard-working men and women who are suffering because of the economic climate created by irresponsible parties on Wall Street and here in Washington. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation before us today as a matter of great national urgency.

Mr. Speaker, today we are voting on the passage of H.R. 1424, the ``Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007'', which will permanently reauthorize and improve the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. I commend my distinguished colleagues, Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad, for their efforts in crafting this important piece of legislation. 
   H.R. 1424 will create true parity of coverage for mental health and substance abuse disorders. It will ensure that healthcare plans that provide mental health coverage do not charge higher co-payments, coinsurance, or deductibles for mental health or substance abuse care. It will also ensure that care for mental health and addiction disorders is no more restrictive than medical or surgical care. 
   Mental illness and addiction disorders have long been recognized by the healthcare community as actual and legitimate health afflictions which may have a significant affect on an individual's life and well-being. It has long been accepted that these afflictions deserve treatment by professionally trained healthcare providers. 
   As I think of all of the different diseases and afflictions recognized by our scientific and healthcare communities, I struggle to find a reason why someone who has healthcare coverage should confront discriminatory barriers to treatment simply because of the nature of the disease. Mental health and addiction disorders can be just as painful and debilitating as medical and surgical disorders. The strains of these illnesses affect individuals, families, and society as a whole. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to pass H.R. 1424 to achieve comprehensive mental health and substance abuse parity.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1252 is intended to stop and punish unscrupulous gasoline price gougers. The bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission to go after gougers at all levels of the gasoline distribution chain and to impose stiff penalties on violators. It also provides authority for the States to go after retail price gougers under Federal law. 
   The bill is not, however, intended to prohibit all increases in price--only those increases that grossly exceed the supplier's earlier prices and competitors' prices and that do not reflect reasonable responses to an emergency situation. 
   This bill would not prohibit a seller from raising prices to compensate for extra risks, such as staying open while a hurricane is bearing down, traveling outside an affected area to secure additional supplies and transport them to people in need, or postponing regular maintenance to increase output during an emergency. These are all efforts that ameliorate a dire situation and the bill is not intended to discourage them. 
   Finally, the bill would permit suppliers to reasonably factor in other local, regional, national, and international market developments in the quickly-changing and uncertain market conditions characteristic of energy emergency situations. 
   In sum, Mr. Speaker, this bill is intended to prohibit grossly excessive, pernicious, and predatory increases in the price of gasoline during emergencies--but not to prevent or discourage fair and reasonable responses to unusual market conditions.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (NICS IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. I want to thank, Mr. Speaker, my dear friend, the chairman of the committee, for yielding this time to me, and express my great affection and respect for Mr. Conyers. 
   I also want to thank my dear friend, Mr. Smith, for the kind words that he made about me, and I want to express my affection and respect for him. 
   I want to say that this is a good piece of legislation. It has taken a while, but I'm happy to have worked with many of our colleagues, including the distinguished gentlewoman from New York, who has been a fine leader on this matter. 
   Improving the National Instant Check System is a matter of important national business, and I would urge my colleagues to take a look at the rather curious alliance which brings this matter forward. Not only is the NRA, but the gun control folks are in support of  it. Members on both sides of the aisle, both here and in the Senate, are strongly supporting it. 
   The bill will require the National Instant Check System to work. It will provide incentives to the States and penalties for those who do not cooperate in terms of making the system work. 
   This system has the capability of seeing to it that criminals are denied firearms while, at the same time, assuring that we protect the rights of law abiding citizens. 
   The bill makes the system better for everyone, and assures that there will be better law enforcement and better protection of the rights of all citizens, both under the second amendment and personal security. 
   The bill also addresses the problems of mishandling of this matter by the Veterans Administration, by making corrections which will make it possible for veterans who have not a disability of mental character or otherwise, to own firearms within the ordinary structure of the law. 
   It is a good piece of legislation. I want to commend my distinguished friend, Congresswoman McCarthy from New York for her leadership and the outstanding work which she has done. 
   I will tell my colleagues that this is an important matter. I'm delighted to see that we're able to come together, Democrats and Republicans, friends of firearms and hunters and sportsmen, and also those who are concerned about public safety, and who desire to see to it that we have proper protection of persons against criminal misuse of firearms. 
   We have given this body a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.  
   Mr. Speaker, we've heard many concerns from gun owners, especially my fellow veterans, who are concerned that a person who seeks treatment for a mental problem might be reported to NICS as a ``mental defective.'' I want to lay those concerns to rest right now. 
   First of all, federal law, the Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits gun ownership by people who are ``adjudicated'' as mentally defective. ``Adjudication'' implies a decision by a court or similar body--not just a doctor's notes on a patient's charts. 
   Even the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives make that clear. They define an ``adjudication'' as a decision by a ``court, board, commission or other lawful authority.'' They have never treated doctors as a ``lawful authority'' for this purpose; clearly what they had in mind were legally empowered bodies such as judges, or the county mental health boards that are in place in some states to make decisions at hearings with respect to mental illness. 
   Second, we in no way intend that this bill should override federal or state medical privacy laws or the basic role of a doctor. The confidentiality between a doctor and patient is sacred and we do not intend to breach it here. We make that clear in section 102 of this bill, where we require the Attorney General to work with the medical and mental health community to develop privacy regulations. 
   Finally, this is a particular concern for the Veterans' Administration, which examines thousands of veterans every year. Even if we wanted them to, it would be an unreasonable demand on that hard-working agency to expect them to comb every patient's file for any possible finding that the person might be dangerous. I want to be clear that that is not our intent. 
   It is important that we understand these points because no person should ever be deterred from seeking mental health treatment out of a concern that he might lose his Second Amendment rights due to some record of voluntary treatment being provided for the instant check system.

   I rise to support the legislation. And I would like to engage in a colloquy with my dear friend, Mr. Frank. I would note that the colloquy is an important one. 
   Madam Speaker, the automobile manufacturers face the most difficult conditions they've faced in decades. We need to do something to help unfreeze the credit markets that are hurting our industry. 
   As I read the legislation, the Secretary has the authority to purchase from a motor vehicle finance company traditional car loans and mortgage-related paper, such as a home equity loan used to purchase cars or trucks. Is my interpretation correct? 
   I yield to my good friend.

If the Federal Reserve Board were to use the authority it has to address extraordinary circumstances in the credit market, motor vehicle companies would have access to capital that would help them to finance dealer floor plans and to make consumer loans. Am I correct in this? And would my good friend support such a decision by the Federal Reserve Bank to make funds available as long as these companies face unusual and extraordinary market conditions?

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. I thank my good friend.  
   Madam Speaker, in the last few months we have watched the Bush administration negotiate the sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, nationalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, take an 80 percent stake in A.I.G., and let Lehman Brothers enter bankruptcy. When it became clear that this inconsistent, ad hoc approach was not going to be enough to keep our Nation from economic crisis, the Bush administration presented Congress with a plan that would give the Treasury Secretary unfettered authority to purchase up to $700 billion in troubled assets. In 2 days of hearings, Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke were asked by members of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee to explain why such unprecedented and unfettered authority should be granted to a single individual, and it was clear that there was no answer. 
   Since the Bush administration's proposal was first introduced, a consensus has emerged that this bailout package is needed but that it needs to be improved through the inclusion of a number of important provisions. I congratulate Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus of the Financial Services Committee and Senators Dodd and Bennett of the Senate Banking Committee for working together to turn an unacceptable proposal into a bipartisan bill that will hopefully help bring us out of this crisis. 
   I had a number of concerns about what is in the President's proposal: I was concerned about the potential cost, I was concerned about how the Treasury would determine a price for these assets, and I was concerned that there may have been other, more effective ways of giving these institutions access to the capital they need. I am happy to say that thanks to the hard work of the congressional negotiators, many of my concerns have been addressed. 
   One concern that remains about this legislation is that it does nothing to address the underlying causes of this crisis. When Congress passed the Gramm-Leech-Bliley Act in 1999 and deregulated the financial sector, I warned my colleagues that tearing down the regulatory structure enacted after the Great Depression would lead to huge institutions that would be free to engage in risky behavior and that the failure of those institutions would result in massive government bailouts. I wish that my prediction had been wrong, but today that is exactly the situation we are faced with. The American people need to understand that nothing in this plan will address that issue. The plan does not reduce the amount of risk that these institutions are allowed to take on, it does not create a new agency or empower an existing one to review the actions of currently unregulated financial institutions, and it does not create any new standards to guide them in the future. 
   Many Americans, who have seen their paycheck shrink over the last 8 years, who have watched some of their neighbors lose their jobs, who are struggling to pay increased costs for things like gas, groceries, or health care services, and who resisted the temptation to take out a risky loan and instead bought a house they were sure they could afford and made every payment, do not understand this bailout. They do not understand what this plan will do, they do not understand why it costs so much, and they do not understand why their tax dollars are going to be spent to bail out the same Wall Street banks whose risky behavior contributed to this mess. Most importantly, they do not understand why the Government is offering so little to help their family. 
   To all of my constituents who want to know why they are being asked to foot the bill to pay for this bailout, I can tell you only one 
   thing: The cost of inaction to you and your family is greater than the cost of this bailout. Should Wall Street decline further and the value of the dollar continue to fall, it will mean greater unemployment, even higher prices for basic commodities, and access to credit for things like college education or home improvements will be even harder to obtain. The impact on the broader economy will be felt by every American. In fact, the credit crisis is already having an impact on the automobile industry that is so important to my constituents in Michigan and to hundreds of thousands of families around the country. If access to credit continues to dry up, the automobile financing companies will be unable to keep vehicles on dealership lots and help customers obtain financing. The automobile financing companies are not responsible for the current credit crisis, but they will be eligible to participate in this program to obtain the credit they need to keep vehicle sales strong. 
   Furthermore, the package that we are voting on today is a far cry from the bailout proposal first offered by the President. It contains important provisions assuring greater transparency and oversight and ensures that there will be no golden parachutes for the executives whose recklessness contributed to this crisis. It also includes provisions that will assist families who are struggling to keep their homes by requiring the Federal Government to modify the terms of the mortgages it acquires. 
   Most importantly, Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Frank, and others were able to negotiate into this package important provisions designed to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure our investment is recouped. For example, the Government will have the option to take equity in the companies that participate in the bailout and will create an insurance program for and collect premiums from those holding toxic assets. If after 5 years these provisions have not allowed the Government to recoup 100 percent of the cost of the bailout, the losses will be recaptured directly from the financial industry itself. 
   I do not, however, want to commit to anyone that this imperfect bill will work. It may not. Scholars of the Great Depression have told us that had the Government addressed the liquidity problem the economic collapse might have been a lot shorter or less forceful in its impact, or both. This bill may not work. But we have to try. Inaction is not an option. 
   I understand the anger and frustration that exists about this bailout. I pledge to my constituents that this will not be the only congressional response to this situation. This legislation creates a Congressional Oversight Panel, tasked with drafting a special report on regulatory reform that will be ready in time for the 111th Congress. Should the voters in Michigan's 15th Congressional District see fit to return me to Congress next year I will work to see that report turned into legislation that restores the regulatory structure that is supposed to protect the financial system from this kind of failure and that provides much needed assistance to the hard working men and women who are suffering because of the economic climate created by irresponsible parties on Wall Street and here in Washington. 
   I again want to thank the leadership of both parties in both the House and the Senate, and in particular Chairman Frank for the work that they have done to improve upon the plan sent to us by the Bush administration. I know that many of my colleagues are as skeptical of this plan as I am, and I know that for many of you it may be easier to vote against this plan than it will be to vote for it and have to explain to voters back home why we had to take this difficult step, but we must join together and pass this legislation now for the good of the country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (BROADBAND DATA IMPROVEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1492. Title I of S. 1492 is the Broadband Data Improvement Act. This Act puts the country further down the path toward universal broadband deployment, a goal we must achieve. It does so by improving the quality of data that the Federal Communications Commission collects concerning broadband deployment and adoption. It requires annual reports on the state of broadband deployment and also requires the Commission to conduct consumer surveys on broadband use, price, speed, and availability. Importantly, Title I requires a comparison of broadband deployment at home with broadband deployment abroad. Armed with this information, policy makers will be able to make more informed decisions to increase broadband penetration and drive its deployment. 
   Title I also directs the Secretary of Commerce to develop a grant program to help take stock of broadband availability in States. Unfortunately, Title I does not require the construction of a nationwide map depicting broadband deployment. I am hopeful that we can work toward that goal as this legislation is implemented. And while I am disappointed that Title I does not authorize funding for this crucial grant program, directing the Secretary of Commerce to establish it is a victory for American consumers. 
   Even though the Broadband Data Improvement Act does not include every provision from the similar bill that passed the House unanimously, it is a solid step in the right direction, and it deserves our full support. 
   Title II of S. 1492 is largely based on legislation authorized by Rep. MELISSA BEAN and aims to promote the safety of children on the Internet and protect them from online predators and cybercrimes. It directs the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, the Nation's foremost consumer protection agency, to carry out a nationwide educational campaign on the safe use of the Internet by children. This legislation will ensure that the FTC's educational efforts are both wide-ranging and inclusive of other governmental and private organizations that are dedicated to safe Internet use. It also ensures that the FTC keeps Congress apprised of its activities through submission of annual reports. 
   Title II also further promotes children's Internet safety by directing the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to establish a working group of government, industry, and public interest. To keep Congress informed, the Assistant Secretary must submit a report 1 year after formation of the working group to the appropriate Committees. 
   Finally, Title II promotes online safety education in schools. It focuses in particular on appropriate behavior in networking sites and chat rooms and awareness of cyber bullying. 
   I congratulate Representatives MARKEY, BEAN, and others who worked on this fine bill. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, today the House will consider H. Con. Res. 99, the House Budget Resolution. I rise in support of this budget resolution because it fulfills the pledge Democrats made when we regained the majority. I am pleased to say that the Democrats have delivered on their word--the proposed Democratic plan will balance the budget in 5 years, while ensuring that critical programs are fully funded and that the programs dearest to our families are fully funded. The Democratic budget will expand health care for our children; provide our soldiers and veterans with care worthy of their sacrifice; support education for a 21st century workforce and a growing economy; invest in renewable energy; and restore fiscal responsibility to the budget process. 
   When President Bush was elected, he inherited a budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. Yet by the end of his first term, the Bush Administration turned this surplus into a deficit of nearly $3 trillion. Instead of addressing this deficit, the President's budget increases our deficit by $507 billion over the next 5 years. In comparison, the Democratic budget will lower the deficit by $234 billion over the next 5 years using the newly resurrected pay-as-you-go rules. 
   We will also work to lower the deficit by putting an end to wasteful government spending through increased oversight over our government agencies, starting with the Defense Department. To date the Defense Department continues to fail a standard audit that tracks what it spends or owns in the annual budget. It is estimated by Defense auditors that one of every six dollars spent for Iraq is suspect--including $2.7 billion Halliburton has received in contracts. This budget resolution proposes to restore government program performance reviews instituted under the Clinton Administration, which produced 285 recommendations to improve government services. 
   I know that many back home are skeptical about whether this will help the working families in Michigan. Michigan has a troubled economy; its unemployment rate is 6.9 percent and family incomes have dropped $7,989 since 2000, while health care and energy costs continue to rise. Yet the President's budget proposes to eliminate $205 million in funding for job training and employment services in our state. This is funding that Michigan desperately needs to keep our workforce competitive. 
   One of the first steps we can take to repair our economy is to invest in our future workforce. Our budget meets the goals of the Democratic Innovation Agenda by providing an additional $2 billion for federal science and technology programs, putting us on the road to doubling funding for the National Science Foundation. These investments are necessary to maintain America's global competitiveness, particularly in the areas of technology, energy and innovation. 
   We are going to make sure that our children receive the best education possible; our budget provides $8 billion more in 2008 and over 11 percent more over the next 5 years for education and training programs. Under the President's budget, more than 120,000 children in Michigan would go without promised help in reading and math. Head Start--a vital program for more 
   than 35,000 Michigan children--would be cut by the President by 1.5 percent. These programs provide critical services for nearly 1.8 million children enrolled in Michigan public schools. 
   The Democratic budget also supports middle-class tax cuts, which will put money back in the wallets of our families where it belongs. It will also protect middle-income families from a tax increase by setting up a reserve fund for a long-term fix for the alternative minimum tax, AMT. In 2004, 69,000 Michigan families were subject to the AMT and if this system is not adjusted for inflation, an estimated 507,000 families in Michigan will have to pay it in 2007. Without this fix, the President's budget would increase middle-income taxes by $230 billion. I know many are wondering how we will actually pay for the middle-class tax cut. We will pay for this by eliminating tax loopholes and closing the tax gap to make sure that those who are cheating the system pay up and those who are honest are rewarded. 
   In recent months, energy costs have skyrocketed, literally leaving many Michigan families in the cold. Gasoline prices in Michigan have increased 79 percent, up $1.12 a gallon since 2001. While the President travels the country promoting his renewable energy programs, his budget proposes holding funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs at the 2001 funding level, and cutting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, by 18 percent. It is obvious that we need to end America's addiction to foreign oil and begin to invest in renewable energy sources here at home. The Democratic budget rejects the proposed cut to LIHEAP and will create a reserve fund that will redirect oil subsidies to invest $14 billion over the next 10 years in clean, renewable alternative energy and energy efficiency programs. This investment will promote new technologies to lower energy costs and relieve families of this immense burden. 
   The Democratic budget rejects the President's proposal to cut the Community Development Block Grant program, and actually provides the first increase in funding for the Community Development Block Grant program. This program provides crucial funding to assist nearly 1,200 States and local governments with job creation, economic development and affordable housing efforts. 
   Not only does this budget recognize the needs of working families, it will also recognize the needs of our veterans. It is clear from the recent events at Walter Reed Army Medical Center that Congress needs to closely examine the health care that veterans are receiving. Veterans have sacrificed too much to come home to run-down health care facilities. We will make sure that our veterans will always have the best care available by providing the largest increase ever to the veterans' health care budget--$3.5 billion this year and $32 billion over the next 5 years. These resources are critical to help repair VA health care facilities, to increase and improve disability claims processing and to invest in mental health care and treatment for traumatic brain injury. Michigan is home to 836,948 veterans, 42,451 of whom recently returned from Afghanistan and Iraq. We need to let our soldiers know that they will not be forgotten after their service is completed. 
   The Democratic budget will ensure that our soldiers have the resources they need in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that our first responders and law enforcement officers here at home are equipped with what they need to protect our country. Under the administration's proposed budget, Michigan would be hit with a 52-percent cut in the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorist Prevention Program would be eliminated completely. The President needs to heed his own advice and fully fund these programs to ensure the safety and security of our communities. The Democratic budget will increase homeland security funding by six percent, ensuring that our first responder and terrorism prevention programs have the resources they need. 
   After 6 years of irresponsible fiscal budgets and empty promises, today's resolution will take the first step to finally balancing our budget and delivering critical funding to programs that need it the most. I support this resolution and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H. Con. Res. 99.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise with considerable regret, and I want to speak with affection and respect for my good friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton), the senior member of the Republicans on the Committee on Energy and Commerce. He complained about the process in the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
   I would like the House and this committee to know that he was afforded, first of all, every bit of notice that is required by the rules of the House, that the proceedings which were conducted in that committee were conducted in an eminently fair and proper way in full accord with the rules and the proprieties of the House. 
   I would also like him to know that I am sure he can recall that we sought his counsel as to how it was we could put something together which, in fact, would give him a process which would enable us to address the problem of SCHIP. 
   I would like to remind him and this committee that SCHIP is going to expire on the 30th of September. That is an important date because at which time we are going to find that all of  the kids, 6 million of them, who have coverage under SCHIP will lose that coverage if something is not done by the Congress of the United States. It is our purpose, given the fact that there will be a recess in this body during the month of August, to see to it that we have this measure ready for the floor in time that the business can be dealt with and that we can handle the matter in a way which will take care of these kids. 
   The legislation was made available to my good friend and to my Republican colleagues on the committee as soon as it could be done after the necessary discussions were held to try to frame a proper piece of legislation and to address something that responsibility of a fiscal and financial character requires, and that is to deal with the pay-fors and how we will pay for the cost of this program. We have done so, and we have arranged that the payments will be a little different than the Senate bill, but they will be sensible. 
   First of all, we will require that the Medicare Advantage plans pay their fair share but that they are not overpaid for the services which they are providing. Some of the less fortunate are getting 11 percent more than they are entitled to, some of the more fortunate are getting 19 percent more than they are entitled to, and some of the most fortunate are getting 30 percent more than they are entitled to. It seemed like good sense to put them in a position where they could compete honestly with the other Medicare providers, and that is what we have done. We also have a modest increase in the tobacco tax. 
   These are all issues which will be considered; and we offered my good friend and my Republican colleagues a chance to amend, debate, and to discuss this legislation. 
   I would note for the benefit of my good friend from Texas that the rules do not require hearings and that on a number of occasions on important legislation in prior Congresses during his chairmanship and that of others of my very dear friends on the Republican side, the situation was conducted in a way in which there were no hearings and which legislation was brought directly to the committee and shot to the House floor in considerable haste. We protested this, but I have to say that, given the exigencies of the situation, the needs and the circumstances and the fact that the kids are very liable to lose their health care benefits and their insurance under SCHIP, we saw fit to bring the matter up. 
   The House will, I hope and I think and I am informed, have this measure before us in the next little bit. We will do so with a full opportunity of everybody to debate it, to discuss where the money is coming from, what the benefits will be, and whether or not the legislation should be passed. 
   It is my personal feeling that we have a chance here to not only save some 6 million kids who would lose all benefits, but under the legislation which has come out of the Ways and Means Committee and which was considered in the Committee on Energy and Commerce to cover not 6 million but 11 million kids that desperately need this, which will be important. 
   I conclude with an expression of affection for my friend and colleague from Texas.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CALLING CARD CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of an excellent and sorely needed piece of legislation, H.R. 3402, the ``Calling Card Consumer Protection Act''. This bill is intended to combat the fraud and deception that is rampant in the marketing of prepaid calling cards. Many of our consumers--especially recent immigrants, the poor, students, and members of the military and their families--are vitally dependent on these prepaid cards to keep in touch with family and friends. 
   This bill requires providers and distributors of these cards to make full, clear, and honest disclosures on the cards, their packaging, and advertising materials. No more hidden charges. No more cards that do not deliver the minutes they promise. The bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the Act. Violators would be subject to injunctive and other equitable relief to stop them from cheating consumers. If a violation is ``knowing'', they would be subject to civil penalties. In this way, the bill ensures that retailers who sell these dirty cards are subject only to injunctive relief, unless it can be shown that retailers knew the cards were fraudulent. Thus, we get the fraudulent cards off the market without punishing innocent retailers. 
   This bill maximizes protections for consumers and maintains a clear line between the areas of expertise of two agencies--the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The bill provides the FTC with limited jurisdiction over common carriers, but is careful to preserve FCC's jurisdiction over common carriers for all other purposes. The bill also appropriately excludes prepaid wireless services as the record has not demonstrated a need for requiring such disclosures. 
   Once again, to promote uniform disclosures on cards bought across the United States, it provides a narrow preemption of State prepaid calling card disclosure requirements only. It preserves a strong enforcement role for State  Attorneys General and public utility commissions. 
   Finally, the bill mandates that the FTC conduct a rulemaking to ensure that all stakeholders--the calling card and telecommunications industry, States, and consumer groups--have a say in the final details of the uniform disclosure requirements that this legislation promotes. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3402 is thoughtful and balanced legislation that is critical to protect some of our most vulnerable consumers. This bill has strong bipartisan support. I want to commend the author of this bill, the gentleman from New York, ELIOT ENGEL, for his fine leadership, and I urge Members to vote yes.

I rise to commend and express my great respect for the distinguished gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall), chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, and also to my colleague Mr. Green, a valuable member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
   They, working with the Speaker, have come forward with a good bill,  one which is going to move this country forward in terms of reducing our dependency on foreign oil and increasing our utilization and development of more of our own domestic natural resources. 
   This bill achieves the delicate balance between the need for increased production, aggressive conservation, and a greater use of renewable energy, a path that this Congress has established in last year's energy bill, and as I would note for my colleagues, we will be in business again next year. Last year, we did something. The year before, in the prior Congress under the leadership of my Republican colleagues, we passed legislation which also increased production. Next year, I assure you that when we confront the business of this Congress in the new Congress, we will again move forward on legislation. This is not a static matter. It is something which goes forward in an intelligent process, thoughtfully led by people like my good friend from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall). 
   Again, I commend my colleagues who have worked on this legislation. I recognize that it has more to be done, but there's always business to be done around this place. 
   I urge the adoption, and again, I commend my friend Mr. Rahall and his colleagues on the committee for the superb job they have done on this legislation working with our distinguished Speaker.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to salute the offerer of the amendment. The gentleman from Mississippi has shown extraordinary leadership, courage, and ability, and the body owes him a thanks for his efforts in this matter. 
   I also rise to thank the leadership for putting this legislation on the floor. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Mississippi is a commonsense, bipartisan proposal that will implement the historic Heller decision enacted by the Supreme Court, and it will restore and protect second amendment rights of the residents of the District of Columbia and elsewhere. 
   The Congress acts tonight under its plenary power over the District of Columbia, and one of its actions tonight are to assure the protections of the second amendment of the Constitution. 
   We've heard much falsehood and misunderstanding pronounced in the press and tonight in the discussion about what it is going to do. The Supreme Court found that the District of Columbia's ban on handguns was a violation of the second amendment, and it based that finding on a decision that the second amendment grants each individual the right to own a firearm for self-defense. 
   Like a majority of the Members of this body, I supported the decision, and I pointed out that the Court's ruling provided important guidance that would allow local governments to craft sensible, responsible measures designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and those who pose a threat to the public safety. 
   That remains the truth today and tonight. The D.C. council reacted to this historical ruling not by enacting sensible regulations but, instead, passed emergency legislation that continues to bar law-abiding citizens, residents of the District of Columbia, from meaningful access to the firearms within the second amendment. 
   I'm happy to hear that the D.C. council and the mayor have now proposed changes to D.C. gun laws that will begin to bring the District into compliance with the Supreme Court decision. I commend them for it. It came, regrettably, too late. These efforts do not, however, preclude us from acting upon the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from Mississippi, and again, I commend him for his leadership in this matter. 
   When the D.C. council's proposals, if they are carried forward as they say they intend to, are there, they, together with the legislation that we are enacting tonight with the Childers amendment, will protect the rights of the citizens of the District of Columbia under the second amendment, but they also will assure that the District of Columbia has the reasonable power to control improper use of firearms. 
   The legislation only does four things. First, it overturns existing D.C. gun laws banning semi-automatic weapons, including the types of guns most commonly used for self-defense, something which the Supreme Court said was protected by the second amendment. 
   Secondly, it overturns D.C. law requiring residents to keep their firearms locked and inoperable until the very moment that they are attacked. What a silly proposal, a proposal that requires a person to rush to the cabinet to unlock it, to get a firearm, to load it, so that they can protect themselves against thugs, bandits, murderers or rapists. 
   Third, it gives the D.C. residents a reasonable ability to purchase a firearm in Maryland or Virginia, a necessity because only one federally licensed firearms dealer exists in Washington, D.C.     
   And he operates without a facility that is open to the public. 
   Fourth, the legislation removes lengthy and burdensome registration procedures malevolently put in place by the D.C. City Council to ensure that citizens would not be able to access firearms in a lawful, legal, and proper fashion. 
   This legislation does not preclude the Council from in any way enacting sensible firearms regulations that comply with the Supreme Court's decision in Heller. The D.C. Council will retain authority to restrict firearms so long as those restrictions do not improperly burden the second amendment rights of D.C. residents. 
   Some of the opponents of Congressman Childers' amendment have claimed that this legislation will lead to more guns ending up in the hands of criminals or even terrorists. What hooey. The only people in D.C. that can own a firearm for almost all intents and purposes are criminals. Law-abiding citizens have enormous burdens in achieving ownership of a firearm. And so we have, in the District of Columbia, a well-armed group of thugs armed to the teeth, preying upon law-abiding citizens at their whim with firearms which they may have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule that will allow us to debate and vote on Congressman Childers' amendment to H.R. 6842: legislation that will implement the Supreme Court's historic Heller decision, and restore and protect the Second Amendment rights of the residents of the District of Columbia. 
   This legislation does four things: First, it overturns existing DC laws banning semiautomatic firearms, including the types of guns most commonly used for self defense. Second, it overturns DC laws requiring residents to keep their firearms locked and inoperable until the very moment they are attacked. Third, it gives DC residents the ability to purchase a firearm in Virginia or Maryland, a necessity because there is only one federally licensed firearms dealer in Washington, DC, and he operates without a facility that is open to the public. Fourth, this legislation removes the lengthy and burdensome registration procedures put in place by the DC Council. 
   What this legislation does not do is preclude the DC Council in any way from passing sensible firearms regulations that comply with the Supreme Court's decision in Heller. The DC Council will retain the authority to restrict firearms so long as those restrictions do not overly burden the Second Amendment rights of DC residents. 
   It should also be noted that this legislation does not in any way harm our efforts to stop criminals or terrorists that pose a threat to DC residents. Indeed, those criminals and terrorists already have access to illegal firearms. This legislation will, however, give law abiding residents of Washington, DC, with the opportunity to purchase a legal firearm from a federally licensed firearms dealer and keep it in their home or place of business in order to defend themselves. 
   I am happy to hear that the DC Council and the Mayor have proposed changes to DC's gun laws that will begin to bring the District into compliance with the Supreme Court's decision. However, those efforts do not preclude us from acting to pass Congressman Childers' amendment. Rather, the DC Council's proposals will complement our efforts here today. 
   In short, I urge my colleagues to adopt this rule today and to support Mr. Childers' amendment, which will for the first time in over 30 years give the residents of Washington, DC, the rights afforded to them under the Second Amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of a second economic stimulus package. This package comes at a time when the number of unemployed continues to rise, gas and fuel prices are continuing to fluctuate, and our financial markets are in crisis. 
   For many months now, Congress has witnessed our economy continue on its economic downturn. I was happy to join with my colleagues to support rebate checks for 117 million American families in the first stimulus package that Congress passed at the beginning of this year. However, I believe now, as I did then, that a one-time check does little for families who have been struggling paycheck to paycheck for months. Bolder action is needed, and I think Congress is taking an important step today to help our working families and to bolster our economy. 
   In my home state of Michigan we have been struggling with the highest unemployment rate in the Nation, now at 8.9 percent. Since 2000 wages have fallen in Michigan at a rate of 0.5 percent per year, healthcare premiums have risen over 42 percent, and we have lost thousands of jobs. Despite all of this tragedy, Michigan's economic plight has not received much attention. I am here today to warn my colleagues that without today's stimulus package, many other States may be joining Michigan's struggles. 
   Today's proposal includes a number of measures that my colleagues in the Michigan delegation have been urging our House and Senate leadership to consider. 
   First it includes language from my colleague Congressman Jim McDermott's legislation H.R. 6867, which extends unemployment benefits by 7 weeks in all States to a total of 20 weeks and will extend these benefits by an additional 13 weeks for States with high unemployment, like Michigan. I cosponsored this legislation because Michigan workers need these extra benefits now more than ever, and I know that this will provide them with he extra time they need to get back on their feet. 
   Second, this economic stimulus package provides $15 billion in relief to all States and territories through a temporary increase in Federal Medicaid funding. This money will ensure States can continue to provide healthcare to their low-income populations including children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly, without cutting important benefits. It will also help prepare Medicaid for the health services it may provide to the additional workers who lose their jobs, access to private health insurance, or both. 
   In Michigan we have witnessed firsthand how rising healthcare costs have hamstrung our manufacturers and employers. We know now that healthcare costs more than steel in a domestic automobile, and Starbucks spends more on healthcare than coffee beans. Further, as unemployment has increased, more and more families are relying on Medicaid to receive the healthcare they so desperately need. The injection of new Federal dollars through Medicaid has a measurable effect on State economies, including generating new jobs and wages. In fact, $1 million in additional Medicaid dollars creates $3.4 million in new business activity. 
   As an author of legislation with a similar one-time increase in FMAP, I know very well that an increase of this nature is one of the simplest, fastest, and best ways to provide stimulus to States and I applaud our leadership for including it in today's bill. 
   Third, this legislation includes a temporary increase in Food Stamp benefits. We know that millions of households rely on these benefits to purchase their groceries, however, when food prices have increased by 7.5 percent, Food Stamps do not stretch as far as they once did. Today's proposal will provide $2.6 billion toward increasing Food Stamp benefits, helping thousands of families put food in the pantry and dinner on the table. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for your leadership on this issue and for standing up to this administration once again. I know that putting together today's legislation was no easy task. However, our families desperately need the Federal Government to help provide them with relief and reassurance that we hear and understand their struggles. I am pleased that I will be able to return home to the 15th Congressional District and tell my constituents about the $25 billion in loans to auto makers the Michigan delegation was able to secure and a second economic stimulus package that Congress was hopefully able to pass and the President signed into law. I know that these actions will not go unnoticed, and as their Federal representative it is my duty to do whatever I can to help them through this tough time. I urge my colleagues to rise in support of today's package, a ``no'' vote on this legislation or a veto by the President's pen is no way to help our families in need.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Chairman, the amendment is simple. It's about protecting Social Security. It is about the fox guarding the hen roost. The fox is the new appointee who has been made Deputy Commissioner of Social Security, but who is unconfirmed by the United States Senate. The hen roost is Social Security and the care and concern of millions of Americans, retirees, orphans, widows, persons who are disabled. What we want to do is to see to it that those people who are in charge of Social Security and guard Social Security are friends to the system and not enemies. 
   Social Security is one of the most extraordinary devices in the history of this country. It is one of the cheapest and the best ways of collecting money, and one of the fairest and the best ways of disbursing it and seeing to it that our senior citizens are protected by their government and that their pensions and that their retirement is made dignified and worthwhile. 
   The President appointed a fellow by the name of Biggs by a recess appointment, and he was made Deputy Commissioner of Social Security. His name is Andrew Biggs. He has had his appointment opposed by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the chairman said this, ``because his support for the failed idea of privatization would reopen a settled debate about the future of Social Security reform.'' 
   The amendment simply says no money may be spent on his salary until he has been confirmed; a simple, sensible, decent and proper protection for our retirees. 
   Mr. Biggs has written dozens of articles in favor of privatization. He has compared Social Security to Enron and claimed that it was on the verge of imminent bankruptcy. He has argued that private accounts are the only solution to fund Social Security over the long term. 
   He has worked to promote the agenda of privatization of Social Security time after time. Listen to some of the words  which he has said: ``Social Security reform featuring personal retirement accounts doesn't send just one liberal sacred cow to the slaughterhouse; it sends the whole herd.'' This was a 1999 paper made by Mr. Andrew Biggs in which his thesis is that the dismantling of Social Security would lead to the dismantlement of all New Deal era programs. 
   What we are doing by adopting this amendment is putting Mr. Biggs before the Senate Finance Committee for hearings to inquire, is he in favor of Social Security? Does he want to privatize it? Does he want to abolish it? 
   This amendment will protect Social Security. It will protect retirees. It will see to it that we do not have the fox guarding the hen roost. It will see to it that the hopes and the dreams and the expectations of our senior citizens and those who look forward to Social Security as protection in their retirement years can be assured that there will be a protection for them and that their Social Security benefits will be there when they retire. It also is to assure that within the structure of Social Security there would not be an avowed and announced enemy of Social Security, of the program which protects our senior citizens. 
   This is a fight which has been before the Congress many times. It's been before the Senate. It has been before the House. The American people have made it plain; they want Social Security protected. They have made it equally plain that they don't want people in charge of Social Security who want to destroy the program or who want to send it, as he has said, to the slaughterhouse. 
   I think that this is an amendment which you can safely vote for, secure in the knowledge that you are protecting the concerns of your Social Security recipients and of others who believe that Social Security is one of the great and wonderful programs in the history of this country. And you can, in so doing, see to it that this individual is inquired of properly of his attitude with regard to Social Security, and that we can address the question of how Social Security should be protected. Certainly not by the insertion into the structure of the organization which runs it by a man who has consistently displayed hostility to it. 
   I urge the adoption of the amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. In so doing, you are voting to remove an enemy from Social Security from a responsible position where he can do a great hurt. And you are assuring that you are protecting Social Security for our constituents, for our people, and for our Social Security retirees.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 2900, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. 
   This is significant legislation, and in the best traditions of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, it is bipartisan. I want to thank and commend my Republican colleagues for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor, and I want to commend all of the members of the committee for their hard work, which was done in an extraordinarily friendly and proper fashion on the legislation. 
   I rise to inform my colleagues that the bill text before the House today contains three useful changes in the bill that was reported by the committee. 
   There is a section on citizen petitions that is designed to prevent or minimize delays to the introduction of generic drugs. In addition to good public policy, it also reduces Federal expenditures and completely offsets the costs of H.R. 2900 so that the bill we consider today meets applicable budget pay-as-you-go standards. 
   The other changes are two clarifications. One, that the Secretary is not authorized to order changes in the marketing plans or product sponsors; and two, that PDUFA fees can be used to carry out the bill's postmarket safety activities under the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies authorized by the bill, known as REMS. 
   H.R. 2900 has nine distinct titles. Title I reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a very successful piece of legislation. It significantly boosts resources to have new drugs or biological products reviewed through a thorough yet timely and careful manner, and gives greater attention and resources to postmarket drug safety activities. 
   Title II reauthorizes the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act, providing increased user fee resources for review of medical devices. The fee structure is broadened to both stabilize revenue and decrease the cost of application fees. 
   Title III is the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007. This will foster development of medical devices for use by children. It fills an important gap in therapies for one of our most vulnerable and important patient groups who are, after all, the future of the country. I commend my colleagues, Mr. Markey and Mr. Rogers, for their fine efforts in this title. 
   Titles IV and V address the need for drugs that are tested and labeled for use by children. 
   Title IV reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act. This title will provide FDA permanent authority to test and label drugs for pediatric patients. 
   Title V reauthorizes the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, providing incentive for testing and labeling drugs for pediatric patients. Together, these two pediatric drug programs provide for the method to achieve an important common purpose, better therapies for our children. 
   I want to recognize the efforts of our dear friend, Representative Eshoo, on both of these titles. 
   Titles VI, VII, VIII and IX represent the drug safety component of the bill. 
   Title VI establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration. This will foster public-private partnerships for the purposes of advancing FDA's mission to modernize product development, accelerate innovation, and enhance product safety. Our good friends and colleagues, Mr. Engel and Ms. Giffords, are to be commended for their work on this title. 
   Title VII addresses concerns about conflicts of interest amongst those who serve on the expert advisory panels that play a crucial role in FDA's work. Title VII establishes a clinical trials registry and database. This title will expand the amount of information available to patients, scientists and other stakeholders regarding clinical tests. 
   Finally, title IX represents a major enhancement of the safety in the drug program of this country through an active postmarket surveillance program with the goal of reducing the likelihood of another Vioxx situation and the reported aftereffects which went unheard. Congressmen MARKEY and WAXMAN made important contributions in this matter.  
   I wish also to thank my friend, the committee's ranking member, Mr. Barton, and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Deal. They worked with us throughout this process and brought forth good suggestions that make this a better bill. For that I commend them, and for their hard work I thank them. 
   Finally, I wish to recognize the outstanding work of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Pallone. His firm and steady hand and hard work brought forth a strong bill out of the subcommittee, and the House should applaud his extraordinary leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation strikes proper balance between new drug safety regulations and measures and ensuring consumers have the access to innovative prescription pharmaceuticals without undue delay. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2900 and ask for a favorable vote on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield the remainder of my time on this matter to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the subcommittee chairman, and that he be permitted to control the time. He will do a splendid job.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have always believed students must have the opportunity to earn degrees based on their academic accomplishments rather than on their economic situation. Today's economy demands a highly educated work force, which is why Congress must ensure we are providing educational access to every qualified student that wants to attend college. H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act, will do just that by making the single largest investment in college financial aid since the 1944 GI Bill. 
   I have heard from many of my constituents that the daunting costs of a college education are preventing them from achieving a college degree. They are not alone. Nearly 200,000 students are holding off on going to college or forgoing college completely because they can't afford it. In the last 5 years tuition at 4-year public colleges has grown by 35 percent, forcing both students and their families to take on increasing amounts of debt to pay for college. At a time when Michigan's economy and workforce is struggling, a college education should not be a luxury that is unreachable for middle-class families. 
   When the Democrats took the majority this year, we committed to making college more affordable and accessible. H.R. 2669 will do this by cutting the interest rate from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years. Each year 6.8 million students take out need-based loans and accrue thousands of dollars of debt while completing their college degree. This legislation will cut in half the interest rates on their loans, saving the average student--with $13,800 in need-based student loan debt--$4,400 over the life of the loan. 
   H.R. 2669 will also increase the maximum value of the Pell Grant scholarship by $500 over the next 5 years, ultimately reaching a maximum scholarship level of $5,200. As the Federal Government's single largest source of grant aid for college students, this proposed increase will directly benefit over 5 million low- and moderate-income students. 
   More importantly, this legislation will prevent student borrowers from facing unmanageable levels of Federal student debt by guaranteeing borrowers will never have to spend more than 15 percent of their yearly discretionary income on loan repayments and by allowing borrowers who enter public service to have their loans forgiven after 10 years. This is critically important because students today are graduating from college with more debt than ever before. 
   Many people may be asking how this will help those who are struggling in Michigan. In our great State of Michigan, over 143,000 students take out need-based loans each year. The average student has $13,256 in need-based student loan debt. H.R. 2669 will provide interest rate cuts that win save each Michigan student $4,240 over the life of their student loan. This legislation will also provide $513 million in increased loan and Pell Grant aid to students and families in Michigan over the next five years--benefiting over 200,000 students. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation not only because it will increase college affordability, but because it will help our workforce. Our economy depends on aggressive investment in our workforce if we want to continue to be competitive in a global economy. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, showing American families that Congress is committed to investing in higher education.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2798, the ``Overseas Private Investment Corporation Reauthorization Act of 2007''. Since its establishment in 1971, OPIC has offered investment financing and political risk insurance to American businesses and lenders, which are willing to direct private capital to developing countries. 
   While OPIC has proven to be a valuable tool for U.S. foreign and commercial policy, it is in need of some improvement. I am pleased that H.R. 2798 establishes requirements that projects be approved only in countries that are making progress toward adopting international labor and environmental standards. H.R. 2798 also embraces the necessity of promoting peace and stability in the international system by prohibiting OPIC from participating in projects in countries that are sponsors of terrorism, possess or have programs to develop nuclear weapons, or commit genocide. 
   I would object, however, to one provision in this bill. H.R. 2798 requires OPIC to implement a climate change mitigation action plan, which would include increased support for projects that use and develop clean energy technologies. The bill further stipulates that OPIC submit a report on this plan, as well as annual environmental impact assessments of the projects that it supports, to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. I respectfully suggest that these reports also be submitted to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, not only because of the committee's jurisdiction and expertise in policy matters related to energy and foreign commerce, but also because this would augment Congressional oversight of OPIC in order to ensure that its plans for environmentally responsible development receive careful and thorough consideration. It is my sincere hope that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will work with the Committee on Energy and Commerce to address this concern when H.R. 2798 is considered again during conference. 
   I would urge that the House approve H.R. 2798 and thank my colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their work on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, a bipartisan measure to increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over 2 years. 
   I am proud to say that my home State of Michigan is ahead of the game on this issue. Governor Granholm and the State legislature have already passed legislation to increase the State minimum wage. A total of 28 States and the District of Columbia have a State minimum wage above the current Federal level. 
   I cannot understand why some of my colleagues are opposed to a measure that will directly benefit 5.7 million workers. Moreover, this measure clearly has the support of the American people. It is our job to represent the American people and I am proud that the new Democratic majority is getting the job done. We will succeed in raising the minimum wage during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress--an accomplishment that the Republican majority could not--or shall I say cared not to--achieve in 10 years. 
   It is wrong to have millions of Americans working full-time and year-round and still living in poverty. At $5.15 an hour, a full-time minimum wage worker brings home $10,712 a year--nearly $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. 
   Since 2000, America's families have seen their real income drop by almost $1,300, while the costs of health insurance, gasoline, and attending college have nearly doubled. Passing H.R. 2 would mean an additional $4,400 per year for a full-time worker supporting a family of three--equivalent to 15 months of groceries, or over 2 years of health care--helping them to keep up with rising costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is an important first step in a new direction for working families and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act.  
   This much-needed legislation will make college more affordable and accessible by cutting the interest rate in half for undergraduates who take out subsidized Stafford loans. Because subsidized loans are need-based loans, the primary beneficiaries of this legislation will be low- and middle-income families. 
   In Michigan's 15th Congressional District, the average amount borrowed under the subsidized loan program is about $14,000 per student. If this legislation is enacted, students who take out loans this fall will save $2,300 over the life of the loan and students starting in 2011 will save nearly $4,500. This is a significant amount of money, especially for a college student. 
   I would like to point out that despite all of the arguments I've been hearing about how much this bill will cost, I am proud to say that the Democrats are committed to fiscal responsibility and have drafted this bill to fully comply with the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) budgetary requirements passed earlier this month. The PAYGO rules require any new spending to be offset in other spending areas. The costs of this legislation are entirely offset by six modest reductions in subsidies to lenders and guaranty agencies, five of which were proposed by President Bush in his budget for fiscal year 2006. 
   Our goal of creating a highly skilled and innovative domestic workforce begins with a college education. This bill is a bold step in the right direction towards advancing America's competitiveness in the global marketplace. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future on additional measures such as increasing the maximum Pell grant, which will contribute to our mutual goal of higher education for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. This legislation achieves a number of very important goals. First and foremost, it provides our troops and their families with the support they need. This includes a military a pay raise of 3.9 percent, which is larger than that requested by the President, a prohibition against fee increases for the military health care program known as TRICARE, an expansion of available health care services, and improved support for military families. 
   The bill also helps protect our troops by improving military readiness, and providing them with the equipment they need to keep them safe. The bill authorizes nearly $2 billion for unfunded readiness initiatives, and authorizes $800 million to provide the National Guard and Reserve, which are terribly stretched thin due to repeated deployments to Iraq, equipment they critically need. It also authorizes $2.6 billion for additional Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, $947 million for additional Up-Armored Humvees, and $783 million for the continued procurement and enhancement of personal body armor. This is equipment that will save countless lives in Iraq. 
   Finally, this legislation includes provisions making important changes to the government contracting system and adds increased accountability for those who are working for the government in Iraq. This bill reforms the DOD acquisition process, provides for a better trained acquisition workforce, and cracks down on conflicts of interest in defense contracts. 
   I want to thank my friend and colleague Chairman Skelton for his hard work on this legislation. It has always been the bipartisan goal of the Congress to ensure that the United States military is the best trained, best equipped, and most capable fighting force in the world. This legislation accomplishes those goals, and has my strong support.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (TMA, ABSTINENCE EDUCATION, AND QI PROGRAMS EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak briefly about the provision of this legislation which provides for a 3-month reauthorization of the Title V abstinence-only education block grant program. 
   On August 1 of this year, the House of Representatives passed legislation which made significant and responsible changes to the abstinence-only education programs. The House-passed legislation would have provided states with the flexibility to offer programs best suited to the needs and desires of their citizens and it would have ensured that Federal funds were being spent on effective programs that provide medically accurate information. 
   Sadly, those changes are not incorporated into the bill before us today because opponents of the House-passed abstinence language decided to hold hostage the important reauthorizations of TMA and Q1, in an effort to ensure that no improvements were made to the discredited abstinence-only programs. 
   Because it is absolutely necessary that we reauthorize TMA and Q1, the abstinence-only education changes were sacrificed for now. Let me be clear: I am dismayed that the House-passed abstinence-only language was omitted from this legislation and I will continue  to fight for those important, responsible, and necessary changes in the coming months.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (HEALTH INSURANCE RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 6908, a bill introduced by Representatives Bart Stupak and Michael Burgess. H.R. 6908 represents a compromise that achieves everyone's goals and is acceptable to all. As a result, the Committee on Energy and Commerce favorably reported the bill last week. 
   H.R. 6908 requires transparency in healthcare benefits. An insurer is required to explicitly and clearly state any restrictions and limitations on benefits. 
   You would not buy a car without knowing if it was new or used. Why should you buy health insurance without knowing whether the benefits you may need are included? 
   This bill does not change what benefits an insurer provides. It merely requires that restrictions be transparent to the consumer. Specifically, this bill requires: (1) that any limitations on benefits be explicit and clear; (2) that they be disclosed to plan sponsors in advance of  the point of sale; and (3) that they be disclosed to participants and beneficiaries in a manner that is easily understandable in advance of enrollment and after enrollment. 
   This is a commonsense bill, and it is surprising we have not required such transparency before. I urge my fellow colleagues to support passage of H.R. 6908.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 6983, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which will permanently reauthorize and improve the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. This legislation will put mental health and mental illness and substance-related disorders on the same footing as other medical and surgical disorders for health insurance benefits. 
   I would observe that we have much to thank our colleagues for. I particularly want to commend my colleagues, Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad and Senators Kennedy and Domenici, for their tireless efforts in crafting this important piece of legislation. They have been unwavering in their commitment to end the discrimination against those with mental health and substance abuse disorder. 
   I also want to congratulate and thank my friends, Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pallone of New Jersey; and Mr. Barton of Texas and Mr. Deal, the ranking members of the Commerce Committee and of our Health Subcommittee and a superb staff on both the side of the majority and minority of the Commerce Committee. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill as it will create true parity of coverage for mental health and substance abuse disorders. I speak as one who has had to deal with the problem of mental health within the family of which I am a part, and I know the terrifying and awful consequences that exist not only to the person involved but to the whole family. So I hope that this legislation will go a long way to addressing the concerns millions of Americans have with regard to this terrifying disease. 
   I want to urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and note that in accordance with PAYGO rules, the bill is paid for with a worldwide interest allocation tax provision that delays a tax break for American companies that operate overseas. It is a good bill. I urge passage by the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008, which will ban some of the worst credit card industry practices, provide important protections for consumers, and implement important reforms that will benefit working families. 
   The events of the past week have highlighted the problems caused by a lack of transparency and regulatory oversight in the financial industry. The same problems that have caused the current crisis on Wall Street also plague the credit card industry. Millions of Americans are struggling with the increased costs of groceries, gasoline, healthcare expenses, and other essential goods and services, while at the same time the average American worker has actually experienced a decline in real wages since President Bush took office. Many of these families are stretched thin, and have had to use credit cards to finance unforeseen expenses such as car repairs, or emergency room bills. Far too often these families are being forced to pay unfair late fees and arbitrary rate increases, or are being taken advantage of by high-fee subprime lenders. 
   The legislation before us today requires nothing more from the credit card companies than to treat customers who pay their bills on time fairly. Sadly, the credit card industry has increasingly resorted to unfair practices to exact late fees and higher interest charges from credit cardholders. In fact penalties have increased by more than 50 percent during the Bush Administration, and now make up more than half of the industry's $40 billion profits. 
   For example, this legislation will end the practice known as ``universal default,'' where a credit card company uses information about a cardholder's financial status, such as a change in his or her credit rating, to raise the cardholder's interest rate even though the cardholder has not defaulted or made any late payments to the credit card company. The bill will also ban what is known as ``double cycle billing,'' which is the collection of interest on amounts already paid. H.R. 5244 will also offer cardholders the right to cancel a card when faced with a rate increase so long as he or she agrees to pay off the existing balance at the rate they agreed to when they borrowed it. 
   This legislation is an important step towards reining in some of the worst excesses of the Bush administration's hands-off approach to the financial industry. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5244, and protect consumers from further abuse against the most unscrupulous credit card industry practices.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 584, legislation to designate the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DC, after our 36th President, Lyndon Baines Johnson. 
   An elementary school teacher himself, President Johnson had a deep appreciation for the importance of education. In his ``Great Society'' speech at the University of Michigan in 1964, President Johnson stated:   
   We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size. This means better training for our teachers. It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor. It means exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation.   
   President Johnson's statement rings true to this day. Now is an especially important time to revisit his vision. As the global marketplace becomes more competitive, it is becoming clear that education is the vehicle that will drive U.S. global leadership into the future. It is therefore vital that we renew our commitment to Federal education programs. 
   Some of President Johnson's largest education initiatives were passed in 1965, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--ESEA--and the Higher Education Act HEA. ESEA provided the first program ever adopted by Congress to provide Federal support for public schools, and HEA provided the first-ever Federal financial aid programs to help students afford college. In addition, 1965 saw the passage of legislation to create the National Head Start program and the National Endowments for Arts and Humanities. 
   For over 40 years, President Johnson's education initiatives have helped millions of children across the country achieve the American dream. It is only fitting that the Federal Department of Education building be named after a man who was a pioneer in his endeavors to promote Federal investment in education. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it.

   Charlie Norwood wanted this bill very badly. It is a good bill. We are delighted that we could bring to the House floor a good bill which not only does good but which honors its author, Charlie Norwood, by carrying forward his goals, his purposes, and his intentions with regard to helping his fellow Americans. I am delighted we can do this for Charlie Norwood who was a valuable member of the committee and who will indeed be missed by his colleagues in Congress on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   The legislation here represents the work of 10 committees. In the portion of the legislation written by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, there is not a single provision that a Member would feel justified in opposing. The legislation from the Commerce Committee sets appliance standards for buildings and other devices and appliances which, when in full force, will save 10 million tons emissions of carbon dioxide, more than the annual emissions of every car in this country. It promotes the development of the Smart Electricity Grid that will deliver energy to a household in a more efficient manner. It paves the way for more efficient use of electricity and  will make innovations like plug-in hybrid vehicles even more promising. 
   It improves the loan guarantee programs to the Department of Energy, and it makes the largest investment in our history in biofuels, along with other things which will move forward and see to it that the infrastructure is there to provide the necessary service. 
   Some of our Members are unhappy with what is not in the bill; some of them are unhappy with what is in the bill. I would observe that we will be having additional legislation which we are contemplating bringing forth from the Energy and Commerce Committee in the month of September which will address a large number of questions not now before the House, including the question of global warming in all of its aspects. 
   These controversies have been avoided so that we could produce a consensus bill that will pass the House and the Senate and be signed into law by the President. That bill is before us at this time, and it merits our support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS--Continued -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have a number of concerns about the resolution before us today. First, I am concerned that granting the power and authority to investigate Members of Congress to an independent, outside entity cedes away too much of the power granted to the legislative branch by the Constitution of the United States. We need to be clear about what it is we are doing today; we are altering the scheme created by Framers of the Constitution in a way that weakens this body. 
   The Constitution grants Members of Congress important protections that allow us to carry out our official duties free from the threat of investigation by an outside entity. Among other things, the immunity provided by the speech and debate clause allows us too vigorously pursue our oversight responsibilities without fear of retribution. Rather than allow some outside body to decide the standards that should be used to judge whether a Member of Congress is capable and responsible enough to carry out his or her duties, the Constitution vests that power in the voters, and with Congress itself. 
   I understand the problem that this resolution is attempting to address: People in this country are losing faith in the institutions of government. I believe that delegating the authority for investigating Members of Congress to an outside entity only confirms these fears. I believe that rather than giving into the skepticism and cynicism inherent in this view, we need to show people that government is responsible and that it can work. 
   If the Committee on Standards and Conduct is no longer capable of carrying out this responsibility, by all means we should find a way to reform it, empower it, and give it the tools it needs to uphold the integrity of this body. However, it seems to me that it would be unwise and unnecessary for us to tell the American people that we are no longer capable of policing our own. 
   Regardless of what we do here today, it will remain up to the voters to decide who represents them in this body. As the dean of the House, I have had the privilege to serve in this body and represent the people of my District for many years. During my time in the House I have witnessed politicians be indicted, be forced to resign because of public pressure, and be investigated and reprimanded by the House. I have also seen politicians accused of wrongdoing, or tarnished by the mere appearance of wrongdoing, who have been given the opportunity to make their case before the voters and return to this body. 
   In today's world, where the Internet and 24 hour cable news amplify and repeat almost any charge, regardless of its veracity, it seems unlikely that many Members of Congress will be able to avoid public scrutiny if they commit illegal or unethical acts. The question before us is not whether we want those who commit such acts to go unpunished, but what is the best way to ensure that they are held accountable. While I respect the views of those who believe an independent office is necessary, I cannot bring myself to agree. Ultimately, I will place my faith in the voters and in this body to ensure that the House of Representatives remains a strong and honorable institution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY FEE EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 781, the ``Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act,'' and I urge its swift adoption by the House. 
   This bill is identical to H.R. 2601, which the House passed on December 11, 2007, to extend the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to collect fees to administer and enforce the provisions of law relating to the ever-popular national Do-Not-Call registry. The registry was established by Congress to enable citizens to place their personal phone numbers on a list that prohibits unwanted commercial solicitations over that number. By any measure, this program has been wildly successful--more than 145 million telephone numbers have been placed on the list, pesky phone calls from telemarketers have declined, and the FTC's enforcement has been vigorous--but the agency's ability to collect fees to fund this operation expired after September 2007. Therefore, we need to act. 
   By agreement with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, we are sending the later Senate-passed bill to the President. At this time, I want to commend Representative Stearns, the sponsor of the House-passed bill and then Ranking Subcommittee Member, for his leadership on this important consumer protection issue. I also commend Representative Rush, a cosponsor of the House bill and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, for expeditiously bringing that bill, of which I am the lead Democratic sponsor, to the House floor last year. We would not be here today without their efforts. 
   I would note to the House that, as part of the agreement, the Senate today will take up and pass H.R. 3541, legislation also passed by the House on December 11, 2007, to eliminate the automatic removal of telephone numbers from the registry, thus clearing the bill for the President's signature. Current rules provide that telephone numbers be removed from the list after 5 years, thus requiring consumers to reregister their numbers in order to fend off telemarketing calls. Most consumers are unaware of this requirement. This places a particular burden on the elderly, the group most often victimized by telemarketing frauds. The House-passed bill contains common sense exceptions as well as requirements to ensure the accuracy of the list. I thank the Federal Trade Commission and the Direct Marketing Association for their improvements to the bill, and I commend Representatives Doyle and Pickering for their strong bipartisan leadership on this legislation. 
   This strong package of bipartisan consumer protection bills will serve the American public well, and will stand as a testament to what bipartisanship and good will across the Capitol can accomplish.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, today we are voting to extend for 1 year, through 2008, the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act. This act bars the use of arbitrary annual and lifetime caps on mental health services if they are not also used on other medical benefits. We need to extend this first good step taken by Congress more than a decade ago, but there is still work to be done to reach true parity in the treatment of mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders. 
   When the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 passed Congress, it provided only partial parity for mental illness and excluded addiction benefits from the equitable treatment other mental health services received under the bill. Left untouched were other important and potentially costly parts of an insurance policy  such as limits on inpatient days and outpatient visits and other out-of-pocket expenses such as copays, coinsurance, and deductibles. These limits result in denying millions of Americans needed treatment and/or incurring huge out-of-pocket costs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, before us is a very simple responsibility. It is a power that has been exercised exclusively by Congress since the very first Congress in 1789, when in the Indian Nonintercourse Act of that year, only Congress may extinguish Indian land claims. That has been the law ever since. 
   So before us is simply the question of whether we're going to accept or deny a settlement agreed upon by the tribes and by the State of Michigan to resolve a serious problem in the Upper Peninsula, in the district of our good friend and colleague, Mr. Stupak. 
   Having said that, what is going to happen is this legislation will permit us to resolve those questions, to enable Indians to resolve the land claims concerns that they have, and to allow the State of Michigan to resolve its concerns and to allow its citizens to remove clouds over the title on the lands which they own up there, and which will enable the Indians to begin to live a more orderly and proper life. 
   This legislation was opposed by my friend, Mr. Jack Abramoff, who left a rather spectacular and smelly legacy. And it is a chance for us now to undo some of the nastiness that he sought to do by preventing the resolution of these questions. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule. I urge my colleagues to support the settlement of these rights which were agreed upon between two Governors of the State of Michigan--Governor Engler, a Republican, and Governor Granholm, a Democrat. 
   And this legislation is not only supported by the affected tribes and citizens of the Upper Peninsula but also by the AFL-CIO and the UAW and a wide roster of other unions that are strongly supportive of this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. I want to commend and thank my good friend from West Virginia and my good friend from Alaska for their gracious kindness in this matter. 
   This is a cry for justice from Indians who have had their land unjustly and improperly taken from them. It is not a violation of Indian gambling law, and this is the only place in which those Indians can get justice. They asked for justice. 
   Now, you've just heard a lot of things, and there are a lot of people on this floor who are entitled to their own view, but they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   What are the facts? Under Michigan law, this is legal. Here's a copy of the vote and the ballot that was put before the people of Michigan. It specifically excludes this kind of transaction, and it says that it will ``not apply to Indian tribal gaming'' and then goes on to say ``or gambling in up to three casinos located in the City of Detroit.'' It doesn't apply. That's hooey. 
   Now, let's take a look. The claim is legitimate. The land was stolen from the Indians in an improper tax sale, and until this matter is resolved, there will be no peace in the area. The Indians will be denied justice, and land titles and land settlements in the northern part of Michigan will be clouded for years to come. 
   This came out of the committee 22-5. It has been heard many times. 
   Now, the legislation follows--it does not set--congressional precedent in dealing with Indian land claim settlements. In fact, the Congress, as mentioned by the gentleman from Michigan, has the sole power to extinguish land claims, since the very first of the Congress, and it follows precedents set by Torres Martinez, the Timbisha Shoshone, the Mohegan Tribe, the Seneca Nation of New York, and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe in 1983. 
   This is drastically different than off-reservation gambling. In that scenario, the tribe purchases land and then the Secretary lets them go down there and gamble. This is not so. As mentioned, it fully complies with the requirements of the Indian gambling law. 
   The land was not selected by the Indians. It was selected by the Governor of the State of Michigan, John Engler, and it was ratified by the Michigan legislature and by our current Governor, with a change in the law. 
   The votes of the people of the communities have supported the fact that if gambling is to occur in these communities it will occur. The people of the State of Michigan, the people of the cities involved have come out and have said they want this to take place. 
   Let us give justice to the Indians. The bill does not, I repeat, violate the will of the people of the State of Michigan. 
   And the legislation is going to bring desperately needed jobs to southeast Michigan, some 4,000 in my district, some 1,000 in that of the distinguished gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller). It is supported by unions that believe that this will bring good union jobs to Michigan and that it will help the Indians. 
   As repeated, there are two groups here who oppose this legislation. One group is of those who legitimately oppose gambling. That's a matter of concern to them, and I respect their judgment. The rest are those good-hearted folk who seek an unfair advantage. They want to protect and preserve their outrageous monopoly on gambling. That's what's at stake. That's all that's involved here; a bunch of good-hearted people are seeking special preference for themselves.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House passed last year, on May 24, 2005, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005 by a vote of 238-194. On July 18, 2006, the Senate followed suit and passed the bill by a vote of 63-37. The President then vetoed this legislation on July 19, the first and only veto of his 6 years in office. 
   President Bush's veto came in the face of bipartisan and bicameral Congressional backing for the legislation, as well as strong public support for embryonic stem cell research. The language before us today is identical to the language we passed on May 24. It is identical to the language that passed the Senate on July 18. It is identical, regrettably, to the language vetoed by the President. 
   By considering the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 today, we are reasserting our commitment and dedication and devotion to the passing of this lifesaving legislation. The time has come for it to be in law and for President Bush to join us in signing this legislation into law. 
   Stem cells are the foundation cells for every organ, tissue and cell in the body. Embryonic stem cells, unlike adult stem cells, possess a unique ability to develop into any type of cell, and their capacity to do this exceeds any other self which we are aware now. 
   Embryonic stem cell research holds the potential for developing treatments for many dreaded diseases, including Lou Gehrig's disease, cancer, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis and pulmonary fibrosis. 
   The unique properties of embryonic stem cells were not lost on everyone, and I will now quote from an individual who has thought rather considerably on this matter. On August 1, this statement was made: 
   ``Scientists believe further research using stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who suffer from many terrible diseases, from juvenile diabetes to Alzheimer's, from Parkinson's to spinal cord injuries. And while scientists admit they are not yet certain, they believe stem cells derived from embryos have unique potential. Most scientists, at least today, believe that research on embryonic stem cells offer the most promise because those cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues of the body.'' 
   The man who said this was our beloved President, Mr. Bush, and I think it is time that the House should listen to his words and disregard his veto. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass a piece of legislation that the public wants, that the scientific community needs, that will benefit our people and that will move forward scientific research of vast help and importance to our people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), and that she be permitted to control the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, this legislation represents a fair, commonsense solution that will give assistance to communities struggling to deal with the problem of vacant homes, help stabilize the housing market, and help low income families obtain a home they can afford and be proud of. 
   The Neighborhood Stabilization Act will make available to communities throughout the Nation $15 billion in new zero interest loans and grants for the purchase and rehabilitation of foreclosed properties. State and local governments have been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis not only because they have been stuck with the bill for maintaining and securing vacant homes, but also because they face decreased property tax revenues. Not only are these properties off the tax rolls, but empty houses drive down the value of other homes in the neighborhood which further decreases tax revenues. 
   Just as important, this bill will get these homes occupied by families who truly need them. A priority will be given to low income families, families who have lost a home through foreclosure, as well as first responders, veterans, public school teachers, and homeless persons. 
   This measure will bring almost $600 million in assistance to the State of Michigan at a time when it is badly needed. Michigan has been particularly hard hit by the President's misguided economic policies, most especially his failure to address the foreclosure crisis. I sincerely hope that the President, who approved a $30 billion bailout for the investment bank Bear Steams, will see to it to sign and implement this bill which will provide much needed assistance to State and local governments.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this legislation represents a fair, common sense solution that will allow homeowners to stay in their homes and help stabilize the housing market. I would like to extend my gratitude to Chairman Frank for his hard work on this legislation, which will be of critical importance in Michigan, where there are thousands of homeowners in danger of foreclosure. I am especially pleased that this bill includes legislation which I cosponsored that would provide up to $300 billion in new loan guarantees to help refinance at-risk borrowers into viable mortgages. In addition, this legislation includes important provisions that expand homeownership opportunities for veterans, seniors, and first-time homebuyers. 
   This legislation will help both homeowners and lenders, but this is no bailout. Lenders who participate will have to take a loss, but their losses under this program will be far less than if these properties go into foreclosure. Borrowers who realize a profit when they sell their home must return some of that profit to the government. The United States provided similar leadership during the New Deal using a program run by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, HOLC. Much like the HOLC, this program stands to save millions of homes from foreclosure at a minimum cost to the taxpayers. 
   I would especially like to thank Chairman Frank for his assistance in securing passage of a provision important to the residents of Parkview Apartments in Ypsilanti, Michigan. I have been working for four years now to try to facilitate the transfer of this property to Ypsilanti Housing Authority. Chairman FRANK and the staff of the Financial Services Committee have been instrumental in these efforts, which are designed to clarify Congressional intent regarding certain properties that entered the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, property disposition process prior to the enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act, DRA, but where the initial proposed disposition was delayed. 
   While I believe that Parkview is already subject to the grandfathering provision of the DRA, this provision clarifies that such properties should be considered ``pre-DRA'' properties, and that HUD should proceed with its prior disposition contracts as to those properties. This provision is one of many that was included in legislation that passed the House last year, and is now being included in this bill as part of a comprehensive housing package. This legislation is of the utmost importance to the Congress, and it is my hope and expectation that it will soon be enacted into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana concerning the fairness doctrine. 
   I am opposed to this amendment. The amendment concerns an important communications policy issue that is properly addressed in the authorizing committee. This is a classic example, of which I have seen many, of an attempt to legislate on a spending bill. 
   The fairness doctrine is an important, complex issue. It concerns many of the core policy values that Congress assigns to local broadcasters. It concerns the First Amendment, and localism in the media. It is, in short, an issue that should first be considered by the authorizing committee. For that reason alone, I oppose the amendment. 
   Even if the amendment were not procedurally defective, the amendment is entirely unnecessary. I understand from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman's office that the FCC has no plans to even debate the issue, much less take action. In other words, there will be no action at the FCC on the fairness doctrine. 
   It is therefore unclear why the gentleman--who must know this fact--is even offering the amendment. I hope my colleagues consider that question as they vote on the amendment. I will vote against it.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I voted against the original Patriot Act, I voted against the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2005, I voted against the President's Protect America Act that was signed into law last August, and I remain prepared to vote against any legislation that does not adequately protect our constitutionally guaranteed civil rights. I have some concerns about this legislation. I don't believe it is perfect. However, I am prepared to vote in support of it today as a sign that we in the House are prepared to negotiate a bipartisan solution that will end the deadlock on this issue. 
   I note that the President has already rejected this overture, and once again insisted that he will veto any bill that does not grant blanket amnesty to the telecommunications companies that are alleged to have assisted the Bush Administration in conducting illegal warrantless wiretap programs. It is unfortunate that the President has taken this position, but I can assure him that there are those of us who will not be moved by his intransigence. 
   I have repeatedly asked the Bush Administration to provide me with a briefing about the warrantless wiretap programs that took place without Congressional authorization so I could determine for myself whether amnesty is justified, and these requests have been repeatedly denied. After seven years of lies and obfuscation, I refuse to take the President at his word that amnesty for telecommunications companies is in the best interest of the American people, and I refuse to vote for amnesty until I am given the opportunity to review the evidence supporting it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes, and I yield the balance of the time to our distinguished Speaker for purposes of closing. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have had a good debate. I believe the Members have become understanding of not only the situation but of the legislation before us. 
   I want to particularly commend the staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee: Amy Hall, Yvette Fonteno, Christie Houlihan, Heather Foster, Jessica McNiece and Bridgett Taylor, who all did a superb job on behalf of the Congress. 
   I also want to thank Cybele Bjorklund, Deb Mizeur, Jennifer Friedman, Chad Shearer, Brian Biles, Bobby Clark, Debbie Curtis, Ed Grossman and Jessica Shapiro from the Ways and Means Committee staff. Their really valuable contribution did much to make this possible. 
   I want to commend my colleagues on the minority side, Mr. Camp and Mr. McCrery and Mr. Barton, and my special friend, Mr. Stark, and the distinguished Chairman Rangel for the superb job they have done. I also thank the subcommittee chairman in the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Pallone, for his outstanding job. 
   The legislation before us is really very simple. The issues before us are not procedure. Rather, they are: Are we going to take care of our kids? 
   For this Congress, this is perhaps the greatest opportunity we will have. We have three responsibilities to the country and to our kids: See that they are properly nourished, see that they are properly educated, and see to it that they have the health that they need so they can be meaningful contributors to the future of this country. It is not only a humanitarian and compassionate concern of this country, it is the future of the country. 
   I know the President has indicated that he thinks that this is bad legislation. I grieve that he has come to that conclusion. He has no reason to do so. 
   First of all, we have the pay-fors. We have taken care of the cost of this. We are seeing to it that, first of all, a modest tax on tobacco comes into play. 
   Second, we are seeing to it that HMOs that are getting as much as 30 percent more than other HMOs are going to get 100 percent of what other HMOs get, no more, no less. We are not taking anything away from senior citizens. I think we are just taking it out of the pocket of a few people who have too much in the HMO business. 
   Having said that, let's look to see who supports this legislation. I think that tells us as much or more as anything we can get. The NAACP, the AMA, the different health organizations, the hospital associations, the National Rural Health Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the March of Dimes, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Governor's Association whose meeting I attended last weekend in Traverse City where a major concern was how are we going to provide them the means that they desperately need to provide for the health care for the children under CHIP? That was on the lips, the mind, and in the heart of every one of the governors who spoke there. 
   I would observe that the Catholic Health Association also speaks to this because they have a concern that this is the best way we can take care of the children and we can see to it that we give a decent right to life to every American. 
   I would offer to my colleagues, any or all of them, a list of those who do, the organizations who are supportive of this legislation; and I point out that you will find almost every organization that cares about kids or health or the well-being of our young people as supporters of this bill, including the great American labor organizations, the AFL-CIO and the UAW. That should speak clearly to us of the needs. 
   I would point out that there are a number of misunderstandings that have been stated here. It has been said this is going to raise costs and it is going to raise the amount that is paid to individual recipients. Not so. This is a program which is going to be governed by the costs which were fixed when the legislation was first offered and first introduced and first put into law under the leadership of, for example, Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey. So it is not fiscally irresponsible. 
   The legislation is going to do something else. It is not going to take care of illegals, nor is it going to engage in any weird practices. If there are waivers given, and they can be given, they will be given in the same fashion as they were given before, and that is by this administration saying this is something that is justified, justifiable and proper and which will help kids. I will note that they have not been overly generous in giving those particular waivers. 
   So what we have a chance to do today, Mr. Speaker, and my friends and colleagues, is to take care of the kids, to support those who are least able to look to their own well-being and who are most defenseless and to suit them best for a healthy, growing adult life so they may contribute to a better, richer, stronger and safer America. 
   We are doing something else. We are seeing to it that we are compassionate, and we may best be judged by that because, in doing that, we are best looked at by being those who really care for those who have the least. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the CHAMP legislation. It is good. It is in the public interest. 
   I now yield to the distinguished Speaker. Madam Speaker.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I am going to make the same unanimous consent request, and then I will withdraw it. But first I want to make an observation here for the benefit of all of my colleagues and friends. 
   This is a very important piece of legislation. I am not going to defend the behavior of any Member here, and I am not going to criticize the behavior of any Member, but I am going to make an observation that I think is important. 
   This is a very important piece of legislation. Twelve million of our kids are going to have their health insurance increased or not depending on how we conduct ourselves today. I want to have a broad exposition. If you look at the time that we have to give to Members who wish to be heard on this, we are talking about a minute or 30 seconds, hardly enough time for any Member to adequately make a position on something which is important to him and to the kids. 
   I think that we have a chance to do a great deal of good for our young people. I don't think that it is excessive to say we are going to give enough time so that this matter can be properly discussed, nor do I think there is any benefit in denying our Members the time to do this and denying the Members a chance to be heard. 
   Now, I am going to withdraw this.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, the CHAMP Act, is a good piece of legislation. It expands and improves a most successful program, bipartisan in character, created in 1997. That program has cut the rate of uninsured children by a full third. Some States have been able to ensure as many as 60 percent of the children who previously had no health insurance. 
   This bill is about taking care of our kids. It is about taking care of the future of the country. Today, 6 million of our youngsters get their health care through the program. With this legislation, an additional 5 million previously uninsured children will be able to see doctors, receive immunizations, and get dental and mental health coverage. 
   The bill requires that children receive priority in coverage. It allows States to cover pregnant women, recognizing that healthy moms make for healthy babies. I am certain my Republican colleagues on Energy and Commerce understood this point, because our clerk read this bill to them. As I am sure all of us there will recall, all some 486 pages were to be read. 
   The CHAMP Act does not allow one thin dime to be spent on illegal aliens. You will find this prohibition in section 135 of the bill. Nor does it create a government-run health insurance system. Coverage under CHIP and Medicaid are provided primarily through private health insurance. All but two States use some form of managed care for their programs. Nothing here will change that, and the newly covered children will be exactly the same kind of child in the same situation that every one of the children now covered happens to be. 
   The CHAMP Act also covers and secures Medicare for the future. This past Monday marked the 42nd anniversary of President Johnson signing that wonderful piece of legislation into law. I was there. 
   The CHAMP Act shores up the Medicare trust fund, improves benefits for seniors, protects their ability to choose their own doctors, and these reforms effectively provide low-income seniors on Medicare with an additional $1,200 in benefits. 
   The CHAMP Act is an act of fiscal responsibility. Seniors in traditional Medicare will pay approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars in excess premiums to cover the overpayments now being made to HMOs, a great injustice. The things that my Republican colleagues are complaining about are that we stop that evil practice. The CHAMP Act also adds 3 years to the life of the trust fund by stopping these overpayments which are accelerating the insolvency of the Medicare trust fund. 
   I know that President Bush has pledged to veto counterpart legislation in the Senate that is much more modest in its ambitions. 
   I include the rest of my speech for the Record and urge my Republican colleagues to read it. It is an excellent speech.  
   The legislation before us accomplishes two critical goals. It will provide health care to as many as 12 million children. And it will allow our elderly to continue seeing their own doctors. 
   The CHAMP Act--the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act--improves a most successful program created with bipartisan support in 1997. That program has cut the rate of low-income uninsured children by one-third. Some States have been able to insure as many as 60 percent of their children who previously had no health insurance. 
   Today, six million children get their health care through this program. With this legislation, five million previously uninsured children will be able to see doctors, receive immunizations, get dental care, and other coverage. 
   This legislation requires that children receive priority in coverage. It allows States to cover pregnant women, recognizing that healthy moms make for healthy babies. 
   While I am certain that my Republican colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce understand this point--because our wonderful clerk read the bill to them--I will restate it for others listening: 
   The CHAMP Act does not allow one Federal dime to be spent on illegal aliens. You will find this prohibition in section 135 of the bill. 
   Nor does the bill create a ``government run'' health care system. Coverage under CHIP and Medicaid are provided primarily through private insurance--all but two States use some form of managed care for their programs. Nothing here would change that. And the newly covered children are exactly the same as those now covered.  
   The CHAMP Act also secures Medicare for the future. This past Monday marked the 42nd anniversary of 
   President Johnson signing Medicare into law. The CHAMP Act shores up the Medicare trust fund, improves benefits for seniors, and protects their ability to choose their own doctors. These reforms will effectively provide low-income seniors on Medicare with an additional $1,200 in their pockets. 
   The CHAMP Act is an act of fiscal responsibility. This year, seniors in traditional Medicare will pay nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars in excess premiums to finance overpayments to HMOs. Those overpayments will accelerate the insolvency of the Medicare trust fund. The CHAMP Act adds three years to the life of the Trust Fund. 
   I am well aware that President Bush has pledged to veto counterpart legislation in the Senate that is much more modest in its ambitions, and I have received my own veto letter from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. They stand on one side of the debate. 
   Let's look at who stands on the other side: 12 million children. The American Medical Association. The American Academy of Pediatrics. The National Rural Health Association. The National Council on Aging. The AARP. The Federation of American Hospitals. The March of Dimes. The Children's Defense Fund. The NAACP. The National Governors Association, including the Governors of New York, Michigan, California, Illinois, and Maryland, and the Catholic Health Association--which notes that ``the most important pro-life thing the Congress can do right now is ensure that the State Children's Health Insurance Program is reauthorized.'' 
   A vote against this bill is a vote to deprive six million children of healthcare. A vote against this bill is a vote to continue the plunder of the Medicare Trust Fund by bloated private interests. A vote against this bill is a vote to deny seniors in Medicare additional benefits. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for what's right for children, seniors, people with disabilities, and taxpayers: support the speedy passage of the CHAMP Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a strong supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 6460, the Great Lakes Legacy Reauthorization Act. I want to thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, Vern Ehlers, for sponsoring this bill as well as Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on the bill. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act has been an incredibly successful program. In fact, the first success story from the Legacy Act is in Trenton, Michigan. Black Lagoon, as it had been named in the 1980s because of the oil and grease that had accumulated between the 1940s and the 1970s, was renamed Ellias Cove just 1 year ago after the area was remediated. Without the Great Lakes Legacy Act, the $9.3 million cleanup would not have been possible. 
   Madam Speaker, the Great Lakes are a national treasure. However, to date, they have  not been treated as such. The Lakes have seen deterioration of water quality, the introduction of aquatic invasive species, and the contamination of toxic sediment, among other things. While the Great Lakes region has worked diligently over the past several decades to help clean up the Lakes, it is clear more must be done on the Federal level to implement the streamlined strategy already in place. 
   All of us representing Great Lakes' States were hopeful when in 2004 President Bush signed an executive order creating the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force. The task force spawned a coalition of Great Lakes' stakeholders, including local, State, and Federal Government groups, to implement a strategy over 5 years to protect and restore the Lakes. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration, as the group is known, which consists of over 1500 stakeholders, called for $20 billion in funding to implement its recommendations. Unfortunately, the administration's Interagency Task Force, in its annual report, recommended that the strategy be funded from existing programs. Madam Speaker, such a recommendation demonstrates how out of touch the Bush administration is when it comes to the resources and major efforts needed to restore the Great Lakes. 
   So far, the Bush administration has paid quite a bit of lip service to restoring and protecting the Great Lakes, but that is where its commitment to the Lakes has ended. I am reminded of that commercial from the 1980s--``Where's the beef?'' We all know what it is going to restore and protect the Lakes--money. Unfortunately, the President has not put his money where his mouth is and made the Great Lakes a real priority. The Great Lakes continue to be plagued by toxic pollutants that contaminate the sediment which can cause health problems for both wildlife and humans. That is why the House must act to reauthorize the Great Lakes Legacy Act by passing H.R. 6460. This legislation triples authorized funding from $50 million to $150 million per year for the next 5 years for cleanup of the nearly 40 degraded sites within the Great Lakes basin identified as Areas of Concern. In addition, this bill reauthorizes a non-Federal 35 percent match of Federal dollars invested into restoration efforts as well as $5 billion over 5 years for development of more effective clean up technologies, saving money in the long-run. 
   The past 8 years brought the Great Lakes little but empty promises from the Bush administration. Not only must we pass H.R. 6460 today, but we must also implement more of the recommendations of the Regional Strategy. I look forward to working with a new President--hopefully one from the Great Lakes region--who understands the importance of the Lakes and will do more than pay them just lip service. 
   Again, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 6460.

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3919, the ``Broadband Census of America Act of 2007''. 
   This bipartisan legislation marks an important step in bringing us closer to affordable, robust broadband service for all Americans. 
   Currently the Government does not adequately collect information on the extent of broadband deployment and usage in the United States. H.R. 3919 addresses this knowledge gap by improving the quality and quantity of data that the Government is authorized to collect concerning broadband availability and subscribership. Armed with this information, Government decision-makers. will have the in-depth information necessary to craft informed, coherent broadband policy. 
   H.R. 3919 calls for the creation of a national broadband inventory map. This map will depict, at granular levels, where broadband service is available. We are informed by the efforts of States such a Kentucky that have successfully developed similar maps. State-level experience tells us that this map will likely spur the deployment of additional broadband facilities and will be a valuable resource for consumers. 
   H.R. 3919 will also jump start efforts by local communities to improve broadband deployment and usage through the creation of grant programs to facilitate the collection of data for the broadband inventory map and local technology planning. These programs will help bring broadband facilities to communities that currently have little or no service. 
   This is a good bill produced through positive, bipartisan efforts. I commend Ranking Member BARTON, Subcommittee Chairman MARKEY, and Subcommittee Ranking Member UPTON for their leadership and contributions to this legislation. I am proud to support it, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (911 MODERNIZATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3403, the ``911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007''. 
   This legislation ensures that consumers using Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP technology can access the 911 system. It also requires the development of a national plan to ensure that the 911 system continues to evolve. 
   Consumers expect that when they place a call to 911 using a wireline phone, wireless phone, or any other type of technology, the emergency operator who answers will send the right type of first responder to the correct location in the shortest time possible. The ability to dial 911 and reach an emergency operator is so integral to our daily lives that we teach our children from the earliest moment how to dial 911. 
   As our communications system has evolved, so too has the 911 system. We have seen this before with the introduction of wireless phone service. As more consumers began using cell phones, Congress passed legislation to ensure that the 911 system could accommodate emergency calls made over the wireless network. 
   Over the last few years, VoIP technology has provided a new way for consumers to make calls using the Internet. H.R. 3404 ensures that consumers using VoIP service are able to access 911 as easily as consumers using wireline or wireless services. H.R. 3403 will give VoIP providers access to the components they need to provide 911 service and will extend the liability protections afforded to wireline and wireless carriers today to VoIP providers, public safety officials, and end users in relation to VoIP 911 calls. 
   The constantly evolving nature of technology can present a challenge to legislators. H.R. 3403 meets that challenge by ensuring that our 911 system continues to adapt. It requires the development of a national plan to migrate to an Internet Protocol-enabled 911 system. It also amends an existing grant program to allow funding for public safety answering points that are moving to an IP-enabled system. 
   As technology evolves, it is important that public safety communications also evolve. Too often public safety is left behind, burdened by yesterday's technology and yesterday's network. H.R. 3403 therefore requires that public safety representatives participate in the formation of the national plan. This will help ensure that public safety has access to the communications platform of the future. 
   Moving to an IP-enabled 911 system will also benefit consumers with disabilities. H.R. 3403 requires that the national plan address solutions for providing 911 and enhanced 911 services to members of the disabilities community who may not be able to speak to or hear an emergency operator. By including those representing the disabilities community in the formation of the national plan, we will ensure that all consumers are able to access emergency services. 
   Because consumers rely on 911, Congress must ensure that the 911 system is reliable. H.R. 3403 fulfills this duty by addressing the addition of VoIP service to the marketplace and by establishing a pathway to the future of the 911 system. This important measure has strong bipartisan support, including the support of the Committee on Energy and Commerce Ranking Member, Representative BARTON, and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Internet, Representative UPTON. 
   I commend Representative GORDON for his excellent work on this legislation. I also thank the other members of the 911 Caucus, and Representatives ESHOO, SHIMKUS, and PICKERING for their important and ongoing work in the area of Emergency communications. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3403.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, the President's veto of a bipartisan plan to help 10 million children is incomprehensible. It willfully ignores the needs of low-income children and the recommendations of Congress, 43 State Governors, more than 300 coalition groups, and the vast majority of the American people. 
   Unlike America's children, the President has nothing to lose by vetoing this legislation. President Bush has government-run health insurance. But millions of American children do not have any coverage at all. 
   It saddens and baffles me to think that the President would not want to make health insurance for 10 million children a positive part of his legacy. I pledge to keep fighting for this bill and to protect America's most vulnerable children. 
   This matter is too important to the children of our Nation. I support the Leader's motion to postpone immediate consideration of the President's veto of H.R. 976 so that we may provide Members time to consider the magnitude of this vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, today we consider H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. I first wish to congratulate Representative Slaughter for her leadership on this bill on which she has worked for better than 13 years. It has been a privilege to join her in that work, and I am delighted that it has brought us to today's vote. 
   Recent advances in research have made it possible to identify the genetic basis for human diseases. These breakthroughs, magnificent as they are, have opened the door to early detection and treatment of diseases and prevention strategies geared to a person's genetic makeup. At the same time, this information can also be used to unfairly discriminate against or stigmatize individuals when it comes to insurance and employment. 
   To protect individuals from insurance discrimination, H.R. 493 would prohibit health insurers, both in group and individual markets, from canceling, denying, refusing to renew or changing the terms or premiums of coverage based solely on genetic predispositions towards specific diseases. 
   Additionally, in order to protect individuals from employment discrimination, this bill would make it unlawful for employers or other hiring entities to use an individual's genetic information regarding hiring, firing, promotion or other terms and conditions of employment. The legislation requires that genetic information be treated as a part of the individual's confidential medical record and that employers maintain separate forms or files for any genetic information that they may obtain. 
   The House of Representatives passed this legislation a year ago with a strong bipartisan vote of 420-3. Unfortunately, the measure has been held up in the Senate, as usual. With these concerns now resolved, we are close to providing Americans the ability to undergo genetic testing that may indicate early treatment and prevention of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's, without fear of losing their health insurance or affecting adversely the conditions of their employment.

   Mr. DINGELL. I yield myself 1 additional minute. 
   The bill currently before us includes clarifying language intended to ease the concerns of some of my colleagues and is identical to the version passed by the Senate last week. These changes include a firewall between title I and II of the bill. The modifications clarify that employers are not liable for health insurance violations under civil rights laws unless the employer has separately violated a provision of title II governing employers. 
   The changes also make it clear that while individuals are protected from discrimination based on genetic predisposition, the authority of insurance companies to base coverage and pricing on the actual presence of a disease is not affected. 
   These changes broaden the base of support for the bill and allow us to bring it to the House floor with the expectation that it will be signed into law by the President. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this bill and for coming together to make this legislation a reality. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield back the remainder of my time to my distinguished friend from California, the Honorable George Miller, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, and that he be permitted to yield that time in accordance with his whims.

   Mr. Chairman, southeastern Michigan is the home for two major airports that accommodate large amounts of air and cargo traffic, Detroit Metro and Willow Run Airport. 
   Southeast Michigan has made strong efforts to develop an aerotropolis between the two airports, and we meet all of the tests that would be required for this, including rail, truck, highway, water, and other kinds of access. We believe that these would be very useful in establishing an intermodal access program which would complement these efforts by facilitating the many public transit plans in southeast Michigan. 
   I request at this time the assurance of my beloved friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, that he will be helping us on this, and I assure him that I will be requesting the assurance of the chairman of the Wayne County Airport Authority that he will cooperate fully in giving priority consideration to this matter to move it forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, today the House is voting on the conference report for H.R. 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act. I want to thank my dear friend Senator KENNEDY for all of his hard work on this bill. 
   Like our fuel and food, college tuition prices continue to rise, making a college degree unaffordable for many of our constituents. If Congress is serious about helping our country through this economic downturn, we must provide our young people with the tools and resources to be successful now and in an increasingly global economy. 
   Back home in Michigan, we are facing higher and higher unemployment rates. Many are forced to look to a new career field after a plant closes, and others are simply having a hard time transferring the skills they learned from their previous career to a new one. I want to do everything I can to help the citizens of Michigan's 15th Congressional District through this tough time and I believe that access to a college education is one way to do so. 
   Many of you have probably heard from constituents who have had trouble navigating the federal student aid program or difficulty filling out the extensive application forms. The last thing we want is to discourage anyone from attending college merely because they find the  federal aid process confusing or overwhelming. 
   H.R. 4137 proposes to streamline the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to make it easier for students and their families to navigate. This will be done by cutting the number of questions of the FAFSA form in half and allowing applicants to save their information rather than re-filing a new form each year. It will also allow students and their families to determine their Expected Family Contribution and their federal student aid package prior to college so that families can plan accordingly. 
   For those of us with children and grandchildren, we all know how expensive a college education can be. Back home in Michigan, over 143,000 students take out need-based loans each year. While this bill will not cover the cost of a college education, it will help to make the costs a little more manageable by increasing the value of the Pell grant. H.R. 4137 will increase the maximum Pell grant increase from the current level of $5,800 to $8,000 by the 2014 school year. More importantly, this bill will allow students access to Pell grants year round, ensuring that students who are going to school part-time will have access to this aid. 
   For those many students who do rely on student loans to pay for school, this legislation will ensure that lenders are serving the best interests of our students. This will be done by requiring higher education institutions and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct and ban all gifts and revenue sharing agreements between institutions and lenders. Lenders will now also be required to provide students with full and fair information about their loans before they sign on the dotted line, as well as be informed by the lenders of all borrowing options available to them when taking out and repaying loans. 
   This legislation will increase aid to our veterans and military personnel. The veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have served our country honorably and it is our duty to ensure that they have access to a college education should they desire to return to school. I know colleges across the country have seen increases in the enrollment of veterans; however, many do not have the resources to give the veterans the support they need. This is frankly unacceptable and this legislation will help correct this problem. 
   H.R. 4137 will create a scholarship program that could award up to $5,000 for veterans, their spouses, or their children enrolled in college. It will also create support centers on college campuses designed to coordinate services and assist veterans with enrollment and completion of their degrees. More importantly, H.R. 4137 will ensure that veterans are not penalized by their financial contributions to their GI benefits in the financial aid process. 
   This bill will reward students who enter public service fields in areas of high-need by establishing a $10,000 loan forgiveness program for individuals who study to become nurses; early childhood educators; librarians; teachers; school counselors; public sector employees; medical specialists; among other career fields. 
   Madam Speaker, as the federal representative of a number of great universities and colleges in my district, I want to ensure that my constituents are able to take advantage of the education these fine institutions provide. However, with Michigan's economy struggling, many students are forced to forego college altogether in favor of working to support their families and pay their bills. Over the August district work period I look forward to going home to these constituents and telling them that a college education can still be an option. I want to tell them that Congress is willing to increase federal aid for students. I want to tell them that Congress is going to make the federal aid application process simpler and easier for them. And at the end of the day, I want to tell my constituents that H.R. 4137 was signed into law. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, let us all show our constituents that access to a college education is a top priority for Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Paycheck Fairness Act. My dear friend and colleague, Representative Rosa DeLauro, has worked for more than ten years on this legislation to close the disparate pay gap between men and women. I thank her for her tireless efforts. 
   President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act 45 years ago. I, like many others, am left scratching my head, wondering why the wage gap has narrowed by less than half a cent a year. Today, women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, compared with 59 cents on the dollar in 1963. At this rate, it would take another 50 years to reach parity between men and women. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 1338, which builds on the progress of the Equal Pay Act by improving legal recourses for women who are being discriminated against in the workplace, providing more effective remedies for claiming punitive and compensatory damages--bringing them in line with those for race or national origin discrimination, demanding from employers a business justification for a gender-based pay difference, and prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their co-workers. 
   As a husband, father of daughters and grandfather of granddaughters, closing the pay gap is an issue I care deeply about. After cosponsoring the Paycheck Fairness Act for nearly a decade, I am pleased to be finally able to vote in favor of it here on the House Floor. 
   Over the years, I have studied the pay gap in depth. Representative Carolyn Maloney and I have commissioned two Government Accountability Office studies on the matter. The conclusion we have come to is sad and disappointing, that even when controlling for all factors, women simply lag behind men. This is most certainly not because women work less hard than men--we know nothing could be further from the truth. Yet, something is keeping women behind. This is why I am also a cosponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment, which is a long overdue amendment to the Constitution to finally give women the standing necessary to address their grievances. 
   The pay gap is too often seen as a ``women's issue.'' In fact, this is not a women's issue, it is a family issue. The simple fact of the matter is that it often takes two incomes to make it in this country. This is especially true during an economic downturn like we face today. When women are not paid fairly, our families suffer. 
   I am proud to be here today voting in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act and sincerely hope this critically important legislation is signed into law this year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4351, legislation that will provide critical tax relief to millions of middle class Americans. I support the Democratic majority's commitment to passing sensible legislation that will provide a solution to the looming Alternative Minimum Tax crisis. I am disappointed that President Bush and the Republican minority are opposing our efforts to pass this legislation. If this bill is not passed by the Senate and signed by the President, more than 60,000 families which I have the honor of representing here in the House will be required to pay the AMT when filing their 2007 return--an increase of almost 1000 percent since 2005. 
   I also support the Democratic majority's continuing commitment to responsible fiscal policies. The relief provided in this bill is paid for by closing tax loopholes that allow hedge fund managers and corporate CEOs to use offshore tax havens as unlimited retirement accounts. That the President and his party would side with a few of the wealthiest individuals over millions of middle class American families speaks volumes about their misplaced priorities.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of 2009 Budget Conference Report. I know many Members here today shared with me the opinion that the President's proposed budget was ``dead on arrival.'' This conference agreement upholds that opinion and goes a step further by rejecting many of the proposed cuts the President suggested in February including his proposal to gut billions of dollars from Medicare and Medicaid. 
   For the last two years the House has held true to its commitment to American families by increasing funding for domestic priorities such as energy assistance program, state and local law enforcement programs, education, among many others. And while it might be hard for this administration to grasp, this Congress has proposed increases in funding for domestic priorities without increasing our deficit. In fact, this conference agreement will balance the budget by 2012 and provide a surplus of $22 billion in 2012 and $10 billion in 2013. 
   What I am most pleased about is the commitment this conference agreement makes to areas that are of the most importance to me--Medicare, Medicaid, education, job-training and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, among many others. 
   Our veterans, many of whom have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, will benefit from this budget through a $3.7 billion increase in funding. This is a sharp contrast from what President Bush originally proposed--$18 billion in new fees over five years. These men and women have served our country honorably and with dedication and under no circumstances do they deserve to come home to a fee from our government. 
   This budget agreement also strives to address rising energy costs. Just this month gas in Romulus, Michigan, located in the 15th District, hit $4 gallon. The ever rising cost of fuel in our country is becoming more and more unmanageable for our families. This budget agreement increases funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, while also providing full funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which has helped numerous families heat their homes through the winter and cool their homes during the summer. Without a doubt this does not solve our energy problems, however, it does help families whose pocketbooks are already stretched thin. 
   More importantly, this conference report will provide increased funding that will help prepare our workers to compete in the global marketplace. The America COMPETES Act, which I strongly supported, created a commitment to increase training and funding for math and science education and research. This legislation upholds that commitment. It also increases funding for education that will help to address the rising costs of college tuition and the rigorous standards of No Child Left Behind. A successful workforce depends on access to quality education and this legislation will help our constituents with that. 
   The Democratic budget provides funding that is crucial for job creation. As we have seen here at home, our economy is heading towards a recession. From 2001-2006 alone, Michigan lost 235,000 jobs, many of them high-paying manufacturing jobs. With the rising unemployment rate, it is clear that we need to invest in our workers and new industries that would promote job creation here at home. 
   I am again proud to say that this budget proposal will follow through on our commitment to expand children's health insurance coverage by providing a $50 billion increase to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) so that we can provide healthcare to millions more children who otherwise would go uninsured. As we all witnessed last year, the President vetoed legislation expanding SCHIP on two occasions. In my home state of Michigan we have seen the number of uninsured increase to one million Michigan residents. Rather than making healthcare coverage less accessible, Congress must be doing everything it can to ensure that every individual who wants healthcare coverage has the means to get it. 
   The Democratic budget also rejects the proposed $500 billion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid proposed by the President. I have long said that this administration neglects our families and his proposal to cut funding from two of our most important healthcare programs is ill-advised. This Congress will not stand for it and this budget will not stand for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that the budget process is never easy; however, I stand in support of today's conference report with great pleasure. Not only am I pleased that this is the last budget that this Congress will work on with this administration, but I am also pleased that once again Congress has shown that it will not rubberstamp the priorities of this administration.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, six years ago, America awoke on a sunny Tuesday morning to learn we were under attack. Today, we once again pause to reflect upon those who lost their lives that day, and those they left behind. We remember the bravery of the firefighters, policemen, emergency responders, and volunteers who charged up the stairs of the twin towers or into the inferno of the Pentagon. We remember the passengers on Flight 93, whose sacrifice in the fields of Pennsylvania saved countless lives elsewhere. We remember the ordinary Americans who gave something of themselves that day or in the weeks that followed, by volunteering at ground zero, by giving blood, or donating money. 
   As we think about that day, and the way it changed us all, we must also ask ourselves whether we have done enough to honor the memories of the many victims of the attacks. I am pleased that on this September 11, Congress can finally say that it passed legislation to implement the recommendations of the independent bipartisan 9/11 Commission. However, we cannot be complacent, and must continue to improve the security of our ports, borders, and other critical infrastructure. Finally, as Osama Bin Laden's latest video reminds us, those who perpetrated the September 11th attacks are still at large. We must ensure that our military has the resources it needs to track down those responsible for the attacks. 
   As Americans gather to remember September 11, 2001, let us reflect upon the fact  that on a day that will be remembered as one of the worst for America, Americans were at their best. Maintaining the spirit of unity that brought us together in the aftermath of those attacks is perhaps the way that we can best honor the memories of those who died.

I want to say a word of praise for our colleagues from Ways and Means led by their distinguished chairman, Mr. Rangel. 
   On our committee, a lot of people worked on it very hard: Mr. Pallone, the chairman of our subcommittee; Ms. Eshoo, who worked very hard on the matter; and our good friend Mr. Stupak and the distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado, who now occupies the Chair, Ms. DeGette, who both did a superb job in negotiating language to avoid the difficult questions associated with birth and issues relating to abortion. 
   I want to say a word of praise for the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) who did so much. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an extraordinary bill. It prevents individuals from employment discrimination. It would make it unlawful for employers, employment agencies, labor organizations or training programs to deny individuals the employment opportunities because of genetic information. It requires genetic information to be treated as a part of the individual's confidential medical record. In addition to that, it protects individuals from insurance discrimination by prohibiting insurers both in the group and individual markets from using genetic information to determine eligibility to establish individual premiums based on genetic information of individuals or their family members. 
   The bill has been significantly amended since its introduction and has been refined through the work of the three able committees of jurisdiction. The version before us includes key elements that were reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and includes a useful definition change of the word ``family member.'' It is a fine piece of legislation. 
   I want to pay a tribute to my friend, Mr. Barton, the ranking member of the committee on Energy and Commerce, for his cooperation on this matter. This is an excellent bill. It should pass, it should become law. My private guess, my dear friends, is that it will exceed, in terms of votes, 350 or 400. 
   I also want to express my respect and affection for the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), who worked hard on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, once again, the House has before it an irresponsible, flint-hearted veto sent by the White House, which has participated in no way in bringing us to the point where we are today. 
   The legislation before us is critical to ensuring access to high-quality physician services for Medicare beneficiaries. If we fail to override this veto, physicians will face a 10 percent pay cut, which will jeopardize access to care for seniors and for the disabled. If we fail to override this veto, low-income beneficiaries will lose out on additional protections and benefits in the traditional Medicare programs, such as coverage for more preventive benefits.     
   Finally, if we fail to override this veto, we will miss out on an opportunity to begin addressing the most egregious abuses made by the private health plans operating under Medicare. Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans, one type of Medicare Advantage plan, do not have to sign providers to be a part of their networks. The result of this is that beneficiaries have no idea which physicians accept payments for their plans. And if the physician does not accept payment, the physician and the beneficiary are left holding the bag. These plans create tremendous uncertainty, confusion and hardships for all concerned, beneficiaries and providers. 
   I urge Members to vote to override the President's veto. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 518, the International Solid Waste Management Act of 2007. This legislation is of the greatest importance to our people in Michigan, and it has been sponsored with great enthusiasm by all members of the Michigan delegation in a completely bipartisan fashion. 
   Mr. Rogers, Mr. Stupak, Mr. Upton, Mr. Ehlers, Mr. McCotter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Kildee, Mrs. Miller, Ms. Kilpatrick, Mr. Camp, Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Walberg have all been important supporters of this bill. And I want to pay particular tribute to my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers) for his leadership. 
   I also want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials for his leadership and for his help and for the way that he has taken care of us in Michigan in making it possible for this legislation to be on the floor at this particular time. 
   The gentleman from Maryland is an extremely effective and able leader, and we are not only grateful to him, but also to our dear friend, Mr. Gillmor, who moved it for us in the last Congress. 
   The legislation is identical to the bill that passed the House of Representatives without opposition last September. In this Congress it was reported out both by the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials and the full Committee on Energy and Commerce by voice vote, without dissent. 
   I would point out that it requires the EPA to enforce the notice-and-consent provisions in the bilateral U.S.-Canadian agreement, an agreement which was signed by the United States and Canada in 1986 to govern trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste, and amended in 1992 to include municipal solid waste. 
   I note now that the administration should comply with the notice-and-consent provisions which require both parties to use best efforts, absent regulation. Unfortunately, the needed efforts by the Administration have not been forthcoming. Although legislation was promised to be delivered ``soon'', by the Administration it has yet to appear. 
   Michigan's ability to manage the importation of solid waste is crucial to the comprehensive and environmentally sound waste management that the State of Michigan wants to have. Since 1996 when Michigan first began collecting the data, we have seen a 350 percent rise in the amount of Canadian waste disposed in Michigan, going from 2.7 million cubic yards to 12.1 cubic yards. 
   As mentioned by Mr. Rogers, better than 400 trucks haul this waste across the bridges every day from Canada into Michigan. Not only is this waste an obnoxious substance, but it is a hazard to travelers and to our roads. It is also an environmental risk, a security risk, and a hazard to the health and security and safety of our people. 
   This legislation would ensure that the U.S.-Canadian Agreement is properly implemented and properly enforced. The bill provides criteria to ensure that the views of State and local governments are properly taken into account in implementing the bilateral agreement and the bill adds the necessary enforcement authority so that this can be dealt with fully, completely, and properly. 
   The legislation would also give not just Michigan, but all of the States, more authority to regulate foreign waste until the Environmental Protection Agency's rules and regulations go into effect. This is extremely important, as all of my colleagues in Michigan and elsewhere know. 
   I want to say that I am pleased that the House is moving forward. I commend my colleagues in the Michigan delegation for the extraordinary cooperation, leadership and energy with which they have addressed this problem. And I want to again thank and express my deep gratitude to the Chairman of the Subcommittee, my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Wynn) for the fine leadership which he has shown in this matter

   Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have long supported filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and strongly support the Energy Policy Act of 2005 provision that directed the Secretary of Energy to fill the reserve ``as expeditiously as practicable'' to the full 1 billion barrel capacity authorized by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, however, also requires that the Secretary time SPR acquisitions in a manner that does not incur excessive costs or do not appreciably affect the consumer price of petroleum products. 
   On May 8, I wrote the President urging him to direct the Secretary of Energy not to enter into any new contracts to fill the SPR during calendar year 2008. This, regrettably, is what the Department of Energy has proposed to do under an April 4 solicitation for royalty-in-kind oil to be delivered between August and December of this year. In light of the record cost of oil and resulting hardship for average Americans, businesses, farmers, and the general economy, I believe it would be imprudent for DOE to take these barrels off the market. 
   While there is no guarantee that putting this oil onto the market rather than into the SPR will lower prices, even such a modest step could potentially prick the speculative bubble now characterizing oil markets. In 2006, DOE suspended filling SPR during the summer driving season, and that is what is appropriate for it to do now. 
   While it is in the discretion of DOE whether or not to enter into new contracts at this time, the administration seems determined to forge ahead. Common sense would say to us not to take the oil off the market at a time of record high prices. Given the administration's apparent determination to pursue this course, the Congress must act and I support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5613, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008. This is a bipartisan bill, critically important to our Nation's safety net. The Committee on Energy and Commerce reported it favorably with a strong bipartisan vote of 46-0. 
   I want to commend and thank our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Pallone, and our distinguished colleague and cosponsor of the legislation, Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania, for their leadership on this matter. And I want to express to my good friends and the ranking members on the committee and the subcommittee, Mr. Barton and Mr. Deal, for their superb cooperation. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues on the Committees on Ways and Means and Financial Services for the splendid cooperation and help they gave us in moving this legislation to the floor expeditiously. The support of Chairmen Rangel and Stark were both necessary and very much appreciated. 
   H.R. 5613 places a 1-year moratorium on seven regulations recently issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The regulations would have restricted payments to critical safety net providers such as hospitals and nursing homes, as well as payments for graduate medical education training. The regulation would have reduced or eliminated payments that allow children with severe mental illness to remain in family settings, and payments to schools transporting poor children with disabilities. The Governors of all 50 States oppose these rules, as do the State Medicaid directors, State legislators, and the National Association of Counties. 
   More than 2,000 national and local groups such as the American Hospital Association, the American Federation of Teachers and the March of Dimes support this legislation. They know of the devastating effect these rules would have upon local communities, upon the hospitals, and upon vulnerable beneficiaries. 
   Without this moratorium, schools would be forced to lay off workers starting in June. Hospitals and nursing homes would be forced to cut off services and to lay off workers as well. In troublesome economic times, we cannot afford to lose good-paying jobs or to cut services that enable people with disabilities to be gainfully employed. 
   H.R. 5613 will postpone the implementation of these seven rules for 1 year, giving Congress time to evaluate the effect they would have on States, providers and beneficiaries. 
   I want to again commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including my dear friend, Mr. Barton, and Mr. Deal for their leadership and hard work on this matter. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 5613. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 322, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. Israel established itself as a sovereign nation on May 14, 1948. Since that time, it has been a close friend and ally to the United States. 
   Throughout the beginning of the 20th Century and in the aftermath of the Nazi Holocaust, millions of Jews from around the world found a home in Israel. Serving as the representative for Michigan's 15th Congressional District, my father, John D. Dingell, Sr., was an outspoken proponent for the establishment of a Jewish homeland and subsequent U.S. recognition of Israel's sovereignty. In my tenure in the House. I proudly followed his lead, encouraging close diplomatic, economic, and strategic ties with our fellow democratic nation. 
   Since its independence, Israel, the ``keystone in the arch of peace'' in the Middle East, as my father put it, has dealt with its share of crisis and wars. The United States stood by as its partner and friend and has served over the years as the chief broker in negotiations between Israel and its neighbors. It is imperative the United States continue in these efforts and continue to foster a close friendship with Israel, as a nation that shares our ideals and values. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution today, and honor the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007. This bill has many provisions which will improve homeland security, ensure safe navigation and enhance shipping reliability, among other measures. However, I would particularly like to draw my colleagues' attention to the ballast water protections in this bill. 
   As a member who hails from the Great Lakes State, I am perhaps more familiar than most with the havoc invasive species can reap on our waterways. I would note that in its 2005 report, the Great Lakes Collaboration stated that the world's greatest freshwater lakes are ``succumbing to an irreversible `invasional meltdown' that may be more severe than chemical pollution.'' There are currently 185 invasive species in the Great Lakes and another is discovered, on average, every 28 weeks! 
   Invasive species cost the Federal Government about $1.3 billion per year and it is estimated that 42 percent of plants and animals on the Threatened and Endangered Species List are at risk because of alien species. Aquatic invasives pose a particular threat because of their ability to spread quickly through connected waterways. 
   Ballast water, which is used to stabilize freighters, is taken on board before a voyage begins. It can often contain organisms which become invasive species when released in navigable waters. For the reasons outlined above, ballast water represents a significant threat to our Great Lakes. 
   To its credit, the National Park Service has already taken steps to prevent ballast water from spreading a deadly fish virus known as VHS in Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. But much more must be done to protect the Great Lakes and other waterways from the exotic species contained in ballast water. 
   H.R. 2830 takes these necessary steps. This legislation for the first time creates strong ballast water management treatment standards in statute and requires that ballast water treatment technology be installed on board beginning next year. In addition, the bill requires all discharged ballast water to be thoroughly treated and implements tougher standards beginning in 2012, with a goal of zero species in discharged water by 2015. The manager's amendment to the bill also includes clarifying provisions to ensure that ballast water management activities are properly reported, so that freighters can be held accountable for complying with the law. 
   I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR, for his hard work on this important legislation. We in the Great Lakes region are lucky to have one of our own, the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota, overseeing these matters. I urge all of my colleagues to support this critically important bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, on July 22, 2004, the 9/11 Commission released its final report on the 2001 terrorist attacks. That was 2 1/2 years ago. Since that time, we have had two elections and two Congresses. Yet only today are we beginning to enact most of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   This is a long and complicated bill that is far from perfect. The scope of the bill's language must be addressed before it is finalized into law. This is, however, an important step forward. 
   The inaction of the previous Congress and the current administration has left America vulnerable, with the American people questioning its leadership. Cargo remains largely unscreened. Not all first responders can communicate effectively. International alliances against terrorism are in shambles. Civil protections have been weakened. Any bill that attempts to hold the administration accountable for this state of affairs is indeed welcome. 
   The legislation calls for vulnerability assessments of our Nation's infrastructure and seeks to prioritize threats. It establishes grant programs involving the private sector and public safety officials, for communications, intelligence, and border protection, and encourages a common set of criteria for private sector preparedness efforts. 
   Some of these functions already occur within Federal agencies that regulate sectors of our economy, including energy, public health, telecommunications, information technology, drinking water, chemical and transportation systems, as well as other commercial facilities. We must ensure the bill will not result in wasteful or duplicative efforts that may cause further confusion, or compromise our national security. 
   H.R. 1 establishes a new grant program at DHS to improve communications among public safety organizations during emergencies. But true interoperability requires more than just spectrum and technology. Stepped-up coordination and planning among public safety personnel, accompanied by greater funding, are critical. 
   Congress directed the Department of Commerce to use its spectrum and communications expertise to administer a $1 billion interoperable communications grant program, which is currently underway. Recognizing the value of such a grant program, this legislation now seeks to emulate this approach within DHS. I hope that doing so will properly focus DHS on ways to achieve widespread communications interoperability. 
   In addition, given the Government Accountability Office's cyber security concerns, I fully expect nothing in this bill will distract DHS or other Federal agencies from properly preparing for and reacting to cyber threats. 
   Additionally, my home State of Michigan has one of the busiest--and most peaceful--border crossings in the world. Businesses on both sides of the border are dependent on smooth and regular transit between the U.S. and Canada. We need to consider the costs to the economy of northern border States as we strike a balance between open borders and security. 
   In the weeks following 9/11, the delays at the Ambassador Bridge--Detroit's only crossing with Canada--cost Michigan billions and forced factories to suspend production. Hopefully this legislation can speed the technological enhancements and personnel expansion we desperately need. 
   I also appreciate the independence this legislation provides to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, whose membership will be confirmed by the Senate. This should go a long way toward ensuring that civil liberties of Americans are truly protected. Without independence, opportunities for chicanery will persist. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve upon this important first step. As this legislation moves into conference, members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce with extensive expertise on these matters including issues as diverse as nuclear energy, the reliability of our communications systems, and the safety of our food supply and drinking water, will enhance these policies for the betterment of the American people.

   I also want to congratulate my dear friend from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) for his part in bringing this matter before us. 
   We honor here a great American, a real patriot, a distinguished President, a man who served with distinction in the House, where he had no enemies and legions of friends. He was an honorable and decent man. He was a friendly man. He was uncomplicated. He was good. He was a fine family man, and he was a man with whom any Member of this House on either side of the aisle could work with affection and with respect. We will miss him. He was a great American, and he was a man who left a great tradition as a Member of this body and as a member of the Appropriations Committee where he served with distinction. 
   A curious event associated with him is that he always wanted to be Speaker, but never made the grade. By a curious set of circumstances, he was the only man who probably could have been confirmed as Vice President under the constitutional amendment. And by an even more curious circumstance, he was never elected either Vice President or President, and yet he served in both offices with real distinction. 
   I will be praying for the repose of his soul. My wife, Deborah, and I knew Gerald Ford and admired him greatly. We extend our condolences to his wonderful wife, Betty, who was his loyal friend, supporter, counselor, and who served his country and him and all of us with distinction and who brought luster not just to her name but also to the name of her distinguished husband. 
   We will pray to God He be good to Jerry Ford, and I thank my colleagues for bringing this resolution. It is well deserved by a great American.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my dearly departed friend, Gerald R. Ford, the 38th President of the United States. 
   Gerald R. Ford rose to the Presidency at a time when the Nation was in crisis. Disillusioned by Watergate, nervous about an economy in recession, and anxious to get its soldiers out, of war, the country was yearning for a leader who could reestablish a sense of normalcy. So when Ford took over the White House after a short stint as Vice President, and a quarter century in the House of Representatives--even though we disagreed on some fundamental policy issues--I was relieved. I knew Jerry as an all-American hailing from Grand Rapids, Michigan, a fellow World War II Veteran, and above all, a man of extraordinary character. He was the right man at the right time to restore a divided Nation shaken to its Constitutional roots. 
   When Ford left for duty he was considered an ``isolationist''. When he came back, he was a committed internationalist. It was this change, which I think marks the type of person that my friend Gerald Ford was. Many of today's pundits will call him a ``throwback'' or a ``dying breed''. I say he simply possessed a remarkable sense of self, strong patriotism and astute common sense. He looked at the world, saw the conflicts, recognized the need for U.S. leadership, and changed his own opinion. 
   Too often today, men and women in public life who change their opinion are derided. Stubborn consstency in the face of rebutting evidence is now considered leadership. But this narrow definition of leadership was never the Ford model. He was a citizen legislator, a stalwart in a grand tradition that stretches back throughout democracy, from the complexities of the 21st century to the founding of Athens. He never sought leadership, it aways came to him. 
   During his 25 years in Congress, where we worked side-by-side in the Michigan delegation for 17 years, Ford worked hard for his party but also reached out and made many friends abross the aisle. His party elected him as minority leader in 1965, where he served as an effective leader and consensus builder until 1973, when he took over the Vice Presidency under Richard Nixon, replacing Spiro Agnew. 
   Not only did Ford take over the Presidency during one of the toughest times in American history, he did so as a leader whose political party differed from the congressional majority. Ford vetoed an unprecedented 66 bills during his Presidency. Nevertheless, the Congress passed some important laws with bipartisan support under the Ford Administrationl including the Community Development Block Grant, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Elections Campaign Act Amendments. 
   Ford and I worked particularly closely during his presidency on energy matters. Despite our differences, we were able to work together. During the Ford Administration we passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), which established the Nation's first fuel economy standards. Because of his self assuredness and his uncanny ability to think for himself, policy disputes did not deter Ford from working across party lines to achieve success. Nor did partisan bickering preclude bipartisan friendships: he played golf with political adversary Tip O'Neill and became good friends with Jimmy Carter after Carter defeated him in the 1976 election. 
   President Ford was devoted to ensuring that America and the Presidency were in better, shape than when he found it, and above all else, this was his most important accomplishment. His honesty and patriotism should be a model for elected officials today who are often too eager to create a sound bite and too reluctant to find common ground. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my fellow colleagues join me in remembering President Gerald R. Ford, and honoring him by carrying on his legacy of bipartisanship, honesty and integrity in the years to come.

   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, stock markets around the world are plummeting. Home foreclosures are ballooning. States, without exception, are facing budget crises. Employers are cutting jobs. Gas and heating oil prices are draining household budgets. The vote of my colleagues today can stop tomorrow's headline from saying American children are losing health care. This vote to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 will not only bring health care to 10 million children, it will protect children and families who may lose their jobs and no longer have health insurance. This is not lip service. This is health coverage. 
   The bill includes mental health services on a par with medical services. It requires dental services be afforded our children. It protects school-based health services and rehabilitation and case management services for those with disabilities. It provides outreach and enrollment grants and new funding for obesity program. 
   We know from a recent 2005 study that investing $1 million in State funds in Medicaid will generate 33 new jobs and $1.23 million in new wages in a year. This bill strengthens that safety net by allocating the funds that States need to protect and cover more low-income children. 
   It should be noted that every complaint that the administration has set forth about this legislation has been met. The bill passed with the support of 265 Members, including 43 of our good Republican colleagues. It passed the Senate with 64 Members, including 17 of our Republican colleagues. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto. Vote to secure health care for our children. It is right, it is decent, and it is necessary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I have great affection and respect for my good friend the ranking member of the committee, but some of the things he has just said would tend to indicate the lack of understanding that there is in this place about this legislation. 
   The committee has had three hearings on SCHIP. We have another hearing coming up next week. The subject will at that time be oversight, to find out how the matters are being conducted. 
   There have been a lot of misrepresentation, mostly by the administration. For example, the administration says in its veto message the bill covers illegal immigrants. Not so. 
   It says that children whose parents can afford private health insurance are included in the legislation. Not so. The ceiling on these kinds of children is $51,510 a year. 
   It also says that families with incomes of $75,000 a year are eligible. Not true. 
   It says that childless adults are covered. All of these will be removed by the end of this year under the legislation, and it should be noted that those who are now eligible under this provision are done so under waivers which have been granted by this administration. 
   Regrettably, we have here then either misunderstanding or just plain hard-heartedness and dishonesty on the part of the administration with regard to what this legislation does. 
   What we have taken care of in this legislation is children who are identical in terms of all of the conditions of eligibility of the 6 million who were covered under the original law and who have been covered up to this time. We have added to them 4 million children who are identical in every particular to those 6 million. 
   What is wrong with that? How is anyone here going to be able to justify to his or her conscience denying 4 million kids who are fully eligible but do not confront a situation where the Federal Government puts the money and the eligibility in place so that they can be covered? I ask my colleagues, how can you then accept this veto? How can you deny these kids, whose need is as great as the 6 million now covered, and deny that 4 million? It is impossible for me to understand that. 
   There are a plethora of other misrepresentations about this bill coming out of the administration, and they appear, unfortunately, in a veto message from the President of the United States. The bill prohibits States from receiving Federal funding if they exempt portions of income that go to families with incomes over $51,510. That is the ceiling, and those are families who have real need. 
   Let us meet that need. The number of kids who are going to be eligible and have need for health care is growing as this recession which threatens gets nearer and becomes a worse and more threatening reality. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote to override the veto. Vote for the kids. Vote to override the veto.

I had strong reservations about this legislation when it was first reported out of Committee, particularly with respect to the degree it appeared to give the Administration the ability to monitor the conversations of U.S. citizens without an individualized warrant. However, after reviewing the changes made to this legislation in the managers' amendment, I am satisfied that the RESTORE Act now contains adequate Fourth Amendment protections. 
   I applaud Congressman Holt for working with Chairmen Conyers and Reyes to address this issue. While this legislation is not perfect, I believe that it represents a substantial improvement over existing law. I realize it is likely we will find ourselves revisiting this issue again in the coming months when the Senate is finished with its own legislation on this matter. As this debate continues, I will continue to insist that any legislation I support contains adequate protections for civil rights.

   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3996, legislation that will provide critical tax relief to millions of middle class Americans. I support the Democratic majority's commitment to passing sensible legislation that will provide a solution to the looming Alternative Minimum Tax crisis. I am disappointed that President Bush and the Republican minority have opposed our efforts on this matter every step of the way. If this bill is not signed by the President, more than 60,000 families which I have the honor of representing here in the House will be required to pay the AMT when filing their 2007 return--an increase of almost 1000 percent since 2005. 
   I also support the Democratic majority's continuing commitment to responsible fiscal policies. Last week when the House passed AMT relief, it was paid for by closing tax loopholes that allow hedge fund managers and corporate CEOs to use offshore tax havens as unlimited retirement accounts. Unfortunately, the President and our Republican colleagues in the Senate once again sided with a few of the wealthiest individuals over millions of middle class American families. This speaks volumes about their misplaced priorities, and we are left with an AMT bill that does not meet paygo rules. However, I understand Chairman RANGEL--for whom I have the utmost respect--has committed to finding an offset for this fix next year as he continues to find a permanent solution to the AMT crisis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2764, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. While this is a vastly different package than the 11 stand-alone appropriations bills that the House passed earlier this year, it is a package that for the first time in over eight years focuses on the priorities of the American people. 
   Without a doubt the budgetary process is never easy. This year, however, the process has been exacerbated by the fact that this Administration has been unwilling to come to the negotiating table to hammer out the details of this legislation, instead barking orders at Congress--the people's representatives--from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Furthermore, this process has been held up by the inability of the Senate to pass these bills as stand-alone measures. As a result, Congress has no choice but to consolidate the remaining appropriations bills in order to complete our budget work. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped that this Administration would have worked with Congress to find a compromise that would have reflected the domestic needs of our country and the priorities of our working families. Unfortunately, the budget proposal the Administration sent to Congress earlier this year proposed cuts to many important domestic programs including: Medical research grants at NIH; Grants for low-income schools; Vocational education programs in high schools and community colleges; Homeland Security Grants for police, firefighters and medical personnel; Renewable energy programs; and Community Health Centers. 
   Yet after proposing cuts to these vital programs, the President had the nerve to request another blank check for the war in Iraq. 
   The truth of the matter is our troops have the funding they need. Congress passed and the President signed a Defense Appropriations bill last month that contained more than $450 billion in funding for the military. Moreover, the House passed an Iraq supplemental last month that would provide $50 billion worth of funding for the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, that bill has been blocked by Republicans in the Senate because it contains important provisions that would require the President to begin to plan for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. 
   I would note that recently, the Congressional Budget Office has reported that costs related to the Iraq war could reach $2.4 trillion over the next decade, even if the number of troops is cut by half. Furthermore, we have seen more than a billion dollars gone unaccounted for in Iraq due to fraud and misuse on the part of contractors and poor accounting by our own government. 
   By threatening to veto any spending bill that does not give him a blank check in Iraq, it is the President who is playing politics--playing politics with our service men and women and their families, and playing politics with critically important domestic programs. 
   The bill before us today is significantly better than what the President sent us at the beginning of this year. It does, as I mentioned earlier, focus on the priorities of the American people. For example, the bill invests in: 
   Medical Research: $607 million above the President's request to study diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's and diabetes. 
   Healthcare Access: $1 billion above the President's request, making targeted increases to programs like Community Health Centers to provide 280,000 more underinsured Americans with access to healthcare and High Risk Insurance Pools to help 200,000 more people afford health insurance. 
   Rural Healthcare: $147 million above the President's request to help 1,200 small, rural hospitals. 
   K-12 Education: $767 million above the President's request with targeted increases to Title 1, Special Education, Teacher Quality Grants, After School Programs, and Head Start. 
   Student Aid: $1.7 billion above the President's request for Pell Grants and other student aid programs. 
   Vocational Education: $575 million above the President's request for technical training at high schools and community colleges. 
   State and Local Law Enforcement: $1.2 billion above the President's request, to help local communities across the country. 
   Homeland Security Grants: 41.8 billion above the President's request, recognizing that fighting terror must be a top priority. 
   Highway Infrastructure: Meets the guaranteed levels set in the authorization bill and provides a $1 billion initiative for our bridges. 
   Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency: $486 million above the President's request for important investments in Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Biofuels, and Energy Efficiency, with a careful blend of new scientific investments and conservation efforts. 
   Chairman David Obey deserves our thanks for plowing through what many of us would consider unworkable circumstances and producing a bill that puts the American people first. 
   Now, it is unfortunate that Senate Republicans have chosen to give the President the blank check he requested in terms of war funding. I cannot, however, in good conscience, hold the rest of the federal government--and the above investments--hostage to Iraq funding. Instead, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the coming year to bring an end the President's failed Iraq policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is the duty of Congress to pass spending legislation each year, and it is a duty we take very seriously. I would like to take just a moment to remind President Bush that Congress is a co-equal branch of government. Our founding fathers intended that no one branch should set the course for our country, and in fact compromise has long been one of the hallmarks of our government. It is time that the Administration recognizes that a seat at the negotiating table can accomplish much more than the wave of the veto pen.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CAMERON GULBRANSEN KIDS TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the K.T. Safety Act of 2007. This is another example  of commonsense legislation, bipartisan approach to regulating an industry and adequately protecting our people and our children. 
   I want to commend Representative Schakowsky and Senator Clinton for working with me and with the able and distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Rush, in achieving this compromise. 
   I cannot praise too highly the cooperation and the assistance of our good friends on the other side of the aisle, Ranking Members BARTON and STEARNS, for their fine support and for the very cooperative way in which they have worked with us, and I thank them and salute them for that. 
   The legislation requires the Department of Transportation to issue regulations to reduce injury and death for nontraffic accidents involving automobiles, particularly to protect children. This is the right thing to do, and it must be, and under this legislation will be, implemented in a responsible manner. 
   The bill has the support of safety advocates, including Public Citizen and the Advocates for Auto and Highway Safety, as well as the automobile manufacturers. 
   This is an important bill for our children, including Franklin Dean Beedle Atizado whose mother worked on this legislation. 
   I urge its swift passage, and I do again commend its author, Representative Schakowsky, for her remarkable leadership in this matter.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend for yielding to me. 
   I want to express my commendations to the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Rush, for his outstanding leadership in this. I am proud, indeed, of your work here. I also want to say a word of praise to my dear friend, the chairman and the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Mr. Barton, and also Mr. Stearns, who have served so well. Working with them has been a privilege and a pleasure. I want to salute them for what they have accomplished. 
   I also want to salute the staff. We have on this committee, on both sides of the aisle, a superb staff. I will not mention all of their names, but I do want to express my appreciation to Consuela Washington for the outstanding leadership she showed in the very difficult work that was done here. But that doesn't demean any member of the staff on either side of the aisle. They are superb, dedicated, wonderful public servants, and we owe them a great debt of thanks. 
   H.R. 4040 is a superb piece of legislation. Is it perfect? No. But it's as good as can ever be achieved in this place. It shows that the House of Representatives can work together, and in a 51-0 vote we have established that the Commerce Committee still carries forward its traditions of working well together and moving forward the business of the House in a proper, bipartisan fashion. In that, we may all, indeed, be proud. It shows a real vigorous collaborative effort by all members of the committee to craft a commonsense solution to the consumer safety problems that have received so much public attention in the past year. 
   We have developed, with input from government, consumer advocate groups and industry stakeholders, a bill which represents a comprehensive approach to improving consumer safety. Most importantly, the bill contains a very significant reauthorization, the first in 15 years at CPSC, and it gives that agency remarkably enhanced tools to enforce the compliance of both domestic and imported consumer products with laws and regulations that will enable the CPSC to do a much better job of protecting our Nation's people and our children. 
   I want to conclude, again, by thanking my good friends and colleagues who have worked so hard on this. I want to comment on the fine works of Representative DeGette, Representative Schakowsky, Representative Capps, and Representative Harman, who provided extraordinarily fine leadership to us as this matter went through the committee. 
   Again, I want to stress what a pleasure it has been to work with the chairman of the subcommittee, the ranking minority member of both the full committee and the subcommittee, and my gratitude to all of the members for the extraordinary way in which they have put together a piece of legislation in which this body may indeed be proud. 
   There will be some carping about the legislation, but I remind all that the perfect good is oft times the enemy of the good. We are moving forward speedily and well to protect our consumers in a proper fashion and to do so in a timely fashion and in a way which ensures not only the protection of the people, but the protection of the people in a timely and speedy fashion and a proper response to the concerns that all have set forward. I, again, thank my colleagues.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (QI PROGRAM SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I support S. 3560, the ``QI Supplemental Funding Act of 2008''. The Qualified Individuals Program (QI) is a program within Medicaid that helps low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities pay their Medicare Part B premium. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 extended the funding for the QI program through December 2009. 
   Projections, however, regarding the amount of funding necessary to ensure continuation of this program through next year were incorrect. Without Congressional action to add an additional $45 million to the QI program, seniors and individuals with disabilities who have an income as low as $12,500 will be in jeopardy of losing this needed assistance. 
   The cost of this provision is fully offset with a provision that requires States to improve their Medicaid eligibility determinations by using the Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) interstate match. PARIS helps States share information regarding public assistance programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Food Stamps, and Medicaid, to identify individuals or families who may be receiving benefit payments in more than one State. 
   Similarly, S. 3560 includes a clarification to ensure that the Medicaid Integrity Program created in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, to operate as intended. The Medicaid Integrity Program performs audits and educates providers, Federal and State employees, and others on payment integrity and quality of care initiatives. The provision would allow for Federal reimbursement of state employees for these program integrity initiatives. 
   Finally, this package includes a provision which states that any antibiotic that was the subject of an application submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, but was not approved, can get the three-year and/or five-year ``Hatch/Waxman exclusivity'' or a patent term extension. 
   I urge all my colleagues in the House to vote in favor of S. 3560.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the thoroughly bipartisan legislation underlying this motion. I begin with a commendation to my good friend from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield) and to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Mr. Barton, the ranking minority member, and the other members of the subcommittee and full committee who have worked so hard on this legislation on both sides of the aisle. 
   I would observe that this is a thoroughly bipartisan piece of legislation. It passed out of the committee 51-0, and it passed the House 407-0. It is one of the most important consumer protection bills to come before this House in this Congress. It is crucially important for us to have such legislation signed into law this year. And I want to point out that without it, people will remain at risk from dangerous products and from an important Federal regulator who will remain both underfunded and incapable of acting properly to take care of consumers' legitimate concerns with regard to the safety of all manner of products from toys from the very beginning of life right through the time that we enter the graveyard. 
   On December 19, 2007, the House passed this legislation then without a dissenting vote. It represents extraordinary work by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and it shows how bipartisanship can function, and it shows how an excellent staff on both sides of the aisle working together can bring before us legislation that is in the broad overall public interest. The Senate substituted its version of the bill on March 6, 2008. Some elements of the Senate bill are problematic, but others are indeed worthy of serious consideration by the conference committee. The differences between the two bills are outweighed by their similarities. There is no reason why the House conferees should not return here in short order with a workable, balanced, and strong conference report deserving the full support of the House and upon which I intend to work closely with my good friends on the minority side, as we have so far. 
   I want to remind my colleagues what the House bill does. It bans lead beyond the most minute amount in products intended for children under 12 years of age. It mandates premarket testing by certified laboratories for lead and other hazards in children's products, and it sees that those laboratories are properly qualified and able to carry out their important responsibilities. It places requirements on manufacturers to enhance recalls. It empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, to share information about dangerous products immediately. It requires CPSC to provide public access to a database of serious injuries and deaths caused by consumer products, but it does so requiring also that the information be truthful, correct, and properly verified. It prohibits the sale and export of recalled products. It ensures that CPSC effectively shares information with the States. And it bans industry-sponsored travel by CPSC Commissioners and their staff. 
   I want to observe that the motion is a good one. I support it. I commend my  good friend from Kentucky for his offering of it and for his leadership in the handling of this legislation. 
   I again want to pay my respects and compliments to my colleagues on the Republican side and to my colleagues on this side for the outstanding way in which they have put together this legislation. 
   I urge that the House support the motion to instruct offered by my good friend from Kentucky. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTION WEEK -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is pleased to bring to the floor H. Res. 94, supporting the goals and ideals of National Consumer Protection Week. We commend Representatives Hinojosa and Biggert for authoring the resolution. 
   Under Rule X, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is the authorizing Committee for the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC, which administers over 40 Federal statutes under our purview, is the lead Federal consumer protection agency. The FTC also administers a handful of financial consumer protection laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. This has been and remains an effective model. 
   The Committee that I am honored to lead has a long and proud tradition of consumer protection. It has mandated and overseen major initiatives to rid the markets of unsafe, and in some cases deadly, children's toys and other products. 
   It has taken legislative action to establish the national Do Not Call List, a giant step forward in lessening annoying telemarketing calls to consumer homes. It also has responsibility for the CAN-SPAM law aimed at curbing the volume of junk e-mail polluting and slowing down Internet commerce. 
   It is the lead Committee on privacy. Two of our Members, Ranking Member Joe Barton and Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet Chairman Ed Markey, are co-founders of the Privacy Caucus. Together, we wrote the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that protects the most intimate details of American lives. We have begun bipartisan discussions with the Committee on Ways and Means for the design and operation of privacy and security protections for groundbreaking health information technology legislation that we hope to have enacted in this Congress. We authored the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that protect financial information. 
   Later this week, we will be reintroducing four major privacy bills--legislation regarding spyware, pretexting, data security, and Social Security number protection--that were reported unanimously by the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the 109th Congress (and in the case of spyware, passed the House). We intend to resolve jurisdictional issues with other Committees where they exist. We will also continue to work with consumer groups, technology experts, and industry groups to enact protections that are the most effective possible for both consumers and businesses. 
   We work hard to live the goals of National Consumer Protection Week. All too often the marketplace takes on the Darwinian tone of ``survival of the fittest'' with John Q. Public trampled in the process. It is fitting that we reflect on our responsibility to ensure transparency and fair treatment in the marketplace for the people who elect us. We salute the FTC, the Better Business Bureau, and consumer groups for their hard work all year-round on behalf of the American consumer. The Committee on Energy and Commerce intends to continue to live up to its reputation for fair and balanced laws and vigorous oversight on consumer protection issues. In the words of the Beatitudes: ``Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for what is right for they shall be satisfied.''

   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day and to show my support for its goals and ideals. 
   Domestically, the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States continues to have a disproportionate impact on African Americans in terms of illness, survival times, and deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death for African Americans. 
   Each year, the 7th of February marks National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, a national community-wide effort to build capacity and increase awareness of HIV prevention, testing, education, treatment, and support among African Americans, who are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS infection. National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day reminds us of the uneven effect of HIV/AIDS on African Americans and provides us with an opportunity to renew our commitment to the promise of finding a cure. 
   We must do more than just bring attention to this epidemic. We must also remain vigilantly committed to prevention programs and to finding a cure for HIV/AIDS. 
   I invite people throughout the Nation to learn more about HIV/AIDS. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia, and I congratulate him on the way he is handling this legislation. We are proud of him and his service. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is critical to ensuring high quality physician services for Medicare beneficiaries. If you want to cabal about that, you're making a great mistake. If this legislation fails, physicians are going to face a 10 percent pay cut, and that is going to drive them out of Medicare and it's going to threaten the security and the health care of senior citizens and the disabled. 
   At the same time, this legislation provides additional protections for low-income beneficiaries, adds benefits to the traditional Medicare program, such as coverage for more preventive benefits. It will also address the Medicare drug benefit and make it work better for pharmacists and therefore seniors. 
   Finally, the legislation addresses one of the most egregious problems, and that is private plans operating in Medicare. Private Fee-for-Service plans, or PFFS plans, which is one type of Medicare Advantage plan. There, they are cutting a fat hog at the expense of the public. If you do away with that particular vice, you will find you are making it more solvent over a long period of time and you are using a mechanism which will help our senior citizens to know that their Medicare is protected and seeing to it that the doctors are there to provide the care that is needed. We are also assuring that the pharmacists are able to stay in this business by addressing a significant hurt that they are undergoing. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and not to cabal about the perfection of the process.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (LEAD-SAFE HOUSING FOR KIDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I want to extend my appreciation to the gentleman from Massachusetts, Chairman FRANK, for his cooperation in working out issues related to the bill's definition of ``elevated intervention blood lead level''. I also commend him for his help in maintaining the relationship between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in carrying out the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, as well as preserving the respective roles of the health-based agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in making recommendations regarding the environmental intervention blood lead level, and the EPA in establishing that level under section 403 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. 
   I have strong concerns, however, about a provision that was not in the original bill and was added during the Financial Services committee process. This provision would only provide the benefits of the new protective blood lead level recommended by the CDC in the bill to children, including children in public housing  agencies, in those instances in which the Federal Government pays for the cost of compliance. I doubt whether the Federal resources budgeted or appropriated will ever be adequate to protect all children who need to be protected from exposure to lead-based paint at the recommended CDC level. All children should have the same level of health protection from lead hazards. This level of health protection should not depend on where a child lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Chairman, I have always said that the working men and women of Michigan are my top priority. I believe that every working family deserves access to a quality education, strong healthcare, jobs that are safe for its workers and secure retirement plans. Today the House will consider the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill, H.R. 3043, which will fund programs families need and rely on. I rise in support of this legislation because I believe it will provide our families with healthy and secure environment in which to raise their children. 
   By 2014, nearly half of nation's growing occupations will require higher education. If we want to help families succeed and help children prepare for work in the global marketplace, then we must help them earn a college degree. H.R. 3043 will provide the Department of Education with $61.7 billion, which is $4.2 billion or 7.4 percent above 2007 funding. In addition, this legislation will provide $2 billion, a 14.6 percent increase above 2007, in funding for Pell Grants to raise the maximum Pell grant by $390 to $4,700, benefiting over 5.5 million students. 
   This legislation will also help prepare our students for college by providing $2 billion for No Child Left Behind, an 8.4 percent increase above 2007. Specifically, $1.9 billion will go towards Title I grants, which benefit nearly 55,000 disadvantaged students in preschool, elementary and secondary levels. This funding will also provide reading and math instruction for 161,000 low-income students. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B grants will receive $174.5 million, ending the previous Congress's habit of declining Federal contributions for special education. 
   We also must focus on preparing workers, many of whom who have been displaced due to layoffs or company closings, for second career opportunities. H.R. 3043 will increase funding for the Department 
   of Labor, including a $227.4 million increase for employment, training and worker protection programs. This funding will greatly help our great state of Michigan because $1.2 billion will be used to provide state grants that training and supportive services, such as rapid-response assistance to help workers affected by mass layoffs and plant closures. 
   H.R. 3043 will also provide for the health and well-being of our families. Currently over 44 million Americans do not have health insurance; by 2013, the number of uninsured Americans will grow by 11 million. Universal health care has always been one of my top priorities, and I believe this legislation reflects a strong commitment to improving health care in our country. 
   Democrats took the first step towards helping the uninsured by passing a $207 million increase in funding for community health centers in the FY2007 Continuing Resolution, benefiting an additional 1.2 million people. The legislation before us today will provide an additional $200 million for community health centers. This bill also includes $50 million to assist states in providing affordable insurance for almost 200,000 people who are considered medically high risk and are not able to obtain health insurance in the commercial market. Lastly, H.R. 3043 will provide $45 million for health insurance counseling to assist 45 million Medicare beneficiaries to understand and fully utilize the benefits to which they are entitled. 
   This legislation will go farther than just providing health care to the uninsured; it will also provide much needed funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and emergency responders who served during 9/11. While the administration proposed reducing funding for the Federal government's public health activities by $159 million, this bill will provide a $255 million increase for a total of $6.5 billion. This funding will be dedicated to programs that focus on childhood immunization, state and local public health emergency  preparedness, and efforts to combat chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and emerging infectious diseases. In the aftermath of 9/11, many first responders were exposed to dust and other harmful debris at the World Trade Center site. H.R. 3043 provides $50 million to improve the 
   health monitoring and treatment of the World Trade Center emergency responders. It will also require that the Administration develop a comprehensive plan for how they will address the current health needs of these first responders. 
   The Labor-HHS Appropriations bill will also help families keep warm. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) has helped over 500,000 families in Michigan heat their homes during Michigan's tough winters. This year it will see a critical increase of $500 million, 23.2 percent above 2008, to provide energy assistance to nearly 1 million more low-income seniors and families. The Community Services Block Grant, which provides funding to States to expand services such as housing, home weatherization, parenting education, adult literacy classes, and emergency food assistance will see a $30 million increase to $660 million. In order to help improve processing time for Social Security disability claims and hearings, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will receive $9.7 billion, $401 million above 2007. Over the years, disability claims and hearings have increased, creating a backlog in casework. This funding will help to reduce the backlog and allow the SSA to continue providing monthly cash benefits to nearly 55 million Americans each year. 
   Our Founding Fathers trusted Congress with the task of funding the Federal government through the annual appropriations process. While this process is never easy, it is one of the most important duties we have to the American people. Not only has President Bush threatened to veto this legislation, but he also proposed cutting funding for these programs $7.6 billion below last year. This bill invests in families and their health, the workforce and their job training, and students and their education. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and show the American people Congress is dedicated to improving their quality of life.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES 911 IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3403, the ``New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008''. 
   This legislation ensures that consumers using Voice over Internet Protocol technology, or VoIP, can make full use of the 911 system in two important ways. First, the legislation extends the same liability protections afforded to wireline and wireless carriers, public safety, and end users to VoIP service. This parity in liability protections will encourage service providers, public safety, and end users to continue to rely on the 911 emergency communications system, regardless of the technology used to make a 911 call. Second, the legislation ensures that VolP providers can interconnect with legacy telephone networks so they can deliver calls and information to 911 call centers. 
   Representative GORDON, the author of H.R. 3403, Representative MARKEY, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, Representative BARTON, Ranking Member of the Committee, Representatives UPTON and STEARNS, the former and current Ranking Members of the Subcommittee, and I worked very closely with all stakeholders on this legislation, and it has widespread support among the public safety community, industry, and others. 
   As is clear from the language of the legislation, the requirement for interconnection is for purposes of 911 only and should not be used to bootstrap access for other reasons. Similarly, the legislation makes clear that those who control the legacy gateways to the emergency communications system must provide access, including rights of interconnection, to those seeking to deliver 911 calls and information. Because all stakeholders agreed to the legislative language, we fully expect that this access will not be inhibited by either delay or litigation. 
   H.R. 3403 also requires the development of a national plan to ensure that the 911 system continues to evolve. It is significant that the plan will include the participation of first responders, including the emergency communications professionals maintaining and using the system. It is also important that the plan will address the needs of the disabilities community when they use emergency communications. I look forward to reviewing the results of this work so we can begin to move to the next generation of emergency communications. 
   I am disappointed that the Senate stripped out one provision of the House-passed version of this legislation that protected proprietary customer information. This provision prohibited a carrier from using the customer information that other carriers are required to provide for 911 databases for any purpose other than emergency communications. I heard no rational argument against the policy underlying this provision. Nevertheless, in the interest of ensuring that this legislation be enacted swiftly, I will support the bill as passed by the Senate. I intend, however, to take this matter up again in the future. We owe it to consumers to ensure that their emergency communications system does not become a playground for competitive shenanigans. 
   H.R. 3403 is a forward-looking bill that ensures that consumers using VolP service are able to access 911 as easily as consumers using wireline or wireless services. Each of its elements--giving VoIP providers access to the components they need to provide 911 service; extending to VoIP providers, public safety officials, and end users the liability protections currently afforded to wireline and wireless services; and requiring a plan for the continued evolution of the emergency communications system--is a worthy victory for all consumers. I commend Representative GORDON for his years of dedication to this important issue and hail this success, from which all Americans will reap benefits for years to come.  
   The motion was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 556, the ``Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007''. As our Nation pursues the laudable dual goals of free and fair flows of capital and trade in the global economy, it must remain ever vigilant of its own security. Understanding this, H.R. 556 amends existing law to strengthen the process by which the Federal Government performs national security-related reviews of foreign investments in the United States. 
   First and foremost, this bill establishes in statute the membership of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. H.R. 556 broadens the factors that CFIUS must consider during reviews of proposed foreign investments in the United States. This includes the bill's express intent that critical energy infrastructure-related aspects of national security not be ignored in the CFIUS review process. I am particularly pleased with this provision, as well as the establishment in the bill of adding both the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce as permanent members of CFIUS. In short, the Committee on Energy and Commerce appreciates the emphasis laid by the bill on issues that fall squarely within our jurisdiction. 
   Lastly, I note my support for the bill's requirement that the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury investigate why that Department has not complied with reporting requirements related to potential industrial espionage or coordinated strategies by foreign parties with respect to U.S. critical technology, as is required under current law. This underscores my strong belief that Congressional oversight is a necessary component in assuring that the laws are properly and thoroughly carried out by the Federal Government. 
   I do have concerns regarding what I believe are several shortcomings in H.R. 556, when compared to the bill originally passed by the House in February of this year. I am troubled that there is no provision to designate vice chairmen of CFIUS--which, in the bill originally passed by the House, would have been comprised of the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security--and instead replaces it with ``lead agencies,'' to which the responsibility for performing national security reviews would now mainly be delegated. This has the lamentable consequence of hindering the thorough participation of the Department of Commerce in the CFIUS review process, something for which my colleagues on the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy and Commerce advocated during their hearing on CFIUS reform in July 2006. 
   Additionally, H.R. 556 now contains weaker provisions related to the collection of evidence in national security reviews, the approval of such reviews, as well as reporting requirements to the Congress about them. For example, while H.R. 556 originally directed CFIUS to submit reports to the Congress on all actions related to covered transactions, the bill now only provides for reports to be submitted to the Congress upon request. Also, I am alarmed that H.R. 556 no longer protects the Federal Government from liability for losses incurred by parties during CFIUS reviews. Such an omission may dissuade the Government from prosecuting thorough reviews for fear of being sued for remuneration by parties to CFIUS-covered transactions. 
   Although I have chided the bill for what I perceive to be its most apparent weaknesses, I have always maintained that the desire for perfect legislation should not impede the progress of good legislation. I believe H.R. 556 is good legislation that will contribute to the improvement of the CFIUS. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 556.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this is a bridge loan. Without this bridge, we are going to fall into the deepest calamity this country has seen since the Great Depression. I call on you to note that one in seven jobs in this country is in the auto industry. Put these companies into bankruptcy and you will bankrupt the entire industry, from the dealers to the suppliers to the small businessmen who depend upon this. That is how bad the situation is. All we ask is a chance to save the industry and to save the millions of Americans  who work there and who contribute to the growth of this country. 
   I saw the Depression. I know what happened: people standing on the corners without hope, somewhere around 33 percent of Americans without jobs. That is where we are going back to if we don't do something about this, and I don't want to hear any of my colleagues say, Dingell, we didn't know what was going to happen. All we thought was if we put them into bankruptcy, everything would be fine. 
   Well, it won't. Bankruptcy will simply take down every dealer, every supplier and everybody who is in the auto industry, including the three major companies, and it will destroy the industrial base of the United States, what little remains. 
   I am here to tell you, this is too big a disaster for us to invite. Imagine a nation with double digit unemployment. That is what we are going to be talking about. And I ask you, how can you turn over $1.2 billion to the Wall Streeters who brought about this calamity when you do nothing? 
   Invest in America. Support this legislation, which has been brilliantly handled by the chairman of committee, to whom I express my praise and my gratitude for his leadership, and I thank our Speaker for what it is she has done in making this possible. 
   This bill is salvation. Vote against it and look forward to a terrible calamity. Vote for it and give hope to millions of Americans who desperately need it and who are now existing on the edge of both terror, want, deprivation and worry of the most gross sort. 
   If you want to see other industries collapse, if you want to see what is left of the housing industry die, if you want to see other industries in this country suffer and hurt, vote against this bill. That is what has happened. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote for this bill. It is hope. It is salvation for this country. It is the future of this country. Yes, it is going to cost more and we are going to have to do it. But, again, I remind you, invest in America. Invest in the future of your people. Invest in the future and the hopes and the dreams and the desires of Americans. 
   Without that, all I can say to you is a terrible disaster looms. Let us at all costs prevent that. Let us at all costs see to it that we protect the future, the hopes, the dreams of millions of hardworking Americans, without whom there is no hope for this country.  
   Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. What is at stake today is nothing less than the livelihoods of millions of American workers. They are counting on us today to pass legislation that will give the domestic automakers the loans they need to survive this financial crisis. If we fail to act we will plunge this nation further into recession, add hundreds of thousands to the employment rolls in a matter of weeks, and deliver a crippling blow to the manufacturing sector from which it may never recover. As it stated on the cover of a special edition of the Detroit Free Press that was delivered to every Member's office, now is the time for us to ``Invest in America.'' 
   The legislation we are voting on has been described as offering a ``bridge loan'' to the domestic automakers. It is important to recognize where this bridge will lead us, and the consequences that will befall our nation if we fail to act. General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler have made significant investments into new vehicle technologies, such as plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. If we allow the automakers to continue to operate, and use the oversight authority provided for in this bill to guide them quickly towards the production of more fuel efficient vehicles, we can create the next generation of green manufacturing jobs here in this country. If the Big 3 fail we will have ceded these jobs to our competitors in China, South Korea, and Japan. These loans offer not just a bridge to solvency for the Big 3, but a bridge to a more vibrant and productive economy for all of us. 
   Protecting the economy was supposed to be the reason we acted to rescue Wall Street and save failing financial institutions. According to statistics released by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, more than $650 billion has been lent to financial institutions since the beginning of this financial crisis, and an additional $350 billion has been used to purchase private assets. This is in addition to the more than $200 billion in TARP funds that the Treasury Department has used to shore up financial institutions. It is unconscionable that approximately $1.2 trillion has now been sent to Wall Street, but there are those who would object to spending $15 billion to save 3 million blue collar jobs. 
   Before you cast your vote today, I would urge all of you to consider what this country would look like without a domestic automobile industry. Ask yourselves how many automobile dealerships or parts suppliers operate in your District, and how many of them will be forced to follow the Big 3 into bankruptcy. Imagine what a nation with double digit employment rates will look like, and what burden that will place on the states and on Federal Government. Ask yourselves why every other industrialized country is taking steps to provide support for their own automakers, and why they seem to place a higher value on good paying middle class jobs than we do. I urge my colleagues to consider these questions, and to support the legislation before us today.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, while l cannot support the legislation before us today, I commend Majority Leader Hoyer for the work he has done to negotiate a bill that is substantially better than the version that passed in the Senate. This legislation, which will be the exclusive mechanism for the Government to conduct surveillance within the United States,  contains provisions that will provide greater protections against unwarranted and unconstitutional searches of American citizens. 
   Despite the many improvements Mr. Hoyer was able to obtain, I unfortunately still cannot support this legislation because it contains a provision that will grant immunity to the telecommunications companies that assisted the President with his illegal and unauthorized warrantless wiretapping program. I have consistently said that it is not appropriate for Congress to grant these companies immunity for their actions without having an understanding of what it is that they did. This is not only because it will hold the telecommunications companies accountable for their actions, but because it is the only way of finding out just how extensive the President's illegal wiretapping program really was. In other words, this provision will enable the Bush administration to continue suppressing facts and information about the Government's own misbehavior and wrongdoing. 
   The immunity provision contained in this bill purporting to allow for judicial review to determine whether immunity is appropriate is a sham. As drafted, courts will have no real discretion and will be forced to grant immunity so long as the Government claims its actions were legal. However, the court is under no obligation to investigate whether the Government's claims are true. Anyone following the headlines recently, who has read about the recent Supreme Court decision overturning the administration's argument that it has the authority to detain people indefinitely in Guantanamo Bay, or about the hearings held by Senator Carl Levin and the Senate Armed Services Committee uncovering evidence that top civilian leadership at the Department of Defense authored memos arguing it was legal for the military to torture detainees, should be extremely wary of trusting President Bush to decide whether or not it is legal to spy on Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3963, the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not a perfect bill, but it is an excellent bipartisan compromise. I would observe that it meets the concerns expressed both in the President's veto message and also in the comments raised by our Republican colleagues as we debated the bill at earlier times. 
   I will note that the bill protects health insurance coverage for some 6 million children who now depend on CHIP. I will observe that it provides health coverage for 3.9 million children who are eligible, yet remain uninsured. Together, this is a total of better than 10 million young Americans who, without this legislation, would not have health insurance, and it is to be noted that those same young people will be losing their health insurance shortly if we do not act expeditiously on this matter.     
   As mentioned, the bill makes changes to accommodate the President's stated concerns. 
   First, it terminates the coverage of childless adults in 1 year. 
   Second, it targets bonus payments only to States that increase enrollments of the poorest uninsured children, and it prohibits States from covering children in families with incomes above $51,000. 
   Third, it contains adequate enforcement to ensure that only U.S. citizens are covered. 
   Fourth, it encourages States to help low-income families to secure health insurance provided through their private employer. 
   The bill is focused on the private marketplace. The evidence of that is the bill has strong support from the private health insurance industry. It is supported by the medical community, AMA, children's advocates, educators, advocates for people with disabilities, health professionals, hospitals, the AARP and others. 
   It is solid, bipartisan legislation worked out in careful meetings with Members from both parties, including Senator Hatch and others on the Senate side who have done such important work on this matter in times past, and that includes also our dear friend, Senator Grassley. 
   It is solid, bipartisan legislation that addresses the concerns expressed by the President and by our colleagues in the House on the Republican side. I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 3963. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I submit for the Record the disregards for children's coverage that have been submitted to us by the Congressional Research Service. 
   The point here is that the money needs to continue to flow to working families so that we can keep them working rather than staying on welfare.  
   Within the Medicaid and SCHIP programs, states are permitted to disregard or not count certain types of amounts of family income as decided by the State in determining eligibility for the program. 
   This bill maintains this long-standing flexibility to allow States to disregard certain legitimate costs like child care and child support costs, recognizing that this income is not available for a family to spend on health coverage. 
   Allowing States to disregard these costs ensures that working families have the money they need to pay for work-related expenses to ensure that low-income families can keep their jobs. This is important to keep families from having to go on welfare to get health coverage for their children. 
   The following are the monthly disregards applied by States in 2006.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I begin with an expression of my affection and respect for my good friend from Texas (Mr. Barton). In most matters he is an extraordinarily fine legislator, except on occasions when he offers these motions to recommit. 
   I begin by pointing out that my good friend's motion to recommit is the same tax about which there have been such prodigious complaints by my Republican colleagues, but that fewer kids are covered, and that there are many impediments inserted into the bill by the motion to recommit to covering the number of kids. 
   Having said that, my colleagues on the other side say they want to ensure that lowest-income States are covered, but they strike the bonus payments that CBO says will get 1.9 million of the lowest-income children covered who would not otherwise be covered.     
   Second, they say they are for working families. But it is interesting to note that they are forcing, by this, many of the working families who would receive coverage under the bill before us are forced to go onto welfare in order to get health care because they strike the provisions which would discourage that kind of unfortunate event. My colleagues, I would observe, still have the wrong medicine for the problem. 
   Now, in addition to this, the recommit would prohibit States looking to expand coverage to a family of three at $52,000 from doing so unless they meet arbitrary enrollment targets. The result of that is, of course, again harder for people who deserve and need this kind of relief to get this kind of benefit. 
   The last point I want to make here is their proposal does not remedy the current problem that has caused thousands of children to lose health coverage due to Republican bureaucratic requirements. I would point out something else, and that is my good friends have essentially in this, as near as I can figure, reenacted the President's proposal, which would set forth a directive to the States as to how they will administer this, something that has caused a huge outrage amongst the States, amongst persons affected and amongst advocates for the poor and the unfortunate. This is perhaps the worst part of what the proposal to recommit does. 
   Let's look at what the bill does. The bill increases the number of children who are eligible for coverage, for health insurance, from 6.6 to 10 million young Americans. It must be observed that we are doing this amidst a circumstance where we have seen significant increases in the number of our children joining the ranks of the uninsured. 
   The bill does more. It sees to it that we take care of the problem. Nearly 70 percent of all uninsured children are from families below $41,300 for a family of four. Of the 9 million uninsured children, nearly two-thirds are either preschool or elementary school age. This is the time when health care becomes singularly precious and important to them. 
   I would remind my colleagues that a Nation is judged by how it treats and cares for those who are most vulnerable and least able to help themselves. The bill sees to it that we amplify and include greater numbers of those who are most dependent upon others for their survival. 
   But in addition to that, I would remind my colleagues that this legislation is something which is of great importance because we are talking about the future of the kids. Giving them health care now when they have need of it is something that ensures that Americans in the future will be the kind of productive, valuable citizens who are able to carry forward the competition of this Nation in some of its most difficult, competitive times. 
   Now, this bill would significantly increase and improve access for needed health care to children. The proposal in the motion to recommit significantly cuts back on that. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and vote for the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Today we face an awesome responsibility to do what is right for America's children. The debate here is about one thing only: health care for kids. Some have tried to change the subject, obfuscating this debate with misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies. Whether this is ignorance or malfeasance, allow me to help them understand the legislation. 
   First, the bill terminates the coverage of adults under the CHIP program. I repeat, terminates. 
   Second, the bill prohibits the use of Federal funds for illegal aliens. Section 605 plainly states, ``No Federal Funding for Illegal Aliens.'' 
   Third, the bill is fully paid for and will not increase the national debt. In fact, CBO estimates this bill, if enacted, will return money to the Treasury. 
   The legislation before us would provide health care and health insurance coverage for 10 million needy American children. It provides funding for States to enroll millions of low-income children who are already eligible for benefits yet remain uninsured. Under current law, these boys and girls are entitled to their benefits. Continuing this situation of not providing coverage is a travesty. 
   I am not alone in this view. Former Surgeons General for Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton and for the current President recently wrote in support of this legislation the following: ``We implore you to not put off the health needs of our Nation's children. Please act today.'' 
   This legislation has the strong backing of the entire medical community, children advocates, educators, school administrators and school boards, as well as insurance companies across the country, and 43 of the Nation's Governors want SCHIP enacted because they know children cannot learn if they are not well.     
   They also know something else. These are the most vulnerable people in our society. We will be judged how we care for them; but beyond that, this is an investment in the future of the country. More than 300 organizations and a long list of distinguished Americans support this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in overriding the veto. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished friend and colleague from Mississippi for the recognition. I recognize that securing our homeland is going to take tremendous efforts across the agencies and involve government expertise and cooperation throughout the government. I want to say that, in this matter, the business of the Nation is in good hands in those of my friend from Mississippi. 
   I represent Michigan, the State with three of the busiest northern border crossings in the United States. Our citizens have long been accustomed to an open border in which citizens on both sides were able to commute to jobs, visit families, do shopping and visiting across international borders. 
   With the events of September 11, 2001, our borders were shut. Michigan's economy literally ground to a halt. Just in time deliveries to Michigan factories and industries were stopped at the border. The new security realities threaten to idle factories and to lay off workers. 
   This bill goes a long way to making sure that we avoid that situation, and it will also enable thousands of our citizens on both sides of the border, Michiganders and Canadians, the freedom to travel when they need to and in ways to which they have grown accustomed. 
   The US-VISIT program is properly funded, more inspectors will be hired for the border. New technologies will be deployed to help ease the traffic and speed processing. 
   Under the leadership of our friend, the chairman, Mr. Thompson, the bill increases Department of Homeland Security budget by $2 billion more than last year, and nearly 8 percent above the President's budget. Not only is more being put into the border, but we are also restoring funding to our first  responders, money that was cut by the President's budget. State Homeland Security and Fire Assistance grants are restored to appropriate levels. 
   As I said before, preparing and preventing another terrorist attack is a responsibility to all. As we learned 6 years ago from the anthrax attacks here on Capitol Hill, it is important that the Federal Government have an intelligent, coordinated and effective response to bioterrorism and to all our terrorisms. All Cabinet-level Departments and the agencies under their purview must work towards ensuring our domestic security. 
   It is, however, important that as we move forward on this legislation, we keep in mind that the agencies have the expertise and the skill to answer public health emergencies. We must not allow mission creep to set in blurring lines of authority and diluting the effectiveness of our response effort. 
   I also want to point out the need for strong improvements in the cybersecurity of this Nation. The Committee on Energy and Commerce has long sought to raise the profile of cyber threats within DHS and to better prepare the Nation for potentially catastrophic cyber disruptions. The manager's amendment in this legislation will require DHS to collaborate with expert agencies, including the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications Commission. This collaboration will ensure that ongoing efforts will not be interrupted or eroded.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 510 of House Resolution 6 and as the designee of the majority leader, I call up the bill (H.R. 4) to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower covered part D drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. This legislation is bipartisan. It is an overdue step to improve part D drug benefits for the millions who depend on that section. 
   The bill is simple and straightforward. It removes the prohibition that prevents the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and ensures that our friends in the executive branch take this opportunity seriously. It requires the Secretary to negotiate. 
   This legislation is simple and common sense. It will deliver lower premiums to the seniors, lower prices at the pharmacy and savings for all taxpayers. The American public subsidizes more than three-quarters of the part D benefit, paying the bulk of premiums and 80 percent of catastrophic costs. They also pay for most or all of part D medicines used by the lowest-income Medicare beneficiaries. These savings add up. 
   It is equally important to understand that this legislation does not do certain things. H.R. 4 does not preclude private plans from offering drug coverage under Medicare from getting better or additional discounts on medicines they offer seniors and people with disabilities. H.R. 4 does not interfere with the ability of doctors to prescribe a particular drug for their patients by establishing a national formulary. In fact, page 2 of the legislation reads: ``Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to establish or require a particular formulary.'' I do not think that there is any clearer way to state these matters than in that fashion. 
   I have confidence that Secretary Leavitt can cut a good deal with the bargaining power of 43 million beneficiaries of Medicare behind him without restricting access to needed medicine. 
   H.R. 4 does not require price controls. Quite the contrary, the bill gives the Secretary an additional power and makes him an additional player with whom drug companies must negotiate. And I say with some sympathy for the drug companies that they have been doing so well that I can understand their opposition to this matter. 
   H.R. 4 does not hamstring research and development by pharmaceutical houses. The most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings by the seven largest drug manufacturers based in the U.S. show that, on average, these companies spend more on marketing, advertising and administration than they do on research and development; and those who insist that the sky is falling if the drug companies negotiate lower prescription prices are arguing that those drug companies should continue to skin a fat hog at the expense of the taxpayers and the beneficiaries. 
   I further note that H.R. 4 does not require HHS's Secretary to use Department of Veterans Affairs' price schedule or to adopt a VA-like system. In fact, you will not find the words ``veterans'' and ``affairs'' in this legislation. 
   Independent studies confirm that Medicare overpays drug companies in purchasing medicines. I will repeat that: Medicare overpays drug companies in purchasing medicines. One study has found that half of the top 20 drugs used by senior citizens fall into that category. Medicare drug plans paid at least 58 percent more than the prescription program of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Even if the Secretary does not get those same discounts, it is clear that Medicare can do better, and we must see that they do so. 
   Senior citizens and people with disabilities deserve better, and after the past 6 years of pillaging the Treasury of the United States, our taxpayers deserve better. 
   While this legislation is an important step forward, H.R. 4 does not address other problems with part D. I anticipate we will be doing so at an early time. The list of wrongs that need righting in connection with this legislation is long, and, as I said, we will introduce legislation and deal with these matters in other ways. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. Let the Secretary of Health and Human Services use the power of 43 million beneficiaries to get a better deal for their prescription medicines, for them, and for the taxpayers  
   Negotiating Lower Drug Prices 
   From all the ruckus raised by the administration and its patrons in the pharmaceutical industry, you would think that Congressional Democrats were out to destroy the free market system when they call for the government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet a bill scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives today is sufficiently flexible to allow older Americans to benefit from the best efforts of both the government and the private drug plans. 
   The secretary of health and human services should be able to exert his bargaining power with drug companies in those cases in which the private plans have failed to rein in unduly high prices--leaving the rest to the drug plans. The result could be lower costs for consumers and savings for the taxpayers who support Medicare. 
   Under current law, written to appease the pharmaceutical industry, the government is explicitly forbidden from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. That job is left to the private health plans that provide drug coverage under Medicare and compete for customers in part on the basis of cost. 
   The Democrats' bill would end the prohibition and require--not just authorize--the secretary of health and human services to negotiate prices with the manufacturers. That language is important since the current secretary, Michael Leavitt, has said he does not want the power to negotiate. 
   No data is publicly available to indicate what prices the private health plans actually pay the manufacturers. But judging from what they charge their beneficiaries, it looks like they pay significantly more for many drugs than do the Department of Veterans Affairs--which by law gets big discounts--the Medicaid programs for the poor, or foreign countries. 
   The administration argues, correctly, that the private plans have held costs down and that there is no guarantee the government will do any better. The bill, for example, prohibits the secretary from limiting which drugs are covered by Medicare, thus depriving him of a tool used by private plans and the V.A. to win big discounts from companies eager to get their drugs on the list. The secretary does have the bully pulpit, which he can use to try to bring down the cost of overpriced drugs. 
   The bill also does not require the secretary to negotiate prices for all 4,400 drugs used by beneficiaries. A smart secretary could simply determine which prices paid by the plans seemed most out of line with the prices paid by other purchasers and then negotiate only on those drugs. The private plans are explicitly allowed to negotiate even lower prices if they can. This sort of flexibility should pose no threat to the free market. It is time for the Medicare drug program to work harder for its beneficiaries without worrying so much about the pharmaceutical companies.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time over here. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can understand how my Republican colleagues are distressed about this legislation. But I would remind them, first of all, that we are simply taking steps to correct earlier abuses of the most outrageous sort. 
   This legislation part D was crafted in the dark of night, and it was done by Republican Members and by lobbyists for the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical houses. That is why it is here. And now I can understand why my Republican colleagues are so distressed, because we are going to take all of those wonderful goodies away, or some of them, from the drug houses that so carefully saw that they got them without a single Democratic Member appointed by our then-Republican Speaker to appear here in the Capitol to address the question of what went into that. 
   Now, we have been getting a lot of excuses from our Republican colleagues. They tell us the bill is working well. Simple fact of the matter is it is not. One Federal program pays 60 percent more than other Federal programs for procurement of prescription pharmaceuticals, that is, part D pays more than the VA pays for the same prescription pharmaceuticals. But the reason is no one is able to negotiate on behalf of the citizens. You have got a bunch of good-hearted or cold-hearted prescription pharmaceutical people who have written this legislation and who are fixing the prices that are paid by senior citizens. 
   This says that the Secretary of HHS, a servant of the American people, will negotiate prices on prescription pharmaceuticals so that the senior citizens can get something other than excuses from our dear Republican friends and the insurance companies about why we ought to disregard what our common sense tells us, and that is that 43 million people can have the purchasing power to perhaps encourage these drug houses to give the government and the American retirees a better price. 
   Now, let's take a look at that. That is a chance to do real good for the people. I would tell you that we are tired of the excuses on these matters. Consumers, and particularly those who are living on disabled or fixed or limited incomes, watch their pennies. They have to. We should watch them too because we owe that to the people. 
   Now, the Secretary says it isn't going to save money. CBO says it isn't going to save money. But the reason is because they know full well that this Secretary probably won't negotiate on their behalf. 
   But I will tell you one thing. On this side, we will see that this Secretary does negotiate for better prices for our people. We will have him up before the committees, and we will give him and the others in the administration the oversight which they have lacked for 6 years. 
   Now, who is in favor of this legislation? 
   Before I say that, the people opposed are the Republicans, the administration, the drug houses and the insurance  companies, certainly a logical collection of opponents to a proposal of this kind. 
   Who favors it? AARP, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Medicare Rights Center, the Alliance for Retired Americans. It is also supported by organizations representing people with disabilities. The National Council on Independent Living, AIDS Action, Breast Cancer Action. 
   Consumer groups support it. Consumers Union, Families USA, U.S. PIRG. No insurance companies support it, but that is no surprise. 
   Provider organizations support it. The National Community Pharmacists Association, people who work with the recipients of this. The American Nurses Association, the American Medical Association. The doctors say this is the thing that we should be doing. The Association of Community Pharmacists. 
   And, of course, organizations representing tens of millions of hardworking Americans. The American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, SEIU, United Steelworkers, the AFL-CIO, and the UAW. 
   Some say part D is working well. And for a few lucky folks, that is true. The insurance companies are cutting the fat hog on this. And the pharmaceutical houses are able to do just what they want on their pricing. 
   It is time that we correct this. Let's pass this legislation and do what we should have done before to protect our senior citizens.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. As a proud father and grandfather, I know too well that the costs of a college education can be prohibitive. This legislation, in combination with the College Cost Reduction Act passed in September, makes great strides to reform our higher education system to increase access to all students and families who desire to attend college. 
   I know many of you have heard me talk about the tough times my great State of Michigan is facing. I know many of you have heard that Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the Nation at 7.5 percent, Michigan has one of the highest foreclosure rates, while at the same time our median household income has decreased by 11.9 percent and over 240,000 manufacturing jobs have left our State. These statistics are worth repeating because they emphasize the need and the importance for providing our future workforce with the tools they need to be successful. 
   One tool that is vitally important to many students is Federal aid; in fact, in past years almost 9 million students have received Federal aid. Yet the process to apply for Federal aid can be confusing and overwhelming for many students and their families. H.R. 4137 proposes to streamline the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, in order to make it easier for students to navigate. This will be done by reducing the number of questions on the FAFSA form and allowing applicants to save their information rather than re-filing a new form each year. It will also allow students and their families to determine their expected family contribution and their Federal student aid package prior to college so that families can plan accordingly. 
   H.R. 4137 will also demand more accountability from student loan lenders, ensuring that the best interests of our students come first. This legislation will do this by requiring higher education institutions and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct and ban all gifts and revenue sharing agreements between institutions and lenders. Students will now also be provided with full and fair information about their loans before entering into loan agreements, as well as be informed by the lenders of all borrowing options available to them when taking out and repaying loans. 
   Another focus of this legislation is the need to address rising college prices so that more students and families will be able to attend college in the first place. We have seen in tuition at 4-year public colleges increase 30.5 percent since 1999 to $7,164 per year. That is an increase of $1,675 over 6 years. When families are making less, every increase makes it harder and harder for students to afford college. 
   To address this, H.R. 4137 will also establish an online net price calculator that will assist students and their families estimate the cost based on income and family situations at individual schools. This will allow families to be able to properly calculate what the cost of a 4-year education will be. Families will now also have access to a list published by the Department of Education that will provide consumers with information on tuition and fees, average price after grant aid, recent price increases, and change in per-student spending. 
   I am also pleased that this legislation will increase college aid to our veterans and military personnel. Many college campuses have seen an increase in enrollment of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan; however, some of these schools do not have enough resources to give the veterans the support they need. With over a million troops having served in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is our duty to ensure that when they return they have access to a college education. This legislation establishes a scholarship program that could award up to $5,000 for veterans, their spouses, or their children enrolled in college. It will also create support centers on college campuses designed to coordinate services and assist veterans with enrollment and completion of their degrees. More importantly, H.R. 4137 will ensure that veterans are not penalized by their financial contributions to their GI benefits in the financial aid process. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have heard over the years from my constituents, many from some of the great universities in my district, about the increasing amount of debt taken on to complete a college degree. Many have been forced to take out private loans, others have taken on additional hours at work, and unfortunately, some have had to take a leave of absence from school to pay the bills. This is a pattern that cannot continue. Education is not a luxury, it is a tool needed to succeed in today's economy. Investing in education and Federal aid programs is investing in our workforce and the success of our constituents. Today I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, reaffirming the commitment the Democratic Congress has made to improving higher education and strengthening our workforce.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, the 9/11 Commission made a series of recommendations to Congress and the administration designed to ensure the safety of Americans while protecting the liberties that form the core of our democracy. This important legislation addresses issues that reach across all aspects of the lives of Americans. 
   The 9/11 Commission recommended that Congress ensure that first responders be able to communicate with each other across jurisdictions--firefighters with police officers, emergency medical professionals with State officials, local with State and Federal personnel. Title III, Ensuring Communications Interoperability for First Responders, establishes a grant program designed to achieve this important goal. As structured in this legislation, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant program will complement the interoperability program already underway at the Department of Commerce. 
   Under statute, DHS's expert on all matters relating to emergency communications is the Director of Emergency Communications. Title III of this Conference Report recognizes this statutory directive by ensuring that the Director of Emergency Communications will design and implement the grant programs' policies and guidelines. The Director will be in charge of ensuring that grant program funds are used to establish a forward-looking, nationwide, interoperable system to ensure the safety and efficient functioning of all of our first responders as they respond to natural disasters and other calamities. The Committee on Energy and Commerce looks forward to overseeing this program and receiving continual updates from the Director on the progress of DHS towards achieving nationwide interoperability through this program. 
   I am also especially pleased that the legislation ensures that the overwhelming majority of the interoperability grant funds will be passed through to localities, because it is at the local level that our first responders are working to ensure our safety and well-being. Importantly, the legislation ties the grant funds to the implementation of statewide plans and a national plan that will act as a road map towards statewide and national interoperability. As we have learned, natural disasters and incidents do not recognize international borders. To help our first responders address trans-border incidents, Title III also establishes border interoperability pilot projects to help us ensure that our first responders are able to communicate with our neighbors to the north and south.  
   Title IV addresses credentialing workers involved in ensuring America's safety. The Conference Report states that the DHS shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services when developing credentialing standards for healthcare personnel. It is imperative that the Secretary of Health and Human Services not only be involved but also have a leadership role in developing standards for credentialing of healthcare professionals. Failing to utilize the public health expertise of the Department of Health and Human Services to its fullest extent could jeopardize efficient care and support for Americans who have been exposed to a terrorist attack or natural disaster. I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson to ensure that the required consultation is to the degree and of the depth merited by the importance of the public health of all of America's people. 
   I want to thank the gentleman for some important clarifications that have been added to Title IX of the bill, which addresses voluntary national private sector preparedness standards. When we voted on this bill in January, I noted that Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act establishes a mandatory regulatory program regarding the accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. As part of that program, the owner or operator of a covered facility must prepare and implement a risk management plan to detect and prevent or minimize accidental releases and to provide a prompt emergency response to any such releases. I asked for clarification at that time that the bill's voluntary program was not intended to interfere with this mandatory Clean Air Act program. The conference report before us today provides that clarification. Rules of Construction, as well as requirements for consideration and coordination with other Federal agencies' preparedness programs or standards, have been included in the two new sections of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that address private sector preparedness. These provisions clarify that the private sector must continue to meet the Clean Air Act Section 112(r) requirements, and that the voluntary preparedness standards are not intended to supersede or interfere with the mandatory Clean Air Act program. 
   Another important area of concern addressed by this legislation is cargo screening. One of the major security vulnerabilities facing this Nation is the threat from the detonation of a nuclear device smuggled into a port through a cargo container loaded on a ship. It is a nightmare we must prevent. Section 1701 establishes a 5-year goal of 100 percent screening for radiological devices or material in cargo containers leaving foreign ports before they ever enter the waters of the United States. This is a worthy priority, and to ensure adequate flexibility, the DHS Secretary is given authority for 2-year waivers should there be major impediments to its implementation. 
   Section 1701 also authorizes the DHS Secretary to ``establish technological and operational standards for systems to scan containers; to ensure that the standards are consistent with the global nuclear detection architecture developed under the Homeland Security Act of 2002; and to coordinate with other Federal agencies that administer scanning or detection programs.'' 
   The need for coordination between agencies is essential, particularly given the advanced work carried out by the Department of Energy (DOE) in setting up radiation portal monitors at ports, airports, and rail stations around the world. The DOE's ``Megaports'' program provides radiation detection equipment to key international seaports to screen cargo containers for radioactive materials, including Greece, Bahamas, Sri Lanka, Spain, Singapore, and the Netherlands. Approximately 70 ports worldwide are targeted for implementation, and installation efforts are underway at ports within Belgium, China, Dubai, Honduras, Israel, Oman, the Philippines, Thailand, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Taiwan. Additionally, the Megaports program is teaming with the ``Container Security Initiative'' to implement the ``Secure Freight Initiative'' pilot program at ports in the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and Honduras. The DOE's ``Second Line of Defense'' program installs radiation detection equipment at borders, airports, and feeder ports in Russia, former Soviet Union states, and other key countries. Approximately 350 sites have been identified to receive detection equipment installations. 
   Even though this legislation authorizes the DHS Secretary to set minimum container scanning technology standards, the Conference Report properly notes that DOE has inherent capabilities to assess, through its cooperative agreements with numerous countries and port authorities, the adequacy of technical and operating procedures for cargo container scanning. 
   To ensure the smooth continuation of DOE's cooperative relationships with numerous countries and the further expansion of the Megaports program, the Conference Report makes clear that these two agencies shall closely coordinate their activities, and requires that DHS shall consult with DOE prior to the establishment of technological or operational standards that would affect screening activities in foreign ports. As part of the coordination requirement in this section, the Conference Report directs that where the scanning technology standards affect the DOE's Megaports and SLD programs, the Secretary shall invite the DOE to participate in the development and final review of such standards, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall seek the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy. Should differences arise, I would expect that DOE and DHS would notify the relevant committees of jurisdiction in Congress. The American people are counting on the agencies carrying out cargo screening at our ports and borders to ensure that there are technically sound decisions in setting standards and selecting equipment, and that there is seamless coordination between agencies with responsibility and expertise. 
   Title XXII makes an important modification to the Department of Commerce's interoperability grant program by including strategic technology reserves as eligible for funding. This modification recognizes the importance of a resilient and redundant network of emergency communications. In Title XXII, Congress also recognizes the expertise of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with regard to the Nation's communications and information infrastructure and directs the FCC to conduct a vulnerability assessment. This title also establishes a joint committee and a pilot project 
   to improve communications for emergency medical and public healthcare committee. Title XXII also requires an important report on the progress of the re-banding efforts in the 800 megahertz band. As such, this title recognizes Congress's clear intent that this process proceed as expeditiously as possible so that our first responders in border areas may effectively utilize the spectrum to which they are moving. I also support the changes in Title XXIII because I believe that it will enhance and expedite the ability of our Nation's 911 centers to be able to automatically locate callers whether they are using traditional land line or mobile phones. 
   I appreciate the Chairman's willingness to work with me, the members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and our staff as we have used our expertise to improve the legislation in this Conference Report.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I would first like to commend Chairman Peterson and the members of the Agriculture Committee for completing the difficult task of bringing this bill to the floor in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I supported the 2002 farm bill, which has served Michigan farmers well. The agricultural sector in this country is strong, and it is a good time to take a look at our farm support system and figure out how we can make it better for small farmers and specialty crop farmers. 
   We must recognize that farming is an inherently risky enterprise; producers are exposed to both production and price risks. Therefore, it is incumbent upon our government to be there for farmers when markets fail. We cannot afford to turn our back on America's farmers and our farm policy should be structured so that those who produce the safest and most abundant food supply in the world have an adequate safety net. We should also promote research to find new uses for the agricultural products grown in our fields and to promote these products in the global marketplace. However, it is not our responsibility to give cash payouts to millionaires, dead farmers or suburbanites who have no involvement in farming but just happened to purchase a house located on farmland. 
   In 2005, 92 percent of the total farm payments last year went to just five crops. Michigan has the second-most diverse agriculture base in the Nation and I am glad to see that for the first time, the farm legislation before us today guarantees a historic $1.5 billion in funding for fruit and vegetable programs, including the school fresh fruit and vegetable program, the farmer's market promotion program, specialty crop block grants and research and organic food programs--all of which provide valuable support for the fresh fruit and vegetable growers in Michigan. 
   The legislation before us today strengthens incentives for farmers to conserve valuable natural resources and protect the environment. Currently, three out of four farmers are turned away from conservation programs due to lack of funding. It is unacceptable for farmers who are trying to do the right thing for the environment to be rejected because we have not allocated enough resources to help them. H.R. 2419, the Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007, adds $4.3 billion more to preserve farm and ranchland, improve water quality and quantity, and enhance soil conservation, air quality, and wildlife habitat on working lands. 
   I support the Fairness amendment offered by my colleague Ron Kind not because I am dissatisfied with H.R. 2419 but because I believe that it goes one step farther towards curbing taxpayer subsidies by reforming our farm payment system to direct aid to those who need assistance. Make no mistake, the Fairness amendment does not dismantle the  safety net--it just modernizes the program so that it works better for family farms and 348 Congressional Districts, including Michigan's 15th District, which would gain $6 million under the Kind proposal. 
   The Fairness amendment does not weaken any of the commendable nutrition or conservation provisions in H.R. 2419--rather, it makes them better by adding $2 billion for nutrition programs and $3 billion for conservation programs. Moreover, it does all of this without requiring spending offsets or new taxes. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2419 contains no legislative text expressing a view on whether manure should be deemed a hazardous substance pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, CERCLA, or the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, EPCRA. The absence of any such text is proper both for parliamentary and policy reasons. 
   The report that accompanies this legislation, however, references a ``sense of the committee'' amendment that farm animal manure should not be deemed a hazardous substance pursuant to CERCLA and EPCRA. 
   I strongly disagree with these sentiments, which would create a blanket exemption from important environmental laws for those large concentrated animal feeding operations that pollute public drinking water supplies with phosphorous and emit more than 100 pounds per day of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide into the air. 
   Manure is not at risk of being deemed a ``hazardous substance'' or ``hazardous waste.'' That is misinformation put forth by some. Phosphorous, however, is a ``hazardous substance'' under CERCLA and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has determined that both ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are ``extremely hazardous substances'' for the ``reportable quantity'' reporting requirements of EPCRA. 
   Congress clearly intended that the Superfund program deal with the improper and excessive application of fertilizer that pollutes drinking water supplies or damages natural resources. This is manifestly clear because Section 
   101 (22) of the Superfund statute creates an exemption from the definition of release for ``the normal application of fertilizer.'' If substances such as phosphorous that emanate from the excessive application of manure fertilizer are exempted, the only people being protected are the bad actors. 
   These large concentrated animal feeding operations produce huge amounts of animal waste. For example, an animal feeding operation with 2 million hogs produces a volume of manure equal to the solid waste stream of a U.S. city of about 2.7 million--a city similar in size to Chicago's 2.8 million population. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency has found that large-scale concentrated animal feeding operations present significant human health and environmental risks. Let me quote EPA's findings: 
   ``Significant human health and environmental risks are generally associated with large-scale Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, CAFOs. Improper handling of manure from feedlots, lagoons and improper land application can result in excessive nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous); pathogens (i.e., fecal coli form); and other pollutants in the water. This pollution can kill fish, cause excessive algae growth, and contaminate drinking water. In addition, emissions of air pollutants from very large CAFOs may result in significant health effects for nearby residents.'' 
   A blanket exemption from CERCLA for excessive application of manure fertilizer would also shift the costs onto community water systems and their ratepayers for additional treatment to make water potable. I attach the July 23, 2007, letter from the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies that highlights the serious consequences that any such an exemption would have for the quality our Nation's drinking water supplies. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Farm Bill Extension Act also makes changes to the Rural Utilities Service broadband loan and loan guarantee program. While this program is in dire need of reform, I am concerned about several provisions in the measure as drafted. 
   The measure wisely limits loans and loan guarantees in areas where consumers already have broadband service available to them. I am deeply concerned, however, that it describes those areas where broadband is available too broadly, so that applications to provide broadband to large areas of a community that currently have no broadband service at all would be denied. 
   The bill also prohibits support in areas where more than 75 percent of households have access to broadband. National satellite broadband providers can in theory reach close to 100 percent of households. However, while satellite-delivered broadband is a rapidly-improving and valuable service, particularly in remote areas, today it is often not comparable to terrestrially-delivered broadband. It typically cannot reach the same speeds and is more expensive and subject to outages in heavy rainstorms and other severe weather. While I appreciate the bill's commitment to technological neutrality, if satellite-delivered broadband is not excluded from the 75-percent requirement, there may be few areas that would be eligible for loans. 
   When it comes to broadband service, speed is critical, and the measure could also be improved by giving priority to applications that, other things being equal, propose to offer higher broadband speeds to consumers. 
   I also strongly disagree with creating within the Department of Agriculture a National Center for Rural Telecommunications Assessment to increase broadband penetration and develop assessments of broadband availability in rural areas. These are matters that fall squarely within the expertise of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and should be left to that agency's expertise. Likewise, any report describing a comprehensive rural broadband strategy should be developed by the FCC rather than by the Department of Agriculture. I applaud the goal of working toward universal broadband availability and urge my colleagues to ensure that we attain that goal by allowing the FCC, the agency with the most expertise, to spearhead that effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, which will give much needed assistance to homeowners, provide increased funding for affordable housing, make important reforms to FHA, and restore confidence in the credit markets. This is the most important housing legislation to pass through the Congress in decades, and it will have an effect on millions of Americans. However, there is one specific provision included in this legislation that will have a particularly important effect in Michigan's 15th Congressional District. 
   Section 2801 of H.R. 3221 is designed to clarify congressional intent regarding certain properties that entered the HUD property disposition process prior to the enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act but where the initial proposed disposition was delayed. An example of one such project is Parkview Apartments in Ypsilanti, Michigan. While I believe that this particular project is already subject to the grandfathering provision of the DRA, Section 2801 clarifies that such properties should be considered ``pre-DRA'' properties, and that HUD should proceed with its prior disposition contracts as to those properties. This clarification was requested by HUD and, in drafting this provision, we were assisted by HUD staff and were assured that this language was the clarification the agency needed to proceed with the 2004 contract as to Parkview Apartments. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Frank and his staff for all of the hard work they have put into this legislation. In particular I would like to extend my sincere gratitude for the work they have done on Section 2801, which will help to ensure that Parkview Apartments is retained as an affordable housing resource in Washtenaw County.

<DOCNO>Mr. DINGELL. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7005, legislation that will provide critical tax relief to 25 million middle class families and provide a solution to the looming Alternative Minimum Tax crisis. Had Congress failed to act, tens of thousands of my constituents in Michigan's 15th Congressional District would have been required to pay the AMT when filing their 2008 tax return. At a time when middle class families are already finding their budgets stretched thin because of rising costs for things like gasoline, groceries, and health care expenses, imposing an increased tax burden would be unconscionable. 
   The Democratic majority has shown a continuing commitment to responsible fiscal policies, and made numerous efforts to offset the cost of the AMT fix by closing tax loopholes that allow corporate CEOs to receive deferred compensation from offshore companies. Unfortunately, President Bush and the Republican minority have opposed our efforts to find a way to pay for the AMT fix, and have chosen to pass the cost of this bill onto our children and grandchildren rather than require the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share of taxes. 
   This is especially disappointing because the expansion of the AMT was an accounting gimmick designed to make the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy more affordable. Since the enactment of those tax cuts, the President has committed us to a war that costs hundreds of billions of dollars every year and the budget deficit has exploded. Despite inheriting balanced budgets, President Bush's irresponsible fiscal policies have caused the national debt to rise to nearly $9 trillion; three times the size of our debt when President Clinton left office. Clearly, it is time for a change. I look forward to working with a new President next year to find a way to enact a permanent AMT fix, and rewrite our tax laws and put an end to irresponsible Bush fiscal policies.
