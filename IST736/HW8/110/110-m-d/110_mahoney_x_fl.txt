<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, the good news is the debate is over. The President, Congress, and the American people all agree that the economy is in trouble and that the old cures that the Bush administration has used to grow our economy have failed to provide working and middle-class Americans a better life and a secure future. 
   I support this economic stimulus package because American families are hurting and small business needs help and they need it now. 
   Unlike the President, both Wall Street and Main Street know that we need a bold new vision to ensure America's economic leadership is a global economy. 
   Americans understand that we need to reward companies that create jobs here at home, and we must stop giving American businesses incentives to move our jobs overseas. We need to once again be the place where entrepreneurs from around the world come to live their dream. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take the first step today by giving families and small businesses a helping hand. I also ask my colleagues to come together with the courage and resolve to give America an economic plan that ensures our children's American Dreams.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. During the past few months, Americans have woken up every morning and encountered headlines in their local newspapers similar to those in my hometown papers. Home sales hit low in February. Late loan payments highest since 1992; and foreclosures skyrocket. 
   I'd like to thank Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Frank for their commitment to address the housing market crisis gripping our Nation and of my beloved Florida. With their leadership, the legislation we're going to pass in the coming days brings hope to millions at home who are being hit especially hard, as much of Florida's economy is dependent on home construction and property development. 
   Right now, thousands of Floridians are out of work and unable to pay their mortgage, turning an economic downturn into a crisis for working families and their communities. 
   Florida homeowners are being hit especially hard because of the staggering cost of property taxes, skyrocketing insurance premiums and increased mortgage payments. This toxic cocktail has forced many home owners to make difficult decisions. Our seniors are being forced to decide between paying their mortgages and purchasing lifesaving medications. 
   Likewise, working families are confronted with the challenges of putting food on the table, supporting their children's education, and paying their mortgage. 
   In the eight counties I represent, there are approximately 13,500 homes in pre-foreclosure, meaning that homeowners have missed at least one of their mortgage payments. To give you a better perspective, Madam Chairman, how deep the problem is in my district, there are approximately 245,000 single family homes in the area that I represent.     
   That means about 5 1/2 percent of the homes in my district are in foreclosure. Every foreclosure serves to further drive down the values of every homeowner in the neighborhood. In addition to the personal tragedies faced by families confronting foreclosure or falling home values are States, counties, and towns that are facing another crisis. 
   According to the Department of Commerce, approximately 200,000 new homes are sitting empty throughout the United States. Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found that partially completed or vacant developments reduce tax revenue for cities and towns and hurt businesses. Likewise, a report authored by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that the rising foreclosures and falling property values may cut tax revenues by more than $6.6 billion for the ten States, including my home State of Florida. This means fewer police, firemen, and teachers. It means fewer parks and after school programs. 
   The crisis has already pushed Florida into a recession, and the State already has to deal with a decrease in tax revenue. The State, which just finished its budget, had to make difficult decisions. Nursing homes in the State charged with taking care of our seniors will face a $163.7 million reduction in what they're paid to take care of residents on Medicaid. 
   The legislature voted to increase taxes by imposing $200 million in user fees on our State citizens. Likewise, spending on education in Florida will drop by $131 per student. These cuts come at a time when it is more important than ever to invest in our children who will have to compete in the global economy. 
   H.R. 5818 will establish a $15 billion HUD administered grant program for the purchase and rehabilitation of owner-vacated foreclosed homes with the goal of stabilizing and occupying them as soon as possible. By doing so, we will ensure that the value of the properties and those surrounding them will not continue to free fall. 
   Madam Chairman, my amendment today is very straightforward. It clarifies that nothing in the underlying bill before us today restricts anyone's right to bear arms under the second amendment. This language ensures that those States, localities, and organizations receiving loans and grants under this law cannot, let me repeat, cannot place any restrictions on the properties they purchase or maintain that would infringe upon a person's second amendment rights. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today representing Florida's 16th District in support of title IV of the House rules package to return fiscal responsibility to Congress. 
   As a former businessman, as of a couple of days ago, I cannot overstress the importance of restoring fiscal discipline and accountability to our government. Over the past 6 years, this House has allowed record surpluses to be turned into record deficits that have increased our national debt to a nearly staggering $9 trillion. 
   Earmarks, an important prerogative of this great body, have been abused for the purposes of greed and as a tool to hold onto power, costing Americans billions of their hard-earned money. Make no mistake, our debt is a tax on America's future as it threatens both the security and prosperity of our country. 
   Today we have the opportunity to demonstrate to the American people that we have heard their voices this past November and we are prepared to make our government live within its means, just like every American family. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support title IV.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it's an unfortunate fact of war young American soldiers are not only losing their lives on the battlefield, but many soldiers who survive traumatic combat injuries are returning home with equally serious psychological wounds. Unfortunately, the Veterans Administration has not been given, by this administration, the personnel and the funding necessary to address the problem. 
   A recent series of Washington Post articles followed the stories of several soldiers returning home from service in Iraq who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The articles paint a harrowing picture of the challenges that face these veterans, suicidal patients left in waiting rooms, psychiatric wards with terrible odors and a disconcerting lack of therapy and treatment. 
   Mr. Speaker, last week this House took action to help our military personnel who are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. We passed the largest increase for funding for veterans health care in the VA's history. This includes treatment for PTSD. 
   It is clear that these funds are desperately needed to provide better care for our men and women returning from serving our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1922, the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse Outstanding Natural Area Act. Today is a great day for the towns and communities that live and thrive beneath the light of this magnificent landmark. 
   I want to begin by thanking everyone in the community who worked tirelessly to make this  day a reality. The Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse Outstanding Natural Area Act serves as an example of what local governments working together can do. The commitment to this historical lighthouse from officials and volunteers from Palm Beach County, the Town of Jupiter, the Village of Tequesta, and the Loxahatchee River Historical Society is truly remarkable. 
   I would specifically like to recognize the efforts of Palm Beach County Commissioner Karen Marcus and Mayor Karen Golonka from the town of Jupiter. Their leadership and vision have been invaluable on this project. 
   The Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse is more than a beacon of light that guides mariners to safety; it is a monument to Florida's history and a symbol of our community. Since the lighthouse's construction in 1860, it has played an important role during military conflicts and has facilitated commerce up and down the East Coast. 
   Designed by Lieutenant George Meade, who would later become famous for his service during the Civil War, the light allowed for vessels to safely travel down Florida's coast carrying cargo to new markets in the Caribbean. During World War II, the keeper dimmed the light in order to protect Allied warships traveling off the coast of Florida from German U-boat attacks. Today, the light still guides boaters safely home. 
   The National Landscape Conservation System, and more specifically the Outstanding Natural Area Designation, was created in 2000 by the Department of the Interior in an effort to better meet the management needs of our Nation's public lands and historic treasures. In addition to the better management practices the system promotes, the designation helps to spur tourism and expand educational opportunities in surrounding communities. 
   It is important to note that the area designated by this bill as an Outstanding Natural Area is much more than the lighthouse. H.R. 1922 also seeks to protect and better coordinate the management of the more than 100 acres surrounding the historic structure. This land, like the lighthouse, has historical, cultural, and environmental value. For example, the area was first used by Native Americans over 4,000 years ago. Likewise, in the 17th Century, Europeans first made contact with this area. 
   This lighthouse and the surrounding area, however, is much more than a historical marker. It has become a symbol of this community, woven into the fabric of our culture, even appearing on the town of Jupiter's seal. 
   I recently received a letter from a student at Jupiter High School detailing why the lighthouse is special to her. She says in the letter: ``I often reminisce about the days my parents used to take [me] to the area when I was a child and due to these trips my love for nature and its protection first started to blossom.'' Today, she is a member of the Jupiter High School Environmental Research and Field Studies Academy. It is important that we preserve this structure and continue to give children the opportunity to explore their history and learn about the environment. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Chairman RAHALL and Subcommittee Chairman GRIJALVA for their support throughout this process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1922, the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse Outstanding Natural Area Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1922, the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse Outstanding Natural Area Act of 2007. And I would like to also thank Chairman Rahall and Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and my good friend, Congressman RON KLEIN, for helping me get this bill passed today in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1922 is an important piece of legislation, as it will establish the Jupiter Lighthouse and the surrounding 126 acres as an outstanding natural area, only the second in the country and the only one east of the Mississippi.     
   An outstanding natural area is a congressional designation to protect the unique, scenic, scientific, educational, and recreational contributions of a natural area to this and future generations. 
   One of the reasons why I enthusiastically support the designation is because Florida's rich and diverse history is sometimes overlooked by the millions of tourists who visit from all across America. Of course, it's not hard to see why. With our pristine coastline, trendsetting hotels and restaurants, and ample eco-tourist activities, a typical family vacation in south Florida can pass, and very quickly without having the chance to see all other amazing aspects of Florida's ecology, culture, and history. 
   The Jupiter Lighthouse area is one such example. It is a local and regional icon, and with this new designation, the United States Congress can say that Florida's rich history should be celebrated as an integral part of our larger American history. 
   Situated where the Loxahatchee River and the Indian River Lagoon meet, the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse area is home to a wide range of endangered species of flora and fauna, and it is one of the true scenic gems of south Florida. 
   The lighthouse also tells a rich story of Florida's history and prehistory. Native Americans first used the area around the Jupiter Lighthouse over 4,000 years ago, and Europeans made contact with it in the 17th century. As trade increased in the 1800s, the need for the lighthouse became more urgent as shipwrecks increased off Florida's coast and, in particular, off the dangerous reefs near Jupiter. 
   The United States Congress responded in 1853 by providing $35,000 to establish a lighthouse in Jupiter. Despite an intervening war with the Seminole Nation, the lighthouse was finally completed in 1860, the first built along Florida's coastline. I think it's fitting that 155 years later the same distinguished body is poised to make the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse an outstanding natural area. Doing so will preserve the natural and cultural significance of the area for future generations and will reaffirm that Florida's history is an important part of American history. 
   Again, I'd like to thank my colleagues for passing this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution honoring Max Mayfield, former director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center. 
   In less than 2 years, my home State of Florida suffered damage from four tropical storms and eight hurricanes. Likewise, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall near New Orleans, devastating the gulf coast region of the United States. In the days that followed, we learned that Katrina had left nearly 80 percent of the Crescent City under water, caused an immeasurable amount of damage, displaced thousands of families and resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,500 people. 
   While hurricanes cannot be prevented, accurate storm forecasting has helped millions of people prepare for them and prepare for evacuation. The individual responsible for providing the public with these accurate and easy-to-understand forecasts was Mr. Mayfield, who retired from the National Hurricane Center on January 3 of this year. 
   Born in Oklahoma, Mr. Mayfield began his forecasting career with the Air Force in 1970 after graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in mathematics. In 1972, he received his master's degree in meteorology from Florida State University. 
   Mr. Mayfield joined the National Weather Service as a satellite meteorologist in Miami. During his 34-year career at the center, Mr. Mayfield served as a senior forecaster, deputy director and then director. 
   Mr. Mayfield has received numerous awards for his work in the field of meteorology. In 1996, the American Meteorological Society presented him with the Francis W. Reichelderfer Award for exemplary performance as coordinator of the National Hurricane Center's hurricane preparedness training for emergency preparedness officials and the general public. 
   He has also received an Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2000 National Hurricane Conference for developing and expanding educational opportunities for the State and local emergency management officials. 
   In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has recognized Mr. Mayfield with gold medals for his work during hurricanes Andrew, Isabel, and a silver medal during Hurricane Gilbert.     
   Maybe more important than the many awards, however, are the countless lives that have been saved by the work of Mr. Mayfield and his team at the National Hurricane Center. The Nation is truly grateful to Mr. Mayfield; his wife, Linda; for a lifetime of love and dedication to the National Hurricane Center, and the people in this great country are thankful for his service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Our national parks, forests and public lands are among our Nation's most valuable resources. In fact, one of our country's most unique national parks, the Everglades National Park, is located near my district. It is important that we continue to protect these environmentally sensitive and historically significant areas for future generations to enjoy. I believe that the bill before us today, H.R. 2016, the National Landscape Conservation System Act, does just that. 
   The National Landscape Conservation System, and, more specifically, the Outstanding Natural Area designation which is part of that system, was created in 2000 by the Department of Interior in an effort to better meet the management needs of our Nation's public lands and historic treasures. In addition to the better management practices, the system promotes the designation of areas under the system to help spur tourism and expand educational opportunities in surrounding communities. 
   Mr. Chairman, just a few short weeks ago the House passed H.R. 1922, the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse Outstanding Natural Areas Act. This bill, which I sponsored, would designate this historic lighthouse as an Outstanding Natural Area. It is important to note that the lighthouse is much more than a historical marker. It has become a symbol of our community, woven into the fabric of our culture, even appearing on the Town of Jupiter seal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for bringing this bill, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008, to the floor today. 
   Madam Chairman, 232 years ago, this country fought to gain its political independence. Today, as we approach Independence Day, it is time that we must fight for energy independence. 
   Madam Chairman, as we all know, Americans are suffering because of high gas prices. But some of the recent proposals we have seen in the past week are political opportunism at its worst. Take the proposal to end the moratorium on offshore drilling. Not only could drilling imperil Florida's $65 billion tourist industry, but there is insufficient oil to meaningfully address demand. 
   In 2007, the Energy Department found that drilling off the coast would not add to domestic production before 2030, and that the impact on gas prices would be insignificant. Further, the U.S. proven reserves are approximately 2 percent of the world's supply, yet we continue to be the number one consumer of oil in the world, consuming about 25 percent of the world's production. So anyone who stands here and says we are going to drill our way out of this problem is not being honest with the American public. It is time to get real, and it is time to take action now. 
   While there are no easy answers, there are significant steps that we can take to stabilize gas prices. 
   First, I am a proud cosponsor of the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation. At a time when gas prices are skyrocketing, oil and gas companies should not be allowed to stockpile leases and they should be required to drill on the leases they own. They should use it or lose it. 
   Second, Congress needs to investigate the impact of speculation in the commodities market and the impact that has on the price of oil. It is time to know whether energy speculators are gaming the system to make money at the expense of hard-working Americans. 
   Third, we must continue to bring alternative energy to the country and to Florida. Recently, the farm and energy bills have set the stage for Florida to become the biofuels capital of America. We must continue to invest in cellulosic ethanol so we can become energy independent. 
   Fourth, we must recognize that the reckless fiscal policies of this administration have racked up a $6 trillion debt and this debt is ravaging the value of the dollar. In the past 6 years, this has contributed to a 40 percent devaluation of the dollar, and the fact that oil is a dollar-indexed commodity, the American people now know that when the value of the dollar goes down, the price at the pump goes up. The American people can no longer afford these reckless policies and this reckless deficit spending, and this Congress must make it stop. 
   Lastly, we need to reduce the barriers to importing Canadian oil, which is why I am offering my amendment today which would clarify language in section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 so that it does not apply to Canadian oil. 
   I appreciate the hard work that my colleagues Congressman Boren and Congressman Lampson have already done on this issue. For those of you who don't know, section 526 prevents the U.S. Government from purchasing an unconventional fuel whose carbon footprint is higher than a conventional fuel. Canada has vast supplies of natural gas and has the world's second largest proven reserves of oil in the world, and Canada is the largest supplier of crude oil and refined products to the United States, supplying approximately 13 percent of total U.S. imports. 
   My amendment will clarify that section 526 does not preclude Federal agencies from purchasing generally available fuels, and that includes fuel from Canada's oil sands, refined using existing commercial processes. Through my amendment, we can address both a national energy supply issue and a national security issue. After all, who would you rather import oil from; our good friends up north in Canada, or from the Middle East? 
   The time has come for real solutions, not rhetoric. Today's actions take important steps to help us stop skyrocketing gas prices and put us on the road to energy independence. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I would like to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Florida, and an original cosponsor of this bill for yielding time to me this afternoon. I would also like to recognize the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert) for his support for this important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2779, legislation that I introduced to recognize the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, as the official national museum of the Navy SEALs and their predecessors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am sure that there are many today watching and asking how important is it to create a national museum recognizing brave men and women who have served in underwater demolition teams as frogmen and today as SEALs. In my life, I have had the privilege and honor of knowing and learning about brave men who have served our Nation and have seen the hell of combat, people like Reggie White, my daughter Bailey's grandfather, who was a combat engineer and who, like the men of UDT, had the job of clearing Omaha Beach that fateful day of June 6, 1944. My uncle, Bart Mahoney, a B-17 pilot, was one of the first to be shot down over Germany. Bart survived combat and then survived German concentration camps. Bobbie Maynard saw frontline action in Korea and survived some of the heaviest engagements in the Korean War. My friend, Pat Kelley, was a medic in Vietnam who had to endure the life-and-death realities of combat. These men are heroes. These men have seen the horrors of war and survived them. These men never bragged about their service. In fact, they rarely spoke of it, preferring to let the horrors of their experience rest. This bill is important because it gives voice to the heroes whose stories and honor need to be captured and passed down to future generations. 
   The ground upon which the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum rests was the birthplace of the Navy frogmen. Through World War II, thousands of brave soldiers were trained as members of naval combat demolition units and underwater demolition teams at the site. Since that time, the frogmen have evolved into one of the elite fighting forces in the world, the Navy SEALs. 
   The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum is the only museum dedicated solely to preserving the legacy of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifices of those Navy SEALs and their predecessors, including the underwater demolition teams, naval combat demolition units, Office of Strategic Service maritime units, and Amphibious Scouts and Raiders.     
   I would like to personally thank Captain Mike Howard, a retired Navy SEAL; Ruth McSween; Rolf Snyder; and others, who have made the UDT-SEAL Museum possible. I would also like to thank all the men and women who worked to preserve the legacy of the Naval Special Warfare community. Since the museum was opened in 1985, thousands of visitors have learned of the accomplishments of the Navy SEALs through the museum's artifacts and photos tracing the history of Naval Special Warfare from its beginnings during World War II, through the Navy's SEALs current role in fighting the war on terror and in Iraq. 
   While we are here today to honor the Naval Special Warfare community, I would like to take a moment to remember Petty Officer First Class Robert Richard McRill and all of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving our Nation. Petty Officer McRill, from Lake Placid, Florida, was killed while serving in Iraq as part of SEALs Group Two when his team was hit by an IED. 
   By designating the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum as the official national museum of Navy SEALs and their predecessors, we are honoring Mr. McRill and all the warriors who have served in Naval Special Warfare. I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing the honor, courage, patriotism and sacrifices of the SEALs and their predecessors by supporting this legislation.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a very special American, Mayor Dorothy Geeben, for her incredible service to her community and to wish her a very happy 100th birthday. 
   Ms. Geeben moved to the town of Ocean Breeze Park, a small community on the Indian River, in 1952, and has been a cornerstone of that community ever since. In 1960 she joined the Ocean Breeze Town Council, serving as its president for 31 years, and in 2001 she became the mayor of the town and its 1,000 residents. 
   Today, as Mayor Geeben celebrates her 100th birthday, she is also recognized as the oldest mayor in America.  As mayor, her duties include presiding over town council meetings and signing documents. But to the residents of her village, she is known as a friend to everyone and as the woman who always has a smile on her face. Mayor Geeben has seen her small community through a lot in the last 40 years, including two major hurricanes. 
   I am proud to recognize such a vibrant and dedicated woman. On behalf of Florida's 16th Congressional District, I would like to express my gratitude to Mayor Geeben for her many years of service to our community, and to wish her another happy 100 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today representing Florida's 16th District and a voice in support of title II of the rules of the House relating to ethics reform in the House of Representatives. 
   Today, Democrats, and I hope with the support of our Republican colleagues, will pass an aggressive reform package that keeps our promise to the American people and reforms how we do business here in Washington. These ethics reforms mark an end to a tragic era in American history where the pursuit of power has cost us the faith of the American people. 
   We are here today to rebuild America's trust and make a promise that never again will special interest trump the interest of this great Nation. As Americans communicated on election day, they want political debate and they want the ability to choose. They are not interested in monopolies by either party on political power. 
   As we move forward, we can only solve the key challenges facing this great Nation by reestablishing the credibility, our credibility, to the American people. Under the new House leadership, the era of special interest politics will end and hardworking families, not lobbyists, will have a voice in Congress again. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these important changes to the House ethics rules.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise today to enter into this colloquy with Mr. Boyd to express my support for the House budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. A budget is a reflection of our national priorities. For far too long, the administration's priorities have been misplaced. In fact, the budget submitted by the President earlier this year makes cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and the environment. In addition, it taxes our veterans by requiring them to pay new fees for health care. 
   As a result of this administration's misplaced priorities, the $5.6 trillion projected 10-year surplus that they have inherited has been squandered. As a result, our children and grandchildren are confronted with the challenge of paying back a $9.3 trillion debt. 
   This budget before us today, however, is a good budget for Florida and the Nation. The House budget protects our homeland by rejecting the President's cuts to first responder programs, reinstates funding for the COPS program, and that will put 247 more police on the street in Florida. This budget helps Florida's kids. It provides substantially more money for schools and education than the President's budget. It will allow our schools to hire the highly skilled teachers that over 25,000 Florida children need desperately to help them grow up and compete in the global economy. It rejects the President's irresponsible new fees that he wants to put on the backs of our veterans. It increases health care funding to allow our Veterans Administration to treat the 5.8 million more patients, including 333,000 from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 
   I support this budget because it is fiscally responsible, it balances the budget by 2012, and it adheres to all of the PAYGO rules. Finally, I support this budget because it protects the most vulnerable among us: our Nation's seniors. Specifically, the budget resolution improves support of housing for the elderly. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Spratt for working with me to ensure that the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program is adequately funded. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, no party's immune from corruption. Democrats and Republicans alike share the blame for outrageous ethical lapses that have occurred in Congress. In order to rebuild the trust of the American people and restore integrity to this great House, it is clear that we need to change the way ethics rules are enforced. 
   While I am pleased that the House will consider legislation tonight to strengthen enforcement of ethics rules, I would like to reiterate the need to create an independent ethics office. 
   We need independent ethics enforcement to prevent the kind of rampant corruption that was condoned in the last Congress and hold all Members accountable for questionable and illegal behavior. 
   Creating an independent ethics office with the authority to blow the whistle  on questionable behavior would introduce the impartiality and accountability that has been missing from the enforcement of House ethics rules. It would depoliticize ethics enforcement and get the fox out of the hen house once and for all. 
   We have seen the costs of corruption. It erodes the trust of the American people, hurts our constituents and damages our ability to solve the critical challenges facing our great Nation. 
   In order to offer real solutions to the many challenges facing our country, we need a solid foundation. I'm committed to supporting efforts to hold all Members of Congress to higher standards of ethics and integrity, but it is time for this body to listen to the will of the American people and establish once and for all an independent ethics office.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act. 
   I must say that I'm extremely disappointed that the President and many of my friends on the other side of the aisle have expressed opposition to this legislation. I think it's telling that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has expressed his support for the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President and some of my Republican colleagues have called this plan a bailout. Clearly, the party that claims to represent big business doesn't understand business. 
   This plan requires current mortgage holders who choose to participate, not taxpayers, to realize the loss of at least 15 percent. And by putting homeowners in mortgages with rates and payments that we know they can afford, we are minimizing the risk of future defaults. And by doing so, we are injecting confidence and liquidity back into credit markets, thereby taking an important step to ensure the economy has the capital to begin digging ourselves out of this recession. 
   For anyone who calls this a bailout of risky investors, I would invite them to come to my district and meet some of the thousands of families who are in foreclosure. These are families with dreams and hopes. They, like everyone in this room, were trying as best they could to live the American Dream of homeownership. These are not frauds and cheats. They are firefighters and teachers who were forced into the subprime mortgage market in order to realize their dream. 
   The only moral hazard before us today would be our failure to act. If we are to protect our economy, our families, and the American Dream of homeownership, pass this amendment today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   I want to begin by thanking Chairman Oberstar, Congresswoman Johnson, and my colleague, Ranking Member Mica and their staffs on behalf of Palm Beach, Martin, and St. Lucie County for all the efforts that they have done to ensure that one of our Nation's greatest treasures is preserved for future generations, the Everglades. 
   Seven years ago, Congress authorized the largest environmental restoration plan in the Nation's history, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Despite its broad bipartisan support for the plan in 2000, Congress has not honored its commitment to the Everglades. As a result, this plan once envisioned as an equal partnership between State and Federal Government has become the sole responsibility of Florida, whose citizens have invested over $2 billion. Today, Congress has an historic opportunity to renew its promise to be an equal partner in Everglades restoration by passing the WRDA conference report for the first time in 7 years. 
   The conference report would authorize funding for numerous projects that are a part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, most notably the Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand. The Indian River Lagoon project located in my district is not only critical to the success of the Everglades, but it is critical to the economic well-being to the Treasure Coast of Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to pass this long overdue legislation and renew Congress' commitment to restoring one of our Nation's greatest treasures, the Everglades. And, once passed, I urge my colleagues to join me in telling the President, after 7 years of neglect, it is time to do the people's business and sign this bill into law.

   I would like to thank Chairman Waxman and his staff for their help in moving this very important piece of legislation to the floor. I would also like to acknowledge my distinguished colleague, Mr. Hastings, who also represents Fort Pierce, for his support of the bill, and all the other colleagues who represent the State of Florida who unanimously support this important piece of legislation. 
   CeeCee Ross Lyles was a flight attendant on United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field on September 11. Passengers on the flight, along with CeeCee and other flight attendants, fought back against the hijackers after learning that other planes had been flown into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
   Shortly before Flight 93 crashed, CeeCee called her husband, Lorne, and told him she loved him and she loved her children. 
   CeeCee was born and raised in Fort Pierce where she served as a police officer for 6 years. In those years as a police officer, she had worked her way from patrol officer to detective, and was respected for her willingness to tackle fleeing criminals. 
   Fulfilling a lifelong goal to travel, she became a United Airlines flight attendant in 2000, where she served with distinction. 
   CeeCee had a true and giving spirit. She loved her volunteer work at a women's shelter that two of her aunts helped found in Fort Pierce. Through her work at the shelter she served as a role model, showing women that they could make their own way if they tried hard enough. 
   I am proud to name this post office in honor of a true American hero, CeeCee Ross Lyles. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring this most worthy hero.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (SECTION 202 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives has the ability to improve the lives of thousands of seniors across the country with the passage of H.R. 2930, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2007. As our elderly population grows, the need for affordable housing will also increase. In 2005, there were approximately 37 million Americans over the age of 65. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of seniors is expected to grow rapidly during the next few decades. In addition, today's seniors are facing economic uncertainty. In my home State of Florida, the toxic cocktail of rising gas prices, skyrocketing property taxes and exorbitant homeowners insurance has forced seniors to make difficult choices between paying their mortgage, putting food on the table or purchasing lifesaving medication. 
   Despite this increase in demand, the number of affordable housing units is shrinking. According to the Joint Center for Housing, for every unit of affordable housing constructed, two are lost either by the conversion of affordable housing to market rate housing or by sponsors of section 202 housing opting out of the program when their contracts expire. 
   In 2002, Congress created a bipartisan commission to study the need for affordable housing and supportive services for the elderly. In the commission's report to Congress entitled ``A Quiet Crisis in America,'' they stated that ``this Nation, despite competing demands for national resources, must respond to the critical need for affordable housing and home and community-based supportive services, with a substantial financial commitment and effective policies.'' The report also concluded that ``all seniors, no matter what their individual circumstances and resources, should be able to continue to live where they prefer regardless of their income, with the services they need to maintain personal dignity and quality of life.'' 
   One of the most important responsibilities we have as a society is to ensure that our seniors, who have done everything our Nation has asked them to do, have a safe and affordable place to live. The Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act is a step in achieving this goal. This important piece of legislation will give the owners of 202 facilities the ability to leverage the property's equity, access much-needed capital and benefit from low interest rates from private lenders. By doing so, this legislation will ensure that these facilities are preserved and improved to meet the changing needs of seniors. 
   In addition, the bill allows for funding to be used to increase the services that section 202 communities provide for their residents, allowing them to live a more independent life. Finally, this bill will assist seniors living in older section 202 facilities by extending them rental assistance. This provision will allow owners to preserve these properties without the risk of displacing poor residents. 
   I have seen firsthand how important these facilities are to our communities. I visited Villa Assumpta in Jensen Beach, Florida, a section 202 facility run by Catholic Charities, and Presbyterian Homes of Port Charlotte, Florida, operated by the Presbyterian Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. I have met with the residents and I have heard their life stories, residents like Ruth Justice. Mrs. Justice lived in a mobile home in Stuart, Florida, for almost 40 years until Hurricane Wilma ripped the roof off of her home. Fortunately, Ruth was able to escape from the hurricane with her piano, trumpets and other instruments she and her husband had collected over the years. However, no matter how much she loved her music and her musical instruments, it couldn't ease the financial burden that she faced with a new place which ate up her entire monthly Social Security check. Ruth felt like she had no place to turn. Thank God for Catholic Charities and Villa Assumpta. 
   Fortunately, Ruth was one of the lucky ones. For seniors in need of low-income housing who qualify for one of Villa Assumpta's 99 units, waits can be more than 2 years. I was moved by stories like Ruth's and how much this housing means to our seniors. After years of working to live the American Dream, many of these seniors find themselves with monthly incomes of $800 or less. Without the section 202 housing, where would Ruth and her friends be? Where are the seniors living tonight that are on Villa Assumpta's 2-year waiting list? On our streets? We have a responsibility to make sure that we provide affordable housing to our seniors and we can start by passing this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act is an example of what this Congress can achieve when it works together in a bipartisan fashion. First, the bill was reported out of the Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote. Secondly, following the committee's consideration of H.R. 2930, we worked closely with my colleague from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) to ensure that the bill meets the needs of rural communities. 
   Under current law, HUD is required to reserve 15 percent of program funds for the development of units in non-metropolitan areas. Unfortunately, the small number of units that are reserved do not provide an adequate incentive for developers to undertake such projects. As a result, rural communities often face severe shortages of section 202 units. The new provision added by Mrs. Capito will provide HUD with greater flexibility by allowing the Department to allocate funding for  non-metropolitan units on a regional or national scale. I would like to thank her for her work to further strengthen the bill and to ensure that all of our communities, whether they be urban or rural, have access to the program. 
   Mr. Speaker, the section 202 program is a great example of how the Federal Government can work with religious institutions to provide needed services to our communities. Many of the section 202 facilities are run by religious organizations. I am proud that this legislation is being supported by more than 30 organizations that provide housing to the elderly, including Catholic Charities, Lutheran Services of America and United Jewish Communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to insert into the Record a letter from these groups expressing their strong support for H.R. 2930. 
   H.R. 2930--Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2007 Endorsement Letter 
   We, the undersigned organizations, write in strong support of H.R. 2930, the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2007. Under the current Section 202 law, the development and preservation of senior housing can be time-consuming and bureaucratic at a time when demand for supportive senior housing is exploding and the loss of affordable housing exceeds new construction. We believe that this legislation is sorely needed to streamline and simplify the development and preservation of affordable, supportive, senior housing for increased participation by not-for-profit developers, private lenders, investors, and state and local funding agencies. 
   The current Section 202 program is a capital advance grant for the construction of new supportive senior communities with a project rental assistance contract to subsidize very low-income elderly renters. Even though the award now comes in the form of a grant, HUD engages in a protracted ``underwriting'' process that often increases red tape, delays the development process, and results in escalated costs, particularly when Section 202 funds are combined with the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. To promote efficiency and streamline the processing of new developments, the proposed legislation will delegate the processing of the Section 202 capital advance grants to state or local entities with expertise in housing development. We know that this will ensure that supportive senior housing will be open more quickly to serve our Nation's most vulnerable seniors, particularly in combination with tax credits. 
   Many older Section 202 facilities are in need of repair, rehabilitation or modernization, but most of them do not have the funds to retrofit their buildings to accommodate the present and future needs of their residents. The current Section 202 statute permits Section 202 providers to refinance ad use the substantial equity in these projects to fund the much needed rehabilitation, extend the lives of these properties, and provide an enhanced supportive environment for seniors as they age in place. Unfortunately, these preservation deals have been stymied by illogical decisions from HUD. Title II of H.R. 2930 would make a number of technical changes in the statute to enhance the ability of organizations to recapitalize and preserve existing Section 202 housing and enhance supportive services. 
   This legislation would require rather than permit HUD to approve reconfiguration of obsolete efficiencies into 1-bedroom units where providers are experiencing high vacancy rates, allow the use of excess proceeds to further the non-profits' housing and services mission, permit the subordination of debt and other important tools that would make preservation easier to achieve. Most importantly, H.R. 2930 will establish a new project based rental assistance program to allow those Section 202 properties built between 1959 and 1974, the oldest segment of the 202 inventory, that do not currently have rental assistance to be refinanced and rehabilitated and receive project based rental assistance. This will enable sponsors to prevent displacement and continue serving low-income seniors. 
   We want to thank Congressman Mahoney for introducing this important legislation. We believe these reforms are absolutely necessary to ensure more units are built and preserved more quickly. 
   The changes this legislation offers represent a comprehensive federal policy change to meet the affordable housing needs of low-income seniors. Without these reforms, our most vulnerable seniors will face displacement, homelessnes s, or premature institutionalization. We encourage you to support H.R. 2930 and a national commitment to the development and preservation of supportive, affordable senior housing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I want to thank the gentlelady for giving me the opportunity to speak on such an important issue. Before I go with my remarks, I would just like to point out that the issue of FISA has to do with making sure that the President gets immunity, not the telecom companies, and the rush to try to do something is really disappointing when we are a Nation of rule of law, and it is important for the American people to understand exactly what happened here after 9/11 with the telecommunications companies giving information to the President illegally. 
   Having said that, I represent the 16th Congressional District of Florida. My district is home to a subtropical climate and rich soil. It is the largest and most varied producer of the biomass needed to produce cellulosic ethanol. 
   Unfortunately, some of my rural areas are also the poorest in Florida, where we have high unemployment and an almost 40 percent dropout rate in our high schools. Many of our rural youth don't see that getting their high school diploma will make a difference in their lives. 
   Thanks to Congress, the day is coming when America can turn its back on foreign oil because we had the courage to create a biofuels industry here in America, a business that will transform rural America. 
   Thanks to Chairman Rangel, H.R. 5351 helps to make this vision a reality by giving gasoline companies a tax credit for blending cellulosic ethanol. This credit, in addition to the energy and farm bills we passed last year, will get Wall Street to open their wallets and invest in cellulosic ethanol businesses throughout rural America. It will give our rural youth hope and the opportunity to have a job with a future.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 161 and the underlying bill, H.R. 976, the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007, which I am proud to have cosponsored. 
   This important piece of legislation is much more than a tax cut for America's small businesses. It is an investment in our Nation's workers, especially those from economically disadvantaged areas, as well as our veterans. 
   Specifically, the underlying bill extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for 1 year. This important tax credit, originally enacted in 1996, has been an important component in an effort to move people from welfare to work, while gaining on-the-job experience. 
   H.R. 976 also fosters entrepreneurship in our communities, an important variable in keeping Americans competitive in a global economy by making it more affordable to own and operate a small business. This Congress and the individuals who have brought this bill to passage today bring their ideas, ambitions and knowledge and support of entrepreneurs and small business. 
   Finally, I applaud Chairman Rangel and the members of the Ways and Means Committee for working within the House PAYGO rules to produce a revenue-neutral tax bill. H.R. 976 is a bipartisan example of a fiscally responsible tax measure that takes into account America's values and priorities. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt the rule and the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I thank my friend, the distinguished gentleman, for yielding time to me this afternoon. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Florida's 16th Congressional District in support of House Resolution 97, providing cost accountability for the Iraq war. 
   If we take a look at what has happened over these past 5 years, America has rid Iraq of a brutal dictator. America has given the Iraqi people a chance to create their own democracy, and we have invested over $400 billion and more than 3,000 American lives in securing their country. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time for the Iraqis to step up and to take control of their destiny and their own security. And it is imperative that any future American financial expenditures in the Iraq war be subject to accountability and transparency. 
   An estimated $9 billion of Iraqi reconstruction funds are missing. According to a January 2005 report by the Office of the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction, these $9 billion have gone missing because of inefficiencies and bad management.     
   For the past 4 years, Congress has not exercised the oversight and accountability necessary to ensure that our money is being used effectively to support our troops to achieve our objectives in Iraq. We have paid billions of dollars to private contractors for work in Iraq; at the same time, the reports have uncovered waste, fraud, abuse, and even possible war profiteering by some of these contractors. 
   In a war already lacking manpower, resources, and international support needed to maximize our chance of success, it is criminal that billions of dollars are unaccounted for. Congressional oversight is needed to make sure that our money is used to support our troops, not lost to profiteering and fraud. 
   House Resolution 97 would require that future Iraq spending is marked by transparency and accountability, instead of systemic waste, fraud, and abuse. The resolution calls for the creation of a Truman Commission to investigate how contracts are awarded, increases transparency so we know how Iraq war funds are spent, demands that fiscal requests for fiscal year 2008 and later go through the normal appropriations process instead of emergency supplementals, and calls for resources to be used to improve Iraqi assumption of policing operations. 
   Madam Speaker, these criteria are long overdue. I encourage my colleagues to support House Resolution 97 to ensure that transparency and accountability are the hallmarks of any future funding of the Iraq war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I've read the President's reasons for vetoing this farm bill, and it's clear that even though he owns a ranch, he's not a rancher. It's clear he doesn't understand that to have national security, America needs food security. It's clear that while the White House whines about crop subsidies, that his administration's failed economic policies have resulted in $4 per gallon diesel and skyrocketing fertilizer costs that are driving farmers in Florida out of business. 
   Although not perfect, this farm bill, for the first time, gives Florida agriculture some of the monies we need to help market and protect our crops. It ensures that our Nation's hungry children and seniors get Florida's fresh fruit and vegetables. It invests in conservation that will speed up our efforts to save the Everglades. 
   Finally, this farm bill, in combination with the energy bill, provides rural Florida a new beginning by breaking the corn ethanol monopoly, and ensuring that Florida, the biggest biomass producing State in the Nation, takes its rightful place as a leader in renewable energy production. 
   I call on my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to vote to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (IN HONOR OF CAPTAIN ADAM SNYDER -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Captain Adam Snyder of Fort Pierce, Florida, who passed away on December 5, 2007, from battle injuries suffered in Iraq. 
   Adam was 26 years old. 
   Captain Snyder belonged to the 101st Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He was the fourth generation Snyder to proudly serve the United States military. Adam was serving his second tour in Iraq. 
   Adam was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, where one of his professors, John McVan, described Adam as ``one of the best and brightest I've ever had.'' 
   Adam's brilliance was not limited to his military career. He impressed whomever he encountered in all walks of life. Adam looked forward to returning home and pursuing his dream of acting. His modesty, bravery, and humanity are qualities rarely found in such great measure in one man. 
   Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart but great pride that I stand here today in this sacred hall to honor Adam and his family. I want to thank Adam's family for giving America a hero who went to work every day defending his country so that we can enjoy liberty. 
   Adam, our Nation for all eternity will be in your debt for the ultimate sacrifice you have made.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4008, the Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act. 
   I would like to begin by thanking Members of both sides of the aisle for helping bring this commonsense legislation to the floor, including Ranking Member Bachus, Representative Melissa Bean, Michele Bachmann and  many others. I would also like to thank my chairman, Representative Barney Frank, and his staff for their efforts in bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2003 Congress passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the FACT Act, to ensure that Americans could continue to rely on the efficiencies of the 21st century financial and credit system while being protected from identity theft, credit card fraud and other financial crimes. 
   This important law has given consumers new and important rights. For example, the FACT Act provides consumers with the right to obtain one free copy of their credit record from each of the three major credit bureaus every 12 months. In addition, this legislation created the Financial Literacy and Education Commission to better help Americans understand and manage their finances. 
   One provision in the FACT Act was intended to enhance consumer protection from credit card fraud by limiting the amount of information printed on receipts from a credit card or debit card transaction. Today, when consumers go into a convenience store, restaurant or retailer, they will notice that their credit card receipt does not contain the full credit card number. This small but important change to their credit card receipts helps prevent criminals from obtaining the receipt and using it to make fraudulent purchases.     
   Unfortunately, this provision, as drafted, has caused a great deal of confusion and is now at the center of hundreds of lawsuits all over the country. Specifically, it required that ``no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last five digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.'' The overwhelming majority of businesses believed that they were in compliance with this provision of the law by truncating the card number and printing the expiration date of the credit card. 
   Furthermore, the publicity surrounding the passage of the act, whether it was press accounts of the President's statement at the signing of the subsequent Federal Trade Commission press release describing the new requirements of the bill, pointed entirely to the truncation of the credit card number. 
   I would like point out that experts agree that the truncation of the card number, by itself, regardless of whether or not the expiration date was redacted from the receipt, removes the single most crucial piece of information that a criminal would need to perpetrate account fraud. 
   I can understand the shock that many of these businesses must have felt when, thinking that they had taken all the steps necessary to protect their customers and comply with the law, they were later served notice of a pending class action lawsuit against them accusing them of violating the FACT Act because they had failed to redact the expiration date in addition to truncating the credit card number. 
   When you consider that the law levies between a $100 and $1,000 fine for each credit card receipt, the amount of liability threatens to bankrupt healthy, successful businesses. 
   While most, if not all these companies, have quickly resolved the issue by instructing their point-of-sale vendors to also redact the expiration date, they continue to face these lawsuits. Not only have these lawsuits been filed against large corporations, they have been filed against small businesses. 
   Last month I was contacted by Arthur Cullen. Mr. Cullen and his wife, Nieves, are the owners of Havana Harry's Restaurant in south Florida. Mr. Cullen states in his letter that he and his wife began his business with a dream and some savings. 
   Today, Havana Harry's employs 75 people and serves more than 4,000 people on a weekly basis. Like so many others, Mr. Cullen believed he was complying with the FACT Act by truncating the credit card number. Unfortunately, a lawsuit was filed against his business because he also failed to delete the expiration date. As a result of the lawsuit, Mr. Cullen is concerned about the future of Havana Harry's. 
   My legislation is designed to provide relief to people like Mr. Cullen, proud entrepreneurs and small business owners, who did everything they thought was necessary to comply with the FACT Act. 
   H.R. 4008 makes a technical correction to the FACT Act to free hundreds of businesses from potential exposure to statutory damages that could total hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars solely because of their past harmless failure to redact the expiration date from an otherwise FACT Act complaint receipt. 
   Let me be clear, not one of these suits has alleged any harm to the consumer. In the event that a consumer does experience identity theft, account fraud, or some other harm, my legislation preserves a consumer's right to sue. 
   Finally, H.R. 4008 does not eliminate a business' obligation to properly truncate the account number or to redact the expiration date from its receipts, and it does not protect merchants who printed more than the account number permitted by the FACT Act. 
   With a struggling economy in Florida and across America, the last thing businesses and consumers need are lawsuits that needlessly drive up costs. These abusive lawsuits will likely result in higher prices to the public and could even result in bankruptcies and more job losses. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for this commonsense fix to a problem that has the potential to put out of business thousands of successful businesses which will ultimately hurt, rather than protect, consumers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would just say that time is running out. I also would like to thank Senator Schumer for dropping the corresponding legislation in the Senate and I ask my Senate colleagues to act quickly because small businesses need relief immediately.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel and reaffirm the friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. 
   Since its establishment 60 years ago, the State of Israel has rebuilt a nation and developed a new and dynamic democratic society. The Israeli government and its people have created a thriving economic, political, cultural and intellectual life despite the heavy costs of war, terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and economic boycotts against the country. 
   The Israeli people have established a nation of diverse cultures with a deep connection to their historical past while at the same time forging their place in today's global economy. Israel has proven its commitment to creating a better global community by becoming a world leader in technology. 
   On Israel's 60th anniversary it is important to recognize the achievements of the Israeli people and of the Jewish community whose faith and commitment to democracy is a beacon of hope for peace and stability. America's commitment to Israel reflects our support for those nations that share our values of liberty and equality.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I thank my good friend from Arkansas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Florida's 16th Congressional District and am a proud voice in support of restoring fiscal discipline to Congress. I am very proud to be a Blue Dog. 
   When I was thinking about what I wanted to talk to the American people about tonight, I decided that the best way to share my feelings, my views in terms of fiscal discipline and why I am a Blue Dog, gets back to something that is near and dear to me. 
   Just a week and a half ago, I was a businessman. I had never held an elected office. And the reason I decided to leave private life and come to Congress is because I was worried about government's out-of-control spending that was hurting our economy. More importantly, that was hurting our innovative economy, and to make it very simple for all, was hurting the future of my daughter and all of the children of this country if we don't get our fiscal house in order. 
   When I take a look at the Blue Dog plan, the 12-point plan for budget reform, I look at the points and I think back to my experience as a businessman. There are several things that I would like to highlight tonight that I can relate to, and every American involved in a business can relate to. 
   The first point is point number one on the plan which requires a balanced budget. In business it is requiring a profit. A balanced budget is something that makes sense for government, it makes sense for business, and the Blue Dogs are proposing that we make a balanced budget a constitutional amendment requiring that this House, that this Congress, balance the books. 
   The second thing I would like to talk about is point number four which requires agencies to put their fiscal house in order. That is really getting into financial control. As my colleague from Illinois, Congressperson BEAN, pointed out, 16 of 23 major Federal agencies can't issue a simple audit of the books. That is unacceptable in business, and that should be unacceptable here in Congress. 
   What the Blue Dogs propose is that we would propose legislation that would freeze any Federal agency that can't properly balance their books. We would not allow it in business, and we shouldn't allow it here in Congress. 
   Point five, we want to make Congress tell taxpayers how much they are spending. This gets to a concept in business called management accountability. What the Blue Dogs are proposing is that any bill that calls for more than $50 million in new spending must be put to a roll call vote. By putting it to a roll call vote, what that does is it forces every Member of Congress to stand up and go on record for their constituents to see how fiscally responsible they are. 
   The next point I would like to highlight is point number ten which requires honest cost estimates for every bill that Congress votes on. 
   In business, we call this a business plan. Prior to undertaking any new endeavor, what a competent manager would ask for is a plan that sets out the goals and objectives of the proposed venture, in this case a proposed piece of legislation. 
   And then as part of that plan, he would ask to have a cost estimate of what the investment would be. That is a very important issue. 
   What the Blue Dogs propose is that every conference report and bill that comes to the floor of the House be accompanied by a cost estimate prepared  by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.     
   These are just a few of the points, a few of the agenda points that the Blue Dog coalition is working on. 
   Let me reiterate what many of my colleagues have said. Fiscal responsibility is a critical issue. It is an issue of competitiveness. It is an issue of making sure that our children are not being taxed with runaway budget deficits. People that say it doesn't matter or it is not as important as a percentage of GDP are wrong, and I am proud to be part of a group, the Blue Dog Coalition, that is committed, Mr. Speaker, to addressing these issues in the 110th Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back to my good friend from Arkansas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I also would like to address the question, but from a slightly different perspective, and that has to do with again one of the reasons I think the Democrats are now in control of the House and the Blue Dogs have such a great opportunity, and it gets back to a fundamental issue of ethics, it gets back to a fundamental issue of values. 
   It is very clear that this House for the last 6 years has been operating under a different set of standards and ethics than the American people. It is very clear that this House does not take responsibility for its work in terms of the bills and the cost of the bills and the budget. These are not our values. 
   What I would say to my parents tonight is this, and that is this Congress is committed to fiscal responsibility and this coalition is committed to fiscal responsibility. It is very important that the American people understand that their elected officials have to operate under the same rules that they have to operate under when they balance their checkbook every month around the kitchen table. That is important, that we achieve that kind of fiscal discipline. It is important that the American people understand that this Congress is committed to it.

   On my first day, I took an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. Tonight we will vote to protect our Fourth Amendment rights by passing this bill. Never again will we give any person the ability to conduct surveillance on American citizens without court approval. 
   America must be vigilant in our fight against terrorism. Congress has a duty to give our intelligence agencies the tools they need to hunt down those who threaten our Nation while protecting the constitutional rights of every American. 
   The RESTORE Act gives the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence the flexibility they need to pursue the terrorists, while keeping the checks and balances enshrined in our Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that our intelligence community have the resources necessary to protect America. It is also critical that Americans are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures. This bill accomplishes both of these objectives. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the RESTORE Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (HOMEOWNERS' DEFENSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today is a turning point for how the Federal Government responds to natural catastrophes. Today, the House of Representatives has the ability to ensure that homeowners across the country will have access to affordable property insurance. More importantly, we have the opportunity to protect and preserve the American Dream of home ownership with the passage of H.R. 3355, the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007. 
   Before I begin summarizing the national catastrophe insurance crisis affecting the 16th Congressional District of Florida, I want to reiterate that this is a national problem. Let me be clear: Congress has been forced to act because private markets for homeowners insurance have failed. The issue is not the industry's ability to pay claims or write policies. It is the American's ability to purchase affordable homeowners insurance. 
   This legislation we are considering today, the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007, is essential, as an individual's home is the single biggest investment an average American has, and it is vital that we protect it. 
   North America has the greatest occurrence of natural disasters of any continent. And thanks to global warming, science is forecasting that we are going to see the incidence and severity of disasters increase. 
   I am proud that the legislation we are considering today preserves the private homeowners insurance industry. H.R. 3355 recognizes that no one got into the insurance business to underwrite a catastrophic event, whether it be an act of war or an act of Mother Nature. The bill gives the insurance industry the ability to operate without fear of insolvency due to a mega-catastrophe we all know will happen. However, because no one can predict when the next earthquake, hurricane or tornado will strike, the industry is forced to plan and incur the expense necessary to cover a 1-in-200 year event every year. 
   The program established by this legislation is voluntary. Each State will have the opportunity to assess its risk of natural catastrophes. After analyzing its exposure to natural catastrophes, a State can choose to participate or not. 
   H.R. 3355 is fiscally responsible. The legislation sets a historic precedent. No longer will the American taxpayer have to foot the cost of a natural disaster with an expensive government bailout. As I said earlier, we know that these catastrophic events will happen. The Homeowners' Defense Act ensures that we plan for them in a fiscally responsible manner and does not cost the American taxpayer a dime, while ensuring that homeowners take personal responsibility for their choice to live in areas prone to more frequent natural catastrophes. 
   In 2004 and 2005, natural disasters resulted in approximately $89 billion in privately insured catastrophic losses. Science tells us that these disasters, their severity and frequency, are going to increase and have caused the insurance industry to adjust their models for insuring these events. As a result, insurers are pulling out or reducing their exposure in disaster-prone areas of the country. In some cases, new companies encouraged to enter the market do not have the financial strength to pay claims following a natural disaster because they are undercapitalized. Likewise, larger insurance companies have created smaller State subsidiaries for the purpose of limiting their liability. This problem has concentrated risk in States, further complicating the problem. 
   In some situations, like in my home State of Florida, the market has deteriorated so drastically homeowners can't get insurance, regardless of price. In an effort to address this growing problem, Florida has had to step up to avert an economic disaster by creating a State-owned insurance company. Today, unfortunately, the citizens of my State are the owners of the biggest homeowners insurance company in Florida with over 30 percent of the market. 
   Lost insurance capacity is not the only issue confronting homeowners today. Families have seen their insurance premiums skyrocket. The toxic cocktail of rising gas prices, health care costs, and homeowners insurance have created a vicious cycle of terror for our seniors living on fixed incomes and our middle-class families struggling to provide for their children. 
   Just yesterday, I spoke with a single mother in Stuart, Florida, who is making a good income of approximately $60,000 per year. She told me that, without warning, her monthly payment went up almost $500 per month. She is struggling to save money to put her daughter through college, and she's fearful she won't be able to pay her bills. 
   The Financial Services Committee has held numerous hearings this year on this issue. During these hearings, several facts became clear. The risk posed by natural catastrophes is not going away. The damage caused by disasters will keep growing, and insurance premiums are likely to remain high. 
   As Congressman Klein noted, the Homeowners' Defense Act is a two-pronged approach designed to address the property insurance crisis, which I have outlined, and ensures a stable insurance market that will give States impacted by severe natural catastrophes the ability to help their citizens rebuild their homes and their lives. 
   Title II of the bill, ``The National Homeowners Insurance Stabilization Program,'' extends Federal loans to States impacted by severe natural disasters. These loans, which will be paid back by the States, will allow a State's catastrophe program the ability to cover its liability in the event it is not fully funded at the time of the disaster. 
   Because the legislation utilizes private capital markets and a loan program that requires repayment in affected States, it eliminates cross-subsidization. Taxpayers will not be asked to subsidize homeowners that choose to live in high-risk communities. 
   In a letter dated November 6, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners stated that H.R. 3355 provides a viable solution for the State and Federal governments to work together to address this dilemma and address the natural catastrophe threat. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Chairman Frank, Congressman Kanjorski and Congresswoman Maxine Waters, as well as their staff, for their continued commitment to America's homeowners. Their support and leadership has been essential to making this legislation a reality. I would also like to thank my colleagues from Florida, Representatives Ginny Brown-Waite and Adam Putnam. Their input on this legislation has been invaluable and serves as an example of what Congress can achieve when we work together in a bipartisan manner.  
   I would ask my colleagues to stand up for the American homeowner and taxpayer by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 3355.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank everybody for having this open debate today and discussing something that is very important to people across this country. This is all about the dream of homeownership. This is about markets working. This is about stabilizing the insurance market so that people who go to work every day can fulfill their dream of homeownership. 
   What we have today is a situation that is understandable. We have a situation where as a result of an increase in the severity and the frequency of natural disasters, insurance companies are prudently increasing premiums. What they are seeing is, as a result of this, an unfunded liability in the billions that they have no other recourse but to either leave markets or raise rates so high that working families can't afford their homeowners insurance. 
   Today, we have the ability to help those people; and we have a very special opportunity, because we can do something here in Washington, DC that we can all be proud of when we go back home, and that is we can fix a problem and do it responsibly. We can end the bailout. We can end the cycle of writing checks and expecting nobody to pay them back, which is exactly what has happened over the years with Katrina and Wilma and other major storms across the Nation. 
   I hope that everybody takes a very close look at this. Many people have described this as a payoff or a bailout for Florida. This is not. This is responsible legislation. It not only expands  the market for private insurance; it makes sure that States have the ability to get money to people after a disaster so they can get in their homes and so they can keep their communities alive. Finally, it is responsible because it encourages mitigation and it encourages building codes. It supports the idea of responsible development. 
   In conclusion, I want to thank my dear friend Congressman Klein and the journey over the last year to the week when we both got elected to Congress and came here with the hope of trying to solve this problem and being here today. 
   I want to thank my staff. I want to thank Patrick Givens for all the work that he has done. I want to thank Garrett Donovan, who has done an amazing job, and the complete staff of the Financial Services Committee. 
   In closing, I want to thank Barney Frank and the leadership for understanding that this is about people. This is not about companies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I'd like to join in support of my friend here from Florida (Mr. Klein) in opposing this amendment. 
   The point I'd like to make is very simple, and that is, the whole purpose of the bill is to stabilize the private homeowners insurance marketplace. And the goal of the bill is to work with the industry to continually find ways to expand the market so that the market takes the responsibility. 
   Right now, the problem that we're facing in the homeowners insurance market is unfunded liability, where we have the opportunity or the specter of a disaster, where the combination of States and the insurance industry do not have the financial wherewithal to pay claims. 
   The purpose of this bill in the first title is to try to work with States to consolidate risk in order to expand the private market's activity so that it can handle these claims. 
   So when the gentleman from Illinois proposes to arbitrarily set a 1-in-100-year mark, what it's doing is it's running counter to the goal of the legislation, which is to get the private insurance companies to take on more and more of the responsibility. 
   So with that, I think that the bill that we have right now recognizes that there needs to be some variability in some cases. One in 100 years, depending on States, might be too little; and in some cases it might be too much. 
   So, therefore, I would urge that this amendment be defeated. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I would just like to also point out, too, that after an event of a natural catastrophe, I don't think it's in anybody's best interest in terms of getting people back in their homes and preserving communities to get into an administrative argument as to whether or not a particular loan has been paid or repaid based on what's going on between the State and a particular community that's in need of funding. 
   So although I appreciate the gentleman's point, I think that the danger here is that there could be a lot of ways that people could look at this issue and determine that there is a conflict between the way a State looks at a particular loan. 
   And it's not just catastrophe loans, as the gentleman's amendment talks about. It's any loan where there might be a conflict between the State and the Federal Government. And all I can tell you is that I don't think you would want to put your citizens in a bureaucratic mess when they are out of their homes and they need to get back in and that we need to save their communities.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. I appreciate the work the gentlelady from Florida has done on helping us do this bill. And I agree with her that I am also concerned, and we are concerned in this legislation about price-gouging. 
   Again, the issue is what's the role of the Federal Government with regard to this legislation? And the problem that we have with her amendment is that what she is proposing is to define for each State the definition of price-gouging. And while we accept and support the idea of encouraging legislation, the problem is when you take the next step and you start defining what price-gouging is, it's a relative standard that may or may not fit the circumstance; and, so, therefore, it may  be too low or it may be too high. So what we would prefer to do is we would prefer to let the experts who are running the program make the determination and make sure that what we're not doing is we're not putting and dictating to the States what they should or should not be doing with regards to that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his amendment. I just want to make a couple of comments. 
   This is a problem that has been afflicting Americans now for over a decade. This Congress has looked at this problem for over a decade. For over a decade, this Congress has failed to do anything. And right now, as we are sitting here in the comfort of this great Chamber, there is a grandmother in Okeechobee, Florida, who has to sit down and write a check tonight to pay her mortgage, her insurance, and her property taxes. Let me just say this for all of the people, the millions of people right now who are afraid that they cannot make that payment. The idea after a decade of do nothing to continue to recommend to do nothing is unconscionable. It is also unconscionable that when Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana and Mississippi, of the $110 billion bailout, that the people in the State of Connecticut coughed up $1.39 billion to pay off a disaster. This has to stop. 
   What the gentleman from Connecticut is trying to do is he is trying to kill this legislation with this amendment. He is trying to hurt the people in Okeechobee right now who are suffering, trying to figure out how to pay their bills. I would urge people to defeat this amendment because this is not the people's business. What we need to do is we need to act responsibly. We need to take care of people who should be able to live in their homes and afford their homes. Having a home and home ownership is the American Dream. It is important that we protect it. The time has long passed, over a decade, the time has long passed for study. Today, this House has the opportunity to take action. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my concerns with H.R. 3996, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007. Today, the American people were offered a false choice--tax families today or tax their children in the future. 
   This year the House of Representatives has twice passed alternative minimum tax relief bills intended to provide more than 23 million American's with tax relief. These two previous pieces of legislation were fiscally responsible. By closing tax loopholes, the House of Representatives sought to ensure that we did not pass the cost of this temporary fix along to our children and grandchildren. 
   Let me be clear. With passage of this bill tonight, President Bush and the Republicans have decided to mortgage our children's future and add to the national debt. 
   I will reluctantly vote for this legislation because without an AMT fix, more than 46,500 people in the 16th Congressional District of Florida will be burdened with a tax increase. These are hardworking families already struggling with skyrocketing property taxes, staggering homeowners insurance premiums, rising mortgage payments and out of control gas prices. These are seniors already forced to choose between purchasing life saving medications and putting food on the table. Simply stated, my constituents do not need the burden of an additional tax increase. 
   In closing, I call upon the House of Representatives to return to fiscal responsibility and Pay As You Go rules. Like many of my fellow Blue Dog colleagues, I believe we have a moral obligation not to pass our debt along to future generations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Thank you, Chairman Cardoza. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Peterson and thanking Chairman Cardoza for their tireless resolve to bring this historic legislation to a vote today. I also want to thank Commissioner Bronson and my good friends and colleagues, Allen Boyd and Adam Putnam, for their work in delivering to the ranchers, farmers and growers of Florida the best farm bill in history. 
   This farm bill, in combination with the energy bill already signed into law, completes the foundation upon which Florida will build a biofuels industry that will power America's engines and make us more secure. It means more jobs for our State. It means our children will be able to stay in rural Florida and have jobs for the future. This farm bill, after more than 70 years, begins to give Florida's growers and farmers parity with commodity crops. 
   In Florida, we grow over 270 different varieties of specialty crops. I welcome this $1.3 billion investment in new programs that supports research, pest management, trade promotion and nutrition for the industry. 
   Finally, this bill makes an investment in our environment by making an additional $7.9 billion available for conservation programs. This bill brings farmers and environmentalists together to protect our land, our waters, and one of our Nation's greatest treasures, the Everglades. 
   As a Blue Dog Democrat, I am especially proud that we have been able to accomplish all of the above without having to raise taxes or go into debt. We don't have to mortgage the farm to pay for this farm bill. 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Thank you, Chairman Cardoza, for all of your work on behalf of the farmers and growers of Florida.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Chairman, as a freshman Member of this Congress and someone who until this past January had never held political office, I came to Washington determined to change the culture of this august body. I believed that we could work together and, in doing so, put the interests of the American people over the political interests of party or the special interests of powerful lobbyists. 
   Just a few days ago at a press conference, I proudly stood and thanked my Republican colleagues in supporting a bill that clearly was a victory for American agriculture. It was a victory for our growers and ranchers; it was a victory for the people of Okeechobee, Lake Placid, Moore Haven, and Clewiston, Florida. This morning I awoke and found out that my Republican colleagues had changed their minds because the President of the United States again wanted to play politics. This is not about a tax increase. This is about politics. 
   As a businessman who, for 30 years, ran businesses around the globe, I am incensed that my colleagues would hurt the American farmer by lying to the American people and call closing a tax loophole for foreign companies and giving them an unfair advantage over our own businesses a tax increase. But silly me, why should I have been surprised? They are the party of special interests, Halliburton, Big Oil, and now they are the party of big foreign corporations.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that will preserve the HOPE VI Main Street Grant program. This program, important to rural communities with very small populations, was created with the passage of the American Dream Act of 2003. Since its inception, the program has helped a small number of rural communities develop affordable housing units in conjunction with larger revitalization efforts. 
   The creation of the HOPE VI Main Street Grant program in 2003 is important to rural communities because it allows rural communities to compete with larger urban areas for HOPE VI dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, for those not familiar with the program, the HOPE VI Main Street grants are funded through a 5 percent set-aside in the HOPE VI annual appropriations and each award is capped at $1 million. 
   As I noted, this program is extremely important to rural communities such as Moore Haven, Florida. Located on the banks of the Caloosahatchee River in Glades County and one of the most rural areas of Florida, Moore Haven is one of the oldest cities in South Florida. This beautiful, old, sleepy Florida town is home to one doctor, Dr. Geek, and one restaurant. It is one of the few places left in Florida where the families have lived there for generations and everyone knows their neighbor. 
   Unfortunately, it is also one of the poorest areas in the State. The population of the city is approximately 1,900 people and the annual tax revenue for all of Glades County is $6 million. The people of Moore Haven have a desire to revitalize their historic downtown area, but they lack the financial resources. 
   Guided by the vision of Tracy Whirls, the Executive Director of the Glades County Economic Development Council, Moore Haven applied for a HOPE VI Main Street grant last year. The city had hoped to use the money to purchase three historic but dilapidated and vacant buildings, with the intention of attracting businesses to the first floors and 12 affordable housing units on the upper levels. Plans for the first floors included opening Moore Haven's only pharmacy and furniture store. 
   I regret, Mr. Chairman, that Moore Haven was not successful in its attempt to secure the grant. The good news is that they are game and they are going to apply for it again this year. But I believe it is imperative that we continue to give Moore Haven and small rural cities like Moore Haven across this great Nation this opportunity. 
   Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would like to leave you with the words of Larry Luckey, the Glades County property appraiser. ``If we are unable to  save these historic commercial buildings, the downtown historic district will cease to exist. I am saddened at the thought that we may well become a city with no history.'' 
   I would ask for the support of my colleagues to preserve the HOPE VI Main Street Grant program and the economy and history of small towns across America, including Moore Haven. In addition, with the passage of my amendment, we will ensure that rural communities continue to have access to the affordable housing benefits provided by the HOPE VI program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (THE PRESIDENT SHOULD LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I am here today representing Florida's 16th District. Tonight we will listen to the President with the expectation that he will listen to the American people. 
   Our Nation is facing some of the greatest challenges of our time. From the war in Iraq, to global terrorism, to ending the addiction to foreign oil, the stakes are high and getting higher. 
   Americans understand the urgency of our challenges. It is time for the President to step up to the plate and offer real solutions that put America on the path to success and security. 
   I hope the President will offer a new strategy to win the war in Iraq and that that strategy will use diplomacy as its cornerstone, not troop escalation. Let me be clear. I am committed to supporting our brave men and women in uniform, but do not believe their role should be policing a civil war. 
   We need to turn our energy crisis into an opportunity by investing in domestic production of biofuels and alternative and renewable energies. Last year the President called for an end to America's addiction to oil. And one week later, he cut funding for the development of alternative fuels and energy-efficient technologies. Instead of rhetoric, we need results. 
   I ask the President to listen to the American people, to the message they sent last November. Our children depend on it.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Arkansas for yielding to me tonight. I stand here today representing the great State of Florida's 16th Congressional District, a district that spans from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico and represents the hopes and aspirations of all Floridians. 
   I stand here as a freshman member of the Blue Dog Coalition supporting our resolution demanding that the administration account for the Iraq war in a manner that lets this Nation see the true costs of the undertaking, and ensuring that our brave men and women who are fighting for our freedom are not being robbed by profiteers and inefficient government bureaucracy. 
   What got me was that not only was the deficit a tax on my daughter, Bailey's, future, but this administration was not leveling with the American people. This administration was not telling the people the true cost of their programs, telling us that these tax breaks for the wealthiest were driving us to the poor house, cutting revenues when increasing government by over 30 percent. 
   Now, do not get me wrong. I believe in smaller, more efficient government. I do not believe we need to raise taxes. However, as a businessman, I believe in living within one's means, having to make tough choices so that we can determine what is important, determining what our national priorities are and making those hard choices. 
   The fact that this administration has calculatingly funded this war with emergency supplemental appropriations so that the American people would not see the true cost is wrong. This Congress and the American people have the right to determine for themselves if the results justify the expenses. Looking at the budget cuts our children had to endure when he cut Head Start, when he unfunded No Child Left Behind, cutting the budget for health services for our veterans, cutting funding for law enforcement programs while violent crime is on the rise, making a decision to leave our ports unsecured by not inspecting the hundreds of thousands of containers that enter this country every year. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to have all of the facts so that they can make their own decision. This resolution calls on the President to budget for the Iraq war like he budgets for everything else. No longer can this country afford the President standing in front of the American people and declaring fiscal victory when he loses less of our money than he projected, declaring victory when we are running record deficits and not adding the cost of the Iraq war. 
   These are real losses, these are real debts, debts to be repaid with our tax dollars. Further, this resolution calls for the President to be a good steward of our money by asking for accountability in how our hard-earned money is spent. Our resolution specifically calls on Congress to perform this congressional responsibility to provide oversight and make sure that our brave men and women fighting for our liberty get everything they need to come home and make those who would steal from them pay the price. 
   This is not a new idea. President Truman, as a U.S. Senator, did exactly that during World War II, a Democrat in Congress providing oversight to a Democratic administration. Imagine that. What a novel idea. 
   Tonight I call upon the American people to let the President know that regardless of whether you support the war in Iraq or not, you expect him to level with the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. 
   Seven years ago Congress, in the spirit of bipartisanship, had the wisdom to protect for future generations one of America's most precious natural areas, the Everglades, by authorizing the largest environmental restoration project in our Nation's history, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). 
   This ambitious plan consists of over 40 projects that, when completed, would restore much of the Everglades. The plan, from its inception, was a joint venture, an equal partnership with the people of my State of Florida to share in the costs. 
   I am sorry to say that Washington has failed to honor its word and live up to its commitment. In fact, to the shame of the Republican-controlled Congress and the current administration, not a single WRDA bill has been passed since 2000. Not a single penny spent. 
   I am proud to say that during this same period of time, Florida has spent over $2 billion to get CERP going. In fact, this is so important in my district that the good people from Martin County voted to increase their taxes to help pay. 
   In my 16th Congressional District we are going to get the opportunity to restore the Indian River Lagoon. 
   Stuart, Florida, which straddles the lagoon, is the sailfish capital of the world and was built on tourism based on its world-renowned fishing. I have seen the black and white photos of wagons overflowing with fish. I have seen the photos of kids swimming in the lagoon. 
   It is time to quit talking about fixing it. It is time for our kids to go fishing. It is time for this Congress to have the courage and leadership to pass H.R. 1495.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight on behalf of Florida's 16th Congressional District in support of the House budget resolution for fiscal year 2008. 
   I decided to run for Congress 18 months ago because I wanted to protect my daughter Bailey's American Dream. I was appalled by how Republican leadership had turned a budget surplus into a $3 trillion deficit. I was appalled by out-of-control earmarks that put political payoffs over good government. Tonight, my daughter's legacy of this Republican mismanagement is her personal debt tax of $29,000. 
   I am proud to stand here tonight with Chairman Spratt and my fellow Blue Dogs in support of a fiscally responsible budget that reflects the priorities and values of the American people. I am proud that the Democratic Party is taking yet another step in bringing fiscal responsibility back to our Nation. 
   Our first step happened within hours of our swearing in, when we began to clean up the Republicans' culture of corruption by passing earmark reform. Next, we passed the pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule that forces this Congress to live within its means, just as American families do. I am proud that this budget follows the PAYGO rule, as it demonstrates a Democratic commitment to walk the walk of fiscal responsibility and not just talk the talk. 
   Instead of a fiscal policy that gives tax breaks today and funding them by going into debt and mortgaging our children's future, this budget begins the process of bringing spending under control and lays the foundation to return to a budget surplus so that we can legitimately lower taxes. 
   While the President's budget imposes nearly $81 billion in new taxes over the next 5 years through user fees for veterans, seniors and other taxpayers, our budget reduces taxes on middle-income families. 
   While the President's budget increases taxes by more than $300 billion by cutting employer-provided health care, our budget lowers taxes by extending the child tax credit, the marriage penalty tax relief, the 10 percent individual income tax bracket, the research and development tax credit and the deduction for State and local sales tax, something that is critical to my constituents in Florida. 
   And while the President's budget increases the deficit by over $1.4 trillion  over the next 10 years, our budget would create a budget surplus within 5 years. 
   This budget resolution provides for a strong national defense, giving the President what he requested, while increasing homeland security funding for port security and our first responders. It takes care of those who have served our country by increasing funding for veterans service programs by a record $6.6 billion. It stands up for Florida's 1.8 million small business owners by rejecting the President's plan to slash the Small Business Administration's budget by 26 percent. 
   Mr. Chairman, this budget puts children and families first by investing in health care and education. It helps 733,000 of Florida's most vulnerable children who do not have health insurance.     
   This budget helps 733,000 of Florida's most vulnerable children who do not have health insurance by increasing funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and invests in our children and our economy's future by honoring the President's broken promises by funding No Child Left Behind and special education and Head Start. 
   This budget resolution funds our priorities and reflects the priorities of our districts, the States and Nation; it lowers taxes, not raises taxes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the House budget resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, as a father, it is unfathomable to me why the President chose to deny health care coverage to children. It's incomprehensible to me that some of my colleagues would play politics with a child's health. 
   I always tell my daughter that in life you don't get do-overs. Well, apparently here in Congress you do. 
   The President and my colleagues across the aisle have the opportunity that is very rare, and that is to have a second chance to do it right. 
   Last week I met with pediatricians at a hospital in Port St. Lucie where doctors painted a stark picture of the challenges faced by children without insurance. 
   I then went across the street to a daycare center and visited children who rely on Florida's CHIP program, KidCare, for the health care needs, kids like 4-year-old Samantha, and 2-year-old Hannah, 4-year-old Rafael and 2-year-old Julian. 
   The President opposes SCHIP because he thinks that children from working families that go to work, pay their taxes but can't afford health insurance shouldn't go to the doctor. He says it's too many kids and too expensive, even though the bill is paid for without putting our country further into debt. 
   Madam Speaker, I would ask the President, which child would you deny health care coverage to, Julian or Hannah? Which child is one too many?

   Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in support of the Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act. The time has come to stop this senseless policy of using our brave men and women in uniform as cops policing a religious civil war, and it's time for our country to rededicate ourselves to winning the war on terror. 
   The data is in. The facts are irrefutable in and the conclusion clearly demonstrates that the President's continued resolve to engage in nation building in Iraq has made America weaker and has put our Nation in greater peril from terrorist attack. It is time that we stop asking our brave sons and daughters to give the ultimate sacrifice in support of the President's failed policies. 
   It is time for the President to listen to his own advisors and the American people. It is time for the President to admit mistakes he has made and for him to show leadership by changing direction. It is time for the President to  honor our service men and women by rebuilding our military and by using our finest fighting force the world has ever known to bring Osama bin Laden to justice, to search out and destroy terrorists and to punish the nations that support terror.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Florida. I'm proud to cosponsor this important amendment with the gentleman, as he and his family are champions of Florida agriculture. 
   One recurring theme we've heard throughout this debate is that although this farm bill is historic for American agriculture, it does not give everyone what they wanted. 
   In the case of conservation programs, I believe it's a mistake for this bill to further restrict the American farmers' access to important conservation programs by lowering the adjusted gross income limits. 
   This is bad policy because it hurts farmers that produce high-value crops from accessing conservation programs. In Florida, we are fighting to protect our environment. We've spent billions to preserve the Everglades. These new, more restrictive limits will disincent Florida ranchers and growers from investing with the Federal Government to preserve our lands and clean our waters. 
   I urge my colleagues to use common sense. This amendment provides real farmers, not millionaires, access to critical conservation programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to take an important step in keeping our rural lands green, to protect our wetlands, and to support our national agricultural heritage. 
   This is a good amendment, and it deserves your support.

<DOCNO>Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MAHONEY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I normally rise to speak on behalf of the people of Florida's 16th Congressional District. Today I rise to begin a conversation not only with my colleagues, but with my constituents. 
   This week, this legislative body, the people's House, is engaged in a great debate over the President's decision to stay the course in Iraq by escalating the number of troops. I have, over the past few days, heard many arguments as to the wisdom of the President's decision to do so. But the one message that all who have spoken agree with, Democratic or Republican, liberal or conservative, is that our brave men and women in uniform have done a magnificent job fighting in Iraq and around the world to protect our lives, our culture, and our country.     
   I have heard my colleagues argue that the mere act of debating the President's decision to escalate the war sends the wrong message to our troops and the wrong message to our enemies. To these colleagues I say do not underestimate the power of democracy, the power of freedom of speech, the very powers we are fighting to give the people of Iraq. Debate sends the message of strength, resolve, and commitment. This debate is about finding the best way for America to win the war on terror. 
   I agree with the President that the world is a dangerous place and we need to take the war to the terrorists and those who support terror. But I disagree with the President that by sending more troops to police a civil war in Iraq, America is any closer to winning the war on terror. I come to this conclusion as a result of consultations with our military leaders, our diplomats, and those in the White House responsible for executing the President's policies. I come to this conclusion from talking to our men and women in uniform who have served with distinction. 
   Democracy can only happen when a people want it. We have seen time and again that a people who yearn for democracy will break the yoke of tyranny and liberate themselves from their oppressors. America has invested lives of over 3,000 of its best young men and women, sustained over 20,000 casualties, and spent nearly $400 billion on the Iraq war. We have rid the Iraqi people of a cruel tyrant and have given them the opportunity to live in a democracy. American men and women securing a street corner in Sadr City will not change the hearts of the Sunni or Shia. Additional troops will not secure democracy. Only the men and women of Iraq can do that. Now is the time for the Iraqi people to stand and demand democracy. 
   It is time for America to move forward in our fight against terror. It is time to focus on eliminating terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, or wherever they are harbored. It is time to bring Osama bin Laden to justice for the crimes he perpetrated on 9/11. 
   We need to gather our strength and send a clear message to our enemies that their continued efforts to support terror and engage in activity against America or her allies will result in certain and swift justice. 
   This President needs to do what his father did in the first gulf war and what President Clinton did in the Balkans, and that is to demonstrate leadership by engaging in diplomacy. This President needs to listen to the sage advice of the Baker-Hamilton Commission and use America's power and prestige to bring the world together in support of the Iraqi people. The world needs to know that America will provide a democratic Iraq, and those who support her, with political, economic, and military support. 
   I want my friends in Stuart, Okeechobee, Sebring, LaBelle, and Punta Gorda to know that I am here today because democracy requires us to speak up and speak out and you deserve to have a voice in this debate. In speaking out, I am supporting our President by letting him know that we are committed to winning the war on terror, but that we will not support his strategy to increase escalation of the troops in Iraq and that America will not quit until we have vanquished all who use terror to achieve political gain. 
   We want the Iraqi people to know that this is their moment to grasp democracy; and should they choose to do so, the American people will continue to support them and their efforts to build a better life for their children. 
   Tomorrow, my colleagues and I will take the important first step in showing the President that we support our troops, but do not support his plan to invest more American lives to mediate a civil war. 
   Make no mistake, this vote is binding, as it binds me and my colleagues to our constituents by forcing us to take a stand.
