<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And let me begin by thanking you for your strong leadership in bringing this legislation through the House and advocating it through the Senate and our ranking member, Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her support, and as you mentioned before, Representative Barbara Lee and Donna Christensen. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, this bill, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, is very timely. 
   This bill is important. In the 5 years since I have been in Congress, the original legislation authorized by the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, or PEPFAR, as it is known, has become a historical program.     
   The road toward serious consideration regarding HIV and AIDS was a long journey. The Congressional Black Caucus began advocating for a sound domestic and international effort during the late 1980s with little success. Pressure continued through the executive branch, and in the Clinton years, an office was established headed by Ms. Thurman on the President's initiative on HIV and AIDS. However, adequate funding was still lacking, especially on the international focus. 
   And so I must say that PEPFAR is destined, in my view, to be remembered as the single most significant achievement of the Bush administration's two terms in office because it was there that we catapulted the funding of this legislation. 
   Over 800,000 people who would otherwise have no access to treatment are receiving anti-retroviral medication in PEPFAR's 15 focus countries. Twelve of those countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Such progress is remarkable. However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. Despite our best efforts, only 28 percent of Africans needing anti-retrovirals are receiving them. 
   A mere 11 percent of HIV-positive women on the continent who need drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission is getting it. Shockingly, over 85 percent of Africa's children who need ARVs are going without it. 
   This is why Congress is taking such an extraordinary step of authorizing close to $50 billion to transform PEPFAR from an emergency response to a sustainable program. It represents the best efforts to turn those statistics around. 
   The new bill transforms PEPFAR by expanding the program beyond a series of medical interventions. For example, the lack of food and nutrition support for people on ARVs have been, up to now, a major impediment to the adherence to AIDS treatment regimens. The lack of adherence limits PEPFAR's effectiveness. 
   Fortunately, the new component will help ease the nutrition problem. The Senate bill has incorporated elements of the provision which I authored that were in the original House bill related to addressing the nutrition needs of HIV patients, their families, and communities. When I introduced the nutrition component a year ago, no one could have accurately predicted the tremendous food security problem which besets us today worldwide. 
   The Senate bill also contains a provision to build and strengthen health systems in developing countries. 
   Like the House bill, it eliminates cumbersome earmarks that the Government Accountability Office and the Institute of Medicine have said limits program efficacy. 
   Just as important as the money and programs for HIV and AIDS, the bill we are voting on today also authorizes $9 billion to fight two other diseases that have wrought havoc in the developing world: malaria and tuberculosis. 
   Malaria kills a child in Africa every 30 seconds. It contributes to the death of an estimated 10,000 pregnant women and up to 200,000 infants each year on the continent. And what is astonishing is that malaria is preventable. With education, providing bed nets and spraying, malaria can be eliminated. 
   TB is just as deadly. Nearly 20 percent of the people who develop full-blown TB die of the disease. They cannot get a simple, low-cost cure which is available. 
   And those with HIV and AIDS are very vulnerable to TB infections due to lowered immunity factors. In fact, TB is the number one killer of people with AIDS. With the new cases of MDR and XDR TB, a more radical strain that is much more difficult to treat, the new emphasis on TB is very important. In South Africa in a village, 52 of 53 people who had contracted MDR TB died within a 2-week period. 
   Mr. Speaker, given the aforementioned toll that AIDS, TB and malaria has taken around the globe, and how much we still need to do to fight all three deadly diseases, it is imperative that we redouble our efforts.

   Mr. PAYNE. As I conclude, we must do so for the obvious reason: U.S.-funded programs save lives. We have a  moral obligation to continue them. We should also do so for a less obvious reason: to counter a growing perception in the world that the United States does not care about anything but counterterrorism. 
   Fairly or not, I think that this bill will go far to continue to uplift the image of the United States. It's saving lives, and it's doing the right thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill. The legislation before us recognizes one of the most tragic and unfortunate incidents in the history of the Department of State. It has been more than 9 years since the brutal bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania occurred. Twelve Americans perished in these terrorist attacks, and many other foreign nationals did in both of the attacks. These murders marked the true beginning of the war on terror, when al Qaeda targeted innocent Americans abroad merely because of their association with our great country. 
   Of those twelve victims, five were foreign service officers including Julian Bartley, Sr., the Deputy Chief of Mission, and his young son who was interning at the Embassy when al Qaeda struck. I had visited the Embassy just several weeks before and had a conversation with Julian and knew him personally even as he worked here on the Hill before going to Kenya. 
   It was later determined in an official accountability report that the security arrangements at the Nairobi Embassy were inadequate, as were the State Department's risk assessment procedures. The Nairobi Embassy was not classified as a hardship post. It was maddening to learn that the Ambassador in Nairobi had pleaded with the Department for additional security measures, but to no  avail. Worse, upon returning to the United States, many of the relatives of those killed were treated dismissively by the Department of State. The expression ``pouring salt on a wound'' does not do justice to the bureaucratic manner in which the government addressed the relatives' claims. It was truly a disgrace. 
   The families of the victims are still awaiting sufficient compensation. The fact that this tragedy occurred so far away should not undermine the care given to the victims' families, whose lives will be forever altered by this incident. No amount of money will bring back those loved ones. However, in cooperation with Representative Jackson, our committee is making an effort to ensure that the families have some added degree of comfort. 
   The bill is also intended to send a message to the State Department: protect your employees; and God forbid, if incidents like this occur again, be attentive and sensitive to the families. 
   This legislation will create a new program whereby the Secretary of State or the head of a relevant agency may compensate the relatives of a U.S. Government employee killed in an act of international terrorism up to eight times the individual's salary. The program would include foreign service nationals. It will also require the Secretary of State to retroactively compensate those U.S. Government employees killed in an act of terrorism since 1998, which would include the 12 victims in the Nairobi attack. Those victims will receive an award commensurate with the total aid package available to a victim of terror today under this amendment. 
   It saddens me that such legislation is necessary, but I am heartened that perhaps this legislative act will bring some small degree of closure to the families of the Nairobi bombing victims. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me once again commend the combined effort on both sides of the aisle. 
   As you know, this has been lingering ever since it occurred. I recall meeting with the family, very devastated by the event, but I do recall, too, that the manner in which the Department of State dealt with the issue was in very, very poor taste. 
   The family persisted. And all of the families that suffered I'm sure today are pleased that the recognition for what their family members, those who joined the Foreign Service, those who said that they wanted to contribute their careers to serving the United States of America on foreign soils in diplomatic ways. And so we are extremely pleased that this bill has finally come to fruition. 
   Once again, I, too, commend Ms. Bartley, who has been in my office year in and year out in a pleasant and very persistent manner. As Congresswoman Maxine Waters said, she is just a gem for anyone to have as their daughter. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Chairman Lantos for his leadership in bringing this bill up and the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and the ranking member of the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee, Mr. Smith, for H.R. 2003, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007. 
   Ethiopia is one of our most reliable allies as one of Africa's most capable peacekeeping forces and is making positive steps towards a prosperous economy and functioning democracy. However, Ethiopia continues to be a country riven with conflict that threatens to tear the country apart. Ethiopia took a major step backwards in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 general elections when the Prime Minister declared a state of emergency, outlawed any public gatherings, and placed all security forces under his direct command. While the government performed commendably in negotiations with opposition parties before the election, the response after the election set off a violent confrontation between the opposition and the government. The opposition accused the government of vote rigging and fraud and called for a public demonstration and civil disorder. 
   The government responded by ordering the security forces to fire live ammunition at demonstrators, killing some and detaining opposition leaders and their followers. In spite of continued negotiations between the government and the opposition, the political environment continued to deteriorate, resulting in regrettable death of civilians and police. 
   An estimated 112 political leaders, human rights activists, community leaders and journalists, including the founder of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, were imprisoned and charged with treason and genocide. In spite of international pleas for more measured responses by the government towards its civilians, the Government of Ethiopia has continued to stifle and criminalize opposition activities and to intimidate and silence civil society and independent journalists. 
   The legislation before the House will withhold nonhumanitarian funds from the Ethiopian Government until democracy and respect for human rights are fully restored. It will send a strong signal of dissatisfaction toward the Ethiopian Government and increase pressure on the Ethiopian leaders to change. As I indicated, in leading up to the election, the government made debates available, opened up journalism and had the opposition candidates on equal footing. However, after the results, 193 people were killed, shot and murdered by sharpshooters. 
   So we are very disturbed. We urge our colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me once again thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) who has worked so hard on this issue of Ethiopia. We are very pleased that today the proof it is coming to fruition is the fact that this bill is here on the floor. I, too, met with Prime Minister Meles in the summer of 2006 and asked if he would consider releasing the prisoners. He once again said that it is up to the judiciary. It is not in his hands. I then went to the Kality prison and met with two of the witnesses who just testified this morning Dr. Nega and Ms. Mideska, who appreciated the pressure and the insistence that we had through the years and because perhaps they would still be in prison. But they are here as free citizens testifying before  the Africa and Global Health Subcommittee this morning. 
   So, once again, we have also in this bill made provisions to assist the Government of Ethiopia. We are saying that you need help in your judicial system, and there are funds in it for that, that we hope to get appropriated. We say the health system is in disrepair, and there are funds in it to help the health system. We say that there is a need for water projects, and in this bill there is financial assistance to help in the economic development. 
   So this is a bill that we are saying that Ethiopia is an ally of the United States. We need a strong Ethiopia. But we need a democratic Ethiopia, not an Ethiopia that is run by a dictatorial regime. So we are hoping that this bill will move forward and effect change in that great country with such a long and rich history.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (COMMISSION ON THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lantos, for moving this bill through expeditiously, and also the cooperation of our friend, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), for assisting in the moving of this bill through our committee. 
   Let me say that January 1, 2008, will mark the 200th anniversary of the Act to Prohibit the Importation of Slaves, which effectively ended the legal transatlantic slave trade. I am proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 3432. The Bicentennial Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade Commemoration Commission Act of 2007, is the total title, to honor the victims and survivors of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   The bill before us establishes a commission to cultivate and preserve the memory of a grave injustice in American history, the transatlantic slave trade, and to mark the trade's conclusion at the hands of our President at that time, Thomas Jefferson. 
   In the early years of the Republic, the transatlantic slave trade constituted a thriving economic vein of the United States. By 1807, millions of Africans had been captured and transported to the Americas on notorious slave vessels. We may recall ``Roots.'' The 30th anniversary of that is being lived out now, which so vividly showed that era. As a matter of fact, it was the most watched series on television, even today. 
   Many individuals perished as a result of torture, including rape, malnutrition and disease. Those who survived faced miserable prospects of a lifetime of bondage. Few Americans are aware that captured slaves resisted their enslavement until the bitter end. 
   During the Middle Passage, enslaved Africans defied their slave masters through nonviolent and violent means, including hunger strikes, suicide, and shipboard revolts, the most historically recognized events taking place on board the Don Carlos in 1732 and on board the Amistad in 1839, that famous case that was defended by John Quincy Adams, who argued and won the case and had the enslaved people released in Connecticut. 
   On March 3, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed into law the Transatlantic Slave Trade Act, which prohibited the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States. The bill was nothing short of revolutionary. It single-handedly outlawed the longstanding and brutal trade of transporting Africans to the United States. 
   In commemoration of President Jefferson's act and to explore the impact of the slave trade on the United States, we will move this legislation which is drafted that will establish the 200th Anniversary Commemoration Commission. 
   This important body will be tasked with the mandate to plan, develop and execute programs and activities appropriate to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, which we will tend to start talking about ``slave trade'' as ``enslaved people,'' which is a new definition that is starting to be used. Slaves are now considered people who were enslaved people. 
   The mission is timely, and the subject is critical. The United States is a primary voice on trafficking issues today, and we are aware also that the principal advocate for human rights and freedom around the world that we stand so strongly behind. Our Nation's willingness to confront its past and calmly assess the impact of enslaved people on the United States strengthens our ability to serve as an advocate on the international stage. I strongly urge the support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me once again thank all of those responsible for moving this bill through. As you recall, it was in 1807 that slavery was abolished in England through the work of Mr. Wilberforce, who for 20 years argued against slavery in the British Parliament. A resolution was passed this year by Mr. Pitts commending the abolition of slavery in Great Britain and commending Mr. Wilberforce for his work as a great abolitionist. So we are pleased that this will give us time to commemorate, to investigate, to remember those who had this difficult period of time. 
   As has been indicated, even though transatlantic slavery was abolished in  1807, slavery continued. As a matter of fact, even in the North, and our State has found records that even after the Emancipation Proclamation and as late as 1866, the last slave was freed in New Jersey. Many people are unaware of the fact that there was slavery in New Jersey, which abolished slavery, but you had to be 25 as a man and 21 as a woman, and any children born of a union had to remain in slavery. Therefore, people remained in slavery up through after the Emancipation Proclamation, which only freed slaves in the Confederacy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, after weeks of denial from both the White House and the Department of Justice that politics played no part in the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys, the Attorney General finally admitted yesterday that there is more to the story. 
   It was an embarrassing and disturbing set of e-mails between the White House's political operatives and Gonzales's chief of staff that clearly revealed that there were political concerns involved in the political purge, or firing. The chief of staff resigned after e-mails were released to the New York Times and the Washington Post, but questions still remain unanswered. 
   What about those at the top? Is it plausible that the Attorney General was unaware of the actions of his own chief of staff? When is the President going to hold members of his Cabinet accountable for misdeeds and mistakes? 
   The Attorney General's office is supposed to be above politics. An independent judiciary is one of the hallmarks of this great democracy which we, as Americans, promote around the world. There is simply no place for politics at the Justice Department. But sadly, it appears that the Justice Department has become a pawn of the Republican Party.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would like to first commend our distinguished colleague and former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Lee of California, for introducing this very important resolution. 
   I am honored and humbled to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of transatlantic slave trade with this resolution, for its legacy continues to reflect the racial biases and socioeconomic disparities that still exist in this country and throughout the Americas. 
   As we consistently admonish the prevalence of modern-day slavery worldwide, because it still exists in some parts of the world, it would be hypocritical if we did not acknowledge the history of transatlantic slave trade which existed for so long in this country, and therefore it is appropriate that we speak about it at this time, its 200th anniversary. 
   For over 300 years the United Kingdom and other European countries kidnapped and sold millions of Africans into slavery. The transatlantic slave trade is known as the largest forced migration in the history of the world. Estimates range from 25 to 50 million Africans were forcibly brought to the United States, the Caribbean, Central and South America and to Europe. Sharks migratory patterns were changed because these predators followed the ships in the Middle Passage because when a slave died they were thrown overboard, or if they were killed because they were protesting, or if they committed suicide, the sharks knew that they could follow the ships, and it changed the migratory patterns of sharks during this period of time. 
   African labor was an essential feature of economic development in Europe and her former colonies, including the United States. All of the nations involved flourished economically as a result of slave labor. 
   The fact that slavery was not abolished in the United States until Abraham Lincoln declared to end slavery in the Confederacy in 1863 with the Emancipation Proclamation. However, slavery was really not abolished in the Union. 
   Interestingly enough, in my State of New Jersey, slavery continued until 1866. In New Jersey, a mother, a woman could become free at the age of 21, and a man at the age of 25, but their children had to continue in slavery. And so  the emancipation only freed slaves in the Confederacy, and did not free slaves in the Union. And so, as I have indicated in New Jersey, there were still slaves a year after the end of the Civil War in 1866. 
   The dignity of our Nation demands our recognition of this tragic part of American history. I extend my highest respect and appreciation for the contributions and struggles of African Americans to create an equitable and just society from which we all benefit today. 
   I strongly support this resolution, and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlelady from California once again. As she said, we hope that the history will be integrated into our textbooks. In New Jersey, I am proud to say, William Payne, assemblyman, passed Amistad legislation that will integrate the history of African Americans in the history of New Jersey. Our current Member of Congress, Albio Sires, was the Speaker of the Assembly when that great legislation was brought through with his assistance. 
   When we read about Patrick Henry, who said, ``Give me liberty or give me death,'' or Nathan Hale, who said ``I regret that I only have one life to give for my country,'' we will read about Crispus Attucks, the first person killed in the Revolutionary War on March 3, 1770. We will read about Peter Salem and Salem Poor at the Battle of Bunker Hill, that fired the shot. They said, ``Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.'' They killed Major Pitcairn, who led the Boston Massacre. 
   When we hear about the Civil War, 50 percent of the Navy were African Americans, once Frederick Douglass convinced President Lincoln to allow them. 
   In the Spanish-American War, as I conclude, we hear about the Rough Riders of Teddy Roosevelt, but it was the Buffalo Soldiers at the Battle of San Juan Hill that saved the Rough Riders of Teddy Roosevelt from annihilation, which has been kept from our history. 
   I could go on and on, but since the time has expired, at another time I will hope to be able to get through World War I and World War II and to the present time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, let me thank the prime sponsor, Ms. Solis, for introducing this very important House Resolution 100, expressing the sympathy of the House of Representatives to the families of women and girls murdered in Guatemala, and encouraging the Government of Guatemala to bring an end to these crimes. 
   Let me commend Ms. Solis from California, not only for the women in Guatemala but she has actually expressed concerns for the deaths of women in Mexico. We have had discussions with Ms. Solis about the murders on the border of the United States and Mexico where women have been killed and there are a tremendous number of unsolved crimes there, and she visited that community in Mexico to express our concern for the women of that region and that country. So this is simply an extension of the work that she has done so well on behalf of women not only here in this country but throughout the world. 
   As we know, since 2001 more than 2,000 women and girls have been murdered in Guatemala, often preceded by abductions, sexual assault, or brutal mutilation. The murder rate has continued to increase and has grown from 2001 where there were 303 reported to more than 500 in 2006. And so we have asked the Government of Guatemala and actually the United Nations, and they recently signed an agreement to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, which has a mandate to investigate and promote prosecution of illegal security groups and clandestine security organizations that function with impunity and are suspected of attacking human rights defenders and other crimes that have undermined the overall security in Guatemala. 
   So when we look to Guatemala and we express our sincerest condolences to the families of these women and girls, we must look at the condition of women throughout the world, even here in the United States. At a recent hearing last week of the Education and Labor Committee, we find that women make 82 cents on the dollar compared to what men make. And the sad part is that, as women progress in their years of work, the gap between men and women actually expands because they start at a lower base. Men's salaries go up, women's salaries remain stagnant, and the gap becomes even greater. 
   So as we remember the women of Guatemala, let's remember that there is still gender bias throughout the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank Congressman Joe Pitts, who was the prime sponsor of this resolution, and the other cosponsors. Congressman Pitts is a strong human rights activist and has worked on issues of Western Sahara and other issues dealing with suppressed people, and so this resolution honoring William Wilberforce by Congressman Pitts and encouraging young Americans to remember his life, legacy and dedication to the abolition of the British slave trade. 
   Mr. Wilberforce was born in 1759 in England into a wealthy merchant family. He studied at Cambridge University, where he began a lasting friendship with the future Prime Minister of England, William Pitt. 
   In 1780, Wilberforce was elected at the age of 21 years of age to the British House of Commons. His self-indulgent lifestyle as a young man changed completely when he became an evangelical Christian, prompting him to dedicate his life to social reform, particularly dealing with the institution of slavery. 
   During his time, the British Empire controlled the largest portion of the slave trade. As we have heard, estimates are from 25 to 50 million Africans were captured and taken from Africa to the Western Hemisphere and forced into bondage over centuries. 
   Wilberforce was mentored and counseled by John Newton, a former slave trader and the author of ``Amazing Grace,'' which was a song that John Newton wrote when he was caught in a storm with slaves. That is when he said ``Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,'' and he asked the Lord to forgive him and he became an Abolitionist. That is where this song originated, which is still sung at Irish funerals, played by the bagpipes, and, of course, it opens up many services in African American churches throughout this country. 
   But Mr. Wilberforce talked about the horrors of the slave trade and he devoted the rest of his life to the suppression and the abolition of slavery. In his major speech on abolition in the House of Commons, he argued that the slave trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice. He described in vivid details the appalling conditions in which slaves traveled from Africa through the Middle Passage and argued that abolishing the slave trade would also bring an improvement in the conditions of existing slaves in West Indies, then, of course, under the domination of Great Britain. 
   In addition to his anti-slavery activities, Wilberforce was active in at least 69 different projects, focusing on issues such as prison reform, education, child labor conditions, animal cruelty, and cultural reformation. He was certainly a man who was indeed ahead of his time. 
   Mr. Wilberforce fought for 20 years in the House of Commons to pass legislation banning the slave trade; and on February 23, 1807, Britain passed a bill banning slave trade. Wilberforce died on the 29th of July, 1833, shortly after the act to free slaves passed. He had labored for 46 years to abolish slavery in the British Empire. 
   Wilberforce helped inspire and encourage those who fought against slavery in the United States, including political leaders like John Quincy Adams, who actually handled the Amistad Case in Connecticut of some slaves who in the Caribbean freed themselves and ended up on trial, and John Quincy Adams won the case. But he was influenced by Mr. Wilberforce, spreading the message of hope and freedom throughout America. 
   As a matter of fact, Wilberforce University, as we heard Mr. Burton mention earlier, founded in 1856 in Wilberforce, Ohio, and the first historically black college in the United States of America, is part of the honored legacy of Wilberforce in the United States.     
   Wilberforce University was a final destination for the Underground Railroad that brought over 100,000 slaves from the South to freedom. As a matter of fact, currently, the president of Wilberforce University is a former Member of this body, Reverend Doctor Floyd Flake. 
   Wilberforce once said, ``Men of authority and influence may promote good morals. Let them, in their several stations, encourage virtue. Let them favor and take part in any plans which may be formed for the advancement of morality.'' I think those words stand today, if we would listen to what Mr. Wilberforce said at that time. 
   I ask all of you to listen to the words of Wilberforce and to vote for this resolution to honor Mr. Wilberforce's work and legacy, his commitment to each and every person's human dignity, value and freedom. I urge that we pass this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me conclude once again by thanking the prime sponsor, Congressman Pitts, for this resolution and just say that as I was indicating before about a little bit about our history, it is important that we remember history. It is important that the House of Commons fought and Mr. Wilberforce would not give up his fight. 
   Actually, New Jersey back in 1863 passed the 13th amendment that was proposed by President Lincoln, although New Jersey did not support Lincoln in his elections. The Republicans passed the 13th amendment, but interestingly enough, the Democrats opposed this, and in the next election the Democrats swept out all the Republicans in the New Jersey State legislature and actually rescinded the 13th amendment.     
   So New Jersey did not pass the 13th amendment, refused to take up the debate on the 14th or 15th amendments. There was a time in our State where we were called, rather than down south was called up north or down north, because we did have problems, even in the North, attempting to get basic things like 13th amendment abolishing slavery; 14th amendment, due process under the law; and 15th amendment, giving the right to vote to all citizens. 
   We still have to fight injustice. No one would think that our great Garden State, which today is such a leader in the right things, had such a spotted past and a troubled history. 
   I urge support of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (MARKING THE END OF THE 4TH YEAR OF THE OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Let me begin by thanking the gentleman from New York for this Special Order and bringing to the American people the very important issue that stands before us. And I would like to commend the Out of Iraq Caucus, but primarily the three women from California, Congresswoman Woolsey, Congresswoman Lee, and Congresswoman Waters, who have kept this particular issue alive, have continued to work with us to shape a policy or keep the conscience of America focused on this situation, a situation that we gave preemptive strike authority to the President of United States, which all of us opposed, when they said there were weapons of mass destruction; and when none were found, said, well, it was 
   regime change was the final one. 
   But today, we mark the fourth anniversary of the occupation in Iraq. Ironically, it was almost 4 years ago on May 1, 2003, that President Bush deemed the operation in Iraq as ``mission accomplished,'' affirming an end to the major combat in Iraq. As you may recall, he flew in a military plane on an aircraft carrier with a big sign and a brilliant smile on his face, ``Mission Accomplished.'' 
   By that time, approximately 175 Americans had lost their lives in combat. Too many, but 175. Yet 3,197 lives later, American lives later, the war continues; 3,197 more from the pronouncement of ``mission accomplished.'' Included in this number are 50 fatalities from my home State of New Jersey. 
   This weekend, thousands of protesters took to the streets to demand an end to the war in Iraq. As an early and staunch opponent to this war, I have watched every single prediction made by this administration. They have boldly said what they predicted, and every time the prediction was wrong: from the duration of the war, wrong; the reception we would receive, wrong; the costs, wrong; the number of casualties, wrong; the existence of weapons of mass destruction, wrong. This administration has proven itself wrong, wrong, wrong. The countless number of Americans and Iraqis who have lost their lives is sad. 
   The administration should listen to the Baker-Hamilton Commission, which has offered a stinging assessment of virtually every aspect of the U.S. venture in Iraq and calls for a reshaping of the American presence and a new Middle East democracy initiative to prevent the country from slipping into anarchy. 
   There is a great sense of sadness among those of us who foresaw over 4 years ago the tragedy that is now unfolding in Iraq. The war that many assumed would be swift and certain now continues to rage, but I urge my fellow colleagues to take this day and all of the days forward to push for a change, beginning with an orderly withdrawal of American forces from Iraq. This approach will send a message to Iraqis that they must take more responsibility for their own security and would reduce the strain on our military forces. For that, we will not need a surge to the war to continue and continue surge after surge. 
   I thank you very much for the time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 865) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the March 2007 report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development makes an important contribution to the understanding of the high levels of crime and violence in the Caribbean, and that the United States should work with Caribbean countries to address crime and violence in the region, as amended.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING CARIBBEAN DRUG CRIME -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Over the past decade, the level of crime and violence throughout the Caribbean basin has increased. Last year, the United Nations and the World Bank issued a joint report titled, ``Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs and Policy Options in the Caribbean'' which confirms this trend. 
   The report makes a very disturbing finding: Crime and violence have generally increased in the Caribbean, to the point where the region as a whole now possesses the highest overall crime rate of any region in the world. 
   While I note that each member of the Caribbean community is different, and that some countries are successful in maintaining relatively low levels of crime, the report's numbers, while taken as a whole, are alarming. They document extremely high levels of murder, rape, and drug trafficking on a massive scale. 
   If the high levels of crime and violence in the Caribbean persist, they will undermine long-term economic development by eroding the region's trade, commerce, and tourism.     
   The impact of this regional law and order would have a crisis which could extend beyond the borders of CARICOM states by impacting immigration patterns to the United States and by undermining our efforts to fight organized crime and drug trade. Regional instability related to crime and violence in the region could also undermine U.S. border security efforts. 
   As the report points out, the United States is part of the cause of some of these problems, and we could also be a big part in the solution. Our allies in the Caribbean stand ready to partner with us in finding workable solutions. We have an opportunity to address this problem before it destabilizes much of the hemisphere and jeopardizes U.S. security. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 865 and the accompanying amendment in the nature of a substitute to express the sense of the House that the United States and its CARICOM allies take up the U.N./World Bank report's recommendations and work together to solve this potentially devastating problem before it's too late. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  
   I would first like to commend my distinguished colleague, Representative McCotter of Michigan, for introducing this timely and important measure. 
   Next week, His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI, will make his first apostolic visit to the United States. It is appropriate that the House support H. Res. 838 in welcoming this distinguished leader of a church, which has more than 1 billion members worldwide. 
   During his 5-day visit, Pope Benedict will hold numerous meetings in Washington, DC, and New York City. His schedule includes a private conversation with President Bush, a candle lighting and prayer service at Ground Zero, and two widely anticipated masses--at the brand new Nationals Park and the venerable Yankee Stadium. He will be only the third person in history to address the United Nations General Assembly. 
   In addition to meeting U.S. bishops and Catholic groups, Pope Benedict will spend time with members of non-Christian faiths. In particular, he will meet with representatives of Jewish groups to acknowledge the start of Passover.     
   This practice is very much in keeping with Pope Benedict's stated emphasis on reconciliation and faith at the ecumenical level, as he has sought to foster dialogue with a range of religious groups. 
   And last but not least, during his visit to our country Pope Benedict will celebrate an important milestone, his 81st birthday. 
   Joseph Ratzinger was born and baptized on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, Germany. Forced to leave seminary at the age of 16 for compulsory military service with the Nazi anti-aircraft corps, he defected at great personal risk and spent time in an Allied prisoner of war camp. 
   In 1951, he was ordained to the priesthood, embarking on a career as one of the most prolific theologians in modern times. He served in numerous university posts, authored 25 books and thousands of hours of lectures, and participated as a theological adviser to the Second Vatican Council. 
   Before becoming Pope, he distinguished himself first as Archbishop of Munich and Freising, and then dean of the College of Cardinals, and finally as the Bishop of Rome. 
   He ascended to the Papacy on April 19, 2005. After nine apostolic visits in Europe and one to Brazil, the 265th pontiff is now traveling to the United States. It is with great pleasure that I welcome him to our country, the home of more than 66 million Catholics. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, over the past year, the Iraqi Government has made countless promises to the Bush administration, but they have yet to live up to them. Military generals and experts have already concluded that there is no military solution to the civil war, and that the only way to cut down on violence there is through political and diplomatic channels. 
   While President Bush addressed the Nation to announce his troop escalation plan, he promised America, and I quote, ``America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' A newly released Pentagon report concludes that the Iraqi Government is still not living up to the promises it made last year. The Iraqi Prime Minister vowed to reform his government, beginning with his cabinet and his ministers, but the Pentagon report says that not one of these steps has been taken. 
   It is time for Congress finally to hold the Iraqi Government accountable. If the Prime Minister is not committed to following through on his promises he made to our President, then it is only fair for us to reevaluate our commitment to them. The day of an open-ended war is over.

   I had the opportunity to travel with the Democracy Assistance Commission, and was very impressed with the work that they were doing. I traveled to Lebanon with them, and I think we were the last group there before the war broke out. And we saw glimmers of hope with the parliament at that time. And so there was great interest in moving democracy forward. 
   Our leaders at that time, Chairman DREIER and Cochairman PRICE did an outstanding job meeting with all party leaders. We then had the opportunity to visit South Africa and Liberia. 
   In all of the countries we attended there was a tremendous amount of interest in our leadership of the Congress being there. I understand that there are possibilities for Haiti and perhaps Colombia and other countries throughout the world to be assisted by this very important commission. 
   And so I would just like to add my voice to the importance of the Congress, the parliament, legislator-to-legislator, in attempting to bring democracy throughout the world.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, President Bush's dangerous plan to escalate the war in Iraq will not make Americans more secure. In fact, it will only lead to more bloodshed and violence. The plan faces significant bipartisan opposition in both Chambers of Congress and is opposed by a vast majority of people in this country. 
   Some Republicans are belatedly calling for benchmarks to measure progress in Iraq, even as they stand by the President's plan to escalate the war. Democrats were calling for benchmarks for success in Iraq years ago, but our pleas fell on deaf ears. 
   As an early and staunch opponent to this war, I have watched as every single prediction this administration has made has been proven wrong, from the duration of the war, the reception we would receive, the costs, the number of casualties and the existence of weapons of mass destruction, all wrong. 
   The loss of more young men and women is too high a price to pay for  this gamble. Let's support our troops by bringing them home and letting Iraqis shoulder responsibilities which should be theirs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, let me once again commend him for the outstanding work that he is doing as the chairman, but in his  many years as a member of the International Relations Committee then and the Foreign Affairs Committee now. We really appreciate his work. 
   Let me say to the gentleman from New Jersey, I had the opportunity to work with him in the last 2 years on our subcommittee, and I commend him for bringing forth so many of the human rights issues, and it has really been a pleasure working with him, and also on this H. Con. Res. 20, the gentleman, Mr. Smith from New Jersey. 
   Earlier this week, we witnessed a breakthrough in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein agreed to the legitimacy of the police service there, and in doing so, they made a strong statement about their future in the north of Ireland. They chose peace over violence and the rule of law over chaos. 
   I have had the privilege of visiting Northern Ireland on a number of occasions. I was there to monitor the parades, and I was lucky enough to accompany President Clinton on a trip there. In each case, I saw great things along with terrible things, but always the hope of the people that one day there would be peace and understanding in their great country. 
   Thanks to no small part to Special Envoy George Mitchell and efforts that we as a nation should be proud of, the 20th century saw the cessation of violence and the beginning of political equality. The Good Friday Agreement stands as a breakthrough, a powerful statement, and a revelation of that hope that there was always there and that would not be overshadowed by violence and death. The good people continued to push forward. 
   In 1989, Patrick Finucane became a victim of that violence. He was murdered by paramilitary soldiers, gunned down in front of his wife and his children. It was a brutal act perpetrated by men in a time of great contention, violence, and fear. It was a small, sad episode in a larger battle between two sides unwilling to compromise, unwilling to talk, each fearful of each other. Northern Ireland is a different place now. There is peace. And with that peace, the initial signs of trust and cooperation because for any peace to work there must be trust that must be followed by cooperation. 
   It is in this spirit that I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 20. The peace of Northern Ireland depends in no small part on openness and cooperation. Only a full independent and just examination of the past can lead to a peaceful trust in the future. This investigation should begin. And with that, I commend Sinn Fein and Gerry Adams.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, every month this year the Bush economy has lost more jobs than it has created. In June, 62,000 jobs were lost bringing the total number this year to 428,000 jobs lost. Yet President Bush and some Washington Republicans continue to contend that our economy is not in a recession. These job numbers were particularly devastating to the 3.8 million workers who have lost their jobs and continue to struggle to find new work. It's difficult to find a job when the economy is simply not producing them. 
   That's why the Democrats fought hard to pass legislation to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks to more than 1.6 million Americans who have been hurt by President Bush's economic policies. This money will allow workers in my home State of New Jersey and throughout the Nation to pay their bills and put food on the table while they continue to look for a job. 
   Extending unemployment insurance is just another example of how Democrats are changing the way business is done in Washington. No longer are the needs of working families forgotten in this Congress.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I am proud that today many Americans will receive their first pay raise in a decade because the Fair Minimum Wage Act passed by the Democratic Congress goes into effect. 
   These hardworking Americans, 40 percent of whom are minorities, will receive a 70-cents-per-hour raise today, which will be followed by two more 70-cent increases in July 2008 and July 2009. This will result in a total of $2.10 increase, or $4,400 a year. This boost in pay will make a significant difference in the lives of these American families who are trying to survive on a minimum wage that has reached its lowest effective level in more than half a century. It means more food on their tables, better health care for their families, and a shot at sending their children to college. 
   Everyone who works full time should have the chance to achieve these pieces of the American Dream. And with this increase in minimum wage which begins today, they can. 
   I am proud to be a part of the Democratic Congress that passed this long overdue pay raise for millions of hardworking Americans. I want to note that my home State of New Jersey led the way in an increase in minimum wage. Our minimum wage is already $7.15 an hour, and that rate was effective since October 2006.

   I think that parliamentary exchanges are outstanding. As we remember Lech Walesa and the solidarity movement, we do see the challenge for the shipyards there in Poland, but hopefully they will be able to sustain themselves. I think that these various types of parliamentary exchanges do a great deal. 
   I visited Poland in 1967 and went back again in the late 1990s and early 2000 to see the tremendous difference of the 1967 Poland that was drab and going through many, many problems with pollution and the communist system. But with the breakdown of the Warsaw Pact and Poland being able to have democracy, it's really a tremendous country. And as a member of the House Democratic Assistance Corporation here in the House, we certainly strongly push for parliamentary exchanges, and so I certainly support this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, let me thank Mr. Lantos and Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and the floor manager, Mr. Faleomavaega, for bringing this resolution forward, but certainly to the sponsor, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, for her outstanding work that she does on the Africa Subcommittee. 
   I rise to speak in support of H. Res. 34, a resolution recognizing the 75th birthday of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Archbishop Tutu will celebrate his 76th birthday on October 7 of this year, and the legacy he has created during three-quarters of a century on this Earth is truly inspiring. 
   It is no exaggeration to say that without his courage, commitment, and leadership, the South Africa we know today may not exist. For over four decades, Bishop Tutu was a vocal advocate and activist for democracy and human rights in South Africa. He defended the rights of not only black South Africans but for brown and white South Africans as well. As I mentioned earlier, Senator Lugar gave the deciding vote to override the veto of President Reagan of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which therefore put sanctions on South Africa, which helped to move towards a free, democratic South Africa, nonracial. 
   Archbishop Tutu's support for regime change through reconciliation between the different ethnic groups in South Africa is well known and I believe should serve as a model not only in Africa but in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. 
   And I believe that his work as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission helped prevent open violence and bloodshed in South Africa in the wake of apartheid following it. Truly Archbishop Tutu practiced what he preached. 
   What amazes me about Bishop Tutu is his tireless effort on behalf of those who are disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and disposed. Many men would have taken a rest after seeing a vision they worked so hard to achieve come to fruition. But not him. Not Bishop Tutu. He continues to advocate for people around the world from West Papua to Zimbabwe. 
   He has led efforts to bring attention to the spread of HIV/AIDS and the dangers of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, XDR. As a matter of fact, Bishop Tutu wrote me a letter in February bringing out the fact that 50 people of 53 in South Africa died from this disease, and I had a hearing long before the person of the United States traveled around the world with this XDR, drug-resistant, TB. So it was Bishop Tutu that brought it to my attention. As a matter of fact, we raised it with the Foreign Operations appropriations committee, and we were able to increase the funding for this disease by $50 million in this year's appropriations bill. The MDR- and the XDR-TB are things where it was Bishop Tutu who brought it to our attention. 
   His latest endeavor will be to serve as chairman of the Council of Elders, a  group formed by the former South African President Nelson Mandela this past July. Bishop Tutu worked with Reverend Allan Boesak years ago and Mr. Oliver Tambo, who was chairman of the ANC. 
   Archbishop Tutu's tireless work on behalf of the people of South Africa and, indeed, the world is awe inspiring.     
   He should serve as an example to all of us of what compassion and commitment can achieve. I congratulate him on his life work and salute him on the occasion of his birthday.

   Just last month, Senator McCain, in an opinion that he wrote, said that the health insurance market should be run more like the banking industry has been during the last decade. Can you imagine that? 
   As you can imagine, this would be a disaster for American families. By creating a deregulated national marketplace, health insurance companies could sell plans that lack even the most basic consumer protections, creating high out-of-pocket expenses and allowing insurance companies to break promises to pay medical bills.  
   The latest financial meltdown on Wall Street highlights the need for a government to regulate big business. We need a referee on the field. Not only does Senator McCain disagree with that belief, but he wants to take the referee out of health care, leaving all Americans to fend for themselves. 
   That's not a change the American people can believe in.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to gas prices, Republicans don't have a record to be proud of. For 8 years, Washington Republicans have favored profits for Big Oil while America is paying record prices at the pump. 
   House Democrats know this country needs comprehensive energy legislation to bring down gas prices and invest in the energy sources of the future. 
   This week we will vote on comprehensive legislation that invests in renewable energy sources and responsibly increases domestic supply by opening portions of the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling. 
   In New Jersey, we want this energy package which will provide real relief for consumers at the pump, help end our dependence on foreign oil, create millions of new jobs, and help transition America to a cleaner, renewable energy future. 
   Mr. Speaker, just talking about an all-of-the-above plan won't help consumers who are pumping hundreds of dollars into their gas tanks every day. We need to pass a Democratic all-of-the-above plan that will help us solve our energy problems.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (CONDEMNING RECENT VIOLENT ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AGAINST PEACEFUL OPPOSITION PARTY ACTIVISTS AND MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H. Con. Res. 100, and commend Mr. Lantos and the ranking member for this H. Con. Res. 100, condemning the violence and the violent action taken against the peaceful opposition party activists and members of civil society in Zimbabwe just a few months ago, last month in March. 
   Zimbabwe has faced a number of political and economic challenges over the past 7 years. Every time I begin to believe that the situation in Zimbabwe has calmed down, something happens which reminds me of how volatile the situation really is. 
   The March 11 crackdown on people who were gathering at a prayer meeting was a disturbing display of violence. Two people were killed. The leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangari, and other members of the MDC were tortured while in police custody. 
   Two women were beaten so severely they needed specialized medical care that was only available in South Africa. One of them, Sekai Holland, had her leg broken in three places, her knee broken and her arm and three ribs broken. I cannot understand what possessed security forces to beat a 64-year-old woman so brutally. 
   And according to the people in Zimbabwe, abductions and killings continue. However, there are encouraging developments. What is most encouraging is that the regional leaders in Southern Africa have spoken out publicly. As recently mentioned, the President of Zambia has likened Zimbabwe to the Titanic, a sinking ship. Officials at the South African Department of Foreign Affairs expressed concern about the situation as well. 
   The leaders of Southern Africa's Development Community held a meeting of extraordinary heads of state in Tanzania in the wake of violence and asked South African President Thabo Mbeki to help resolve the situation. 
   This is an important step, and we should support SADC's effort. It is imperative that Congress do all we can to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are respected in Zimbabwe across the political spectrum. 
   As Mr. Lantos mentioned, Zimbabwe had great promise. When the struggle to end white rule of Ian Smith was led by Mr. Nkhomo and Mr. Mugabe, the ZANU and ZAPO leaders, they finally were able to break the stranglehold of Ian Smith's government. And education was the order of the day, and the Zimbabweans went ahead to build a country. 
   But something happened in the meantime, and the move from multi-partyism to single-party system, and Mr. Mugabe taking all of the power, that was a move in the wrong direction. And so we have seen multi-partyism come back again. But this brutal behavior of the security forces must end. 
   In conclusion, I think that we should take a look at the Lancaster House Accords because this was an agreement between Zimbabwe and Great Britain where there would be willing seller-willing buyer purchase of the land that was in the hands of the very small minority of the white Rhodesians.     
   And there has to be a program of some land distribution. However, the way that Mr. Mugabe has been doing it, as Mr. Lantos mentioned, in the past there was an attempt to assist Zimbabwe to see if we could help in that process, but we were denied. 
   So I just ask my colleagues if they would support this resolution, and, hopefully, Mr. Mugabe and the people of Zimbabwe will finally see the light.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (THE RUTGERS WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I was only going to speak about our Rutgers women, but I do want to also add my voice to the condolences for the Virginia Tech students. Out of the number of students who were killed, four students came from my State of New Jersey. So our hearts are heavy for all of the families, but especially for our four New Jersey students. 
   I also want to add my congratulations to Congresswoman Woolsey for being the persistent voice against the war. Day in and day out she has brought this to our attention, and I think much of what we see today in the movement against the war can directly be attributed to her tenacity. 
   I want to also commend Speaker Pelosi for the groundbreaking trip she took to Syria. I think that the dignity and the knowledge and the respect that were shown to her will begin to break the ground, and I hope that she continues to do that. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a Representative from New Jersey, I am pleased to rise here in the United States House of Representatives to praise the young women of the Rutgers basketball team, the Scarlet Knights, and their inspirational coach, C. Vivian Stringer. They are true champions not only for their academic and athletic achievements, but for the dignity, for the strength, for the class they have shown during this ordeal. 
   These 10 women overcame disappointing early losses in the season to advance, amazingly, to the Final Four. Around the Nation fans watched as the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers, who had lost four of their first seven games, defeated Duke's Blue Devils in an exciting 53-52 upset victory. This was after a lopsided 59-35 victory over LSU. 
   When the ugly incident with Don Imus cast a shadow over their success, these young women showed what they were made of. In standing up for themselves and their school and for New Jersey, they also took a stand on behalf of all young women who insist on being treated with respect and refuse to be insulted and stereotyped. 
   Don Imus and those of his ilk vastly underestimated New Jersey's strong and proud Scarlet Knights. He underestimated the pride we feel in New Jersey about our remarkable women on that team. As a matter of fact, during the founding of the Nation, New Jersey had a theme: ``Don't tread on us.'' Don Imus may have had a microphone, but he was no match for these young women and their coach, who so eloquently spoke up for what is right and fair. I am so proud that through their actions they were able to persuade two major networks, MSNBC and CBS, as well as numerous advertisers, that the days of using public airways to ridicule and debase anyone they choose are over. 
   Let me add that it is time that the FCC start doing its job by halting the use of racial and gender slurs over the public airways. As long there is weak enforcement, there will continue to be hate language used by the so-called ``shock jocks.'' In Rwanda it was the radio that urged people to kill and to go. It is hate radio that can create problems, serious problems, as we have seen, like I said, in Rwanda. 
   History has shown us that words matter, and once society accepts ugly language, ugly incidents will follow. We see the indecent exposure at the Super Bowl, where a tremendous amount of attention was paid. However, we let a Don Imus go on year in, year out, year in, year out, and many others. Something is wrong with that picture. 
   I call on the networks to examine their record of hiring minorities for top on-the-air and executive positions so that African Americans are fairly represented in the media. One reason that the networks made the decision to discontinue the Don Imus show was that the network employees let the management know how disturbed and embarrassed and offended they were by these demeaning commentaries and that they were a part of that institution, and that was the overriding factor. However, it was Rosa Parks, who 50 years ago decided that she would not sit at the back of the bus, and the people from Montgomery walked for a year, 2 years, and broke the back of the bus company. It was once again the economics that had a play in this 50 years later that people said that if you continue to advertise on that station, we will not use your product. So I am proud of the American people. 
   Finally, let me say that once again I am proud of these young women, one from my district in Newark, New Jersey, from the high school Shabazz that I taught at.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS REPORT ON THE ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank you again for your great work, Congresswoman Jones, she does a fantastic job, and for all of the leaders that you have heard mentioned. And I would like to commend Dr. Elsie Scott for really bringing the foundation forward. Of course, our chairperson MEEKS and KILPATRICK and G.K. BUTTERFIELD and CHRISTENSEN. 
   Let me also commend our speaker pro tempore this evening for the great work that YVETTE CLARKE, a new Member from Brooklyn, who has come into this House and has brought vitality and excitement. And we know that she will do an outstanding job as she moves that district forward. It's a great pleasure to have you with us. 
   Let me just say that I dealt with three areas, BOBBY SCOTT, DANNY DAVIS and our brain trust on education. Then I had the Head Start part. Then we had two other workshops and brain trusts, one, ``We Don't Do February.'' And that is about integrating African American history into the regular curriculum so that when we hear about Patrick Henry and Nathan Hale, we will hear about Crispus Attucks and Peter Salem. When we hear about the Rough Riders, we will know about the  Buffalo Soldiers. So the Amistad Committee of New Jersey is integrating African history into the regular textbooks. 
   Then, of course, as you all know, we deal with the Africa brain trust, the theme, ``The New Africa: Opportunities and Challenges,'' President Wade of Senegal and former President Obasanjo of Nigeria, and Under Secretary Henrietta Fore, Ambassador Ali, AU Ambassador to the U.S. And we had Dr. Adasena, who was representing Kofi Annan's new group on the ``Greening of Africa.'' And Ambassador Lyman, former Ambassador from the U.S. to South Africa and Nigeria. And Dr. Juma from Harvard talking about education. 
   So we really had standing room only. I recall 19 years ago, when I started the brain trust, we had a difficult time. We used to run in the halls and just drag people, beg them to come in. Now, unless you're there before 9 o'clock, you're not going to get a seat. So it shows that the Congressional Black Caucus, the constituency for Africa has grown very strong, and the members of the caucus are so supportive of the efforts we're doing, not only in Africa but in the Caribbean. And in Latin America, where Afro-Latinos are saying we want our share, too. We have, in Brazil now, an affirmative action program where in their colleges, they will have to admit the qualified blacks who've been ignored, and in Columbia. 
   So we have seen in the ``hands across the ocean,'' as I often say, that the blood that connects us is much thicker than the water that separates us. 
   So with that, I will yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, we have now entered the sixth year of the war in Iraq, a war the Bush administration assured us would be short and easy. One Bush official famously remarked that the victory in Iraq would be a ``cakewalk.'' Sadly, it has been the opposite for our troops, who continue to face lengthy and multiple deployments in the war. 
   Last week, as we mourned the marking of a grim milestone, the death of 4,000 American troops in Iraq, we were reminded of the human costs of this ill-advised war. 
   Military leaders warned that the war is putting enormous stress on our troops. We have seen a dramatic increase in suicides and depression. Lieutenant General William Caldwell, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, said the Army is experiencing a shortage of majors and captains, because many who have had one, two and three combat tours have made the decision to go back into civilian life. 
   With 4,000 American lives lost and thousands of young men and women suffering serious injuries, we should be looking at a way to end the war in Iraq. Instead, the Bush administration continues to support the status quo. ``100 years'' is one presidential candidate's latest statement. 
   We must end the war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Miller for his leadership on this bill and certainly urge my colleagues to vote for the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This legislation will provide the single largest investment in college financial aid since the 1944 GI Bill, helping millions of low- and middle-income students and families pay for college. 
   This legislation would provide about $18 billion over the next 5 years in college financial aid at no cost to the United States taxpayers, no new costs. 
   This new investment is critically important because college costs have grown nearly 40 percent in the last 5 years. Students are graduating from college with more debt than ever before. Many would-be students are holding off going to college or skipping it altogether because they do not believe they can afford it. 
   By boosting scholarship and reducing loan and tuition costs, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 makes an historic investment in America's college students, its economic competitiveness and its future, while maintaining fiscal responsibility. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this landmark legislation.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the passage of H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which would help nearly 13 million American workers and their families by increasing the Federal minimum wage by $2.10 an hour. Let me thank the chairman, George Miller, for bringing this very important legislation to the floor. 
   The intent of the bill is to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour, but let me just say this: When I hear naysayers say that this will eliminate jobs, back in 1994, when New Jersey had the highest minimum wage in the country, we compared the job growth of low-income jobs in New Jersey to those in Pennsylvania. Not only was there no negative impact on low-income jobs in New Jersey, but actually during that period of time, in the middle nineties, the minimum wage jobs in New Jersey grew at a higher rate than they did in Pennsylvania, which proved that the increase in the minimum wage did not run jobs out of the area. That was done by the American Economic Review. 
   Just recently, a survey was taken that showed that 83 percent of Americans support an increase of $2 or more in the minimum wage, and a survey this week from the Associated Press found that 80 percent of Americans support an increase in the rate. So there has been consistent support from the public in the United States of America. That is why we going in a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, as a former teacher and as a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I am concerned by the fact that as the need for post-high school education increases in our country, so has the high price of attending college. Tuition fees at public universities have increased 41 percent after inflation since the year 2000. 
   A recent report highlighted my home State of New Jersey as having the highest college costs in the Nation for 4-year public institutions. Including tuition and room and board, it costs an average of $17,515 to attend a public 4-year university or college in New Jersey, about $5,600 over the national average. Because of these skyrocketing costs, many students and their families must take out student loans. 
   Unfortunately, thanks to the policies of the Bush administration in the past and of a Republican-controlled Congress, interest rates have increased as funding to college programs have been cut. Now this Congress has a chance to pursue a positive course by broadening college opportunities for all American students.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me commend the gentleman from California, chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, for bringing forth this very important resolution dealing with the equal employment opportunities in the military. 
   I think that it is great that we are finally recognizing these 21 brave men who had the courage to stand up and say that enough is enough. In many instances, workers are intimidated by the surroundings, by worrying about their positions, worrying about having action taken against them; and so it is always great when people decide it is time to step forward and do the right thing. 
   Dr. King said, in his march on Washington that there was a promissory note that was sent out by America to the, at that time, the Negroes, and that the check came back, the promissory note, marked ``insufficient funds.'' And this was a part of the insufficient funds, people willing to work, but being denied. As a matter of fact, when World War II began, that infamous December 7 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, our country was caught off guard; we did not have the build-up, the military wherewithal, we did not have the weapons, we did not have the ships, we did not have the tanks. 
   And there then became a move to try to catch up to the enemy because they were preparing for war and we were not. However, blacks were not allowed to work in the factories that were producing or tried to catch up. It actually took President Roosevelt at that time to encourage U.S. businesses, even though they were short of manpower because the draft had come in, they would not hire blacks, even though it meant that we could not prepare and produce the equipment that we needed. And so sometimes racial discrimination really makes no sense at all. 
   I agree with the gentlemen from California and from Minnesota who said that there have been big changes, things are different now. I would like to once again thank the gentleman from California for bringing forth this resolution.

   H. Res. 43 
   Whereas the Boise State University Broncos football team won the 2007 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, defeating the University of Oklahoma Sooners by a score of 43-42 at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on January 1, 2007;
   Whereas the Broncos have won the last 5 consecutive Western Athletic Conference football championships;
   Whereas the Broncos are the Nation's top scoring Division 1-A collegiate football team for the last 7 seasons, with an average of over 42 points per game;
   Whereas the Broncos are the Nation's 4th winningest Division 1-A collegiate football team for the last 7 seasons, with a record of 75-13 and winning percentage of over .850.
   Whereas the 2007 Fiesta Bowl is widely considered one of the best games in the history of college football;
   Whereas the Broncos are the only Division 1-A collegiate football team to complete the 2006-2007 season undefeated;
   Whereas Broncos head coach Chris Peterson called some of the most creative and courageous offensive plays in bowl-game history, including the game-saving ``hook-and-lateral'', game-extending ``tailback pass'', and game-winning ``Statue of Liberty'';
   Whereas the Broncos are 5-2 in Division 1-A collegiate post-season games;
   Whereas Broncos quarterback Jared Zabransky was named the Offensive Most Valuable Player of the Fiesta Bowl;
   Whereas Jared Zabransky threw for 3 touchdowns and 262 yards in the Fiesta Bowl and completed his college career with a record of 33-5 as a starting quarterback;
   Whereas Broncos defensive back Marty Tadman was named the Defensive Most Valuable Player of the Fiesta Bowl;
   Whereas Marty Tadman intercepted 2 Sooner passes, including one returned for a touchdown, and had 5 tackles in the Fiesta Bowl;
   Whereas Broncos running back Ian Johnson, one of the Nation's most exciting running backs, gained 101 rushing yards, scored 1 touchdown, and scored the game-winning 2-point conversion in overtime of the Fiesta Bowl;
   Whereas the entire Broncos team should be commended for its determination, work ethic, attitude, and heart;
   Whereas the Broncos are deserving of an opportunity to play for the National Championship;
   Whereas the Broncos are building an impressive legacy of excellence in its football program; and
   Whereas the Broncos have brought great honor to themselves, their university, the  city of Boise, and the State of Idaho: Now, therefore, be it

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise to commend the Boise State University Broncos' victory over the mighty Oklahoma Sooners in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. 
   For all of you who watched the game, you know it was an exciting game from start to finish, and anyone who was not a fan of the Sooners had no choice but to cheer for the underdog Boise State as the game progressed into the second half and overtime. 
   Every player for the Broncos should be commended for their effort throughout the game, and head coach, Chris Peterson, should be commended for making risky calls and preparing his team, a decided underdog, for success and for victory. 
   Since the Bowl Championship Series began in the 1998-1999 college football season, only two teams from non-BCS conferences have been invited to BCS games. Following the 2004 season, the Utah Utes from the Mountain West Conference defeated the Pittsburgh Panthers in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl, and now the Boise State Broncos from the Western Athletic Conference have become the second non-BCS team to win a BCS game, winning one of the most exciting games ever played. 
   Boise State's success should not be a shock to anyone who has followed this team over the past 5 years. Their victory in the Fiesta Bowl completes an undefeated season and their second 13-win season in the past 4 years. 
   Over the past 5 years, they have an astounding 58 wins and only seven losses. There are very few teams during that span of time to have experienced a modicum of success that this State University in Idaho has experienced. 
   I also want to congratulate the Oklahoma Sooners for battling their way back in this very exciting ball game. They fell behind by 18 early in the second half, but showed tremendous poise and character by coming back in the game and even taking the lead very late in the game. 
   However, after it was all said and done, the Broncos, led by quarterback Jared Zabransky, executed a tremendous hook and ladder for a touchdown to send the game in overtime. In overtime, Boise State, down one, went for a two-point conversion, and called the patriotic Statue of Liberty play, run by Ivan Johnson, to complete the 43-42 victory. 
   I congratulate Boise State University's president, Dr. Bob Kustra, Coach Chris Peterson, and the Boise State University's football team for a wonderful season and for being the only undefeated major division college football team in the Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson). And there is no question that he has every right to be very proud of the Boise State Broncos. 
   As a matter of fact, I think that because it is a small school, because it is a school that is not the perennial schools that finish up top, say, the last 50 years, for the last 8 or 10 years Boise State has had a difficult time trying to prove its worth. Even though they beat top contenders, they will say it was a fluke; it was some mistake, it was just by luck. And I think that by their continuing winning, by them moving up and winning the national championship, I believe that they will finally have the naysayers saying that this is really an outstanding team. 
   We found the same situation in the great State of New Jersey, where Rutgers University, a State university that has had a terrible football program for years and years and years, although it played one of the first football games in the country in 1897 against Princeton, when Princeton and Rutgers played. They have now, finally, been able to, after last year wasn't a fluke, this year losing only two games and going to a major bowl. 
   Athletes from New Jersey now are staying in New Jersey, and that is what made the difference. New Jersey athletes have made other States' teams great, and now that they are staying in the State, we will certainly expect to see Rutgers University, perhaps, play Boise State next year for the national championship. 
   So with that, Madam Speaker, I, again, congratulate the Boise State Broncos. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Let me begin by thanking my colleague, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, for introducing this resolution, and also to congratulate her and her fellow alumni for the Gators' win last week in the 2006 Bowl Championship Series. 
   A week ago Monday marked the University of Florida's second national football championship when they defeated Ohio State University Buckeyes. College football fans, student athletes and the general public were treated to an exciting national championship game, an end to the college football season. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to head coach Urban Meyer, athletic director Jeremy N. Foley, University of Florida president J. Bernard Machen, and Florida's student athletes for attaining the unprecedented achievement of holding concurrent Division I national championships in football and men's basketball. 
   I also want to extend my congratulations to the Ohio State University Buckeyes and their student athletes for a great season. Ohio State won all of their games during the regular season and produced the 2006 Heisman trophy winner, Troy Smith. Winning concurrent championships has brought national acclaim to the University of Florida, and I know the fans of the university will remember this very special moment for many years to come. 
   It takes a great deal to assemble a world-class football team. It takes dedication of the young men who are playing on the team. It takes support from the alumni. It takes patient and accomplished coaching. It takes support from the community. A winning football team can bring an entire community together. It brings pride to the individuals on the team, but it brings joint pride to the community in general. 
   And so although many people say why is so much emphasis put on sports, I think that it is one of the tools that brings us together that has the esprit de corps that makes America great. As a former, simply, high school coach, I know the hard work and the time and effort and the sacrifice, really, that it takes for the players, that it takes for the coaches being away from their families, their children, away on weekends. It is a real sacrifice. And so I once again commend the university and once again say, to have the number one football and number one basketball team in the country in the same year is a great achievement. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE LATE DR. JOHN GARANG DE MABIOR -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of House Resolution 98. 
   Let me begin by thanking Chairman Lantos for his leadership in the Foreign Affairs Committee, which allowed our resolution to come through the committee, and our ranking member. And I would like to also give special acknowledgment to Congressman Frank Wolf, who for many, many years, even preceding my entrance to Congress, was working on issues dealing with the problem in Sudan. And he worked very closely with the late Dr. John Garang de Mabior to help bring about peace in southern Sudan. 
   Madam Speaker, H. Res. 98 honors the life and achievements of Dr. John Garang de Mabior and reaffirms the continued commitment of the House of Representatives to a just and lasting peace in Sudan. The resolution honors the life and achievements of Dr. Garang; reaffirms its commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Republic of Sudan; calls for the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement without delay; strongly urges the people of southern Sudan and its leaders to continue to support Dr. Garang's vision for a new Sudan; and strongly supports the creation of a Dr. John Garang de Mabior Institute for Agriculture, Peace, and Economic Development in southern Sudan. 
   Dr. Garang had a vision for a new Sudan, a Sudan which is multicultural, multi-ethnic, and peaceful. He fought for 21 years as the leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement/Army to achieve a just peace for his people but only served 21 days as the first Vice President of Sudan before being killed in a tragic and mysterious helicopter crash on July 30, 2005, in his region of south Sudan where he was to be sworn in as President. 
   Dr. John, as he was affectionately called, was a powerful human being and a symbol of a people's freedom from oppression. Dr. John was born into a poor family of the Dinka ethnic group in the Upper Nile region of Sudan. He was orphaned by the age of 10 but supported by his family members. When the first civil war started in 1962, he was too young to fight and was sent away to school in Tanzania and later came to the U.S. to get his degree and studied at the University of California Berkeley but decided to go back.     
   The fact is that Dr. Garang was a person that we honor and respected so much, and he will live on in that country. But there was this tragic and mysterious crash on July 30, 2005, which took his life. At the time I was traveling the region in hopes of seeing Dr. Garang in Southern Sudan to discuss the status of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. It was a terribly saddening situation when I received the news of his crash. 
   Besides leaving behind a wife and five children, he also was mourned by the people of all of Sudan, from east, west, the center, to the north as well as the south. They all saw him as their hope for future peace and justice in Sudan. 
   Thankfully, the number two member of the SPLM, Dr. Salva Kiir, was installed as the new first vice president of the government of Sudan and President of the government of South Sudan, and we are working to help professionalize the government of Southern Sudan and the SPLA. This is a critical time for real and lasting peace in Sudan. 
   We must support the government of Southern Sudan in development efforts and arrange for elections in 2 years. We also must ensure that the people of Southern Sudan get the right to self-determination through a referendum in 2011, as provided for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
   I have followed the crisis in Sudan for most of the last 21 years as the Islamic government in Khartoum waged war against the Sudanese People's Liberation Army/Movement and the people of the south. More than 4 million people were displaced from Southern Sudan, and over 2 million people were killed over the course of this 21 year war. 
   During that time, the National Islamist Front Government, led by Omar el Bashir, committed innumerable brutalities of unimaginable scope against the people of the South and the marginalized areas of Southern Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains. It was the longest running war in Africa until January 9, 2005, when the parties signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
   I was in Nairobi for the signing of the CPA and was cautiously hopeful that the long awaited peace in Sudan would work. However, once the north-south conflict reached a point where an agreement was imminent, the government began its attack on the innocent civilians in Darfur. With the help of the Janjaweed, the National Congress Party, formerly the National Islamic Front, had destroyed villages and communities, and maimed, raped, killed and terrorized the people of Darfur. 
   In the annual Country Report on Human Rights released today, the State Department called Darfur ``the most sobering reality in 2006.'' Over 400,000 are dead; more than 2.5 million displaced. 
   The people of Sudan have suffered tremendously under the hands of this government which, by the way, came to power in a bloody coup in 1989. This same government harbored Osama bin Laden for 5 years between 1991 and 1996. He plotted several terrorist attacks from there. 
   However, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement so many people have worked for has not been implemented fully, and the genocide in Darfur is not abating. We must be firm with Khartoum. Khartoum must comply with the CPA. Khartoum must stop the killings in Darfur. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this resolution. 
   I also want to take the opportunity on the floor of the House of Representatives to congratulate Ghana on 50 years of independence from Britain. Today, people from all over Ghana and all over the world and many heads of state are celebrating the first Sub-Saharan country to gain its independence 50 years ago. So the correlation between the new Southern Sudan and what happened 50 years ago in Ghana is very important. 
   Let us remember that Ghana's first leader, Kwame Nkrumah, had a broad vision of African unity. President Nkrumah did not make a distinction between north and south. He called it one continent. His belief is in one Africa, one of the underpinnings for African unity. 
   So Africa certainly has a long way to go, but the continent as a whole is more stable today than it was many years ago, and with better governance and use of resources, as well as fairer trade policies by the U.S. and other Western countries, African countries can grow and develop into one of the most important areas in the world. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, during the first 6 years of the Bush administration, the President and congressional Republicans squandered away large budget surpluses that were left to them by the Clinton administration; yet they failed to properly fund key national priorities. Again this year, the Bush administration proposed a budget that ignores the real needs of American people, particularly at a time of such economic uncertainty. 
   This week, congressional Democrats will bring a budget to the House floor that fully funds Medicare and Medicaid, the health care programs for the Nation's most vulnerable people, including our children and our seniors. Unlike the President's budget, our budget fully invests in environmental protection and low-income heating programs such as LIHEAP so that low-income families, including those in my district in New Jersey who are facing skyrocketing home heating bills this winter, will receive some much-needed assistance. We also fully invest in the COPS program so that we can better protect our streets against crime. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do all of this without raising taxes by one single penny. This is a well-crafted budget, and it deserves strong bipartisan support.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (CALLING FOR A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THE CURRENT ELECTORAL CRISIS IN KENYA -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, ``Kenya is at a crossroads.'' Those are the words spoken this morning by the chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Kenya in a hearing that I chaired on the current crisis today. 
   Kenya had been considered a linchpin on economic and political stability in the East Africa region for decades. We always were proud of the accomplishments and the achievements of them, and we often pointed to Kenya as a beacon of how other African countries and countries throughout the developing world should move towards democracy. However, we have seen very sad occurrences during the past month or two. H. Con. Res. 283 seeks to address the unfortunate and still unfolding political crisis in Kenya. 
   I went to Kenya last month to assess the situation and to encourage political, religious, community, and civil society leaders to find a peaceful resolution to the current situation. I visited thousands of displaced children in Jamhuri showground and met with volunteers from diverse backgrounds. It was remarkable and encouraging to see Kenyans coming together to help their fellow citizens, donating food and material to those in need. 
   Indeed, witnessing the violence and meeting the young victims was deeply troubling. Yet, I am confident that Kenyans will come out of this crisis united. Kenyans must put Kenya first. 
   Kenyans of different religious, ethnic, and economic backgrounds live together peacefully in a region long marred by civil war and political chaos. Unfortunately, like the millions of Kenyans, the more than 170,000 refugees from the Ogaden and Somalia regions in Kenya will also be affected, because when the central government is affected, those other people, refugees and other groups in need, are also affected, as will be the lives of so many others in the countries surrounding Kenya. Many depend on Kenya for economic and industrial progress for their countries to survive. 
   On December 27, 2007, the citizens of Kenya went peacefully to the polls to elect a new parliament and a new president, despite the logistics challenges and long lines. More than 14 million Kenyans registered to vote. That is 82 percent of the eligible voters. An estimated 2,547 parliamentary candidates were qualified to run in the 210 constituencies, a clear indication of the desire and the determination of Kenyans to participate and to be a part of the political process in their country. 
   Incoming President Mwai Kibaki was hastily declared the winner by the Electoral Commission of Kenya, after a series of highly irregular events which cast significant doubt on his so-called victory. Let me be blunt: The election results announced by the ECK do not reflect the wishes of the Kenyan people. The people of Kenya voted for change. What they were given was more of the status quo. 
   In reaction to what occurred, Kenyans went to the streets to express their frustration and anger. The protests soon turned violent, and it is still unfolding as we speak. More than 1,000 people have been killed and over 300,000 displaced as a result of unrest, including an estimated 80,000 children under the age of 5, and these young lives are being traumatized as we speak. Millions more have been adversely affected. Two members of the parliament from the opposition ODM were killed in  January, reducing a five-member lead to three. 
   The instability in Kenya continues to threaten and affect the economies of neighboring countries, imposing serious threats to regional stability, a fragile region in the first place. But this is going to make it even more fragile. The Kenyan economy has been hit hard and recovery may take a long time. 
   H. Con. Res. 283 does several critical things. One, it strongly condemns the ongoing violence in Kenya and urges all parties concerned to immediately end the use of violence as a means to achieve their political objectives. It also calls for all parties to participate in good faith and dialogue mediated by former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, and asks President Bush to consider imposing asset freezes and travel bans on leaders in the Party of National Unity, the Orange Democratic Movement, and other relevant actors who refuse to engage in this dialogue to end the current crisis. 
   Additionally, the resolution calls for the international community to respond to the grave humanitarian needs of the people of Kenya and all neighboring countries to provide assistance to those affected by the violence.     
   At the same time, it calls for a review of our assistance to Kenya and restrict any nonhumanitarian assistance. 
   Before concluding, though, I would like to point out that U.S. diplomatic efforts in the wake of the election have not been stellar. Indeed, the response to the Kenyan election crisis proves beyond a doubt that some of the administration officials are too quick to embrace a government that engages in electoral abuses and overlook rather than condemn its electoral and human rights abuses. 
   We saw this happen in the 2005 elections in Ethiopia. We must proceed carefully and thoughtfully and work with our partners in the EU and AU to help resolve this crisis. I also want to emphasize a very critical point. Despite statements by some to the contrary, what is happening in Kenya is not an ethnic conflict. It is a political conflict with ethnic overtones. 
   We must look closely at the historical and political context to really understand and to avoid making additional mistakes on how we characterize what is happening today in Kenya. However, if political leaders in Kenya do not make a serious effort to stop the violence now and address the systemic problems that exist in their political structures, the violence we are seeing could certainly reach a point of no return. 
   Once that happens, it will be very difficult to stop. It is critical that a transitional coalition government is established with a clear mandate to implement necessary reforms such as a new constitution, a new electoral law, a new electoral commission, and address the root causes of the crisis and prepare the country for transparent Presidential elections within 2 years. The people of Kenya deserve no less. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank the gentleman from California and commend him for the outstanding work that he did as chairman of this subcommittee and his continued interest in the subcommittee's activities. 
   I would like to say that I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey cosponsoring this resolution, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Wolf, who has been a true real leader on issues in Africa, too. One of the things that I must say, as I already mentioned about Mr. Royce, that our Subcommittee on Africa, regardless of which political party tends to chair it, has worked in a bipartisan manner for the 20 years that I have been a member of the committee, sometimes in the majority, sometimes in the minority. 
   But the thing that has been very encouraging is that in 95, 96 percent of the time, I would say we are on the same page. We see things the same way. We might have to tweak a word or two here, but by and large, we have been able to move forward on so many important issues because of the bipartisan spirit. 
   Once again, Mr. Royce, I appreciate your continued support, and, of course, Ranking Member Smith, who is not only doing a tremendous job here but with the Helsinki Commission, and for the fact that he is very interested in the situation in China, I appreciate your continued human rights efforts. It's a pleasure to work with you.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (CONGRATULATING LEE MYUNG-BAK ON ELECTION TO PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to first thank my friend Mr. Royce of California for introducing this resolution which congratulates President-elect Lee Myung-Bak on his victory in the South Korean presidential elections. 
   In electing Lee Myung-Bak, the South Korean people have selected a man of exceptional accomplishment and proven leadership. During his 27 years at the helm of Hyundai Group, Mr. Lee transformed the company from a successful but relatively small local corporation into South Korea's largest industrial conglomerate with a dominant worldwide presence. 
   Mr. Lee and Hyundai's success helped drive the Republic of Korea's dramatic success as an East Asian economic ``tiger'' in the seventies, eighties and nineties. The parallel is particularly appropriate since in English the Korean word ``hyundai'' means ``modern.'' As Mr. Lee led the company to new heights, he played a direct role in the spectacularly rapid modernization of the Republic of Korea. 
   Mr. Lee's extraordinary professional career is right at home among the American Dream stories of our Nation. The son of a cattle rancher who fell onto hard times, Mr. Lee was born into poverty and worked his way through  college as a garbage collector. Relying on his talents and work ethic, he eventually rose to the pinnacle of the business world. 
   Committing himself to politics, he became the mayor of Seoul and applied his leadership skills and his no-nonsense approach to improve that important city. Now as South Korea's president, he is uniquely able to lead and further strengthen his country, one of the United States' closest and most significant allies. 
   Mr. Lee's story is a potent reminder that the friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea is based not only on our shared interest but also our shared values. For over 50 years, our two countries fought together against common threats such as communism, but the foundation of our alliance is a common commitment to democracy, individual liberties, and human rights. 
   The end of the Cold War did not end the critical role of our alliance in promoting and protecting political and economic freedoms in Asia and around the world. Today, we work side by side to combat international terrorism, denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, and promote peace and stability in northeast Asia. This work relies on our strong military alliance, bolstered by 28,000 military personnel stationed in the Republic of Korea. 
   We also share a dynamic economic relationship. With two-way trade approaching $80 billion, South Korea is the United States' seventh largest trading partner, and the United States is the fourth largest trading partner of the Republic of Korea. Our shared commitment to free, fair, and open political systems is reinforced by our commitment to free, fair, and open markets. 
   Further strengthening our bilateral relationships and our bonds of friendship are the millions of South Korean visitors that come to the United States and the millions of visitors from the United States that travel to South Korea every year. Many South Koreans who come to the United States do so to visit their Korean American family members, who make up a vitally important part of the United States' social and economic fabric. 
   Based on these shared interests and values, the U.S.-Republic of Korea relationship is strong and is poised to grow even stronger. 
   With this resolution, we in Congress rightly congratulate Mr. Lee Myung-Bak on becoming the next president of South Korea, welcome his inauguration on February 25, and look forward to the opportunity to work with him to further strengthen the relationship between our two countries. 
   I strongly support this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Let me once again say that I certainly support this very timely resolution and urge that our two countries continue to forge strong relations. 
   We, as has been mentioned, have a very strong Korean American community, even in my State of New Jersey. But also, I'd just like to mention, now that I'm thinking about it, several years ago I had the opportunity to visit a hospital in Ethiopia. A Christian organization built a hospital. Much of the funds came from individual businesspeople from South Korea. The Myung Sung Christian Hospital in Addis is the finest hospital in all of Ethiopia, and it was built by the Koreans who wanted to show their appreciation for Ethiopian soldiers who fought with them in the Korean War. 
   And, as a matter of fact, it's very interesting that the South Korean Government still pays veterans a monthly stipend, those who are still alive, of course, and who served in that war, they send them a check every month to show their appreciation for the Ethiopians who fought. I don't know of many countries that have done anything like that. 
   So, Mr. Royce, I certainly support your resolution.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, with the Bush economy losing 325 jobs so far this year, it is important for the House to extend a financial lifeline to millions of unemployed workers, many in my home State of New Jersey and across the Nation, who are having trouble finding jobs. Today, 1.6 million Americans have exhausted all of their unemployment benefits. The numbers are expected to grow to more than 3 million Americans by the end of this year. 
   Last week, with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans, this House passed legislation giving workers and their families an extended 13 weeks of benefits so that they don't have to worry about losing their homes and their cars while they're looking for work. 
   For weeks, despite continued bad economic news and huge job losses in the airline and auto industries, the White House actually threatened to veto the legislation. Fortunately, they have reconsidered, and they are now supporting that the unemployment insurance will continue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic Congress has made good on its promise to change the direction of the war in Iraq while providing critical funding for our veterans and our wounded soldiers. Yet, the President is still threatening to veto a final conference report when it comes out of this Congress. 
   Why would the President veto a bill that requires Iraqis to take control of their country by meeting key security, political and economic benchmarks the President himself established? 
   Why would he veto a bill that provides greater protections for our troops and our veterans than what was originally requested by the President? 
   The supplemental provides 1.7 billion more for military health care, which includes facility upgrades at Walter Reed and other hospitals that require renovation. We also provide an additional $1.7 billion for veterans health care to ensure that they have access to quality care. The veterans I have met with from New Jersey have told me that this is one of their top priorities. 
   I have been opposed to the preemptive war in Iraq from the beginning because the administration has failed to explore diplomatic solutions. And therefore the stay-the-course strategy is wrong. And I hope that the President will sign and not veto this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in expressing my deep condolences to the families of Virginia Tech University. 
   Let me begin by commending Representative BOBBY SCOTT for introducing this very important resolution. As you know, Representative Scott is a member of the Education and Workforce Committee and has shown a tremendous interest in young people throughout his State and the Nation, and this exemplifies the deep concern that he has for all of our children. 
   Let me commend the Virginia delegation for its coming together and uniting with the Governor of the State of Virginia with the State legislators, with the students to see about a way that healing can start. To the families and friends of the 32 victims, to the students, to the faculty and the staff, to the alumni of Virginia Tech, we express our condolences. 
   As a member of the Education and Workforce Committee, we are deeply concerned about the future of our Nation. We are concerned about our young people whether they are in preschool, in elementary or secondary education, whether they are in the institutions of higher education. And we continually learn, and we have to continually change as Toffler said in his book, ``Future Shock,'' 20 or 30 years ago, that if institutions and agencies do not change internally with the same rate of change externally, then those institutions or agencies become obsolete. And this is, again, another example of how we have to rethink how we operate. New Jersey had 4 students of the 32 who perished in this senseless act, and so our hearts are heavy, also. 
   I think that we have to see how we can assist. Those of us in New Jersey heard little about Virginia Tech 20, 30 years ago until they became a part of the Big East, and then we did hear about Virginia Tech because they had overwhelming sports teams, they had such tremendous student support. It is a great institution. And we know that they left the Big East for the ACC, but we have fond memories of our competitive competition. 
   I am a Seton Hall graduate, so we were competing many times. 
   But I think that we have to use this example to see how we can heal. I think that we need to take this tragedy and see how we can better identify students who have problems, students who go to elite schools, who are lonely, students that have situations that need to be dealt with. 
   We have in our inner cities many young people who don't have the opportunity to go to higher learning. We need to really, I think, as a former national president of the YMCAs of the United States, I think we need to focus more of our attention on the young people. A Nation that loses its young is losing a part of its future. We need to really spend more time on our young so that we develop them, so that we can nurture them, so that we can be sure that our country can be all that it can be as we move through this new millennium.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (COMMENDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE RUTGERS UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, as a representative from New Jersey, I am pleased to rise here in the United States House of Representatives to praise the remarkable young women of Rutgers University, the Rutgers women's basketball team, the Scarlet Knights, and their inspiration, Coach C. Vivian Stringer. They are true champions, not only for their academic and athletic achievement, but for the dignity, strength and class they have shown during this ordeal. 
   These 10 young women overcame disappointing losses early in the season to advance amazingly to the Final Four. They lost four out of their first seven games. But around the Nation, fans watched as the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers, who lost four of their first seven games, defeated Duke's Blue Devils in the last seconds in an exciting 53-52 upset, the same team that had lost to Duke by 20 points earlier in the season. This victory followed a lopsided defeat of the very strong LSU women's team by a 59-35 score. 
   When the ugly incident with Don Imus on his morning show cast a shadow over their success, these young women showed what they are made of. In standing up for themselves and their school, they also made a stand on behalf of all young women who insist on being treated with respect and refused to be insulted, as Don Imus did to them, and stereotyped, as he used these disparaging words to describe these wonderful young women.     
   Don Imus and those of his ilk vastly underestimated New Jersey's strong and proud Scarlet Knights. He underestimated the pride we in New Jersey feel in the remarkable women of this remarkable team. As a matter of fact, during the 13 original States, New Jersey had a theme, and it just said: Do not tread on us. And that meant we are a proud, small State, but do not mess with us. Don Imus did not know the history of New Jersey. 
   Don Imus may have had a microphone, but he was no match for these young women and their coach who so eloquently spoke up for what is right and what is fair. I am so proud that through their action they were able to persuade two major networks, MSNBC and CBS, as well as numerous advertisers that the days of using the public airwaves to ridicule and debase anyone they choose are over. He did not realize that these women, as I said, at that initial press conference, that they had, with the 10 of them, all underclass persons, dressed in their uniforms, sitting up proud, people who will be future  lawyers and musicians, all top students. As they spoke, as they introduced themselves, it was just a joy, and so Don Imus really did a favor to these young women because it gave America a chance to put a face with a name, to listen to what he said and what he called them and to see just the quality of these young people. 
   Let me add that it is time that the Federal Communications Commission start doing its job by halting the use of racial and gender slurs over the public airwaves. As long as there is weak enforcement, there will continue to be hate language used by the so-called shock jocks. 
   As a matter of fact, there was a great outcry when at the Super Bowl there was an indecent of exposure, and there were fines levied because there was some equipment failure, and therefore, there was an outrage of indecency. 
   However, it is allowed for people to say whatever they want to say. As a matter of fact, in countries, radio has been used to foster hate. As in Rwanda, it was hate radio, Radio Colline, that went on to say, let us get this genocide going; you know what those people look like, go and get them. And it was the radio that pushed this, and so we have to be careful about what we allow to happen on the airwaves. History has shown us that words matter, and when society accepts ugly language, ugly incidents will follow. 
   I call on the networks to examine their record of hiring minorities for top on-air and executive positions so that African Americans are fairly represented in the media. One reason that the networks made the decision to discontinue the Imus show was that the network employees let the management know how disturbed and offended and embarrassed they were to work for that company. That was the overriding factor, and then the sponsors said that they would withdraw their sponsorship. 
   And so we will not allow these demeaning commentaries to continue. I once again applaud those young women and their fine coach from the Scarlet Knights at Rutgers University. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The Democratic House has now passed 50 key measures since January, most with strong bipartisan support. Thanks to this Democratic Congress, millions of Americans will receive their first pay raise in almost a decade on January 24. As a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I was proud to support the long overdue increase in the minimum wage. 
   Gulf coast hurricane communities will get much needed relief, up-armored Humvees and critical military  support are getting to our troops, and fiscal responsibility has been restored to the Federal budget after the White House and Republican-led Congress reversed President Clinton's budget surplus and replaced it with the biggest budget deficit in American history. 
   This is only the beginning. This House has also passed legislation that will better protect our Nation by fully implementing the recommendations of the nonpartisan 9/11 Commission. Let's continue to move forward in this positive direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (STRENGTHENING THE SUCCESSFUL SCHIP PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, as the House prepares to vote on the Child Health and Medicare Protection Act, known as the CHAMP Act, later today, I think it is important to refute some of the misleading talking points that Republicans are seizing on as they oppose this health insurance for millions of American children. 
   First, Republicans claim that by strengthening the State Children's Health Insurance Program, known as SCHIP, we are advancing ``government doctors,'' advancing ``government health plans.'' 
   This could be no further from the truth. Government does not deliver SCHIP services. Instead, it is private doctors and private health plans through private insurance. This program is operated successfully in my State of New Jersey and around the Nation. 
   Second, Republicans say that we are trying to expand the program to reach middle-income families. Again, that is false. We are not expanding the program. Today, 5 million children are eligible for SCHIP but are not enrolled. We are strengthening the program so that we can reach almost all of these children, the vast majority of whom come from low-income families. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE IN IRAQ AND PRESIDENT BUSH IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE WAR IN A NEW DIRECTION -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, over this past weekend, five more American soldiers were killed in Iraq, bringing the number killed in April to over 100 U.S. soldiers. It was the deadliest month for American soldiers this year. Sadly, the total number of Americans killed now stands at 3,351, along with thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children. 
   The realities on the ground that our brave soldiers continue to face day in and day out stand in stark contrast to President Bush's pronouncement 4 years ago that major combat operations in Iraq were over. 
   If major operations were over 4 years ago, what have our troops been fighting the last 4 years? If indeed our mission was accomplished 4 years ago, as the banner behind the President on that aircraft carrier proclaimed, what are American troops still doing in Iraq? 
   If the President truly wants to bring our mission to a just conclusion, he should work with Congress instead of simply vetoing our funding bill as he did. It's now up to the President to decide if he will support accountability for Iraqis, benchmarks for success, and new direction in Iraq, for we cannot stay this course.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. I appreciated having the opportunity to control the time in the past several hours, and perhaps might request from the chairman perhaps an additional 2 minutes as I respond and wrap up. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say that I listened with great interest to the George Washington story, and there is no question that there were tough times. But George Washington had some pretty intelligent advisers. You know, the people who signed the Declaration of Independence, he had people like Adams and Washington. You had people like Crispus Attucks, the first person to die in the Revolutionary War and in the Boston Massacre on May 4, 1770. 
   You had people who participated in the Boston Tea Party because they said taxation without representation is tyranny. It was Christmas Eve in Pennsylvania when George Washington came across the Delaware and attacked the Hessian soldiers on Christmas Eve because they were unaware that this attack was coming. George Washington came from New Jersey, Morristown, Newark, and went on through and did have a victory. 
   But let me say the difference, when George Washington was fighting, there was a clear and present issue. We were fighting for independence. We knew exactly what it was. We were being held bondage by the British, that Union Jack. 
   But what do we have here? We have, following 9/11, support from practically every country in the world. But then we went on and Osama bin Laden said he did the bombing, he took credit for it, the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the final plane that was brought down on the way to the Capitol and the White House. 
   Then we said that we were going into Iraq. First of all, it was because there were weapons of mass destruction. Then it was the fact that we had to have a regime change. At one point we talked about we had to remove Saddam Hussein. 
   We kept looking for reasons, and that is a big difference. We had the preemptive strike, and then we tried to come up with the reason that we were doing it, and it continued to change, one reason after another. 
   There is a great sense of sadness among those of us who foresaw over 4 years ago the tragedy that is now unfolding in Iraq. On October 8 and 9, 2002, I stood right here in this very well at the House of Representatives, and I managed the time those 2 days in opposition to the preemptive first strike for Iraq. It was in the 107th Congress, and now we are in the 110th Congress, and the war that we assumed would be swift and certain now continues to rage. 
   I am looking over the remarks I made at that time. It saddens me that the argument of those of us who oppose the war fell on deaf ears. At that time, I stated that a unilateral first strike would undermine the moral authority of the United States of America. I stated that results of substantial losses of life will occur, that there will be a destabilization of the Middle East region and undermine the ability of our Nation to address unmet domestic priorities. 
   It saddens me beyond words that 3,122 Americans had to sacrifice their lives and over 23,000 have been wounded for a war that did not have to be fought. Included in this number are 50 fatalities from my home State of New Jersey and 366 wounded. Estimates are up towards 100,000 Iraqi men, women and children have been killed. 
   After the administration has been proven wrong on every prediction from the length of the war to weapons of mass destruction to the strength of the insurgency, we are now being asked to trust their judgment on a new strategy, which would put 20,000 more American lives on the line. This plan will not provide lasting security for Iraqis. It is not what the American people have asked for in November.  Haven't we learned anything from our mistakes yet? 
   Recent so-called short-term troop surges in Iraq have not stopped the violence from getting worse. There is nothing to suggest that this time will be any different. 
   For example, we had Operation Together Forward from June to October 2006. In June, the Bush administration announced a new plan for securing Baghdad by increasing the presence of Iraqi security forces. That plan failed, so in July, the White House announced that additional American troops would be sent into Baghdad. 
   By October, a U.S. military spokesman, General William Caldwell, acknowledged that the operation and troop Increases was a failure and had not met our overall expectations of sustaining a reduction in the level of violence. Regardless of how the administration intends to increase the troops in Iraq, the result will be the same. 
   There is additional strain on our military personnel and their families, and personal lives will be upset by unexpectedly early deployments of family members or unexpected delays in their homecoming. This is an additional burden to our military families that they should not have to bear. 
   By extending operations, we undertake a strategic risk. Our ability to meet potential future challenges is strained under the current operational demands. Increasing these demands only increase the risk to our future capacity. 
   I had the privilege of serving in the past as a congressional delegate to the United Nations. I strongly believe in the power of democracy. If we had allowed the United Nations inspectors to complete their work before the war instead of suddenly ordering them out of Iraq, I believe things would have turned out much differently. Instead, the administration proceeded full speed ahead towards war, as they disseminated faulty intelligence and relied on scare tactics to garner support. 
   I believe the time has come to begin an orderly withdrawal of American forces from Iraq. This approach would send a message to the Iraqis that they must take more responsibility for their own security and would reduce the strain on the American military. 
   The administration should listen to the Baker-Hamilton commission, which has offered a stinging assessment of virtually every aspect of the U.S. venture in Iraq and called for a reshaping of the American presence and a new Middle East diplomacy initiative to prevent the country from sliding into anarchy. 
   I conclude by saying I have heard my colleagues on the other side warn about Iraq falling into chaos and dangers of the United States losing our standing in the world. Sadly, Iraq already is in total chaos, and, unfortunately, the United States, a country we all love, has suffered much loss and prestige around the world. 
   In the debate before the war those of us who predicted the outcome did not prevail. I pledge with my colleagues to listen this time to vote against escalation of the war and support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (ACT COMMEMORATING THE LITE, OR LIFETIME INNOVATIONS OF THOMAS EDISON -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing one of New Jersey's own--Thomas Alva Edison. H.R. 2627, the Lifetime Innovations of Thomas Edison, LITE, Act, is a testament to Edison, whose impact is still being felt today. Congress, in 1928, honored Edison with the Congressional Gold Medal for the ``development and application of inventions that have  revolutionized civilization in the last century.'' In 1997, Life magazine named Edison ``Man of the Millennium'' in recognition of his inventions that have transformed modern society, including the incandescent light bulb, the motion picture camera, and the phonograph. The LITE Act will preserve the intellectual and physical accomplishments of Thomas Edison by commemorating his lifetime achievements; re-designating the Edison National Historic Site, located in West Orange, NJ, my congressional district, as a national historic park; and authorizing appropriations to support the site. 
   The Edison site is actually comprised of two separate sites--Edison's home of 45 years, known as Glenmont, and his laboratory complex. The Edison site houses over 5 million pages of documents, over 400,000 artifacts, approximately 35,000 sound recordings, and over 10,000 books from Edison's personal library. Like this priceless collection of documents and artifacts, Edison's laboratory complex and home are also historical treasures. With buildings dating back to 1887, the laboratory complex was one of America's first research and development facilities, and is where Edison earned over half of his 1,093 patents. Moreover, Mr. Edison's gravesite is located on the grounds of his beloved Glenmont, a 29-room home built in 1880 that contains original furnishings and other family items. 
   H.R. 2627 is critical to efforts to protect the Thomas Edison National Historic Site. The Edison site has enormous historical significance for America and for the world, and is badly in need of restoration. The need for major infrastructure improvements at the Edison site has been documented as early as 1972. Additionally, the site was listed, in 1992, by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the Nation's most ``endangered historic places.'' The laboratory complex is currently closed to the public because of an extensive restoration effort. It is estimated that the first phase of the restoration effort will be completed next year and that the laboratory complex will re-open to the public some time between June and September of 2008. Renovations at Glenmont have been completed and the site is open to the public and fully functioning. Plans also exist for a second phase of the restoration project. Currently, National Park Service, NPS, staff are housed in historic buildings under less than ideal circumstances. The second phase will focus on getting NPS staff out of the historic buildings and into office space that better supports their critical mission of preserving Edison's historical legacy. 
   When the Edison site was fully operational, approximately 95,000 people visited the site each year. It is estimated that the number of visitors will nearly triple when the first phase of the restoration project is completed next year. H.R. 2627 would ensure this commitment by re-designating the Edison site as a ``national historical park''--consistent with National Park Service guidelines--and authorizing appropriations for restoration work. These measures will preserve Thomas Edison's historical legacy, enhance the educational experience of visitors to the site, and hopefully, encourage more private funding for restoration projects. 
   Although private benefactors--most notably the Edison Preservation Foundation--have generously donated significant resources to restore the site, the Federal Government's long-term commitment to the site is critical to its longevity and educational mission. This legislation recognizes Thomas Edison's numerous contributions to American society and preserves the Edison National Historic Site as a leading educational, scientific and cultural center. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is non-controversial. Similar legislation in the 109th Congress was supported by the National Park Service and approved by the House by a vote of 399-1. I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD DIABETES DAY -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer House Concurrent Resolution 211, pronouncing that Congress supports the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day. 
   Let me thank Representative Manzullo, who was a prime cosponsor of this legislation, and other Members, for cosponsoring this bipartisan resolution. 
   This global health awareness campaign established in 1991 by the World Health Organization and International Diabetes Federation is celebrated annually on November 14. This marks the birthday of Dr. Frederick Grant Banting, a Canadian medical scientist, Nobel laureate, and co-discoverer of insulin. And now, it is an official United Nations recognized day. 
   World Diabetes Day aims to coordinate diabetes advocacy worldwide. In almost every country of the world, the incidence of diabetes is on the rise. Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of global death by disease. In the United States, it is the sixth leading cause of death including accidents, but of deaths by disease it climbs to number five. 
   The economic burden on both developed and developing countries due to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diabetes was analyzed in a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Diabetes currently affects 246 million people worldwide and is expected to affect 380 million people by 2025. In 2007, the five countries with the largest number of people with diabetes are India, China, the United States, Russia, and Germany. Worse, each year 3.8 million deaths are attributed to diabetes. An even greater number die from complications, renal failure, vascular loss. Soberly, every 10 seconds, two people develop diabetes and a person dies from diabetes-related causes. 
   On December 20, 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed landmark Resolution 61-225, recognizing diabetes as a chronic, debilitating, and costly disease. This is the first year, therefore, that the World Diabetes Day has risen to such prominence, and it is fitting that here in the United States Congress we support it this day. 
   Mr. Speaker, World Diabetes Day has annually focused on a particular aspect or complication of diabetes, the heart, the eyes, the kidneys, and feet. I am especially pleased that this year the World Diabetes Day's theme focuses on raising awareness of diabetes in children and adolescents who face unique challenges when diagnosed with diabetes. The campaign aimed to firmly establish the message that no child should die from diabetes. 
   As a senior member of the Committee on Education and Labor and Foreign Affairs, as a delegate to the United Nations since 2003 and 2005, I see this year's theme as a perfect synergy of a global health and childhood issue, with importance to the United Nations. 
   So as we speak here, November 1 in Bermuda, 246 people dressed in U.N. blue t-shirts to represent the 246 million people in the world with diabetes. They stood up. Tomorrow in Lagos, Nigeria, there will be a walk starting at Maryland and ending at Lagos State University, where there will be young people asking folks to have their blood sugar level checked. In Australia, from November 11 to November 20, there are children-centered activities from a Switch-Off Turn On to Play Pledge that will once again highlight this. 
   And so, as I conclude, while commemorating World Diabetes Day, of course I can look no further than my own congressional district of New Jersey to find shining examples of the dedication to diabetes in the area of education in St. Barnabas Hospital and Newark Beth Israel are all leaders, and we hope that everyone will join in this. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of House Concurrent Resolution 211, supporting the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Chairman, the Chair of our Congressional Black Caucus who has done such an outstanding job, it is really a great loss. We have this untimely loss of our wonderful friend and colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones. A void has been left in the lives of all of those of us who had the privilege of knowing this remarkable, vibrant and accomplished woman. It is a loss shared by her family, her many friends, her Ohio constituents, and all of those around our great Nation who looked to her as a champion of justice, a person who was an advocate for the everyday people. 
   A former county prosecutor, a judge on the municipal court, she went to break glass ceiling after glass ceiling, with her election as the first African American woman to be elected to Congress from Ohio. She tore down barriers here in the House of Representatives when she successfully sought a seat on the Ways and Means Committee, and those walls came down. She was like at Jericho. When she blew that trumpet, the walls just came tumbling down. She was just so full of energy. 
   In the little time that she was on the Ways and Means Committee, her reputation for fairness was so great that she was selected as Chair of the Ethics Committee. To chair the House Ethics Committee, you have to be the fairest person among that body. It is a tough, tough position. So, once again she was called to duty. It is really not an office you seek, it is just something that is bestowed upon you, and when you are asked, you have to take it. 
   She was a pioneer who forged ahead, not just for herself, because she knew that she was opening doors for others. As Cochair of the Caribbean Caucus, I had the pleasure of traveling with Stephanie. We would go to the Caribbean, and she was a great traveling companion. She had a lot of interest in global issues. She was interested in understanding other cultures. She was interested in those people in nations less fortunate than ours. 
   She was enthusiastic about promoting international trade. She wanted to have economic development to address the problems of poverty and hunger around the world. She wanted to bring more educational opportunities to regions in the Caribbean and other places that we traveled. 
   Even though she was a diligent public servant, Stephanie always found time to laugh and enjoy life. A terrific sports fan, she was unrivaled in her enthusiasm for her hometown teams, the Cleveland Browns, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and she even cheered the Cleveland Indians, even though they had not won a World Series since 1948 and she would complain about that. 
   She was just so proud of Mervyn II. She loved to sail. My brother is a sailor, and they would talk about just getting out. The only water I like is when I take my shower every day, and that is about it. But she loved to sail, and she just knew all about it, and her sister Barbara right there paid attention. 
   I remember her proud father. He was elderly and he was so dignified. One time we were staying on the same floor at the CBC's hotel where we were, and his tie came loose. He was walking so proud, and I said, could I just fix it for you? I just felt good just trying to do something. And he was just so proud. I know how my grandfather was, the dignified black men who had to endure so much. But when they walked, they walked proud and they walked straight as an arrow, and that is how he was. 
   She was just great. She was my pal. She was my traveling companion. It just hard to find words for Stephanie, full of life, full of energy. I didn't smoke, but I used to tell her she needed to slow down on that smoking. But we did have some times together. I won't get into that. We don't want to get into too many details. 
   But she was good at everything. She did a great job with that tennis and golf tournament every Wednesday at the Congressional Black Caucus lunch. She would say, you have got to come. You have got to support it, scholarships for children. 
   It is hard to be in Congress without Stephanie there, but we are going to have to remember her. She was my pal.  
   With the untimely loss of our wonderful friend and colleague, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a void has been left in the lives of all those who had the privilege of knowing this remarkable, vibrant, and accomplished woman. It is a loss shared by her family, her many friends, her Ohio constituents, and all those around our great nation who looked to her as a champion of justice and also an advocate for their everyday concerns. 
   A former county prosecutor and judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court, she went on to break another glass ceiling with her election as the first African American woman elected to Congress from Ohio. She tore down a barrier here in the House of Representatives when she successfully sought a seat on the Ways and Means Committee, which had no African American woman member at the time. It was a measure of her reputation for fairness that she was selected to serve as Chair of the House Ethics Committee. 
   She was a pioneer who forged ahead not just for herself, but because she knew that she was opening doors for others who would benefit from her groundbreaking steps. 
   As Co-Chair of the Caribbean Caucus, I had the pleasure of traveling with Stephanie  Tubbs Jones, and what a great traveling companion she was. She had a strong interest in global issues, in understanding other cultures, and in improving the lives of those in nations less fortunate than ours. She was enthusiastic about promoting international trade and economic development; in addressing the problems of poverty and hunger; and she wanted to bring more educational opportunities to regions where such opportunities were severely lacking. 
   Even though she was a diligent public servant, STEPHANIE always found time to laugh and to enjoy life. A terrific sports fan, she was unrivaled in her enthusiasm for her teams, the Cleveland Browns, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and she even cheered on the Cleveland Indians, even though they had not won the World Series since 1948--a year before she was born. 
   She was also very proud of her son, Mervyn II, and she loved spending time with her sister, Barbara Walker. I recall the care and attention she paid to her elderly father; it was touching to see the bond between them when they were together. 
   Stephanie lived life out loud. Her dazzling smile, her passion for causes, and her devotion to her family made her a remarkable person to know. 
   Her home town newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, summed it up well when they wrote that she was ``tough, exuberant, passionate . . . a woman from modest means who rose to national prominence.'' 
   Our thoughts and prayers remain with her family as we mourn the loss of Stephanie Tubbs Jones and celebrate her amazing life and legacy.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (NO BLANK CHECK FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ WITHOUT INPUT FROM CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, while our troops continue to perform heroically in Iraq, President Bush's troop surge has not lived up to its promise of producing essential political reconciliation. 
   As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I helped lead the opposition to our involvement in Iraq in the first place because I felt that we should let the weapons inspectors do their jobs before rushing into a preemptive military strike. 
   After our Iraq policy failed, and the rationale for going to war was invalidated due to the absence of weapons of mass destruction, we're told that the so-called military surge would help bring about a political solution in Iraq. That has not happened. Senior military commanders have indicated that the inability of the Iraqi Government to achieve political reconciliation is a greater threat to our troops than the insurgency in Iraq. 
   Many of us here in Congress believe that the Iraqi Government will not begin to address the political reconciliation until it is clear that our troops are coming home. 
   Last month, House Democrats once again passed a bill that provided our troops with $50 billion in funding and a strategic plan that brings them home. We must bring our troops home. We demand a change in the direction in Iraq.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, from day one, this Democratic Congress has been fighting to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, bring down record gas prices, and launch a cleaner and smarter energy program. We have passed legislation to suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve later this month through the end of this year. After initially opposing this legislation, the President signed it into law last month. 
   We passed legislation that gives the U.S. the authority to prosecute anticompetitive conduct committed by the  international cartels, like OPEC, that restricts supply and drives up prices. The House also passed the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which allows us to retain and create hundreds of thousands of new ``green'' energy jobs and invest in the renewable energies of the future. 
   Today, experts estimate biofuel blends are keeping gas prices about 15 percent lower than they would otherwise be right now. With gas prices continuing to skyrocket in my home State of New Jersey and across the Nation, House Democrats will continue to explore ways to provide relief to consumers at the gas pump.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (TRIBUTE TO FOUR OF NEWARK'S FINEST -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I come to the House floor today. 
   Over the August recess, four young, promising Newark, New Jersey residents were savagely gunned down execution style in a city playground while enjoying the last days of summer. 
   On August 14, 2007, in my city of Newark, Terrance Aeriel, age 18, Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower, both age 20, were senselessly murdered. Natasha Aeriel, age 19, is still recovering in the hospital. 
   I stand here today to pay tribute to their lives. While three were cut short, were full of courage and determination and continue to inspire the residents of Newark. 
   Active in their community, these youths stayed above the fray. Dashon, Iofemi and Natasha were avid music lovers and played in their Newark High School marching bands while they attended high school. Terrance, full of charisma, became an ordained minister at age 13. 
   Their hard work paid off; all became students at Delaware State University. Natasha and Dashon were juniors, Terrance was a freshman, and Iofemi was about to begin classes. 
   In a testament to how they lived their lives, Natasha, who has undergone many major surgeries and is still  recuperating, provided the police with many key details that led to the apprehension of six suspects. Without her input, some of the suspects may have evaded capture. Her bravery and perseverance is an inspiration for others who, for various reasons, fail to speak up for what is right at times. 
   While I know that their families and the community are going through a trying time, I hope they take comfort in the legacy that these four young adults had created. It can be said that this senseless crime cut short their promise, that their destinies went unfilled. I beg to differ. In the short time that they were alive, their lives epitomized consciousness, fortitude and dedication to family and friends. They have and will continue to serve as role models for the young and old in the city of Newark. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to recognize three lives that ended too soon, and one that is still brimming with possibilities. Let us not remember Terrance Aeriel, Dashon Harvey and Iofemi Hightower for the senseless crime that took their lives, but for the lives that they led. As Natasha Aeriel continues to recover, I commend her for her bravery and conviction. I wish to convey my sorrow and condolences again to their families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Thank you very much for yielding. 
   Let me commend the sponsor of this great resolution and also let me just commend Representative Skelton for the outstanding work that he has done for so many years in the Armed Services Committee. 
   I stand in support of this resolution, H. Con. Res. 297, because as we all know, there were many, many African Americans who have fought valiantly through many of the wars. I'm very proud to have an uncle who just passed away 2 years ago, 3 years ago, who was in the invasion of Normandy. I used to recall as a young boy receiving the letters that he would send that were photocopied and made about the size of your hand where anything they felt was strategic was blacked out. And my Uncle John was a staff sergeant. As I mentioned, he was in the invasion of Normandy. And his wife, Ruth Garrett, who is still alive, worked in Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey for the war effort making weapons for our armed services. He was very proud when the World War II monument was opened, and he proudly sat with his uniform and his cap and his medals and made us very, very proud of his service. Even today, one of my employees, Richard Turner, is serving in Iraq. 
   But there have been African Americans who have served for so many years. It took Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt to fly with the Tuskegee Airmen for them to finally allow the Tuskegee Airmen to fly in combat because there was resistance to that. And as we know, the first person, as a matter of fact, to die in the Revolutionary War was Crispus Attucks back in 1770 on March 5 when he and four other patriots were taken down by the British to start the Revolutionary War in the Battle of Bunker Hill where we had Crispus, and where we had Salem Poor who fought at the battle of Bunker Hill. And we can go on and on. 
   A neighbor of mine, Needham Roberts and Sergeant Henry Johnson, captured 30 German soldiers in World War I and kept them captive for over a month. And people wondered how two soldiers could have kept so many enemy soldiers at bay. And so I am so proud to have this recognition and certainly pay tribute to Harry S. Truman. He was a person who had said ``the buck stops here.'' He was from Missouri. He said that he'll take the heat, and he did. 
   And so I would just like to once again commend so many of the men and women who continue even today to show their appreciation and strength for our Nation as they serve valiantly in the United States Armed Services.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (HONORING THURGOOD MARSHALL ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Let me begin by thanking my fellow colleagues, Mr. Sherman included, who joined me in the cosponsorship of this commemorative resolution, which honors Justice Thurgood Marshall's legacy and his dedication to civil rights and public service. 
   Thurgood Marshall was born the grandson of a slave back in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908. Marshall's mother, Norma Marshall, was one of the first black persons to graduate from Columbia Teacher's College in New York City. His father, William Canfield Marshall, worked as a railroad porter and as head steward at an exclusive white club. Mr. Marshall was the first black person to serve on a grand jury in Baltimore in the 20th century. 
   Thurgood Marshall grew up in Baltimore and graduated from an all-black high school at the age of 16. During his childhood, his parents taught him to argue by making him prove every statement he made and by challenging every point he made. At school, as it was mentioned earlier, when Thurgood Marshall got into trouble, the principal would make him sit in the basement and read the U.S. Constitution. 
   Students couldn't return to class until a section of the Constitution was memorized. Evidently Thurgood Marshall had an opportunity, because he memorized a great deal of the Constitution, but that moved him into the interest of being a lawyer rather than a dentist, which his mother wanted him to be. 
   After graduating from high school, Justice Marshall attended Lincoln University, a historically black university in Chester, Pennsylvania, a school that many outstanding blacks from the United States and abroad went to, including the first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah. 
   However, education was such a priority for the Marshall family that Mrs. Marshall sold her engagement ring in order to send Thurgood Marshall to school. After his graduation with honors at Lincoln University, Justice Marshall applied to the University of Maryland Law School. He was not accepted because he was black, and that set in motion the events of his future. 
   That same year, Marshall was accepted at Howard Law School, and he went on to graduate in the class of 1933. Upon graduating, Justice Marshall started his own practice in Baltimore. The next year he discovered the NAACP and became an active member. 
   As a matter of fact, Justice Marshall then sued the University of Maryland's law school, where he was not admitted, and won the case about discrimination. So he did get justice in the end. 
   From 1940 to 1961, Thurgood Marshall served as legal director of the NAACP, which allowed him to travel throughout the United States representing numerous court cases. Most of the clients had disputes involving questions of racial justice, which ranged from common crimes to appellate advocacy, raising the most intricate matters of constitutional law. 
   I had the privilege to follow his work very closely, because I was then president in the middle 1950s of the NAACP youth councils in college chapters and attended the NAACP convention in Detroit in 1957 when Dr. Martin Luther King received the Spingarn Award. 
   Of course, Thurgood Marshall was still a person that we all admired. As we heard, out of the 32 cases, he won 29 of them, earning more Supreme Court victories than any other individual before the Supreme Court and as chief counsel of the NAACP, the landmark Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which overturned Plessy v. Ferguson of 1897, saying that ``separate but equal'' was constitutional. 
   In 1961, John F. Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit, despite heavy opposition from many southern Senators. Thurgood Marshall served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1961 to 1965. As we heard, he wrote 112 opinions, none of which was overturned on appeal. 
   In 1965, President Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall to the position of solicitor general, which he held from 1965 to 1967. Then in 1967, President Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall as the first African American Justice to serve on the Supreme Court. 
   During his 24 years of service in the Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall promoted affirmative action and sought protection for the rights of all Americans.     
   In 1992, he was honored with the Liberty Medal recognizing his long history of protecting individual rights of women, children, prisoners, and homeless.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (MIDDLE CLASS CONTINUES TO GET SQUEEZED AS ECONOMIC SITUATION GETS WORSE -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, for 7 years now, President Bush and Republicans have catered to the excesses of the wealthiest few while ignoring real needs of working Americans. Over the past 6 years, the median household income has fallen over $1,000 per year while prices for health care, education, food, and gas have increased well above inflation. How can we expect working men and women to continue to meet the financial needs of their families when they bring home smaller paychecks as prices rise? 
   The Democratic Congress has been working hard to ensure that working Americans are not ignored. We passed an economic stimulus package that puts money into the wallets of working families. We've also passed legislation addressing the concerns of millions of Americans, including many of those from my home State of New Jersey, who are afraid of losing their jobs or are afraid they might lose their homes. 
   Senator McCain's chief economic adviser claims that Americans are whining, that the economic downturn is all in their heads. House Democrats realize that we need to turn the Bush economy around.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (HONORING NELSON MANDELA ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first thank our chairman, Mr. Berman, for moving this resolution swiftly to the floor in light of the time sensitivity of this resolution. Let me also recognize Mr. Jefferson for introducing this resolution and for inviting me to join him in that endeavor. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Friday a living icon of freedom will turn 90 years old. His birthday already has been celebrated at more than 20 different charity events around the world. Now it's time for the United States Congress to rise in its voice of praise of Mr. Nelson Mandela in recognition of his remarkable life and the contributions that he has made to humankind. 
   His struggle on behalf of black South Africans confronted with the horrific system of racial hatred is legendary. It landed him in prison under harsh conditions for 27 years. Mr. Mandela will be remembered for many things, but perhaps the words he spoke at his trial sums up his effort best. He said: 
   ``During my lifetime, I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against  white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideals of a democratic and free society in which all people live together in harmony with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal which I am prepared to die for.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, death did not claim Nelson Mandela that day or in the decades of dismal imprisonment to follow. Instead, he grew to become a figure almost larger than life, an international symbol of an oppressed people's thirst for justice. He joined the pantheon of inspirational figures whose legacy belongs to all humankind: Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And as a measure of what he meant to us, Nelson Mandela's liberation and subsequent rise to become President of a free and democratic South Africa were greeted with joy and near disbelief around the world when it occurred. 
   Mr. Speaker, Nelson Mandela was born in a small village in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. His family belonged to the Thembo Dynasty, a Xhosa noble bloodline in South Africa. He was well educated, earned a law degree, set up a law practice with his long-time friend who spent 27 years with him on Robben Island, Walter Sisulu. 
   As a young man, Nelson Mandela joined the African National Congress, which was established in 1912 to fight for justice and equality for Africans against discrimination and unjust laws prescribed by the minority European settlers. For decades leaders of the ANC challenged the segregation system imposed on them and demanded, through petition to the courts and to the British Royalty and government, the freedoms and opportunities afforded the whites who dominated South Africa at that time. 
   In 1944 Nelson Mandela, along with other young educated Africans, formed the African National Congress Youth League, in large measure to shift the traditional ANC role from an elite organization to a mass-based, African nationalist movement. After the 1948 election of the Afrikaner National Party, racial segregation laws that had been adopted incoherently were codified into a comprehensive segregation policy called ``apartheid,'' creating major challenges for Mandela, the African National Congress, and its allies. 
   Apartheid institutionalized racism through physical and social segregation of all ethnic groups. It codified race classifications, prohibited interracial marriage, and reserved certain jobs for whites. While black Africans comprised 75 percent of the population, under apartheid they were allowed to live on only 13 percent of the worst land in the country. All public facilities were segregated by race. Black Africans were forced to carry identification cards and forbidden to be in towns preserved for whites, unless they had explicit permission to go there. 
   In 1964 when many fellow leaders of the ANC and its armed wing were arrested, Mandela was brought to trial with other comrades who were plotting to overthrow the government by violent means. He and his seven comrades were imprisoned for life for their leadership in opposing apartheid. 
   In 1989, on the strength of South Africa's own definition of the African National Congress, the United States Government listed the ANC as one of fifty-two organizations around the world as ``the more notorious terrorist groups.'' 
   I am pleased to say that 2 weeks ago, President Bush signed into law a bill introduced by Chairman Berman of our committee that several of our House colleagues joined in cosponsoring to erase this injustice. Particularly, Representative Barbara Lee was instrumental in ensuring the bill's passage in the Senate. Now Nelson Mandela and others who supported the effort of the ANC will no longer face additional security measures based solely on their association with the ANC while traveling to this country. Long overdue. 
   In 1993 Nelson Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize, which he shared with former South African President F.W. de Klerk.     
   He also has received the Order of Merit and the order of St. John from Queen Elizabeth II and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W. Bush. 
   Today President Mandela is revered around the world and continues to represent the values of freedom, justice and liberation for all people. He has become the champion in the fight against HIV and AIDS through his foundation. He continues to work on behalf of everyday men, women and children so that they can enjoy lives of freedom from injustice, sickness and want. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues in the House to support the measure recognizing Nelson Mandela's unique contributions to humankind. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. In keeping with what the chairman said, in addition to what Mr. Mandela did with the person who really codified apartheid, he invited his jailer, the one who locked and unlocked his cell door, to attend his inauguration as president because he felt that the prison guard treated him with a modicum of respect and he invited him to also attend the inauguration. This was certainly a unique person. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (YOUTH VIOLENCE -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak to this important issue that we have been talking about that has been brought to the floor by Congressman Larson. 
   As we all know, the pendulum seems to be swinging in an opposite direction as relates to our young people. According to the Center for Disease Control, homicide is the second leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year-olds in this country. More closely, homicide is a leading cause of death for African Americans the ages of 10 to 24, the second leading cause of death for Hispanics ages in the same category, and the third leading cause of death for Native Americans, Alaskans, and Asian Pacific Islanders. 
   The recent shootings in Omaha, Nebraska; Cleveland, Ohio; Blacksburg, Virginia; and actually my own hometown of Newark, New Jersey, have shone a harsh light on the rising crime epidemic plaguing our country. Our country has a proliferation of weapons. It is estimated that there are 300 million weapons in this country, one for every man, woman, and child. There seems to be a romance in some areas with guns, the fact that they can be purchased so easily in many parts of our country. Our State of New Jersey has one of the strongest antigun laws in the country; however, people can come in from other States and bring them in. We had four children, four young people, college students executed, four at one time, in a playground, almost gangster type. 
   And so we have to do something to stop this epidemic which is plaguing  our country. We as a Nation, and particularly here in Congress, have a sobering choice to make: We can either continue to bury our heads in the sand and hide behind our tough-on-crime rhetoric and placing the sole blame on things like violent music and video games, or we can be proactive so that we can start seeing real reduction in crime. There are options available to us that are more cost-effective and life-saving than throwing increased resources into cameras and metal detectors and security guards and prisons. 
   Let it not be misconstrued that I believe that these are not important factors in our society. We certainly have to segregate violent criminals from the society. However, if we continue to unwisely spend an overwhelming amount of our constrained resources on this, we will continue to lose on the war on crime. 
   According to CNN, cost analyses show that for every dollar spent on youth violence prevention, $14 is saved on what would have otherwise been spent in the criminal justice system. And so many times an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
   As a matter of fact, as earlier mentioned, the disparity between crack cocaine and powdered cocaine led the sentencing commission once again to say this is discriminatory, it is absolutely wrong to have a 5-year minimum sentence, mandatory, for crack cocaine. But for the same amount, or even 10 times more, and I believe it even goes up to 100 times more for powder cocaine, you can have a suspended sentence. That is absolutely wrong. I am glad that the sentencing commission and the judiciary now are saying we should change this. 
   Also, I am proud to say in New Jersey, just this past week, for the first State in the Union to ban by legislative action the death penalty in the State senate, and today that is being considered in the assembly, is I think really a just way for our State to move. So let me say that I commend Congressman Larson.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (PROTECTING THE MEDICAID SAFETY NET ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for the passage of H.R. 5613, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act. I commend my colleagues Representative DINGELL and Representative MURPHY for introducing this bill, which would extend until March 31, 2009 the moratorium on several Medicaid regulations that would strip an estimated $20 billion over 5 years from the Medicaid program.  
   Mr. Speaker, for more than 40 years, Medicaid has served as the Nation's health care safety net, providing access to health services for millions who cannot afford private insurance in a dynamic and changing economy. 
   Today, more than 57 million children, poor, disabled and elderly individuals rely on Medicaid for care. The program now serves more people than Medicare, and with the ranks of the uninsured growing, and the threat of an economic recession, the Medicaid program is more important than ever. 
   Mr. Speaker, hospitals are the backbone of America's health care safety net, providing care to all patients who come through their doors, regardless of their ability to pay. But, hospitals are experiencing severe payment shortfalls when treating Medicaid patients. 
   Despite these financial pressures, the Administration continues to call for further cuts in federal funds for the Medicaid program that will affect hospitals and the patients they serve. 
   Despite concerns raised by Congress, CMS continues to take steps to implement these regulations. These rules range from limiting payments for teaching hospitals, public hospitals and hospital outpatient services to reducing school-based services for children and case management for the disabled. 
   Last year, Congress imposed a year-long moratorium (P.L. 110-28) on two regulations the proposed and final cost-limit rule and the proposed graduate medical education (GME) rule. The moratorium on implementation of these rules expires May 25, 2008. 
   CMS's regulatory budget-cutting policies will have a devastating effect on my home State of New Jersey's Medicaid program, along with the hospitals and physicians serving our Nation's most vulnerable population--poor children and mothers, the disabled and elderly individuals. Much of Congress has expressed opposition to these rules. 
   This bill would delay implementation of regulations affecting: CPEs; IGTs; GME; coverage of rehab services for people with disabilities; outreach and enrollment in schools, in addition to specialized medical transportation to school for children covered by Medicaid; coverage of hospital outpatient services; case management services that allow people with disabilities to remain in the community; and state provider tax laws. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that CMS's regulatory budget-cutting policies will have a devastating effect on my home State of New Jersey's Medicaid program, along with the hospitals and physicians serving our Nation's most vulnerable population--poor children and mothers, the disabled and elderly individuals. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass H.R. 5613 today. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (JUANITA MILLENDER-<em>McDONALD</em> -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, yesterday we lost a devoted colleague and friend, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents in the 37th Congressional District of California. As we know, prior to her coming to Congress, she made a name for herself as the first African American woman to serve on the City Council in Carson City and the chairwoman of two powerful committees, Insurance and Revenue. 
   But many people don't know that in recognition of women who served our country in uniform during wartime, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald initiated the first annual Memorial Day Tribute to Women in the Military at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. And she led the fight to secure $15 million for the maintenance of the memorial. 
   She also secured $50 million for counseling services for our returning men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Bold initiatives have been her trademark. In 2005, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald, along with other CBC members, unveiled a portrait of Joseph Rainey, the first African-American to be seated in Congress. She was very proud of that because she contacted members of his family who are alive today, and there was a tremendous celebration. 
   Internationally, she spoke out against genocide in Cambodia and Darfur and other regions of the world where human rights are in danger. She worked with former Secretary of State Madeline Albright and Ambassador John Miller on human trafficking and women's rights issues globally. 
   She reminds me of a poem I learned as a youngster in elementary school, actually; but it is appropriate because her memory will live on. The poem is called, ``The Arrow and a Song.'' It said: 
   ``I shot an arrow into the air, it fell to Earth I know not where. For so swiftly it flew, my sight could not follow it in its flight. 
   ``I sang a song into the air, it fell to Earth I know not where. For who has sight so keen and strong that can follow the flight of a song? But long, long afterwards in an oak I found the arrow still unbroke. And the song, from beginning to end, I found again in the heart of a friend.'' 
   And so I say that to say that what Juanita did will live on. Her work for the persons who worked in the Library of Congress who were minorities and women who were being terminated, and we felt unfairly, she took on that responsibility to fight to see that those women, primarily, would be placed in other positions. 
   She worked hard, and the dignity and the beauty and her perfection were certainly noticed. And I can tell you, the women talk about the grace that she had. Well, let me make it clear that the men also noticed that grace and that beauty and that charm. And so we will remember her as she moves on up that highway.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, Americans everywhere are feeling the pain of 8 years of Republican economic policies. Since President Bush took office in 2001, American taxpayers have witnessed the largest increase in spending under any President since the Great Depression. Thanks to a tax policy that has overwhelmingly favored the wealthiest 1 percent, President Bush has been forced to borrow more money from foreign nations like China and Japan than all 42 of his predecessors combined. Through their recklessness, the Republicans turned a healthy budget surplus left by President Clinton into one of the most dismal economic records in history. 
   Last week we had another reminder that the Bush economy is not producing any new jobs. In the year 2000, the Clinton economic plan created 1.4 million jobs in the first 8 months of that year. During the same period of this year, President Bush's policies have led to our economy losing over 600,000 jobs. 
   Middle class workers in my State of New Jersey and around the Nation are not only worried about job security, they are concerned about how to get by, when the median household income has fallen by $1,000 since President Bush took office. 
   We must change and turn this around.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 337, a resolution honoring Seeds of Peace for its 15th anniversary as an organization promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the Middle East and around the world. 
   While the peace process has had its ups and downs over the last 15 years, Seeds of Peace has blossomed into a widely recognized organization that has facilitated interaction among thousands of young people and young leaders and educators from all around the world. 
   Seeds of Peace lays a foundation for sustainable peace by promoting dialogue among young leaders before their fears, mistrust and inherited prejudices have permanently shaped their vision of their enemy. We get them in time to prevent that from happening. 
   After a summer program in Maine, which also includes many American participants, these young seeds, as they are known, and their teachers, continue with regional and international programming that furthers the dialogue among and across nationalities and supports the development of future leaders. Seeds of Peace also fulfills an important recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, reaching out to young people, particularly in Arab and other Muslim countries, and offering them hope and a positive vision of the future. 
   A decade and a half ago, Seeds of Peace, founded by the late John Wallach, envisioned a handful of Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian teenagers coming together in the woods of Maine and breaking down barriers of mistrust. Since its inaugural camp session 15 years ago, the mission of Seeds of Peace has grown to include not just those from the Middle East, but young people from throughout South Asia and Afghanistan. Governments negotiate agreements, but Seeds of Peace has remained as the only people that can define a quality of peace. 
   Every new seed, you may recall that is what they are called when they complete the course, whether he or she is in Kabul or Tel Aviv, Ramallah or Islamabad, represents one more person who has the potential and the required skills to see through mistrust and prejudice and thereby to contribute to making and building peace. That is why we seek to honor the terrific organization Seeds of Peace. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF SANITATION -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I'd like to thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ranking Member CHRIS SMITH and Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON-LEE as well as Representative CHRIS SHAYS for being lead sponsors on H.Con.Res 318, which supports the United Nations Declaration of 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation. Their bipartisan support has helped to bring this resolution to the floor for a vote. I also would like to thank Senator RICHARD DURBIN, who introduced the Senate companion to this concurrent resolution. 
   In September 2000, the United Nations adopted the eight Millennium Development Goals to challenge the global community to reduce poverty and increase the health and well-being of all peoples. Two years later, in September of 2002, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the United States and the rest of the international community reaffirmed these goals and added access to basic sanitation as a centerpiece of the poverty eradication commitments. The target to halve the proportion of people without access to the basic sanitation by 2015 was defined in the Johannesburg Plan of Action. 
   In September of 2005, President Bush addressed the United Nations General Assembly, at which time, as I was the U.S. delegate from the House to the United Nations, I was very pleased that President Bush recommitted the United States to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
   Last year, the United Nations declared 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation in order to recognize the great strides that have been made towards increasing access to sanitation for people around the world. However, it is also a time to galvanize member nations, U.N. agencies, regional and international organizations, and other relevant stakeholders to renew their commitment. 
   Access to basic sanitation is something so simple, yet so fundamental to everyday life. Well, simple, at least, for the majority of people who live in the developed world. An estimated 2.6 billion people live in an environment where they do not have access to proper toilet facilities and human waste cannot be properly disposed. And approximately 1.1 billion people have no access to any type of improved drinking sources of water. As a direct consequence, over 1.6 million people die every year from easily preventable diseases attributable to lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Ninety percent of those are children under five, mostly in developing countries. 
   This lack of access to basic sanitation affects everything from how food is grown and prepared to the ability of girls and young women to attend school. Sanitation is an obvious issue of health, but also one of dignity, physical safety and development. 
   Halving the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation is a target of the seventh Millennium Development Goal, which is to ensure environmental sustainability. In fact, it is vital to the success of other Millennium Development Goal targets in order for them to reach their goal. 
   Access to proper sanitation is essential to reducing childhood and maternal mortality. It can help reduce the symptoms associated with HIV and AIDS. It can also improve the living conditions of 100 million-plus people living in slums.     
   The dividends that increased access to basic sanitation pay are multifold. Depending on the region of the world, economic benefits have been estimated to range from $3 to $34 for each dollar invested in access to basic sanitation and safe water. According to the United Nations, meeting this MDG target will yield nearly $200 billion in annual benefits. If we meet this goal, people and governments will save more than $500 million in direct health treatment costs and get back more than 3 billion working days that are now lost to sanitation-related illnesses. Reducing the incidences to sanitation-related diseases will add nearly 200 million days of school attendance. 
   As we in Congress work to increase access to lifesaving medication and strengthening health care infrastructures, we must remember that the success of such initiatives is, in part, dependent upon individuals having access to basic sanitation. Let us use this time to also refocus our efforts on strengthening one of the basic pillars upon which global health must stand, proper sanitation. 
   I strongly support this resolution and ask that my colleagues back H. Con. Res. 318, which supports the ideals and goals of the International Year of Sanitation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.

As the previous speaker indicated, we passed legislation called Water For the Poor, and in our oversight hearing I was looking for places like Burkina Faso in Niger that had no water, but found that the money was allocated to Iraq and Afghanistan. ``Water for the Poor'' was what it was called, not ``Water for the War.'' 
   So we need to be sure that when we pass legislation, that it goes to the intended recipients and not for other purposes. If other purposes must be done, put them in another budget. There is plenty of money in other budgets and no one ever opposes them. So put it over there, and leave our Water for the Poor for the countries that are actually and really poor.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, with so many Americans fearing the loss of their jobs and their homes and worrying about the rising cost of basic needs like food and gas, it is clear that Washington must act. 
   The House had led the way in working to jump-start the economic recovery by putting hundreds of dollars in the hands of more than 130 million American families with the economic stimulus package. That is only the first step. It is going to take time to reverse the 7 years of the Bush failed economic policies that have favored the wealthiest few to the detriment of the middle class. 
   Congressional Democrats are working to address the record high cost of gasoline with the passage of a renewable energy tax incentive that will lower prices at the pump and create thousands of green jobs. With 325,000 jobs lost over the last 5 months, this Congress extended unemployment benefits last month, so that those having a hard time finding a new job have access to 13 additional weeks. 
   The Bush economy is hurting middle-class families in my home State of New Jersey, across the Nation, and we must give them relief.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (MARKING THE 225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TREATY OF PARIS OF 1783 -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to support this resolution that marks 225 years since the Treaty of Paris concluded the Revolutionary War with Great Britain and that acknowledges the close friendship enjoyed by our two countries ever since. 
   I commend our distinguished colleague, Representative Wu of Oregon, and Vice-Chair of the British-American Parliamentary Group, who introduced this measure. It is important that the House marks this anniversary and celebrates such a vital bipartisan partnership, bilateral partnership also. 
   The Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally ending the Revolutionary War between the 13 original colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain. The settlement of the war and the recognition of our young Nation by Great Britain was a moment of great significance in the infancy of our Nation. 
   Two hundred twenty-five years later, the United Kingdom remains one of our closest allies by virtue of our shared history and values. Both the United States and the UK have proud histories of representative democracy and respect for the rule of law. 
   They have also encouraged and helped many people around the world secure the freedoms and rights their  own citizens enjoy. During World War I, the United States and the United Kingdom fought together as a part of the allied forces against autocratic imperialism. 
   During World War II, again, against the Axis, our countries stood together against the scourge of Nazism and fascism. Our brave troops helped to liberate European countries from Nazi occupation, and innocent civilians from the horrors of concentration camps. We talked about the greatest generation, our World War II veterans, that we today still admire and respect. 
   Throughout the 20th century, the United Kingdom has stood side-by-side with the United States on critical issues concerning liberty and human rights. Most recently the United Kingdom has strongly supported the United States' effort in South Asia and the Middle East. British soldiers are the second largest contributors to NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and the multinational force in Iraq. 
   The United States and the United Kingdom share long histories of industrialization, being among the first nations to develop technologically. Both nations have a culture of intervention and curiosity, as evidenced by the innumerable number of scientific discoveries and inventions. This work has enhanced the frequent collaboration between American and British researchers. We have a tremendous bilateral system going. 
   Indeed, such links are often developed at an early stage as young people take advantage of educational opportunities in each others' countries. There are currently 8,400 British students attending American universities and 32,000 American youth staying in the UK. These young people know all too well the extensive cultural links between our countries as British and American arts, music, literature, cinema, are enjoyed on both sides of the Atlantic. 
   In recognition of the close bilateral relations shared by the United States and the United Kingdom, I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me, once again, say what a great occasion it is marking the 225th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris of 1783. 
   As has been indicated, we are close allies. Many of our organizations, as a matter of fact, the YMCA, which was founded in Great Britain in the late 1840s to take people who were coming into London because of the Industrial Revolution in London and England found a place where they could have a wholesome relationship. Twenty-five years later, that organization was brought to the United States of America. Still we have relations between them, just another example of close ties between the United States and the United Kingdom. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I want to congratulate our colleague Mr. Fortenberry for putting forth this very important resolution. He's a very valued member of our subcommittee, and he has been a strong supporter of issues of goodwill.  
   This resolution celebrates the 60th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first international agreement on the rights of humankind. The universal declaration proclaims the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. It is this universal quality of the declaration that is its strength. 
   The core freedoms and guarantees are entitlement of all people, not just those from certain groups or cultures. As such, no government or Nation has the power to confer these rights. They are inalienable freedoms with which all people are endowed by their very nature. 
   The notion of inalienable rights was not invented in 1948. Socrates wrote about ethic laws that were higher than laws of kings over 2,500 years ago. 
   Even a proclamation of such rights is not new. The Magna Carta, the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Men all articulated specific inalienable rights. 
   The power of the declaration is that it represents the first comprehensive agreement among Nations as to the specific rights and freedoms belonging to all human beings. It has become a cornerstone of customary international law, binding all governments to its principles. 
   In the 60 years that I have followed the adoption of the universal Declaration, expansion of the circle of human dignity has come in fits and starts. Authoritarian governments still attempt to limit freedoms proclaimed by the declaration, including political and economic pluralism, a free press, freedom of association, freedom of religion, free and fair elections, and the rule of law. Nevertheless, the declaration allows humble citizens, be they monks in Burma, political dissenters in Cuba, journalists in Russia, lawyers in Pakistan or dispossessed in Zimbabwe, a standard by which to measure and challenge any government. As such, we see roots of freedom and democracy growing in even the most repressed societies. 
   Our duty is to support the efforts of human rights defenders to expand the circle of human freedoms so that the declaration will, in Eleanor Roosevelt's vision, become the Magna Carta for all men everywhere. As she says, it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (JUBILEE ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND EXPANDED DEBT CANCELLATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by commending Chairman Frank for bringing this very important legislation to the floor, and his ranking member, Mr. Bachus, who has really been a real champion in these issues over the years. Let me give special congratulations to Congresswoman Maxine Waters for her tireless effort to bring H.R. 2634, the Jubilee Act for Responsible Lending and Expanded Debt Cancellation to the floor for consideration, and her long history of working to help the world's countries to elevate their people out of poverty. 
   While nonprofit organizations and Members of Congress initially fought for debt relief, many of us never imagined that we would still find ourselves here today. Unfortunately, with the likes of Debt Advisory International, Elliott Associates, the burdensome IMF and World Bank policies, we must redouble our efforts to prevent such policies and companies from pecking away at the hard-won gains that we have made and must continue to make. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, I understand how the redirection of monies towards debt servicing and vulture funds has crippled African countries' attempts to improve upon development indicators. Sub-Saharan Africa receives approximately $13 billion in aid every year, yet spends $15 billion in servicing old and many times odious debts. 
   This type of deficit spending perpetuates the vicious cycle that prevents African governments from truly creating their own solutions to the challenges that they face. 
   Three billion people in nations around the world are living on less than $2 per day. For some of these nations, they are beholden to servicing debts instead of focusing their financial and human capital towards creating the necessary infrastructure to educate, feed, employ and care for their people. By eliminating many of the debts that are tying their hands, they will be able to direct the necessary energies to alleviating poverty in their countries. 
   Debt cancellation works. Zambia is a prime example as to how monies freed from servicing a country's debt can be used to better the lives of its people. It is using its savings of $23.8 million under the multilateral debt relief initiative to increase spending on agricultural projects on smallholder irrigation and livestock disease control, as well as eliminating fees for health care in rural areas. 
   The Jubilee Act will establish an agreement among the U.S., other countries and international financial institutions to provide debt cancellation for deserving, eligible low-income countries. It will also work to create a binding legal framework to ensure that entities, particularly unscrupulous vulture funds, will not be able to lie in wait in order to seize upon newly awarded debt relief. 
   I congratulate Congresswoman Waters on getting this wonderful and timely bill to the floor of the House. I encourage other Members of Congress to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, the American people are rightfully concerned about the high cost of gas, and they are looking for solutions that will provide some immediate relief. We don't need more of the stale rhetoric of the past 7 years that we have heard from the Bush administration and their so-called energy policy. 
   President Bush and congressional Republicans continue to argue that opening one of America's treasures, the Arctic refuge, to oil drilling will lower gas prices. That's simply not true. 
   Ask the experts. That is the conclusion of the Bush administration's own Energy Information Administration, which estimates that opening the Arctic refuge to drilling today will save only a few pennies a gallon 20 years from now. Sadly, this is the Republican solution to addressing the high prices that they created. 
   The American people are looking for action. That's exactly what this Democratic House has been doing over the past couple of months. Unfortunately, we need help from our friends across the aisle because President Bush remains committed to failed policies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, let me begin by thanking the ranking member of the full committee, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, for introducing this very important resolution.  
   Since the March 29, 2008 presidential and parliamentarian elections in Zimbabwe and the 5-week delay in announcing the presidential victory, President Robert Mugabe of ZANU-PF has carried out a reign of terror on opposition supporters, opposition leaders, and civil society. Mr. Mugabe's effort to coerce and intimidate the people of Zimbabwe before the June 27 runoff have included the torture and beating of over 900 people and the loss of dozens of lives. 
   I strongly support H. Res. 1270, commending the efforts of the southern African governments who sought to block an international arms transfer destined for Zimbabwe. 
   The resolution specifically, one, recognizes and commends the efforts of southern African trade unions, religious leaders and advocacy groups to raise awareness about the possibility of weapons transfers to Zimbabwe as part of the campaign to address the worsening political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe; recognizes and commends the effort of those southern African governments which denied access through their national territories for a weapons shipment destined to be received by a regime that continues to perpetuate gross human rights violations against its own citizens; urges the United States to continue to work with African governments and multilateral institutions to compel Mr. Robert Mugabe's regime to respect the will of its citizens and find a peaceful and timely solution to the current political standoff; and urges the Permanent Representative to the United States at the United Nations to advocate for an international moratorium on all shipments of arms, weapons, and related goods and services to Zimbabwe until the current political crisis has been resolved and democracy, human rights and the rule of law are respected by the Government of Zimbabwe. 
   The successful transportation of arms into Zimbabwe may have increased the political violence that already exists. It is critically important that the international community work together with regional leaders at the Africa Union and sub-regional organizations to foster a peaceful resolution towards the human rights violations facing the Zimbabwean people. 
   Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PAYNE. Let me conclude by once again thanking the sponsor of this very important resolution. I think it's been said very clearly that when people stand up, we can defeat tyranny. 
   I compliment the dock workers who refused to unload the ship. As has been mentioned, the solidarity movement in Poland led to democracy there. And actually, back in the sixties, there was an incident during the height of the Cold War where the dock workers of Newark refused to unload a ship of furs from the Soviet Union.     
   At that time, Krushchev said they were going to bury the U.S., and the ILA and the dock workers refused to unload that ship, once again showing solidarity. As a person who worked on the docks of Newark for 4 years during my early career, I certainly appreciate the strength of the dock workers and the labor unions and ILA from around the world. 
   I think we have to work on proliferation of conventional weapons that we see throughout the world. I think we have to really monitor and rein in the People's Republic of China that continues to support the brutal regime in Sudan with the atrocities in Darfur. We have to say that if we are going to be a country living in the community of world nations, then there is a responsibility to act responsibly in this new millennium. 
   And so with that, I urge the passage of House Resolution 1270.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (CONDEMNING POSTELECTION VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to the unanimous support of the Congressional Black Caucus, all 21 other Members, who have joined as original cosponsors to this resolution condemning post-election violence in Zimbabwe and calling for a peaceful resolution to the current political crisis. 
   Madam Speaker, assertive U.S. diplomatic engagement has contributed to conflict resolution in many African countries, especially over the past decade. Zimbabwe is one of the few exceptions, unfortunately. While many African countries moved to embrace democracy and rule of law, the dictatorship in Zimbabwe has taken the once promising country to a state of anarchy and haplessness. 
   President Robert Mugabe has been in power in the country since it got its independence in 1980, along with Joshua Nkomo, one of the great freedom fighters. The two joined in building Zimbabwe in its early days. Great strides were made, especially in education, and Zimbabwe became a leader in that area throughout Africa. 
   The country began to progress during those early days; however, when multiparty elections were introduced, the Mugabe regime began to lose its prominence. The Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, became an alternative to ZANU-PF. 
   In reaction to the winds of democracy, the Mugabe regime cracked down on the opposition party and thwarted democracy. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered since that time under the brutal dictatorship of the Mugabe regime. 
   The recent elections in Zimbabwe in March were a clear signal by the people of Zimbabwe that they wanted real change. Yet, Mr. Mugabe once again is in the process of crushing the democratic aspiration of the people of that country. 
   Instead of stepping aside, his regime has been engaged in a brutal crackdown against opposition elements. Dozens of people have been killed, and leaders of the opposition have been imprisoned. 
   The international community has done very little to help bring about change in Zimbabwe. We should not allow one dictator to ruin the way of life for millions of innocent civilians. Enough is enough. 
   The 1990s saw the spread of democracy across the continent of Africa, once dominated by military dictators and authoritarian leaders. The ghastly civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia have finally come to an end. C&#244;te d'Ivoire now is moving in the right direction. 
   The DRC crisis, which erupted in 1998 and threatened to disintegrate the entire subcontinent, actually ended after a long and dedicated effort by African leaders that came up with a solution to that war of many countries in the DRC. In 2006, the Democratic Republic of Congo held its first democratic elections in years. Yet Zimbabwe still suffers from a brutal dictatorship. 
   The African Union, despite limited resources and capacity to deploy peacekeepers to a number of countries, have done so in several instances without delay. The African Union deployed an African mission to Burundi back in May of 2003 after an agreement was signed in order to support a cease-fire accord and to ensure implementation of the agreement. Troops have been deployed to Sudan in the north-south dispute and even to the Darfur region. Actually, in Somalia, Ugandan peacekeepers are there under the auspices of the A.U., even though there is a controversial intrusion of Ethiopian troops. Yet the A.U. has not been as vocal as many believe it should have been in the support of the suffering people of Zimbabwe. African leaders must speak out. 
   Prime Minister Odinga of Kenya, a long-time democracy advocate, said it right. He recently stated, ``It is sad that many African heads of state have remained quiet when disaster is looming in Zimbabwe.'' We must act now to end the suffering. We must do what we can to protect and support the people of Zimbabwe. 
   My resolution, H. Res. 1230, calls for an immediate end to the violence, harassment and destruction that is ongoing in Zimbabwe at the expense of a once vibrant population. 
   It calls on the government of Zimbabwe to create an environment conducive to a peaceful transition. 
   It encourages the political parties to commit to forming a government that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people and promotes national unity, the restoration of the rule of law, and genuine democracy. 
   It advocates a mechanism such as a Truth and Reconciliation Commission through which to ensure accountability of all groups and individuals who are found to have orchestrated or committed a human rights violation in the context of the election. 
   It urges the United Nations, A.U. and SADC to dispatch special envoys to Zimbabwe without delay, with a mandate to monitor the run-off elections and to come up with a peaceful resolution to the problem. 
   It urges the international community, under the leadership of the U.N., A.U., SADC and the SADC Parliamentary Forum to deploy teams of credible persons to serve as monitors to ensure that the outcome of the presidential run-off elections reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people. 
   We conclude by commending the people of Zimbabwe for their continued courage in the face of systematic prosecution and intimidation and abuse, and commit to providing continued humanitarian assistance until the economic crisis is resolved. 
   It commends the actions being taken by activists, civil society, churches, people who are in support of human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe, and we stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution and support this peaceful reconciliation, national healing, and let's restore democracy to Zimbabwe and lead this country back to the greatness that it once had. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, since Democrats took over Congress, we have tried to establish a process to responsibly end our involvement in Iraq. We, like all Americans, have watched in sadness as 3,422 of our brave soldiers have lost their lives, including 57 of those who came from the State of New Jersey. 
   That is why Congressman Pascrell and Congressman Pallone, Congressman Holt, Congressman Rothman and Congressman Sires and myself voted against this resolution. 
   As we said, we have asked the President to have a responsible end to our involvement, but 3,422 deaths later, the lives of 57 Americans from New Jersey have been lost. Already we have passed and sent to the President a plan that would include a timeline for troop withdrawal. 
   Our best efforts, however, have been consistently met with a veto. Indeed, President Bush continues to stubbornly, recklessly insist that his failed Iraqi policy continues without any reasonable compromise. We, along with the great majority of Americans, strongly disagree with the President. He has been wrong every step of the way, and it is long past time to bring U.S. involvement in Iraq to a conclusion. 
   The Democratic leadership has tried repeatedly to bring finality to the war. But because of a lack of a veto-proof majority, today they have relented on key requirements to help bring about the end. 
   While we understand why the proposal before us was crafted in such a way, that we believe we must continue to forcibly stand up to the President. 
   We voted against spending even more money in Iraq because there were no timelines or real accountability on an administration that has proven to be utterly incompetent on the most important issue of our time. 
   As late as yesterday at a major address, the President continues to try to directly implicate Iraq in 9/11. It was Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, who made it very clear on that dastardly, cowardly act on September 11 to our World Trade Center that it was done by al Qaeda, done by the Saudi who led this and still continues to lead this terrorist organization. 
   So why do we continue to try to stretch the reason for going in and having an attack on Iraq that it was because of 9/11. We know that there is the continued attempt to connect the two when they are not connected. Now we hear al Qaeda is strong and doing well in Iraq. However, before 9/11, there were no al Qaeda operatives in Iraq. 
   So we have now a country that is no better off, really. More people die there. We have a world that is really not any safer. Yet, and still, we have a President who refuses to see the light, continues to go down a path of destruction. So, for that reason, I am proud of my colleagues, PASCRELL, PALLONE, HOLT, ROTHMAN, SIRES and myself who stood up and said, enough is enough, the time is now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me join in with my colleagues in expressing support for the designation of September 2008 for Gospel Music Heritage Month. And let me commend the sponsor, Ms. Sheila Jackson-Lee, for her initiative to make the gospel music national art form as we've seen with jazz in the past. 
   And let me thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for his support of this legislation. 
   Let me say that this resolution certainly recognizes gospel music's contribution in American culture by celebrating its rich heritage and artists for the entire month of September. It is very important that we recognize and celebrate the vital role gospel music has played in music history and also in contemporary times. 
   Gospel music has been woven into the fabric of American history spanning generations from rock and roll, country, to blues, R&B, and even hip hop. Gospel music roots can be many musical genres, and we love that today. Not only has gospel music entertained the masses, but its spiritual roots have spread the hope to many souls around the world. 
   As you know, the history of gospel can be traced back to the African American spirituals that blended diverse elements from traditional music, folk songs, and hymns and ultimately borrowed from other American musical styles including ragtime, jazz, and the blues. 
   The first Negro spirituals were inspired by the hardship of slavery yet enlightened by the hope and faith of God. They were used to send messages to express personal feelings and uplift broken spirits. They told a story of a generation, and each era's sense of belief, hence the word ``gospel.'' 
   As traditional Negro spirituals continued to be sung, new spiritual songs were created. The lyrics of these songs were sung and they dealt with the praise of the Lord with personal improvement and with brotherly community life. Many of them were inspired by social problems, segregation, lack of love, and the list goes on and on. 
   Words from traditional spirituals were slightly changed and adapted to special events. For example, the words of ``Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho (and the walls came tumbling down)'' was changed into ``marching around Selma.''

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, over the last week, we have heard that President Bush is finally going to admit tonight what most of us have known for many years, that global warming is actually occurring and that we as a Nation need to take action. 
   Tonight's expected pronouncement from the President is welcome news, but it does not excuse the administration's past record on global warming. Over the last 6 years the Bush administration has served as a major roadblock to reversing dangerous warming trends. The President walked away from international efforts to help reduce the growing danger to our planet, refusing to actually lead on this critically important issue. 
   In my home State of New Jersey, we are proud of the fact that former Governor Richard J. Codey took decisive action over a year ago to strengthen our State's efforts to combat global warming by classifying carbon dioxide as an air contaminant. This action made New Jersey one of the first States in the Union to take such a step. By contrast, the Bush administration has been in constant denial that environmental dangers to our planet exist. So, therefore, we hope that the Nation will take this seriously.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 909 introduced by Representative KENDRICK MEEK of Florida commemorating the courage of the Haitian soldiers that fought for American independence in the Siege of Savannah and for Haiti's independence and renunciation of slavery. 
   H. Res. 909 recognizes the honorable act of the Haitian soldiers of the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint Domingue who volunteered to join the fight for American independence in the fall of 1779. Already in the fifth year of the American Revolution, Americans were growing weary of gaining independence when the Haitians stepped in. Today, we give them our gratitude for their bravery in sending over 500 soldiers to aid us in our fight for independence. We also remember and honor their sacrifice of over 300 men lost during the Siege of Savannah in October 1779. 
   I hold Haiti's achievements of being the world's first black-led republic and the first Caribbean state to achieve independence in high esteem. However, Haiti continues to struggle against poverty and instability. This is why we need to commemorate the landmark of the brave actions of the 500 Haitians who fought alongside Americans for our freedom. 
   It is important that we honor the progress of states in the 21st century continuing the fight against racially driven injustice. I would like to mention that H.R. 3432, which I introduced in August 2007, was signed into law by the President last week on February 5, 2008. This bill called for the establishment of the commission on the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   As Haiti still struggles to find her own model of peace and liberty, we extend our support by commemorating the loyalty of Haitians to the U.S. Haitians played a vital role in America's path to independence and freedom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the provision on food and nutrition security in the bill currently under consideration is drawn directly from a bill I introduced in December, H.R. 4914, the Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and Nutrition Support Act of 2007. I introduced the bill after chairing a hearing in the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health to determine whether the Global HIV/AIDS program was adequately addressing the nutritional needs of its beneficiaries. 
   The hearing corroborated what I had already heard in the field on numerous visits to Africa over the past 5 years: PEPFAR is falling short in this critical area. I share the concerns of the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentlelady from Missouri about the increasing cost of food aid. Just last week, the World Food Program had to issue an appeal for an additional $500 million to offset the increased costs of food and fuel.

   Mr. PAYNE. Without the extra $73 million, people who rely on WFP for their daily sustenance may have their rations cut. This is a truly alarming situation, and it is not my intent for the provision of this bill to exacerbate it. The language under consideration very clearly states that these activities are to be funded from amounts authorized under section 401 of this bill. I used this language deliberately, as I strongly believe that the food assistance and nutritional support we are providing under the Global AIDS program must be on top of the food aid we are already providing.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Chairman, let me begin by commending Chairman Berman of the committee for bringing forth this tremendous, important legislation, and for the support in this bipartisan effort from Ranking Member  Ros-Lehtinen, and for her support of this very important legislation. 
   I rise in strong support of the legislation currently under consideration. I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   This bill is appropriately named because it was under the leadership of the late Henry Hyde, then chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that the PEPFAR legislation was originally authorized. And under the leadership of the late Tom Lantos, reauthorization began. Both of these tireless giants who have left us should be remembered by this legislation. I might also note that under the leadership of the original authorization, Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and the Congressional Black Caucus were very strong advocates to push the leadership of the House and the President to consider this very important legislation. 
   In the 5 years, there has certainly been a pandemic that the world is facing, and there has not been a pandemic similar to this since the plague during medieval days in Europe. So I am pleased that we are finally dealing with this pandemic in the way that it should be. 
   In the 5 years since Congress passed the original legislation authorizing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, as it is well known, it has become an historic program. In my opinion, this will be remembered as the single most significant achievement of President Bush's two terms in office. 
   And from my recent conversations with the President, I know that he has worked very hard on this reauthorization, and it is with the support of the White House and the staff, they helped us craft this bipartisan legislation. 
   Prior to PEPFAR, the United States did very little in supporting AIDS treatment programs abroad. In fact, Members may recall a high-ranking USAID official said that treatment was not feasible in Africa, the most heavily AIDS-infected region of the world, because Africans cannot tell time and therefore would not be able to take the required medication properly. As we know, it was foolish to say that at the time; and as we have seen the results, it has proven once again to have been a foolish statement. 
   These officials advocated limiting our activities only to education and prevention, a position that would have in effect sentenced millions of HIV-infected men, women and children to die if it were only that program. And so I am very pleased we expanded it to where it is today. 
   Fortunately, the Congress and the President did not agree with that position. And because we were willing to find a way to provide treatment for over 800,000 people, today they are receiving antiretroviral medication to prevent AIDS in the 15 focus countries, 12 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   We are also pleased that we are increasing the number of countries to the 14 Caribbean countries. And as cochair of the bipartisan Caribbean Caucus, and under the leadership of Representative DONNA CHRISTENSEN, at a meeting she convened in her district, we had health ministers admit that the Caribbean also needed substantial help. 
   Our progress, while significant, is not enough. Only 28 percent of Africans needing antiretrovirals are receiving them. Shockingly, over 85 percent of African children who need ARVs are going without them. A mere 11 percent of HIV-positive women who need drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during child birth are getting them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. In light of these troubling facts, we have taken steps in this legislation to transform PEPFAR from an emergency response to a sustainable program by expanding the program beyond a series of medical interventions. For example, the committee incorporated the provision that I discussed earlier about food security into the legislation in order to address the nutritional needs of HIV patients, their families, and communities heavily affected by the disease. 
   Lack of food and nutrition support has been, up to now, a major impediment to the adherence of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens. 
   H.R. 5501 also contains provisions to build and strengthen health systems in developing countries. The committee has given the Office of Global AIDS Coordinator the flexibility to do prevention, care and treatment programs tailored to the characteristics of the epidemic in the country in which they are operating by eliminating cumbersome earmarks that the GAO said were ineffective. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes significant funds, $50 billion over the next 5 years, in order to accomplish the goals of the bill. I urge the House to pass this legislation.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Blumenauer's amendment to ensure that safe drinking water is a component of our HIV/AIDS strategy. Congressman  Blumenauer, the lead sponsor of the Water for the Poor Act of 2005, has been a strong advocate on this issue for years, and he was kind enough to testify about the challenge of clean water in Africa at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Global Health I chaired in May of 2007. 
   During the course of that hearing, it became clear that in Africa, the region hardest hit by the AIDS pandemic, the problem of safe water is particularly acute. The total number of people without access to potable water in the region has actually increased by 60 million in the past half decade. That is why Mr. Blumenauer and I, along with other Members of Congress, successfully secured $300 million for safe drinking water and sanitation projects for fiscal year 2008. 
   We all know that HIV compromises the immune system. Those infected with the disease are far more likely to succumb to the illness caused by unsafe drinking water, especially if they are children, and there is no way that people can take ARVs if they do not have access to clean drinking water. 
   I strongly support Mr. Blumenauer's amendment, and thank him for his cosponsorship of H. Res. 318, supporting the goals of the United Nations International Year of Sanitation. His resolution encourages international communities to achieve the target of halving the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. I encourage my colleagues to support the Blumenauer amendment.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Chairman, I rise to speak on the amendment offered by Mr. Fortenberry. We appreciate the work that he does on the subcommittee and he contributes greatly. 
   We feel that the Inspector General has been doing an adequate job; however, we do not oppose this amendment. The Office has approved over $10 billion for programs in 136 countries around the world so far, which amounts to 21 percent of all donor HIV/AIDS spending, and two-thirds of all the donor spending on malaria and tuberculosis. Through the Global Fund, 1.4 million people have been treated with life-saving antivirals, 3.3 million cases of TB have been treated; and, in a new area, 46 million bed nets have been distributed to protect children against malaria. And I am pleased to say that Ray Chambers from New Jersey and my congressional district has been appointed ambassador for the U.N. to combat malaria. 
   So, we do not oppose this amendment, and we look forward to the bill's passage.

   Mr. PAYNE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentlelady from Wisconsin. 
   Southern Africa has the highest rate of HIV and AIDS in the entire world. In Lesotho, we have heard, a country with an HIV/AIDS prevalence rate of 38 percent among pregnant women, only 19 percent of those in need of treatment for the disease have access for it. Even more troubling is the fact that only 5 percent of HIV-positive mothers get drugs to prevent the transmission of the virus to their children during childbirth. Life expectancy for women is 44 years, and for men a mere 39. 
   In Malawi, the situation is a little better; men are expected to live 41 years, women 42. The health care worker shortage in the country remains a major obstacle. 
   Circumstances in Swaziland are equally grim: 26 percent of adults are HIV positive. In a country of just over 1 million, there are 70,000 AIDS orphans. Clearly, HIV and AIDS pose a dire threat in these countries and must be urgently addressed. Therefore, I commend the gentlewoman, Ms. McCollum, for her amendment to make Swaziland, Lesotho, and Malawi focus countries, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the gentlelady, the ranking member, yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of the Carson amendment relating to the building of human capacity to fight HIV/AIDS through collaborations between U.S. colleges and universities and those in the developing world. 
   I, too, am very pleased to see this piece of legislation by Mr. Carson. We all knew Julia Carson. She came to my district to deal with health disparities in my district in New Jersey, and traveled to Africa with me on a trip dealing with this problem. So this is very appropriate, and let me commend you again. 
   In May of 2007, Doctors Without Borders released a report that found that in southern Africa, a shortage of trained health care workers was the main barrier to increasing access to antiretroviral treatment. 
   The report found that in Mozambique, people had to wait up to 2 months to start ARVs because there were not enough doctors and nurses to manage it. In one health district in Lesotho, nearly half of the nursing posts were vacant. Malawi has only two doctors per 100,000 people. The minimum standard according to the WHO is 20 doctors per 100,000 people. 
   I am pleased to say that the bill under consideration seeks to address those problems. It calls on the United States to train 140,000 new health care workers and professionals so people can start on life-saving therapy. 
   University partnerships are a logical and effective means through which to support this goal. So I once again commend Mr. Carson for his amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats are trying to move the Iraq war in a new direction, but we are not getting much help from the White House or the congressional Republicans. House Democrats have now voted four separate times over the last 3 months to change the course of the war, but every single time House Republicans refused to join us. 
   For weeks congressional Republicans were saying that the withdrawal timeline proposed would lead to America's defeat in Iraq. But now a week after the President vetoed that bill, Republican leaders are saying that our generals must make the troop surge work by this fall. Republican leaders have now indicated that there should be a timeline for progress in Iraq, stating that, ``By the time we get to September or October, Members are going to know how well this is working, and if it isn't, what is plan B?'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it appears that Republicans are slowly but surely coming around to timetables in Iraq. This doesn't mean that they are defeatists, as their own talking points have suggested in the past. It means that they may be turning into realists.

<DOCNO>Mr. PAYNE. (COMMISSION ON THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise as the sponsor of H.R. 3432 and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership on this legislation. I would also like to thank  my friends in the other body and the senior Senator from my home State of New Jersey for sponsoring and ensuring the passage of this bill. And finally, I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi and Representative Clyburn for their assistance in bringing this important and timely bill to the House. 
   This year will mark the 200th anniversary of the act to prohibit the importation of slaves, which effectively ended the legal transatlantic slave trade. 
   The bill under consideration before us, H.R. 3432, the 200th Anniversary Commemoration Commission of the Abolition of Transatlantic Slave Trade, establishes a commission to cultivate and preserve the memory of a grave injustice in American history, the transatlantic slave trade, and to mark the trade's conclusion at the hands of President Thomas Jefferson. 
   As you know, the transatlantic slave trade was the capture and procurement of Africans, mostly from west and central Africa, to western colonies and new nations in America, including the United States, where they were enslaved in forced labor between the 15th and mid-19th centuries. 
   In the early years of this Republic, the transatlantic slave trade constituted a thriving economic vein of the United States. By 1807, millions of Africans had been captured and transported to the Americas on notorious slave ships. That ship replica can be seen at the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. 
   Many individuals perished as a result of torture, including rape, malnutrition, and disease. Those who survived faced the miserable prospects of a lifetime in bondage. Few Americans are aware that captured slaves resisted their enslavement until the bitter end. 
   During the Middle Passage, enslaved Africans defied their slave masters through nonviolent and violent means, including hunger strikes, suicide, and shipboard revolts, the most historically recognized events taking place on board the Don Carlos in 1732 and on board the Amistad in 1839. 
   On March 3, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson signed into law the Transatlantic Slave Trade Act, which prohibited the importation of slaves from any port or any place within the jurisdiction of the United States. This bill was nothing short of revolutionary at that time in 1806 when it was passed through this Congress. It single-handedly outlawed the long-standing and brutal slave trade of transporting Africans to the United States. 
   As we know, even before this bill was passed, free and slave persons fought in the Revolutionary War, the War of Independence against Britain. In the Boston Massacre on March 3, 1770, Crispus Attucks was the first American to shed his blood at that Boston Massacre, which was led by Major Pitcairn, at that time a British officer. Ironically, in 1775, at the famous Battle of Bunker Hill, Peter Salem and Salem Poor were two outstanding blacks who fought with the minutemen. And it was Peter Salem who fired the shot that killed Major Pitcairn, who led the Boston Massacre. So, there were blacks long before slavery was ended that fought heroically for this country. 
   The commission will encourage civic, historical, educational, religious, economic and other organizations, as well as the State and local governments throughout the United States, to organize and participate in anniversary activities to expand the understanding and appreciation of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   As we constantly admonish the prevalence of modern-day slavery worldwide, it would be hypocritical if we did not acknowledge the history of transatlantic slave trade and slavery that existed not long ago in our country. 
   African labor was an essential feature of economic development in Europe and our former colonies, including the United States. All of the nations involved flourished economically as a result of slave labor. 
   Slave trade and the legacy of slavery continues to have a profound impact on social and economic disparities, hatred, bias, racism and discrimination that continues to affect people in the Americas, particularly those of African descent. 
   It is important, as Americans, that we extend our highest appreciation for the contributions and struggles of African Americans to create an equitable and just society from which we all benefit today. 
   The commission created by this bill will be tasked with the mandate to plan, develop and execute programs and activities appropriate with the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slavery. The mission is timely and the subject is critical. 
   The United States is a primary voice on trafficking issues. We are also the principal advocates for human rights and freedom around the world. Our Nation's willingness to confront its past and calmly assess the impact of slavery on the United States strengthens our ability to serve as an advocate on the international stage. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this timely legislation that will embrace America's history and honor its past. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   But let me, once again, thank our chairman and ranking member for assisting us in bringing this bill forward. We hope that, as has been indicated, that we will be able to deal with modern-day slavery. We have problems in our country today where people are being brought in from eastern Europe and other areas where they are being exploited, and we need to really be more vigilant about wiping some of these terrible practices away. 
   And so, we hope that this commission will focus not only on the past, deal with the present, but also deal with the future. And we certainly appreciate the support from the other body and the senior Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, we cannot drill our way to either energy independence or to lower prices at the pump. The Bush administration's own Energy Information Administration says that opening up new areas for drilling would not affect production or prices for nearly 20 years, and even then it concludes that ``any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant.'' So much for the Republican energy plan. 
   In stark contrast, House Democrats have taken action and passed legislation that will make America more energy independent and help provide relief to Americans struggling with high gas prices. For the first time in 32 years, we passed a landmark law that will require more fuel efficient vehicles, which will produce nearly $1,000 in savings for the average American family at the gas pump. This is the kind of relief that my constituents in New Jersey want. 
   Democrats also forced the President to stop sending oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and now we are standing and urging him to start releasing oil from the reserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank Congresswoman, Chairwoman Lowey and, of course, Congressman Blumenauer for the opportunity to join in this colloquy. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, I recently called a hearing on the implementation of the Water for the Poor Act where Cong ressman Blumenauer testified. I agree with him that the State Department, in its 2007 report to Congress, reflects inflated figures and a lack of concrete strategies for providing sustainable access to drinking water and sanitation for the poor. 
   The Millennium Development Goals, a catalyst for the Water for the Poor, aimed to reduce by one-half the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation and safe drinking water by 2015. Due, in part, to the State Department's inefficient execution of sustainable programs, the MDG target is being missed in sub-Saharan Africa, which has had the slowest rate of improvement in this category compared with all other regions. 
   Furthermore, the State Department reported that in fiscal year 2006, the U.S. helped 9 million people receive improved access to water. Of the beneficiaries, 75 to 80 percent was in the Middle East, and 25 percent was outside this region. According to the United Nations, most countries in the Middle East and North Africa are on track towards reaching the MDG targets. Our efforts should be directed to regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest proportion of people living without access to improved water sources of any region in the world, and is not on track to meet its MDG target. Therefore, of the $150 million appropriated to Africa and the Middle East, I feel that more than 50 percent should be allocated to the countries in Africa, where the need is greatest. 
   So I conclude by saying also, the State Department's water funding in Africa has primarily been used for emergency relief efforts, rather than water supply and management projects that deliver sustainable results. In maintaining the vision of the Water for the Poor Act, assistance should be focused on improving the sustainable management of drinking water and sanitation. 
   I agree with Congressman Blumenauer and Chairwoman Lowey that of the $300 million appropriated for fiscal year 2008, a significant amount should be directed towards sustainable wate r management with programs in Africa. 
   With efficient execution and adequate funding, the objectives of the Water for the Poor can be accomplished. Access to safe water and sanitation plays a central role in promoting global public health, economic growth, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. 
   I look forward to working with Congressman Blumenauer and Congresswoman Lowey in increasing our funding to regions with the greatest need and improving the strategies in place to provide t he world's poor with sustainable, safe, drinking water and basic sanitation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which increases the amounts available in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill to fight the global spread of tuberculosis by adding an additional $50 million by taking $25 million from the Economic Support Funds account and $25 million from within the Child Survival and Health Programs account. 
   According to the World Healt h Organization estimates, someone is infected with the organism that develops into TB every second. Every second. An infected person may not develop full-blown TB, but in 2004, of the 9 million people who were newly infected, 2 million died. The good news is that it is entirely curable. 
   However, the treatment requires patients to be on a drug regimen for 6 months. If they do not complete the regimen, or if they complete it but take an incorrect number of pills during the treatment, the infection can deve lop into what is known as multiple drug resistance or MDR-TB. MDR-TB is not responsive to either of the two first-line TB drugs, and the treatments that are available take longer and are more expensive than regular TB medications. 
   But as news headlines earlier this month have shown, there is an even more deadly threat: extensively drug-resistant TB. XDR-TB is not only resistant to the two first-line drugs but also to three of the six second-line drugs. The treatment required to cure a patient can b e radical, including the removal of part of the lung that has been infected. 
   Earlier this month, a Georgia man who had been diagnosed with a dangerous strain of TB known as extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB, traveled through four countries, completely unimpeded. If he had been infectious at the time, there could have been an outbreak across two continents. 
   We must also keep in mind that XDR-TB has a deadly linkage with HIV and threatens to undermine all of the investments we have ma de in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The devastating effect of patients with HIV first gained global recognition last August with reports of an outbreak in a hospital in South Africa where 52 of 53 patients with XDR-TB died. Half of them died within a matter of 16 days. 
   This tragedy serves as a sobering example of what may happen across Africa if we do not act to prevent another outbreak. Given XDR-TB's resistance to both the low-cost, first-line anti-TB drugs and to several of the classes of sec ond-line drugs used, we are faced with a burgeoning epidemic driven by HIV infection that is lethal. 
   Since the initial outbreak, South African medical authorities have documented some 400 cases in dozens or more hospitals in South Africa. What is troubling, however, is that no one knows for sure that these 400 cases represent the extent of the outbreak because XDR-TB typically kills quickly and doctors' ability to identify it is severely limited; so many people may have simply died without its even bei ng diagnosed. 
   Experts believe that XDR-TB has moved beyond South Africa into other countries in the sub-region where the capacity to identify it and control it is significantly weaker than in South Africa and where the HIV/AIDS rate continues to drive the epidemic. As a matter of fact, there are only two laboratories in 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that can determine this disease. 
   All of us here today must work together to take the necessary steps to enhance the ability of the medical establis hments in Africa and other developing countries to identify, treat, and stop the spread of drug-resistant TB, primarily in Africa, and to head off further incursions of XDR-TB into the United States. Failure to do so will result in potentially devastating health catastrophes.

   Mr. PAYNE. Thank you very much. 
   I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the Pitts amendment that would strike the underlying language that provides flexibility to the President on designing his HIV/AIDS programs. 
   In 2003, Congress and the President came together to establis h the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative. Five years ago, the world was optimistic that we could, with additional funding, start to turn the pandemic around. As we have heard, success has not been as easy as we would have hoped, and over 4 million people were newly infected last year. That is why, in addition to increasing the amount of money we are spending to combat HIV/AIDS, we must take every effort to ensure that we are spending money as wisely as possible. 
   The chairwoman's bill contains language which giv es the President maximum flexibility. There is no empirical data to my knowledge which supports the abstinence-only earmark in P.L. 108-25, the original PEPFAR authorizing legislation. The earmark calls for one-third of all prevention funds to be spent on abstinence-only until marriage. No one has ever explained the rationale for that figure. The provision of flexibility to the President to determine how much money to spend on abstinence-only is way overdue. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the Pi tts amendment and to support the chairperson in this endeavor.

   Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by also expressing my accolades to the gentlewoman who is chairing this Special Order tonight from the great city of Cleveland in Ohio. 
   As you know, she has served with distinction in the past in the judicial system as a judge. She is a former prosecutor, of course, and esteemed attorney, and she now heads the very difficult Ethics Committee, which really says that of all of the people in this body, it was deemed that she was the most qualified and suitable, in addition to qualifications you need to be suited for a position, and so I commend you for that. 
   Also, as I previously mentioned, we're very pleased with the Congressional Black Caucus as it continues to be the conscience of the Congress. Our chairperson from the great city of Detroit, Representative Kilpatrick, is doing an outstanding job. 
   Today, I rise to speak briefly on two subjects. First of all, I rise to speak about my support for the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, which expands and increases health insurance coverage for low-income children and improves the quality of health care that our children receive. But we need to pass a bill that fully funds and covers all eligible children. How could the richest Nation in the world do less than to provide for its young? It is critical and important because they are our future. 
   Today, our Nation is facing a health care crisis. Existing private insurance options are becoming increasingly less affordable for families, and 45 million individuals remain uninsured in our country, 9 million of whom are children. The State Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid have been successful in providing 6 million children with health care coverage. 
   In considering the reauthorization of SCHIP, we must build on past bipartisan success and work together to ensure coverage for the 9 million children who remain uninsured. 
   I am proud to say that New Jersey has made significant progress in providing health insurance for its children. However, the progress cannot be maintained unless we reauthorize legislation which meets the real needs of children and for children's health coverage, including addressing the unique needs of children with disabilities. 
   According to a study released by Families USA, the number of uninsured children in my home State of New Jersey could be reduced by 100,000 Statewide if SCHIP is fully reauthorized. 
   Without this legislation, New Jersey has more to lose than most States, unfortunately. Why? Because New Jersey did the right thing by increasing SCHIP eligibility to 3.5 times the Federal poverty level because of the cost of living, which is higher in New Jersey, especially housing costs. Similarly, New Jersey enrolled low-income parents in part because research has shown that this results in more low-income children being enrolled in the program.  
   However, instead of being rewarded for these actions, under the Bush administration's proposal, over 28,000 children and 80,000 parents Statewide could lose their health care coverage. In addition, thousands more children who are eligible now but not participating would never be able to enroll in the program. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government must be a responsible partner in terms of State health coverage initiatives. Forty years ago, Medicare eliminated the problem of the uninsured among the elderly. I believe we have an opportunity to take steps to do the same now with our children by fully reauthorizing this vital health care program. 
   Mr. Speaker, my commitment to children's health care is solid, and I urge that we support a bill that fully reauthorizes, not half, not a quarter, not three-quarters, but fully authorizes, and I hope that the bill that comes before us will do just that. 
   Now, if I may speak for a few minutes on the Jena Six.

   Mr. PAYNE. Thank you very much. Because we stand here on the 50th anniversary of school desegregation in the South and 43 years ago after the signing of the civil rights bill of 1964. 
   However, recent events, particularly in the last 2 years, give credence to the saying that all that glitters is not gold. Although we thought we were making tremendous progress, still many problems remain. 
   Two years ago, New Orleans washed away, exposing undertones of class and race that did not go away with the signing of those two momentous decrees, Brown v. the Board of Ed and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   In Jena, Louisiana, the issue of race, which had been simmering below the surface, had reached the boiling point late last year. Can you imagine that an act of sitting under the unspoken white only tree will garner the reaction of nooses? Not only nooses, but nooses decorated in the school colors being hung from that same tree? There's no mistake the symbolism that nooses hanging from a tree means in the not-so-distant history of America. 
   As a matter of fact, the NAACP was founded in 1909 not for full employment, not for equal accommodation. The simple, original goal was simply to try to stop lynchings, just try to stop lynchings, and here we have nooses put under a tree that is the tree for whites only, to send a message that if you sit here, you don't know what might happen to you in the future. 
   While I find what those students did to be egregious, hanging the nooses on the tree, I am just as disgusted and dumbfounded by the reaction of the school administrators. Chalking up those actions to be a youthful stunt shows a dereliction of duty by the Jena school administrators. Have you no sense of history? Have you have no sense of common decency? Three days of in-school suspension for the culprits of this prank equates to a slap on the wrist. That punishment says shame on you but really means no harm, no foul.     
   Yet, after almost 4 months of underwhelming reactions from the school administration who are supposed to protect and advocate for the students under their care, the school imploded. 
   While I do not condone violence as a solution, couldn't something have happened before we even arrived at this point? Yes, one student was injured, and thankfully he has recovered. But attempted second degree murder, second degree aggravated battery and conspiracy? 
   The Jena school administration and the local legal system cannot run hot and cold while doling out punishments. They have the responsibility to be objective and fair, and not play with the people's lives like they are pawns in a chess game. The punishment must fit the crime. We are dealing with lives here, especially the lives of young people who still have a lot ahead of them. Threatening to take their lives away at the stroke of a pen does not ring of the necessary objectivity and fairness befitting a district attorney who looked at the black students and said, by the stroke of this pen I can have your future of your life. 
   And so as I conclude, Martin Luther King said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. 
   As Members of Congress elected by the people to represent them and to promulgate laws on their behalf, we have to speak out against these types of injustices that threaten the very foundation upon which this Nation stands, equal treatment under the law. If we fail to speak up for these young men, we will be abdicating our roles for which we were elected. What is to say that my grandchildren or your child will not be the next? Let us not sheepishly accept this type of behavior, not in the 21st century.
