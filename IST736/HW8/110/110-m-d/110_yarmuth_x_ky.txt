<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, today we will pass a bipartisan economic stimulus package that will help American families and jump-start our growing economy. 
   Throughout our great country, hardworking citizens are making major sacrifices to make ends meet, cutting back on winter clothes to pay for heat, scaling back groceries to pay for kids' medical bills, or sacrificing college in attempt to prevent mortgage foreclosure. 
   For 117 million families, 1.6 million in Kentucky alone, rebate checks of $600 per individual, $1,200 per couple and an additional $300 per child will be in their mailboxes by as early as May. This is dramatic departure from the old strategy in which leaders hoped tax breaks for billionaires would trickle down to the people who really needed help. 
   Hope is a wonderful thing. But as the last 7 years have taught us, it is not effective fiscal policy for most Americans. By targeting those who need help, who we know without doubt will spend and invest and put money back in the economy, we aren't depending on hope; we're providing it. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in providing that hope and jump-starting the economy today.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (THREE YEARS OF GOP ENERGY PLAN AND AMERICANS STRUGGLE WITH $4 GASOLINE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, it's been 3 years since the Republican Congress passed energy legislation they claimed would bring down the cost of gasoline and end our dependence on foreign oil. The result? Gas prices have hit $4 a gallon and a barrel of crude oil has gone from $30 to $150 a barrel. 
   Still, Republicans continue to propose the same failed policies and continue to block Democratic efforts to invest in renewable energy and to release oil from the government stockpile. 
   Republicans say they want to drill, but they voted against a bill that would force Big Oil to drill on 311 million acres of land already open for energy production. Republicans say they want to help struggling drivers with gas prices, but they voted against repealing unnecessary tax breaks for profit-rich oil companies. 
   Madam Speaker, BP Oil experienced a 28 percent hike in their profits this quarter while American families can't afford to drive to work. When are Republicans going to start helping American families instead of Big Oil?

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (HONORING OWSLEY BROWN -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to rise today in recognition of my good friend and a great citizen of my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, Owsley Brown II, as we mark the end of his 46-year career at Brown-Forman. 
   In Louisville, Owsley is well known for his success in business. He worked his way up to the top of his family business, and his leadership turned it into a giant in the wine and spirits industry. That fact is all the more astounding, considering that among the top companies in the industry 50 years ago, only his Brown-Forman remains a leader in the field. 
   The global expansion has taken the company to heights only dreamed of back then, and the branding under his watch was absolutely unprecedented. Jack Daniel's, a tiny acquisition of a half century ago, has practically superseded the term whisky itself. But in Kentucky, of course, we take the most pride in Brown-Forman's home-grown bourbons: Early Times, Old Forester and Woodford Reserve. 
   Owsley Brown's reputation in business comes not only from making money, but from creating an environment in which people want to work. Owsley himself takes great pride in the fact that the average tenure at Brown-Forman, 14 years, is three times the average for a Fortune 500 Company. The reason for this is simple. For many of these employees, Owsley Brown gave them more than a job; he gave them a home. 
   But Owsley's place in our community only begins with what happens in the walls and barrels at Brown-Forman Corporation. Through the philanthropy of Brown-Forman, Owsley set the standard for what it means to be a good corporate citizen. His commitment to social responsibility can be seen throughout his work for the Century Council, of which Brown-Forman is a founding member, and in every facet of Louisville life. 
   His dedication to the arts has been critical to Louisville's developing a scene in which music, theater, independent film and visual arts of every stripe have thrived, helping to forge our community's unique and exciting character. His philanthropic devotion to health care has helped make Louisville home to some of the best facilities, doctors, and medical innovation in the world. 
   What's more, as Owsley helped to make Louisville a vibrant 21st-century city, he never lost sight of the need to preserve Kentucky's natural beauty. In fact, he has served as a powerful force in protecting land from overdevelopment, particularly along Louisville's scenic riverfront. Long before conservation hit the mainstream, Brown-Forman began implementing policies to reduce the company's environmental footprint and enhance the environment around us. 
   So as Owsley took Brown-Forman to new heights worldwide, our community reaped the rewards. We are fortunate in Louisville, for even as a corporation sees its leader pass the torch into other capable hands, Mr. Brown remains one of our most generous and responsible citizens. His triumph and business exceeds the success of the bottom line. The true achievement he oversaw and engineered was creating a company of fine character and impeccable integrity, just like the man himself. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring my good friend, Owsley Brown, thanking him for all he has done and wishing him luck as he enters this next chapter of life. 
   Owsley, you and Christy now have time to see the world, and I have no doubt that you will use that time to change it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, this week Congress has an opportunity to change the course of the war in Iraq by supporting an amendment to the emergency supplemental that would not only direct the President to immediately begin bringing our troops home but would also force the Iraqi Government to start paying their own reconstruction costs. 
   The amendment calls on the Bush administration to begin redeploying our troops out of Iraq one month after it is signed into law, with the goal of having all of our troops out by December of next year. 
   Another year of the status quo in Iraq is unacceptable. April was the deadliest month for U.S. troops in seven months, and the political reconciliation that President Bush promised when he implemented his troop escalation plan has not become a reality. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a significant step in the right direction, but for some reason, congressional Republicans want to once again send President Bush a blank check. Blank checks have not worked in the past and they will not this time. 
   We all know that there is no military solution to war in Iraq. It's time we let the Iraqis know that our days there are numbered.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the most profound step forward in energy policy that this country has taken in 30 years. 
   In those 30 years, we in America have seen our dependence on foreign nations increase exponentially. The same issue which has caused this great nation to be beholden to others is draining the wallets of our fellow citizens while warming the earth at an alarming and unnatural rate. 
   And so, I am incredibly proud to be a part of the Congress that isolated the source of those problems and responded resolutely, in a bicameral, bipartisan way. When the energy bill is fully implemented, a gallon of gasoline will take the average American nearly 30 percent farther, our need for foreign oil will plummet by a colossal 4 million barrels a day, energy bills will drop as appliances grow more efficient, and thanks to an unprecedented investment in homegrown, renewable, clean fuel, the prospect for real, safe energy independence is closer than it has ever been. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is more than simply an energy bill, this is America's declaration of energy independence, and I urge my colleagues support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding. 
   And, you know, we have a wonderful situation in here. We have a very interesting and productive dialogue, I believe, about something we all want to do, and that's to solve our energy crisis to take the pressure off the American consumers whose lives are being terribly affected, adversely affected, by these high gas prices and the economy as well. 
   I call back to the words of a very smart person who once said the significant problems that we have today cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them. And unfortunately, this idea that we are going to drill our way out of the problem, both the short term and the long term, is the same level of thinking that got us into this problem. The man who said that was Albert Einstein. He was a pretty smart guy. 
   What we are proposing, and you have heard many instances of it and suggestions of it today, is that we have the ability, we have the resources right now to have an impact, a downward impact on prices. All we have to do is free our own oil, free America's oil. It's in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   As my colleague from Oregon just pointed out, we have been able to reduce the price three separate times over the last 17 years by releasing that oil. We can do it again and we should do it again. But more importantly than that is the entire attitude we take toward what's down the road, no pun intend. 
   My colleague from Tennessee on the other side of the aisle just mentioned a few minutes ago, he asked where are the electric cars, where are these hybrid cars? Well, actually, they're very close on the horizon. We met with Ford executives just a few weeks ago in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. They are on the verge of some significant breakthroughs. They have a plug-in hybrid that uses hydrogen power, as well as electricity. They're working on a battery car. They have several versions of alternative power sources they're working on. 
   General Motors has promised to have a battery-powered car on the road in 2010. We know in California there's a new manufacturer that's developed a battery-powered car. 
   These are the technologies that will be our future. We need to be investing in them, because as President Bush said the other day, what we are trying to do with this long-term approach is change the psychology of the market, change the psychology of the speculators, so that if they see down the  road that there's not going to be that much need for oil, the price will come down. I agree with him totally. 
   But wouldn't the effect be that much more dramatic if the speculators said not only is there going to be a reduced demand for oil in 2020 or 2030, there's going to be virtually no demand for oil in 2020 or 2030? That would really scare the speculators out of this market and drop the price. That's where we need to be investing our attention, our resources. 
   We can take tax breaks way from the oil companies--we have tried to do it a number of times already--and invest it in these technologies because they're not that far away. They are actually closer than the policies that will bring us relief at the gas pump maybe in 2030.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman from Colorado, and I appreciate his excellent work on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, the one thing that's encouraging about this debate is that we all agree in this Chamber that we need to do something about high gas prices. We need to do something to reduce our dependence on oil. We need to do something pretty quickly because the American people are hurting. The economy is feeling the impact of these prices, and immediate action is required. 
   Now, let's consider the two options that we have before us. We have the option that has been put forward by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, which basically is to open up new areas of potential oil reserves for drilling, which everyone agrees is a solution that will not manifest itself until years down the road. The Bush Energy Department, itself, says no appreciable reduction in gas prices will occur from drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf or in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge until 2030. 
   As attested by my colleague from Colorado, the average American family will spend $57,000 on gasoline before the Republican plan saves them a penny. That is hardly the kind of relief that the American people are looking for. 
   There was a very wise man once who said the significant problems we face today will never be solved by the same level of thinking that got us into those problems. That was Albert Einstein, a pretty smart guy, and that's what the Republican plan is. It's to do more of the same to solve the problems that we're now in. I think the American people are much smarter than to fall for that type of proposition. 
   On the other hand, the Democratic majority has a plan that can reduce oil prices virtually immediately. We call it Free America's Oil because we do have plenty of oil at our disposal to use to bring down prices immediately. That is only half the problem, though, because, as my colleague from Colorado mentioned, we've got a long-range proposition to deal with. We don't want to find ourselves year after year after year in the same dilemma in which we find ourselves now. We've got to look in a different direction. I'll return to that in a second, but let's talk about the immediate action we can take. 
   We have 700 million barrels of oil right now that the United States owns that are sitting in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 700 million barrels. When we invaded Iraq, we took that down to 600 million. When we had the Katrina disaster, we went to about 600 million barrels. We have far more oil in the Reserve than we will ever need for any eventuality. If we were to release just 10 percent of the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 70 million barrels, into the market over the next few months, history has shown us that we can immediately impact the price of oil. 
   There are three times in the last 17 years that we've done it. The first was in 1991. The most recent was in 2005. Each time we did it, the price of oil dropped, in 2005 by 10 percent, in 1991 by a third. Wouldn't it be great to have oil down under $100 a barrel. Again, it seems hard to imagine that we're actually thinking that would be a desirable goal, but at $140, it would be very desirable.     
   We can do that if the President just uses his authority to release that oil. We own it. It's ours. We have paid for it. We can use it to benefit the American people and get action now. 
   Two other things we're proposing can bring relief in the relatively short term. First, we have 68 million acres onshore and offshore already under lease to oil companies. They can drill virtually immediately. They don't need to do exploration. They don't need to clear environmental hurdles as they would in these other areas they want to drill. They can drill tomorrow. We have a proposal. We call it ``use it or lose it.'' It's part of our ``free America's oil'' proposal that if we pressure the oil companies by threatening to take those leases away if they don't make a good-faith effort to produce on them, we can encourage them, again, to use the resources we already have to get oil onto the market, increase the supply and bring the price down. 
   Finally, we have in Alaska, west of the area that they want us to drill in, the wildlife refuge, 23 million acres that are already available for drilling. It's called, ironically enough, the National Petroleum Reserve area because there is petroleum there, estimates up to 10.6 billion barrels of oil, more than would ever be in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We want them to drill there, not in a pristine area where we don't know how much oil exists. So again, we have options. We have oil on American soil. We have oil we own that we can use to bring prices down in the very short term. And we ought to be embracing that policy. 
   One other mention about the long-term effects. President Bush said the other day that the reason we need to open up all these other oil areas, potential oil areas, is because of the psychological effect, because if the oil speculators know that down the road there is this massive supply coming on, the price will drop. If that is what we are relying on, I say we have a much better chance to affect the psychology of the market if we change our emphasis from oil to alternative and renewable fuels, alternative sources of power. We know the technology is there. We just have to invest in it, develop it and refine it. But that is the kind of psychological effect, the knowledge among speculators not just that there will be more oil on the market 20 years from now, but we won't need any oil 20 years from now because we're going to go in another direction. The psychological effect of that will be compelling and will be devastating to oil prices. 
   So I say we have a plan both for short-term and long-term energy policy that does make sense, that is not the same old rhetoric and that is not the same level of thinking, as Einstein said, that we had that got us into this problem. And I think the American people know that this is the direction we need to go on. And I think that by responding today, by passing the DRILL Act, that we can take the first step towards energy independence and toward helping the American consumer deal with these incredibly high prices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chairman, this week, opponents of the Employee Free Choice Act have tried to frame this debate as unions versus workers. I don't think it is working, but what a  miraculous bit of political gerrymandering it would be if it did. 
   The opponents are trying to create the illusion that somehow unions and workers are on different teams. But the truth is that in today's economy, the only consistent advocate for America's workers, both union and nonunion, have been America's unions. 
   This bill isn't employers versus employees, and it is certainly not unions versus workers. This is simply Americans for America, because when our working families thrive, all of us benefit. 
   Therefore, on behalf of not only the employees, who are the backbone of our economy, but on behalf of all our citizens, I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reference that the gentleman from New Hampshire just made is an interesting segue into something that has been of very great concern to me, because often when we hear from those who are touting the glory of the American economy, and certainly, we are all proud of our American economy throughout history, but on many occasions, they say the economy is doing so well, the stock market is at record levels, or at least it was until earlier this week, and productivity is great and corporate profits are great, why is it that the middle class is complaining? And there is this disconnect between those people who say we look at these big numbers and statistics and the average lives of everyday Americans. 
   One of the things that occurred to me when I was on the campaign trail all during last year, one of the incidents that I heard about I thought was a perfect example of why this disconnect sometimes exists. 
   We had a situation in which a warehouse, a distributing company, with 800 employees was sold to a company from out of State. The new employer came into that company and said, all of you employees have had your jobs terminated, they are now terminated, you can all reapply, you can reapply for 20 percent less salary and you will have no benefits. 
   I said, well, now according to macroeconomics and statistics, there are going to be 800 new jobs created because these are all new jobs. Now there are 800 jobs lost. That is in another column somewhere, but the 800 jobs are created. Unemployment stays exactly the same because those same 800 people are employed, and yet 800 people had their lives devastated, their standard of living decreased by 30 or 35 percent, and yet all the numbers look rosy. 
   So sometimes, as we all say, statistics can say whatever we want them to say, but in fact, when we talk about productivity and corporate profits and all of those things, it is oftentimes, and in most cases, does not reveal a lot of the stress that the middle class and the average working family are under, even though the administration touts these wonderful figures from above.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my distinguished colleague. And you talked about kind of historic developments and how we got to where we are. 
   One of the things that we also lose sight of sometimes is that the widespread concentration and consolidation of corporations in this country has also made it more of an unlevel playing field for the American worker. When we have a corporation, we might have a small business that is then bought out by a larger business that is then bought out by some corporation from four states away, and all of a sudden not only is that worker detached economically from the bosses, but he is also detached geographically from those bosses. And he or she is not even able to negotiate anymore with the people who set the policy for the corporation. 
   So as we have had this massive and widespread consolidation of corporate power in the country, we have 
   also seen the playing field get more and more unlevel for the average worker. And it is not like a century ago when employers had two or three employees. Now, there are thousands and thousands of employees, massive policies, corporate stock, shareholder driven motivation to make more and more profit. And the power of the individual worker to shape his or her own destiny is reduced even more. 
   And one of the things that I think is unfortunate about the debate we had today is we tend to speak in polarizing terms, and it makes it seem like we who supported this act think that every corporation is evil and every employer is evil and that every union is without sin. 
   And of course, that is not the case. And, in fact, in my district, there are numerous examples in which corporations and their unions have dealt with the issues of the economy in an incredibly cooperative manner. And when times got rough, the employers went to the union and said, ``Here is the situation.'' They were transparent, they explained the situation. The unions said, ``We don't want the company to go bankrupt. We want to help.'' They made concessions. They agreed to match wages that may have been in other lower priced settings. And the converse has happened. When we have had good times and the employers say, ``Wow, we have got all this work. Let's renegotiate the contract because we need to get more employees in here and we need help.'' So it can work. 
   And I get the impression that when those people who oppose the legislation that we passed today, and I haven't had the opportunity yet to say how proud I am of what we did and I am extremely proud. But those people, when they oppose this bill, it seems to me they are saying we want to protect the employers who aren't good because the employers who are good and bargain in good faith and treat their employees well will have no fear from this legislation, they will welcome it, because they are already dealing with their employees on a good-faith basis. It is those people who don't bargain in good faith that we need to pass this bill to resolve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my colleague. Before I get to that, I want to get to another part of the myth, and this is related to my colleague from New Hampshire, who talked about kind of the stigma attached to unions, and so much, I think, of what the stigma that is attached to unions and also the psychology of management is that if you are an entrepreneur, if you are building a company and you are running that company, then you think you should have a say in exactly how it has been run. 
   I have been an entrepreneur, my late father was, my two brothers are; and I know the mentality, that you started something and all of a sudden you think you 
   should have nobody else telling you the rules. You should be able to set all the rules, and ultimately that is a self-defeating proposition because the only way to get the buy-in of your employees and to get really loyal employees is to treat them as part of the entire endeavor that you are involved in. 
   I know that a lot of people in this country tend to form their impressions of certain dynamics in society by what we see in the movies, and a lot of people probably look at ``On the Waterfront'' and old movies and say these are the unions that we are threatened with. 
   I had a great experience at the beginning of the last campaign. I had a meeting with six or seven labor union leaders, and I took my son, who was then 22. We had a wonderful 2-hour meeting in which we talked about all the issues from all different perspectives.  
   On the way home, my son, who had never been exposed to any union activity, said to me, Dad, that was really interesting. The only thing I ever knew about unions was what I saw in the movies. These guys aren't at all like those people in the movies. These guys are really smart. 
   Of course, that's the truth, and not only were they and are they smart people, but they also understand economics. They also understand the pressures that are on employers as well as on employees. 
   As I said before, there are all sorts of myths that permeate the labor management debate in this country, and most of them are not true. We have several we have heard throughout this debate on the floor, including the one my colleague from Iowa discussed, the whole notion of the secret ballot and eliminating the secret ballot. 
   Of course, this law does not eliminate the secret ballot if the employees choose to have a union organization process that involves a secret ballot. They are perfectly entitled to do so. It is just that they are not burdened with that exercise if they don't want to be. 
   This seems to be the height of fairness. We are not denying them the secret ballot. If they want a secret ballot, the majority of the employees, they can have a secret ballot. But we haven't heard that from the other side.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Yes, I do. I associate myself with the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Iowa and also from Minnesota and Mr. Hodes, you as well. 
   We face a situation in this area of labor management relations, just like many of the other situations we face in this country, where oftentimes, the problems are very complex and there are no perfect answers. And I don't think that any one of us here today thinks that this is a perfect answer, the Employee Free Choice Act, or that we are going to in any way, in one step of this body, correct the inequities in the economy. We always are looking for the best possible answer. We are trying to be fair. We are trying to make life better for the most people we can and the greatest number of people we can. And this does that. 
   As the world gets bigger and bigger, as corporations consolidate and get bigger and bigger, the power of every man and woman to determine his or her own fate gets less and less. And in our small way today, a significant way, but in a small way, I think we have begun to reverse a slide of imbalance in the economy and a slide to total inequity and helplessness on the part of American workers. 
   During my many stops at picnics last summer, I ran into a man who was in his early 50s, and he had worked for Winn-Dixie, the grocery company, 23 years. And Winn-Dixie had gone out of business. They had gone out of business because of competitive reasons. Nobody was going to help that. And yet, he had built up $150,000 in his pension fund. And when Winn-Dixie went out of business, he was left with $30,000, so he had lost 80 percent of his life savings because of the situation with Winn-Dixie. 
   He was forced to take another job, a job he was not prepared for, not physically or emotionally, probably, and he was struggling to get by. 
   But the point of the story is, that we are not going to be able to correct every wrong and right and save everybody's pension or protect everyone's livelihood through our actions. But we can take steps, when we see institutionalized imbalance in the economy, an imbalance of power, particularly when it is balanced against the working men and women, we can take steps like the Employee Free Choice Act and make a difference and make a difference for millions of Americans. 
   So once again, I salute this body today for the action that it took. It is a significant step on behalf of the American working man and woman, and I am proud to be a part of this body today.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Before I begin, I want to thank Chairman Gordon, Chairman Udall, and Ranking Member Hall for their leadership and their hard work that has gone into the NASA Authorization Act. 
   The amendment I have offered today to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 will make sure that the American public has access to the best and most up-to-date taxpayer-funded Federal research. 
   In the transparent government we wish to provide to the American people, the suppression of nonsensitive information has no place. Yet last year, I took part in two Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearings where we investigated instances in which critical data on the causes and long-term effects of global warming were withheld from the American public. 
   The taxpayers are funding government studies every day, and they should fully benefit from the results. To proceed otherwise is a disservice to science and the American people. 
   In order to protect the integrity of scientific discoveries and to ensure the widespread availability of the research being conducted by government scientists, the Government Accountability Office and the National Academy of Sciences made a series of recommendations. Those recommendations include making available the information that supports published results to other researchers creating an infrastructure in which data can be easily accessed, and releasing research in an affordable and timely fashion. 
   The amendment I'm proposing would simply require NASA to develop a response to these recommendations. These provisions would further scientific progress by enabling data sharing between government agencies, colleges, universities, and grant recipients. It's also my understanding that NASA agrees with the recommendations of the GAO. 
   The United States has the advantage of being home to some of the greatest scientific minds of the world, and by providing these scientists with the most up-to-date research information, we can help ensure that American innovation stays on the cutting edge. 
   At this crucial time when America strives to end its addiction to oil, it could not be more important to ensure that our Nation's scientists have every possible advantage in working towards the next generation of discoveries, inventions, cures, and energy solutions. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment which will ensure that the American people have unfettered access to reliable information that their tax dollars help to undercover while giving American ingenuity another edge in revolutionizing the world. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate the point made by my colleague. 
   The intent of the amendment is that, since the Government Accountability Office has set a broad range of actions that they recommend in a very general sense, we wanted to provide the flexibility to NASA and to the other agencies--although this amendment only covers NASA--to develop guidelines for the sharing of data that comply broadly with those guidelines set down by the GAO. 
   So, with that, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. With brave American soldiers dying in record numbers, I have just two questions for the President: Just whose posteriors are we kicking? And how do you know? 
   With Sunnis and Shiites killing themselves and each other, plus an incompetent Maliki government, we don't know who we are fighting much less where we are kicking them. And while we are tied up in Iraq, al Qaeda thrives in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
   So the President's turn of phrase will go into the Blooper Hall of Fame with other Bush golden oldies, like ``last throes,'' ``links to al Qaeda,'' and ``mission accomplished.'' 
   There was a time when American success meant defeating Nazis, tearing down communism's iron curtain, and walking on the Moon. Supporting our troops meant honest safeguards, not trash talk. How low have our standards fallen when the President points to the debacle he created and says, ``This is what I am proud of''? 
   Most Americans believe in a country that is capable of much higher standards. And if America were really kicking butt, the President wouldn't need to say anything. Everyone would know it.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the S-MINER Act because it will quite simply and without doubt save the lives of innocent Americans. It could have saved the life of my fellow Kentuckian, Jimmy Lee, whose widow Melissa I met this past year. She courageously came to us for help because, though it was too late to save her Jimmy, we still had the chance to prevent more loving spouses from becoming courageous widows. 
   Yesterday, Melissa and 27 other Kentuckians sent me a letter. Each has lost a father, son or husband in a preventable mine disaster, and each urges the implementation of this legislation. 
   I found it very interesting to listen to my colleague from across the aisle, the gentleman from Alaska. And he used the term on a number of occasions, a nail in the coffin: And this is what we're talking about. 
   In my case, today, I'm talking about a letter from 28 Kentuckians who had to put their relatives, their loved ones in coffins and bury them because this government has not done what it can and should do to protect them. 
   In any event, the White House threatens a veto, not so much because it disagrees, but because the Department of Labor still hasn't implemented the last law. Congress is here to act when bureaucracies drag their feet. And here the consequences of the administration stonewalling are disastrous. 
   This is one of those choices we face in this era. We face the decision between money and lives. And as I said during the hearing when we looked into the Darby disaster and Sago and Crandall Canyon, we need to have a country and a government that value the lives of the miners as much as what they bring out of the ground. That's what this legislation is all about. That's what we stand here to do. And that's why I congratulate the chairman for his courageous act and his passion for this cause. 
   So with that, I urge my colleagues and the President to join me in supporting the Supplemental Mining Improvement and New Emergency Response Act. And I urge them to begin saving lives today.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and thank him for his comments and also Mr. Walz for his leadership as well. 
   I will say, no, the situation in Kentucky is not much different than it is anywhere else in the country, and throughout the campaign 2 years ago and before that, as I talked to people in my district and around the State of Kentucky, what I heard was the same message you have heard. You know, we're working harder and harder, we're struggling, we're doing the best we can, and yet we're falling behind. We're not making progress. Our standard of living is not getting better, not improving. 
   And I know that we don't want to burden the audience with too many statistics, but Mr. Walz talked about productivity, and one of the most astounding statistics I've heard recently is that 25 years ago, when there was a productivity gain in the United States, workers benefited to the tune of 70 percent of that productivity gain. So for every dollar increase in productivity, workers got 70 percent, owners got 30 percent. 
   In the current era, that number is down in the 20s. So while American workers are working harder and harder, most of the gain in their productivity is not going to them. It's going to owners. It's going to the corporations, and the workers working harder and harder are not getting the benefit of that. 
   And we're seeing it day in and day out. And not only that; we're seeing instances in which people who have worked their entire lives, because of emergencies, because of businesses going out of business, are losing their life savings. 
   I will never forget being at a Catholic picnic one day in 2006 and talking to a man who had worked for Winn-Dixie Corporation. He had worked 28 years for Winn-Dixie, and he had accumulated $150,000 in his retirement plan. Winn-Dixie had gone into bankruptcy. He was left with $30,000. He lost 80 percent of his life savings because of the problems inherent in his corporation, and they had not planned adequately to secure his retirement benefits. 
   So these have ripple effects. These are stories that are heard by relatives, by friends, by neighbors, and that increases the anxiety throughout society. And this is what I sense that we face in this country today is not just the actual fact of people's standard of living not increasing despite the fact they're working harder and harder, but their faith in the future is declining and faith in the future of their neighbors and their friends because they see the threats to them, and they say what am I working for, what am I trying so hard to accomplish. 
   Then we had the added specter, as I know one of our colleagues will discuss this evening, of the incredible crisis in the health care system where 50 percent of the bankruptcies that we now experience in this country are due to health care costs and people, again, who have done everything the right way and have lost everything because of bad luck of the draw. They've come down with cancer. They've come down with a serious injury that's preventing them from working. 
   So as we go across the entire spectrum of American society that's what we find day in and day out. I like to think of government as the way we organize our responsibilities to each other, and in this day and age we do face these very serious choices and very clear choices in how we perceive our economy and what government's role should be.     
   And the question is, do we reward wealth versus work? And I think this group that was elected in 2006 has a clear position on that; we want to reward work and not necessarily wealth. We want to make sure that when people work harder, they benefit. And we want to make sure that the economy is  fair to everyone and works for everyone. And if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to be representing the American people because we have let them down. And I know that this group is not going to let them down; I know that's why we came here. And I'm proud to be here for that reason, and I'm not going to stop fighting as long as I'm here. 
   So, I thank all of you for your collegiality and all of your efforts in this behalf. We are part of a great cause for the working families in America, and I'm very proud to be a part of that. 
   With that, I will yield to my colleague from out west, the site of this year's Democratic convention, Mr. Perlmutter.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Thank you. One of the things that I want to follow up on what you were talking about was we were sent here to solve problems. And I think one of the reasons that we have gotten into the predicament we're in is because a lot of people in the White House and in this Congress thought that you can govern by dogma. And when people say the free market's infallible or that regulation is bad or government should get out of the way and we hear those kinds of dogmatic philosophical statements, a lot of people bought into those. And what we see time after time, and I guess we are all slow learners in this country, but what we see time after time, whether it's with the subprime mortgage, whether it's with Katrina, or in all sorts of areas, with our health care system, is that dogma doesn't do very well when the rubber meets the road. There are real facts that we have to deal with. 
   So we come here, and I know a lot of people, when we try to suggest that the disparity between rich and poor has gotten too great or that corporations have too much power, think we are playing at class war or we are trying to pit one part of society against the other. And that's not at all what we're doing. And I hope the audience has understood that everybody tonight has talked about fairness and, dare I say it, balance, and we are talking about the fact that in this country over the last couple of decades the economic pendulum has swung way too far to one side. And the marketplace works where there is some kind of balance in power, and now there is no balance in power because the rules are all stacked against every working American. 
   So we're not trying to say that corporations are evil. I don't think anybody would say that, or that the rich are evil and that they don't care about the working class. But we have a situation in which that pendulum needs to be moved back to the point where everybody shares in the growth of this country. 
   So as I look at this group, all of whom are committed to solving problems and not necessarily to advancing a dogma, I think that's what the American people expect us to do and I think that's what we are going to continue to work to do. 
   I would like to yield to my distinguished colleague and friend from Vermont (Mr. Welch).

   Mr. YARMUTH. I would just like to add as maybe a closing remark that one of the things in the area of dogma we talk about, or cliches, we want government out of our lives. Everybody hates government until they need government. That is from the richest to the poorest. We know there's a lot of subsidy to the wealthiest people, the wealthiest corporations. They say they don't like government, but they are always coming here to ask for help when it suits them. 
   This is one of those times when everyone needs government in this country. Everyone needs the stimulus that we are about to try to provide. It's the right thing, it's the smart thing, and it's the moral thing to do. I think that if we can convince enough people on the other side of the aisle, we will strike a great victory for this country and for the American people. I look forward to doing that in the next couple of weeks.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise today because I'm very concerned about statements I've heard from all three Presidential candidates over the last few weeks. We hear constantly, I will do this, I will do that, I will do this, all referring to matters that have to be adopted by the United States Congress. And I would remind them that article I, section 1 of the Constitution says, all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. 
   So while we certainly look to the President as a partner in our policies, we know, as we've seen over the last couple of years, that this President, this White House ignores, the first article of the Constitution. 
   I would urge all three candidates, whoever is President, whoever he or she may be in 2009, re-read the Constitution, because this is the people's House. The founders' brilliance said that the people will speak as to the laws that they will obey through their representatives in Congress. 
   I again urge the President, the next President to re-read the Constitution and adhere to article I. Many of us wear this button because we're very concerned that people forget that this is their House.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, we began this week by solemnly marking the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq, the more than 3,200 brave soldiers who have been killed there, and the 378 billion dollars that have been appropriated thus far. But we end the week with the historic opportunity to bring about an end to this catastrophe. 
   Over the last 4 years, the President not only failed to provide a plan to win in Iraq, he failed to offer our troops concrete and attainable objectives. Where he has let down our forces and the American people, Congress has a Constitutional obligation to step in, and this, ``The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act,'' is our chance. It is our only real chance, to see this war end, to comply with the stated will of the American people, and to bring our troops home. 
   It is important to remember that this bill does more than set benchmarks and a timeline; it also provides much needed funding to protect our troops abroad and care for our veterans at home. A vote against this bill is a vote for the President but against our soldiers; it supports the war but abandons our young men and women in uniform. 
   That being said, whether we authorize it or not, the President will find the funding to prolong this war, even if it is at the expense of our soldiers, our veterans, and other crucial programs. This country cannot afford another Walter Reed, nor can it afford to send the President another blank check to indefinitely extend this occupation. 
   The President has asked for a bill without strings attached. He doesn't deserve a bill without strings. In 4 years of acting without strings, this war has never had an end in sight. We have before us today the opportunity to bring finality into view, and I urge my colleagues, members of the Senate, and President Bush not to squander this opportunity. I ask that we unite in support of Iraqi independence, U.S. troops, and H.R. 1591.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 years, Dick Cheney has convinced himself that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that the insurgency was in its last throes. Now it seems he's convinced himself that he is not actually Vice President, insisting that he, unlike the previous 44, is not a member of the executive branch. 
   It's difficult for any American who's taken seventh grade civics to miss the hypocrisy of this claim, especially when it comes from a man who so frequently has withheld information from Congress based on the assertion of executive privilege. 
   It's time for the Vice President to remove the secrecy, reject hypocrisy, and honor his pledge to support the Constitution. It's time for Dick Cheney to start respecting the citizens who pay  his salary and start leveling with us. Even a child can tell you, you can have special privileges if you obey the rules, and even the Vice President can't have it both ways. 
   Many of us wish you weren't part of the executive branch, Mr. Vice President, but so long as you accept the executive perks, we will demand executive responsibility and accountability.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, my constituents, like yours, paid over $3 a gallon for gas last year. Isn't that enough? Do they really need to be paying a second time with their tax dollars? 
   Last year, Big Oil saw higher profits than any industry in the history of the world, yet we are writing them welfare checks. The United States is 65 percent dependent on foreign oil, worse than we have ever been before, sending $800 million a day to the Middle East. This situation creates conflicts of interest in crucial matters of security and diplomacy whereby we, the United States of America, are beholden to nations who do not represent our best interests. Still, we are cutting a welfare check to Big Oil. 
   When we embrace the wave of the future and dedicate ourselves to developing alternative, renewable, clean more-affordable energy sources, America will create more than a quarter million new jobs, generate $30 billion in new worker wages, and finally stop funding both sides of the war on terror. 
   Despite all that, we are still using taxpayer dollars to hand a huge welfare check to billionaire oil companies. The CLEAN Energy Act takes the crucial first steps to ending this policy, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (IRAQ WAR -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor once again to come to the floor of the House as a representative of the landmark class of 2006 known as the majority makers, a group of 41 Democrats elected from 23 States who were sent here by the American people to change the direction of the country. 
   Of course one of the primary issues that was at the heart of the campaign in 2006 was our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. And this week that effort, national effort, has taken greater significance because we once again heard from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker about the progress or the situation, I should say, in Iraq. They testified before two congressional committees, two Senate committees yesterday and the House committees today. Their testimony, I think, raises two issues that I want to address tonight. 
   Of course the first is what the situation is in Iraq and what the prospects for success are in that part of the world. And, secondly, what is the cost to the American people and to the American economy because as we all know, the costs are varied and they are significant. They rise to magnitudes that we are not used to discussing in this country, both in human cost which of course is our top priority, and also the economic cost. And then there is the future cost as well because what we are doing is incurring obligations for our future generations that are real, that are incredibly large, and that the American people need to focus on because as we go forward and try to establish policies and have a national debate about what the appropriate course of action is in Iraq, we have to discuss again not just the human costs but also the cost to future generations of the American people, juxtaposed against the benefits and potential benefits of our continued involvement.  
   There are two things I think we need to say from the outset that really underlie all of these discussions and that is everyone in this body, in the Congress and in the country wants the United States to be successful, wants there to be a peaceful and beneficial result in Iraq. We all want a stable Middle East. We all want a stable, peaceful world. No one in this body or anywhere else that I know of is rooting for us to be unsuccessful in Iraq. 
   The second thing that we need to focus on is that it is unavoidable that we have to talk about economics and it is sad that we even have to talk about money because already we have lost 4,000 American men and women in Iraq. We have had virtually 30,000 wounded, many seriously, many with life-altering injuries; and the cost to the Iraqi people, of course, is also extraordinary with 2 million people having left Iraq, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, Iraqi civilians dying, and many more dislocated throughout the country, families torn apart and lives ruined. 
   So the human cost of the U.S. involvement in this effort in Iraq and also in Afghanistan cannot be minimized, and nobody is trying to. That of course is the ultimate cost. But we do have to talk about the economic cost of this war because we are looking at a situation in which we have potential exposure throughout the world. We have a military that will be called on to be deployed in other situations, not just in the Middle East. We have by almost everyone's estimation a much more serious and ominous threat in Afghanistan and Pakistan that will require continued involvement of American forces, and where it is clear to everyone that terrorists, including particularly al Qaeda, are much more active and we need to focus much more intensely on Afghanistan and our involvement in Iraq is, of course, preventing us from doing as much as we could and probably should in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   These are all of the dynamics that we face as we discuss these issues. Two things in particular concern me about the testimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker yesterday. And, of course, everyone quite justifiably honors their service and their commitment to their duty, and they are certainly fulfilling their obligations well. 
   But two things in particular disturb me greatly, and one was when asked continuously by a number of Senators and House Members to describe the conditions under which we might be able to withdraw a substantial number of our forces from Iraq, General Petraeus basically said we will know them when we see them. He could not identify them. And he said, Well, we will look at it again in a few months. We will look at it in September. Maybe we can start withdrawing them then; maybe we can't. 
   What's the measure for success? He wouldn't specify. He couldn't specify. And I don't think he was being coy. I think, in fact, his unwillingness to specify or identify the conditions under which we might be able to leave was purely a function of the fact that 
   we don't know what the conditions are, and we have never known exactly what we were trying to accomplish in that country. 
   The goalposts have been moved continuously. There have been dozens of different reasons for our involvement mentioned over the last 5 years. And it is, I think, quite indicative yesterday when asked on numerous occasions again what would you see, what would you have to see before you would recommend withdrawing more troops, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, Well, we'll know it when we see it; it is a matter of what the conditions are. 
   That is an important point to make. 
   Another answer that he gave to a question asked by Senator Biden, I think, was quite revealing. When Senator Biden asked when you come back and make your evaluation and assessment in September of this year, at that point do you think there is any chance that we could be within 30 days of having troops withdrawal? 
   General Petraeus said at that point, Well, it might be that very day. Of course he went on to say it could be a month later, it could be many months later, it could be years later. 
   When I heard him say that it occurred to me if he was willing to say there was a possibility that we could be out, be able to start withdrawing significant numbers of troops in September, if that was a possibility, he should know what the metrics are, what the conditions he would have to be looking for in September to allow us to do that. And yet when asked what are the conditions, he couldn't identify them. 
   So again, I think all of these points, reading between the lines, indicate that we are not getting the full story about what we should look for as a measure of success in Iraq because the people on the ground don't know what the measures are. I think they would tell us if they knew, but I don't think they know. And that is a pretty frightening thought because we are being asked to carry the burden of an incredibly large cost as a society. 
   Now many of us are not asked, unfortunately, I think in many ways, we are not asked to bear any of the burden. Most of the burden is being borne directly by the military families and the soldiers who are overseas in deployment, many for several deployments. They are bearing the hardest burden; but we are also bearing a serious cost, and it mounts by the second. 
   As a matter of fact, every minute that I spend speaking here, we are spending, the American taxpayers are spending $230,000. Every minute, $230,000 is being spent in Iraq; $4,000 a second. That mounts up. It becomes real, real money. It becomes $14 million an hour; $340 million a day; $2.5 billion a week, $10 billion a month; and while some estimates are higher, $125 billion a year, and that is just in Iraq. 
   Now I know, believe me, that many people have a hard time grasping what a billion dollars is, what $120 billion are, but there are a couple of easy ways to describe it. With $120 billion in 1 year, you could give every teacher in the United States a $20,000 a year raise. Every teacher. Every one of our 6 million teachers in the United States, and I think most people agree teachers are drastically underpaid, we could give them a $20,000 a year raise with what we are spending in Iraq. 
   We could pay for the health care of about 16 or 17 million people every year. That 47 million people we have uninsured, we could cover 16 or 17 million of those people with that $125 billion that we are now spending in Iraq. 
   We all know we have huge infrastructure needs in this country, bridges to repair, highways to repair, schools to rebuild. Throughout the country we face trillions of dollars of needed repairs and new construction on our infrastructure. This would make a considerable investment in that seriously needed national agenda. But that is going overseas. And, unfortunately, it is going to where it is not an investment, it is money that is irretrievably lost. 
   We could also, and this is taking what we spend every day, that $340 million or so we spend every day in Iraq, we could hire 2,000 more Border Patrol agents; 18,000 more students could receive Pell Grants to help them attend college for an entire year; 48,000 homeless veterans could be provided a place to live; 317,000 more kids could receive recommended vaccinations for a year; almost a million families could get help with their energy bills. The list goes on and on. This is the cost of this war in economic terms to the American people. This is the lost opportunity, the lost opportunity for our American people. 
   What is even worse is it would be one thing if we had this money, but we don't have this money. We know we are running a deficit of almost $500 billion this year, so we are borrowing this money. We are not just saying we have $125 billion lying around, we can allocate this to Iraq, no problem. We are borrowing it. At least half of it we are borrowing from foreign countries. So we are having China and other nations who are financing our debt, who are actually paying for this war, but it is not free. China is going to want to get paid back some time, and that is going to be on future generations. So again, whatever we feel about this war, we have to understand the cost, and the cost is real. The American people understand that this cost is real. 
   A recent New York Times CBS poll, 89 percent of Americans surveyed said that the war in Iraq is a drain on the U.S. economy; 66 percent said it is a big drain, and 22 percent said it is some drain.     
   So the American people understand this. The American people understand that while we have a housing crisis, while we have a crisis in our financial markets, where we're having trouble actually making, having funds made available to make student loans, we understand that there's a connection between the economic problems we face and our involvement in Iraq. 
   And again, I don't think any of us would argue if this were a war where there were clearly defined goals, and if there were an existential threat to the United States, our security. But our national intelligence estimate, our 16 agencies said no, that's not the case, that we don't face an existential threat in Iraq. We are, essentially, refereeing, as we know, a sectarian dispute. 
   And I think what is most frustrating, again, reading between the lines, listening to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, is that there was never a mention that I heard of anything that we could do to change the outcome there; that the implication was we were just sitting there, and that we had to wait until they decided that they were going to make it okay for us to leave. And that's a very, very frustrating position to be in. 
   And I wish somebody, maybe somebody did ask that and I didn't hear it, but I wish that they had been asked that specific question; is there anything we can do to change the dynamics there to improve the conditions that would allow us to begin withdrawing our troops and to reduce this incredible cost to the American people? 
   So I would hope that as we go forward, and you hate to say, as we go forward, because we've been going forward, now, for 5 years, and the outlook is not any brighter. The prospects for resolution in Iraq are not any greater. 
   And unfortunately, listening to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker yesterday, I think it's, unfortunately, true that the people who are in charge don't know where we're going and most importantly, why we're going. 
   So these are things, as the months roll by, while the cost accumulates, and while, unfortunately, we will suffer, no doubt, as we have suffered, just in the last few days, 13 new American casualties, that the American people understand and demand, both of us and the administration, that we get a clear picture of what the objectives are, what the cost is, and will be, because we have estimates, Professor Joseph Stiglitz has estimated the total cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, ultimately, of $3 trillion. 
   But we need to understand what our goals are, what our objectives are, what the possibilities are, what the risks are, what the potential benefits are, and of course, what the costs are, because we're not playing with small numbers. We're not playing with insignificant lives. And this is the greatest challenge facing this country. 
   And I hope that we can have the type of dialogue, continuously, which focuses on these points, because the American people, rightfully, are looking for leadership and progress on Iraq. 
   So once again, I thank you, Mr. Speaker. It has been a great privilege to stand in the House and represent the freshman Democrats who came to Congress to change the direction of the country, who are, in many ways, changing the direction of the country. And I think we will continue to ask the questions that need to be asked, and try to bring a much quicker resolution in Iraq and a new direction for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (WELCOMING HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XVI ON HIS FIRST APOSTOLIC VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 838 to welcome His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI on his first apostolic visit to the United States, and to honor a key reason for his visit: The bicentennial of the Archdiocese of Louisville. 
   Only Baltimore and New Orleans retain older Archdioceses than the four created by Pope Pius VII 200 years ago yesterday. It was on that day, April 8, 1808, that His Holiness created a diocese in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Bardstown, Kentucky. To be Bishop in Bardstown, he tabbed an exile of the French Revolution, Benedict Joseph Flaget, a name revered in Louisville to this day. 
   Dubbed the ``First Bishop of the West,'' Bishop Flaget was responsible for an area that now covers more than 40 dioceses. He immediately led a spirited period of growth in the area, establishing numerous seminaries, churches, and schools where none had existed before. For many, these institutions provided the lone opportunity to pursue a quality education and reinforce one's faith. 
   And it was Bishop Flaget, in 1841, who moved the Bardstown diocese to the burgeoning city of Louisville. With the diocese at its core, a strong Catholic community grew in Louisville and in the surrounding areas; one united not only by a shared faith, but by a mutual moral sense of community, education and service. 
   That community grew and thrived for nearly a century, and in 1937 became the Archdiocese of Louisville as we know it today, now serving over a million people and 24 Kentucky counties. It was in service to the Archdiocese of Louisville that Thomas Merton, one of the most influential religious authors of the 20th century, had his legendary ``Louisville Epiphany'' that led to an impassioned and inspired quest for peace and social justice.  
   The Archdiocese of Lousiville also operates Catholic Charities of Louisville which offers countless services to people of all religious, ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds throughout our community. The efforts of Catholic Charities can be seen in every corner of Louisville, giving hope to disadvantaged youth, assisting the elderly, lending support to those who need help to stand on their own, and revitalizing neighborhoods that have fallen into disarray. 
   We also have the Archdiocese to thank for one of the truly outstanding parochial school systems in the Nation. For more than a century, and through every stage of a young person's development, Louisville's Catholic schools have helped to foster generations of great citizens, role models and leaders. 
   During my tenure representing Louisville in Congress, I have had the pleasure of serving alongside two Archbishops. Archbishop Thomas Kelly retired this past year after a quarter century defined by interfaith outreach, multi-cultural ministry, and a commitment to social services. Archbishop Joseph Kurtz now leads the Archdiocese, and in his first year, he has shown the leadership abilities and initiative to build upon the incredible foundation already in place in Louisville. 
   The theme for this year's bicentennial is ``Serving God's People: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.'' It is a fitting tribute to an institution that has always done and continues to do exactly that: Serve all of the people of the Louisville area through acts of faith, peace and kindness. 
   Extraordinary is nothing new for the Archdiocese of Louisville. Still an Apostolic visit to the United States from His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to mark the bicentennial is a recognition that will be forever treasured by our community. I join my colleagues in thanking and welcoming His Holiness to the United States of America, and know they join me in honoring the Archdiocese of Louisville on its bicentennial and thanking our Catholic community for two centuries of faith and service.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (NATIONAL AMERICORPS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 385, which recognizes National AmeriCorps Week. 
   Since Congress created AmeriCorps in 1994, the program has generated numbers that are impressive by any measure. In 13 years, AmeriCorps has mobilized 1.5 million volunteers in every State in the Union, accumulating nearly 700 million hours of service, a value of $12 billion. 
   In addition, AmeriCorps volunteers have earned more than $1 billion in scholarships for that service. My home State of Kentucky has benefited from 7 million of the service hours from nearly 5,000 volunteers. 
   Few Federal programs can quantify this type of success across the board, but the numbers would be meaningless were it not for the tremendous impact these hours and all those volunteers have made on countless lives throughout our communities. In my district in Louisville, that impact can be felt throughout the community. 
   I see it on the optimistic face of a young girl who recently found new reasons to smile, thanks to her mentor from Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Kentuckiana. We feel it walking through a Portland neighborhood, freshly cleaned and painted by volunteers participating in the second annual Martin Luther King Season of Service. You hear it in the voice of a boy proudly reading his first book to his mother, who would not have been able to provide adequate education if not for the AmeriCorps Every 1 Reads program. 
   There can be no doubt that in our world, the ways these lives have been touched is exceptional. But in AmeriCorps, by providing resources to Court Appointed Special Advocates, Habitat For Humanity, Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, and other educational and non-profit services, these successes are the norm. 
   They happen every day all across the country over and over again, because this unique and ambitious government initiative provides the catalyst for selfless Americans of all backgrounds to push the limits for our capacity of service, and turn awareness into action, compassion and commitment. 
   AmeriCorps members live every day with the understanding that when we act as one for progress, we progress together. Yet all too often, these life-changing individuals and community building programs go unrecognized. So I ask all my colleagues to join me for the next 7 days in honoring all AmeriCorps members and alumni, to say thanks for all that they have done and continue to do and to encourage more people to get involved. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   The outstanding individuals who have contributed over the years deserve our thanks and recognition.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Juniata College for winning the NCAA Division III Women's Volleyball Championship. 
   On November 18, 2006, the Juniata College women's volleyball team won the 2006 NCAA Division III championship by beating the Washington University-St. Louis Bears in Salem, Virginia. 
   I want to extend my congratulations to head coach Larry Bock, assistant coach Heather Pavlik, Juniata College president Thomas Kepple, Jr., and the student athletes on a wonderful season. 
   The Eagles had an exceptional record of 41 wins with just one loss. They were undefeated in Division III competition, with their only loss coming to a Division I school. The team also had an exceptional player in Stephanie Kines who was named Division III women's volleyball player of the year. Coach Larry Bock also added to his extraordinary record of 1,100 wins and 172 losses over 30 years of coaching, the most wins of any coach in NCAA women's volleyball history. 
   I also want to extend my congratulations to the Washington University-St. Louis Bears. The Bears had a record of 38 wins and 2 losses. The Bears won the University Athletic Association title for 2006 and had four women receive AVCA All-America honors. 
   Winning the Division III national championship and finishing the season with a 41-1 record has brought positive national attention to Juniata College, and I know the fans of the university will cherish this moment as they look forward to the 2007 season.  
   Mr. Speaker, once again I congratulate Juniata College for their success.

   We cannot continue to neglect the needs of our veterans and our soldiers wounded in combat. That is why the Democratic emergency supplemental bill provides substantial funding increases for equipment that will better protect our troops in the field and the necessary assistance to meet our obligation to help those who were wounded. 
   The Democratic supplemental bill provides $313 million more for new vehicles called mine resistant ambush protection vehicles, which will resist improvised explosive devices. Our bill also provides critical funding for soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries. 
   Madam Speaker, the Democratic emergency spending bill shows a real commitment to both our soldiers still in the field and our troops wounded in combat. It deserves our support.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, President Bush declared that major combat operations in Iraq were over. To that point, we had lost 139 soldiers. Over the last 4 years, due to the administration's incompetence and lack of planning, thousands more U.S. troops have been killed and wounded, hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money has been spent, and now Iraq is consumed by a civil war that the President is asking our troops to referee. 
   It was way too soon for the President to declare mission accomplished, but 4 years later, the President seems content to tell our soldiers that their mission is not going to be accomplished any time soon. 
   By vetoing the Iraq supplemental last week, the President ignored the voices of the American people, his own military generals and this Congress. He can no longer afford to be that stubborn. The President must work with the Congress to come up with an agreement on how to move forward. He can't believe that this Congress is going to roll over and rubber-stamp his failed policies like past Republican Congresses have done.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, last night this House acted in bipartisan fashion to reject some of the President's harmful budget cuts to important education programs. Had this Congress simply rubber-stamped President Bush's budget, education funding would have been slashed by $1.2 billion, including a 50 percent cut in vocational education and the elimination of every student aid program except Pell Grants and Work Study. 
   This House rejected those cuts. Instead, we invest $767 million more than the President's request for K-12 education, including targeted increases in special education, teacher quality grants, after-school programs and Head Start. We invested $575 million above the President's budget for technical training in high schools and community colleges. And we provide $1.7 billion more than the President for Pell Grants and other student aid programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this new Democratic Congress has prioritized the needs of children and young adults by investing in their education so they can better compete in an ever-expanding global economy.

   For 7 years, Washington Republicans allowed Big Oil to run our Nation's energy policy. The result, high gas prices and continued dependence on oil. 
   Democrats believe we must diversify our energy sources with bold investments in renewable energy and more efficient technology. Last year, for the first time in three decades, this Congress passed a landmark law that increases fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon and that will save American families at least $700 a year when it takes effect. 
   We have also passed legislation that repeals billions of dollars in corporate welfare to big oil companies that are currently seeing record profits. Instead, we invest these funds in the renewable energy solutions of the future.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of legislation that would pressure the oil companies to drill, and drill now. In my hometown of Louisville, people are struggling to pay more than $4.20 for a gallon of gas. While they search for a way to make ends meet, a few multinational corporations hold the answers: Permits to drill over 60 million acres of oil and gas reserves today. 
   These existing leases could double U.S. oil production. But the oil companies don't want more land to drill, they want more land to control, which keeps oil off the market and gas prices high. After all, high gas prices have made them the richest companies in the history of the world. 
   Instead, they demand the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, presumably so they cannot drill there too. Even this oil-friendly White House admits that drilling the wildlife refuge won't affect the price of gas for more than 20 years, and then, only by a couple of pennies. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people's problems are measured in dollars, not pennies, and they can't wait until 2030. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation and get American oil into the market as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, in this body, where we often discuss proposals to allocate millions or billions of dollars, it can become easy to lose sight of what just a few thousand dollars a year can do. But the increase in the minimum wage, the first part of which takes effect today, will make a major difference in the lives of America's working families. The extra $4,400 per year that these families will bring home to their families will have a very tangible impact on their lives. 
   For families who have struggled too long without a raise, $4,400 a year translates into 15 months of groceries, 19 months of paid utility bills, 20 months of child care, or well over 2 years of employer-provided health care. The extra money could even pay for 30 months of tuition at a public 2-year college, allowing these parents to get additional education or to help their children achieve their dream of attending college. 
   Madam Speaker, thanks to the Federal minimum wage increase passed by this Democratic Congress, nearly 13 million working Americans and more than 6 million children will have a chance at a better life. This fair and long overdue pay raise is an important first step in moving our Nation in a new economically healthy direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (DEMOCRATIC FRESHMEN HOUR -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it's a great honor for me to be here tonight representing the class of 2006, the freshmen Democrats who were responsible for returning the majority to the Democrats in the last election. I'm particularly proud to be here to talk about the whole area of intelligence and surveillance, which our colleagues from across the aisle spent the last hour talking about. 
   I don't have props tonight because I look down at the dais and I see engraved in the side of the dais two words that serve as the only props I need in discussing this very important topic. I see the word ``justice,'' and I see the word ``freedom.'' Because that's really what we're talking about when we're talking about the FISA controversy. We're talking about whether the incredibly important principles of justice will apply to the way we treat corporations in this country that choose not to  obey the law. And we're also talking about freedom. We're talking about the freedom of individuals to pursue their private lives free of the worry that they're being listened to for no good reason. 
   You know, it's interesting to listen to my colleagues from across the aisle. And I don't want to impugn their motives at all. I believe that they, just as we on the majority side of the aisle, firmly believe in patriotism. We firmly believe in securing this country. We believe this is one of our sworn duties. 
   There is no question that all of us take an oath to secure this country and to protect it, and one of our primary responsibilities is to defend the people of this great country. But the first thing that we swear to when we take the oath of office is to protect the Constitution of the United States. That is our solemn oath. And the Constitution was written primarily to protect the rights of the American citizens. And that's really what this controversy is all about. All of us, every one of us, Democrat and Republican, is primarily concerned about making sure that our citizens are safe. And we want to do everything in our power to make sure that we use every tool that we have at our disposal to make sure that our citizens are safe. But we also want to make sure that every tool in our power is not used to violate the Bill of Rights, the amendments which guarantee fundamental freedoms to our citizens. And that's really what we're talking about when we talk about the FISA reauthorization. 
   You know, it's interesting; we passed, last fall, a reauthorization of the FISA Act, the Protect America Act, and we passed it willingly. We thought it was a good bill. And here comes the President saying, I'm not going to allow this bill to go forward. I'm not going to allow these important protections for the American citizens to go forward unless we give immunity to the phone companies because the phone companies did what we ordered them to do, essentially, starting with 9/11. We asked them to help us provide surveillance of American citizens even though we knew it was against the law, even though they knew it was against the law. We asked them to do that, and, therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for that. 
   Well, that's an interesting attitude. And I know that my colleagues across the aisle said all they're trying to do is to protect the trial lawyers, all they're trying to do is protect the trial lawyers. Well, I have another question because there is another side to that point. And I'll address the trial lawyer controversy, or issue, but the other side of that is, why are they trying to protect the phone companies? Why are they trying to protect American corporations that knowingly violated the law of the United States? 
   Now I don't think that it's really because they care whether the phone companies have to pay millions of dollars in damages. I don't think it's really because they care whether trial lawyers might make a contingent fee. I think the only reason that they are concerned about granting immunity to the phone companies for ostensibly violating the law of the United States is because they don't want the American people to know what the phone companies were doing and what the administration has ordered them to do because in a legal procedure, a lot of that information may come out. 
   Now they will say, on the other hand, if they get to that, well, this is a matter of national security. And all the legal experts say no, the courts have a way of making sure that no classified information is divulged to the public. But what the administration is really afraid of is not that AT&T might have to pay $100 million. They're concerned about AT&T having to go under oath and say here's what we did, and that somebody will understand that this administration asked them to violate the law, and they knowingly did that. That's what the immunity issue is all about. 
   Now in terms of the trial lawyers. I know, and I know our leadership has told us, the trial lawyers have never said a word about this issue. This isn't a big deal. You're not talking about a vast number of lawyers who are going to benefit from this. There are only a few companies that did it. As a matter of fact, there are a couple of companies that were reputable enough and honest enough to say no to the government, we're not going to do that, we're not going to violate the law.     
   So they didn't need immunity because they didn't do anything wrong, and I don't know how many lawyers could actually, and I don't want to use the metaphor I was thinking of, but try to exploit that situation for their benefit, but there are not that many involved. And trial lawyers really have not lobbied this issue at all. 
   What we are talking about, plain and simple, is the issue of who violated the law. Is there accountability? Is there justice in this country? And this administration, in spite of their protestations of saying Osama bin Laden is out there, he's making phone calls, they're all making phone calls, that that's what we want to protect ourselves from, that has nothing to do with the immunity issue. The immunity issue is history. That's the past. We're concerned about what we do going forward. We're concerned about protecting the American people. We enacted legislation last fall that would do that. The President won't sign it. 
   So we have a very, very different perspective on this issue. And it's funny because they throw up their hands on the other side and say, I just can't imagine why the leadership of the Democrats is not allowing this to come to a vote, why they won't pass this bill. We need to do it. It's a perfect bill. We need to do it. 
   Well, I have three answers for them. I think I have already mentioned a couple of them. One is the Constitution. That's the solemn oath that we take when we enter this office. And we are not willing to pass a bill that basically eliminates part of the Constitution. 
   Secondly is the rule of law. I think we all agree that the rule of law is sacrosanct, that this country would fall if it weren't for the rule of law. And we are trying to make sure here that the rule of law is observed and respected. 
   And, finally, we're talking about individual liberty, the freedom I talked about at the outset of the remarks, that we need to make sure that if we allow individual liberties to be abridged in this country that it is done pursuant to legal authority, that it is done pursuant to warrants, that it is done pursuant to the government's going to a court and providing reasonable cause to assume that there is some reason to surveil an individual American citizen. That's what this dispute is all about. That's what this issue is on both sides. 
   And it's interesting. As I listened to the President not too long ago when he was once again trying to use scare tactics to intimidate this body into doing what he wants to do, to protecting him and to essentially helping him engage in a coverup of the activities of the administration and the phone companies, he made the statement that right now terrorists are plotting activities against the United States that would make 9/11 pale in comparison. That's what he said. 
   And when I heard him say that, my thought was, well, wait a minute. If he actually knows that, that they are plotting something that's worse than 9/11, then I guess he's getting all the information he needs. Somehow, some way he's hearing information. If he can make a claim with that specificity that it's going to be worse than 9/11 and they are planning it now, then maybe he's listening to something. Maybe the intelligence authority that he was using works and he doesn't need this additional authority. 
   But I don't think that's the case, of course. I think basically what he was trying to say is do this or you die because that's been the strategy of this administration in many cases. Do what we want or you will be in trouble. You will be harmed. Your family will be harmed. 
   I don't think the American people are buying it anymore. I think they've cried wolf far too often. But that's what we have been dealing with in trying to have a very reasonable approach to providing the type of authority that we agree is necessary to allow us to wage this struggle against terrorist activity. So that's sort of, in an introductory way, what we are dealing with. 
   And it gives me great pleasure now to welcome another Member of the class of 2006, my good friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, Dr. Kagen.

Richard Clarke, who is the former Chief NSC Counterterrorism Adviser under both Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush said, ``Let me be clear. Our ability to track and monitor terrorists overseas would not cease should the Protect America Act expire. If this were true, the President would not threaten to terminate any temporary extension with his veto pen. All surveillance currently occurring would continue even after legislative provisions lapsed because authorizations issued under the act are under effect up to a full year.'' 
   So, of course, there is no reason to believe the ads and the scare tactics that have been perpetrated against Members in the Congress.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Well, obviously we can. And obviously this body did last fall. We passed a very, very reasonable reauthorization of the Protect America Act which did virtually everything that the President wanted, and it provided authority to surveil under reasonable circumstances. It didn't grant the NSC or any other institution the ability to go on a fishing expedition. It retains some oversight, some court control. Again, this is a secret court. But this is the way the law was set up in 1978. It's worked very well since then. There are some tweaks that are needed in this law. We recognize that. We did what the administration requested. All of a sudden, this issue of immunity comes up. And, again, I can't believe that this has anything to do with worrying about whether AT&T pays out millions of dollars. This is not what they are concerned about. I don't think the gentleman believes that either.

I think it's not only reasonable; I think it's our duty to require that because it would be a frivolous act if we just said, well, whatever you did, whether it was legal or not, then we're going to grant you immunity or amnesty for doing that. No, we have to know, in order to grant immunity, whether or not there is a reason to grant immunity. Why would we want to do that if there were no reason to do it?

   Mr. YARMUTH. Well, I think that's exactly the case. 
   And I don't blame the telephone companies. I think they were in a very difficult spot. When your government asks you to do something and says that the security of this country is at stake, then I suspect that most corporations would comply with the government's request. 
   Now, these corporations, being the major corporations that they are, with lots of money, with lots of legal advice, lawyers everywhere, would understand that what they were being asked to do might run afoul of the law. And I would suspect that they did make a decision, being in a very difficult spot, I can see, that I either comply with the government, do what they ask me to do, understanding that the government is regulating me; so they would say, okay, I'm really between a rock and a hard place. I can do what the government asks, knowing it's a violation of the law, or I can refuse and knowing that they are regulating me, that my business might be affected some way or another. 
   But that's all a different dynamic from what we're dealing with. We are dealing with the question of does the Congress have the responsibility to hold anyone, corporation or individual, accountable if they violate the law? And that's what I think we're talking about today and talking about in this long debate.

   Mr. YARMUTH. If the gentlelady will yield, I would like to reinforce one statement you made. You talked about the fact that we wanted to extend the act for 21 days so that we could make these corrections. It wasn't just that the President threatened to veto the bill and we voted to extend it. All 202 Republicans voted against the extension. 
   I actually was mystified to watch a news show right around that time, on which they said the Democrats refused to extend the act. I said, boy, is that ridiculous spin. Because we proposed the extension. Every one of the Republicans opposed it, the President threatened to veto it and demagogued it, and yet we were blamed for something we tried to do. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I want to yield again to my colleague from Wisconsin, but one of the things that intrigued me earlier was the notion that somehow we were not interested in security, that we were not interested in fighting the most effective fight that we could against 9/11, and that we were playing politics with the security of this country. That seems to me to be kind of standard rhetoric when we are talking about these matters, when in fact we tend not to deal with what is in the actual law, what the facts of the situation are.  
   I would like to yield again to my colleague from Wisconsin. We have been joined by another distinguished colleague, Mr. Perlmutter, from Colorado. I would like you all to engage in a colloquy about the issue of politics and just who might be playing politics with a very important matter of national security.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I am going to yield to the gentleman from Iowa in just a second, but I want to ask one question about that, and it is a rhetorical question. 
   But can you imagine, I want every American to imagine how their lives would change and how their conversations would change if they thought that every phone call they made was being monitored? Just imagine the chilling effect that that would have on every word you say, on your very thought process. You have to be able to put yourself in that situation to understand what is at stake when we talk about this issue. This is not just about nasty people trying to do people wrong. This is about every American having their very being altered by the threat that they are being listened to. 
   Now I will yield to the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Braley.

   Mr. YARMUTH. There is some other history we haven't talked about tonight yet, and that is the background of this controversy. Because what we fail to remember as we debate this issue, and obviously I think we want to deal with this prospectively, we want to make sure that this country has the power, the government has the power and authority and tools it needs to provide legitimate security for this country.     
   But this program started right after September 11, 2001, and continued for 4 years before it was exposed by the New York Times. So this was a longstanding violation of the law, a deliberate avoidance of the law by the administration. They could at any time after 9/11 have come to Congress and said, we want some additional authority. But they didn't do that. They knew that it would be tough. Even a Republican Congress at that time might have looked askance at requests to do warrantless wiretapping, so they just did it by themselves for 4 years. Then, when it was uncovered, this Congress under Republican leadership rushed to pass the Protect America Act, a stop-gap measure because, obviously, it was embarrassing and they needed to do that. 
   But this is a longstanding deliberate ignoring of the law, and this is something that it doesn't matter whether the government sanctioned it; if companies did it and violated the law, as I said at the outset of my remarks standing right behind you, Mr. Kagen, the words described in that dais, justice. And that is what this country has been built on. And this is a longstanding violation that needs to be redressed, and we shouldn't just say, because the government asked them to do something, that it is okay, that they broke the law. Because if that is the precedent we are setting, there is no end to the imagination of horrors that could happen if the government were able to immunize anyone for any violation of the law. 
   With that, I would like to yield again to Carol Shea-Porter from New Hampshire who has joined us.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding. And I want to join many of us in expressing my great empathy for him and the residents of his State who have gone through so much recently. And we all, I think, not only empathize but sympathize with what the people of Minnesota have had to go through, and I know we all stand ready to help in any way that we can. 
   But my colleague is right, Mr. Speaker. When we all came to this body last year right after being elected and we all met for our orientation and, as freshmen, we met for the first time and started comparing notes, it was clear that we all came with pretty similar mandates. We 
   were sent by our people to change what was going on in this country. We were sent by the people of this country to deal with energy problems. We were sent by the people of this country to deal with a dysfunctional health care system. We were sent by the people of this country to deal with the income and wealth inequality that has put such a strain on the great working families of this country and has seen the wealthiest people in America have their wealth increased by leaps and bounds while, as the census report just mentioned last week, 95 percent of the people in this country have not seen their standard of living improve over the last 6 years. 
   We were sent by the people of this country to do something about the education system, to make sure it not only leaves no child behind but moves every child forward; that we work with the most gifted kids and we work with the kids posing the greatest challenge; that each one of them will have the best that our teachers have to offer and have the greatest support system that we can provide for them. 
   And foremost of all these things, the people of America sent us to Congress with one overriding thought, and that was to change direction in Iraq. 
   And it is very interesting because I know that the people on the other side, our colleagues in the Republican Party, want to try to spin our activities by saying, well, we haven't really accomplished very much. Well, I think every one of us knows how hard we have worked over the last 8 months to accomplish the mission that the people of the United States sent us here for. 
   We have dealt with minimum wage, increasing the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. We have dealt with the energy situation. We tried to eliminate the great and unnecessary tax cuts that were given to the oil companies when they were making record profits. We dealt with health care, not just recently by trying to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program to cover 5 million more American children, but also in trying to save money and make the system more efficient by forcing the pharmaceutical companies to negotiate with Medicare in the Medicare part D program. 
   In every area of our jurisdiction, we have tried to respond to the demands of the American people. We have listened to them. We are dealing right now with the revision of No Child Left Behind. The changes we are making in that program stem directly from what we have heard from the American people. We are listening. We are acting. We are moving. 
   And so it is with not only a great deal of personal disgust but also with a sense of outrage that I listened to President Bush make a statement when he was halfway around the world in comparing this Congress, this body, with the Parliament in Iraq. And I know he likes to be cute and that is the way he is, but for him to stand halfway across the world before international cameras and international media and tout the fact that the Iraqi Parliament has passed 60 bills when, according to him, we haven't passed that many in this session of Congress to me is an outrage. It's not even factually correct. We have sent him 57 bills; he signed 55. We have passed several hundred bills in this House. 
   But the most important thing is look at what he has done. Look at the vetoes he has threatened, the vetoes he has actually made. He has already threatened to veto 10 out of 12 appropriations bills we passed in this body. After the committees in this body, both parties working hand in hand, have dealt with these issues and the budgeting for months and months and months, he says arbitrarily, they weren't my budgets, it wasn't what I asked for and, therefore, I'm going to veto them. 
   For him to criticize the United States Congress for not passing legislation is like the Vice President criticizing his lawyer friend for getting in the way when he shot him. I mean, if anyone is more responsible for retarding and obstructing the work of this body, it is the President of the United States and his party. And it happens day after day. It happens hour after hour. And the only reason it happens is because the Republican Party and the President of the United States have run out of initiatives. They have run out of ideas. They know the American people have rejected their agenda, and they are looking for a new direction, and they just simply don't want to see us succeed. 
   But that's not what we're here for. We're here to continue working. We're going to generate the type of grassroots support for what we've done. We know it's out there. We're listening to the people. They will be listening to what we're doing, and they will force this Republican Party and this President to move in our direction. 
   I am convinced that we are doing the right thing, that we are working, we are making progress for the American people. We will continue to do that under the great leadership we have in Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer. And I know eventually the Republican Party will come to their senses and they will begin to realize that the American people want us to act to solve the very demanding, the very challenging problems that face  this country. We are about that task. That's why we came here. That's what we will continue to do as long as we are here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman. 
   I would like to follow up on something to which you alluded because I think it's really important. This Congress has not only taken on a lot of new initiatives and has tried to deal with substantial problems that face this country and our people, but it has also made up for a lot of lost ground and a lot of inactivity in prior Congresses. And we hate to sound partisan around here, and I know the American people don't want us to be partisan, they want us to work together, and I think we have tried to work together and to reach out, but the fact remains that over the last 6 years the Congress did not do a lot of the things that it was supposed to do. We've seen the impact in a lot of ways. We've seen the impact on our budget, where we have increased the Federal debt, the national debt by $3 trillion, 50 percent over the last 6 years. That's because the previous Congresses were not doing their fiscal accounting the right way.  
   We've seen time after time, program after program, you mentioned veterans. We also had situations with education. We've had situations with health care where basic research that we were supposed to be funding has been cut. A lot of human services have been cut or zeroed out in past budgets. So we've not only had to take new initiatives, but we've had to make up for a lot of lost ground and programs that have affected a lot of Americans adversely. So we've had a lot to do. 
   And another area we've had a lot to do, and this is, again, something you alluded to, my colleague from Minnesota has alluded to, is that we've had to finally provide the accountability for many of the operations of government which have basically gone unsupervised for the last 6 years. We've seen it time after time after time. We've seen it in the reconstruction effort in Iraq. We've seen it in cases of fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid situations. We've seen it in the enforcement of coal mine safety rules. We've seen it in environmental regulations. Across the entire spectrum of government we have seen time after time where problems in the operation of government have basically gone unsupervised and unaccounted for.     
   We have taken steps to do that. I hope that the American people all have the occasion, for instance, to read the new Rolling Stone where there is an article about all of the subcontracting, the private contracting in Iraq, and the billions and billions of dollars which have been lost or essentially stolen by fraudulent activities by contractors in no-bid contracts and in sweetheart contracts given to friends of the administration. Nobody was looking at these deals until this Congress decided to take action and look at them. And now we have tried to implement new contracting laws and new supervision so that the taxpayers' dollars are accounted for. This is what the Congress is supposed to do. This is what we're doing. 
   Again, it comes to me as an incredible affront for the President of the United States to stand halfway around the world and say to the world that this Congress is not doing what it should be doing and that it is not functioning as effectively as the most dysfunctional parliament in the world, which is the Iraqi Parliament. I can't imagine what the American people would say if Speaker Pelosi or my colleague from Minnesota, or any one of our Members went to Australia or went to Iraq and compared President Bush unfavorably to Mr. Maliki. There would be an outcry unheard like anything in this country. And yet the President does it in Australia and criticizes this Congress. I hope the American people respond with the same degree of outrage which I think they would, and probably justifiably, if we were out there comparing him to Prime Minister Maliki. 
   I would like to expand on that a little bit, just for the sake of having fun, since the President likes to be cute and have fun when he makes these statements. Since he was so interested in the Iraqi Parliament, let's talk about what the Iraqi Parliament has done with regard to some of the benchmarks that they were supposed to make progress on. We're going to get a report from General Petraeus in a few days. But the Government Accountability Office has already given us a report on the progress of the Iraqi Parliament, the one that Mr. Bush seems to appreciate so much. 
   One of the benchmarks, enacting and implementing legislation on de-Baathification, nothing done. Laws were drafted, not passed. Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people of Iraq, none being considered by the Parliament. Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form semiautonomous regions, that one they did enact a law. Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an Independent High Electoral Commission, provincial elections law, provincial council authorities, and a date for provincial elections supporting laws, not enacted. Enacting and implementing legislation addressing amnesty, no law drafted. Enacting and implementing legislation establishing a strong militia disarmament program to ensure that such security forces are accountable only to the central government and loyal to the constitution of Iraq, no laws drafted. Nothing done. 
   So this is the great Iraqi Parliament that President Bush seems to appreciate when he is standing halfway across the world. The fact of the matter is, this Congress has acted. It has acted in so many areas that I am so proud to speak of and that my colleague has done such an excellent job of enumerating. But this Congress continues to work in education, in health care, in the environmental issues, and, yes, in Veterans Affairs, for the great heroes of our country to whom we made a critical promise when they decided to give their service. We had made a promise to them, and we haven't been keeping it. This Congress is going to make sure that we do keep it, even though prior Congresses and this administration is not. 
   So again, I am very proud of the record that this Congress has assembled over the last 8 months. I am, again, ashamed of the President of the United States for what he said in Australia. But I hope he will come back. I hope he will realize that his legacy is going to depend, to a certain extent, on how he reaches out to us and deals with us over the next 15 months. 
   The Constitution begins with article 1, which vests the legislative authority in this country in this body, not in him. Now, he doesn't seem to have read the Constitution. With 700 or so signing statements in which he said he is basically going to ignore what this Congress does with executive orders, vetoes, and virtually every other parliamentary procedure or technical procedure he can use to invalidate the work of this Congress, I think basically he has a lot to answer for, both to the American people and to us. The Constitution vests the legislative authority in this body. We are doing our job. We will continue to do our job. 
   I ask the President and the Republicans on the other side of the aisle and in the other body to recognize that this is our job. We are the ones mentioned by article 1. We are mentioned first in the establishment of this government, and I think we will continue to act first in the interests of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, President Bush continues to ignore reality in Iraq, instead glossing over the deteriorating situation while asking for more money from Congress and more personal sacrifice from our troops. 
   A report released by the White House in July claimed that progress had been made on eight of the 18 benchmarks mandated by the Congress. But a new, unbiased report from the GAO shows that the situation is even worse than the White House led us to believe. 
   According to the GAO report, Iraq has failed to meet all but three of the 18 benchmarks required for political and military progress in Iraq. Some of the report's most disconcerting findings include the fact that the capabilities of Iraqi security forces have not improved and that violence remains high. 
   Madam Speaker, with the release of this discouraging and objective report, Republicans in this body must decide whether to continue rubber-stamping the President's failed policy in Iraq or begin working with Democrats to bring our troops home.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and it's a pleasure to be here with my distinguished colleagues from the class of 2006 talking about the issues that confront this Congress and this Nation and also some of the issues that we have in dealing with the basic functioning of government, which is one of the reasons we're here tonight. 
   And I'm so happy that my colleague from Minnesota mentioned the President's statement that we were wasting time and doing many of these things. I can only think when I heard him make that statement, did he really think that maybe the Founding Fathers were wasting their time when they wrote the Constitution? Because the first thing they did when they wrote the Constitution was write article I, which established the Congress of the United States and vested all legislative powers in the Congress of the United States, not some of them, not those dealing with certain subjects, but all of them in the Congress of the United States. 
   And the reason they did that was simple. They had escaped. They had revolted to escape a dictatorial form of government when one person was the decider. We've had one person who thinks he's the decider in the White House, and we've had members of both parties who have been in the White House and felt that they were the deciders, but that's not what the Founding Fathers envisioned. 
   They envisioned a representative democracy in which people that they sent to decide how the government would affect their lives would make those decisions, and that's why they put article I first. That's why they created the executive branch in article II of the Constitution, and that's why when we act, whether it's to provide health insurance for kids, whether it's to provide resources for water projects throughout the country, whether it's to provide for the Defense Department for our soldiers, our brave men and women fighting overseas, for our veterans, whether it's when we try to create a new energy policy for this country, when we try to provide a sound and high-quality education for everyone in this country, that we're doing it pursuant to the powers, and not just the powers but the responsibilities that the Founding Fathers vested in this very body. 
   So, when the President says we're wasting time, I would beg to differ, because if we're wasting time, then the Founding Fathers wasted time when they wrote the Constitution. 
   And that's why it's so important that we focus not just on what we do here but why we're doing it and the fact that we are actually realizing the direction and the decisions made by those great men 220 years ago when they formed this Constitution that determines how we operate in this country and that has served this country so well for so long. 
   So I look forward to the next few minutes of discussion, and once again, I'm so proud to be here talking about how we're putting article I to use for the benefit of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman, and I have a button for the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas, and I look forward to giving it to her. I thank her for endorsing the type of emphasis that we're trying to place on this very important discussion of the balance of powers in this country. 
   You know, there's another element to this whole question, a balance of powers, and it really is reflected in the debate over the SCHIP program. Because while we debate, on the one hand, the actual legislative powers and  how we might enforce those through the courts and so forth, there's another competition going on, and it's the competition that goes on in the media and in the public dialogue. And here is where there is an inherent advantage for the executive branch. And I think part of the reason why, over the last few decades, the executive branch has been able to accumulate far more power than the Constitution and the Founding Fathers envisioned was because it is much easier for the President of the United States to use the bully pulpit, as we call it, and dominate time and the news media and the television, and it's much harder for the Congress to do that since we are a body comprising 535 men and women.     
   But what's interesting about it is that when you use the bully pulpit and when the President uses the bully pulpit, you hope that he uses it in an honest way, and, in fact, in this debate what we have seen is a performance that has actually been very insulting to the concept of a pulpit, I think, because what this President has done is used his bully pulpit, his media access, to deceive the American people about what we are doing and what he intends to do. 
   For instance, he is constantly saying that the proposal, the legislation that we passed would enable families making $83,000 a year to access the SCHIP program. No families making $83,000 were authorized to make it or, in fact, ever found access to the SCHIP program. The only way that a family making more than double the poverty level can get entrance and access to the SCHIP program is if the executive branch gives them a waiver. In fact, the State of New York asked the President for a waiver. He declined it. So for him to then say under this program people making $83,000 would be eligible for SCHIP is not only not true, it is deceitfully dishonest. And, actually, if you talk about what he has done, he has the power, which we delegated to him, he has the power through the executive branch to waive some of these requirements. 
   And that goes back to the interesting thing about this entire debate. In 2004 during the Presidential campaign, President Bush actually campaigned for an expansion of the SCHIP program. He loved the SCHIP program. He applauded it when he was Governor of Texas and he wanted to expand it. Now what does he do? Because it's not a Congress dominated by his party, he wants to change his perspective. He's changed his perspective as to whether the States should have waiving powers, which he wanted the States to have when the Congress was run by the Republicans. Now that Democrats control the Congress, he wants there to be Federal standards which he controls. 
   So this is not just a battle of power internally in the Congress and through the courts but also one that we have to fight in the media. We are at a disadvantage, but I hope it is discussions like this and people who are not afraid to be outspoken and point out dishonesty and deceit when they see it that will help us even the playing field in terms of convincing the American people that not only does this Congress have the power, by virtue of article I, to make all legislative decisions, but it also has the moral foundation and the integrity to do what's right for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, some years ago I heard someone say that the secret to life is how you handle plan B. That resonated with me because so few things in this world go exactly as planned. Tragically, for the 3,300 American soldiers who have lost their lives in Iraq, there will never be a plan B. And for more than 20,000 other soldiers, plan B, sadly, will include a wheelchair, a prosthetic limb, a serious brain injury, or a lifetime of posttraumatic stress disorder. And the even greater tragedy is that the sacrifices of many of those courageous men and women could have been avoided had President Bush had a plan B in Iraq. 
   Many of us saw this coming back in 2002. It was evident that the President's team was either so brazenly self-confident or so badly misinformed that they never saw the need for an alternative strategy, and certainly not for an exit strategy. And now, 4 years after ``mission accomplished,'' there is still no plan B coming from the White House, only a transparent appeal to the national pride that we must win, without regard to cost or duration, and without the slightest understanding of what a victory might look like. 
   Last night, this body took an important step in the Iraq tragedy. We set a new direction for our effort because the President has refused to do so. We not only provided the resources requested by the President to ensure the safety of our troops, we added funding needed to fulfill our obligations to those troops who have been wounded in action, and to the veterans who have sacrificed so much for all of us. But more important, we have provided the framework for bringing our troops home. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I would have preferred a stronger measure. While I have never advocated a fund  cutoff as a way to end our combat activity in Iraq, I would have liked to have forced the redeployment of our troops out of harm's way as soon as reasonably possible. But as our extraordinary Speaker has said, we must not let our search for the perfect become the enemy of the good. And last night we passed a good and reasonable approach to ending the war in Iraq. 
   The President has said that he will veto this bill, and it is clear to me that after 4 years of refusing help or advice from anyone who has not bought into his policy, he is not about to welcome our assistance now. But he should. This bill provides President Bush with the exit strategy he has never had, but which the American people so desperately want. He would be foolish not to sign it.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 months, the new Democratic Congress has amassed an impressive record of accomplishment, making real progress on issues important to the American people. 
   Last week, thanks to our efforts, the minimum wage was increased for the first time in a decade. We also sent to the President's desk one of the most important bills of the new Congress, legislation that will make America safer by finally enacting the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Last week, the House also passed a farm bill that reforms our Nation's farm policy by committing more resources to nutrition and conservation programs, while also addressing the needs of our Nation's family farmers. 
   And our efforts continue this week. Today, we will live up to our promise to change the way business is done here in Washington when we pass the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Tomorrow, we will strengthen the health care safety net programs essential to our children and seniors. And then on Thursday we will pass a comprehensive energy bill that reduces our dependence on foreign oil and fights global warming. 
   Democrats are delivering results and doing it in a new way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, when President Bush vetoed a bill earlier this month that would provide health care coverage to 10 million American children, he said the spending was excessive. The bipartisan bill invested $35 billion more in children's health over a 5-year period. Three weeks later, President Bush announces that he needs $196 billion to fight the war in Iraq over the next year. If $35 billion for children's health is excessive, what exactly is his request for the war? 
   I know the President believes that Congress is his personal ATM machine, but article I of the Constitution says different, and we will not rubber-stamp his funding request for the war. 
   As we have in the past, Democrats will continue to exert pressure on the administration to change course in Iraq so that we can begin to bring the  troops home. There is no military solution to the war; yet the Bush administration refuses to put pressure on the Iraqi Government to enact the political reforms that are necessary to bring about stability in the country. 
   While we push the administration to change course in Iraq, we also remain firm in our conviction to pass the children's health care bill that covers 10 million American children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota, the distinguished president of our class, for yielding and thank him for the superb job he has done in leading us through this wonderful year that we are spending as new Members of Congress. 
   I want to start this segment by actually reading the first few words of the Constitution of the United States because too often I find that, as I go around the country and go around my district, the people have lost sight and I think many Members of Congress have lost sight of exactly what the Founding Fathers did 220 years ago. I think we are all familiar with the preamble of the Constitution, and it starts with those wonderful words ``We the people,'' those incredible words that actually go to the heart of what we are about as a democracy: 
   ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'' 
   Now, following those words, following that brief preamble, it says in article I, section 1: ``All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' 
   I think it's amazing to think back to what was going on in those formative years of our Republic in 1787. The country had just rebelled against a monarch in England, and when they were establishing a government that would reflect the hopes and dreams of the people who had gone through that incredible war of revolution against England, they decided to create a government in which the ultimate power would rest in the people. That's why they said at beginning of the preamble, ``We the people.'' They created in article I the representative body of government that we sit in today. They did that because they didn't want one person being the decider of everything that affected their lives. They wanted to vest the power to govern in themselves through their representatives in Congress. 
   And so we sit here as successors to that incredible legacy. And it is not only our power to do that vested by the Constitution in article I; it is our responsibility. We have an obligation to govern on behalf of our citizens, ``we the people,'' as reflected in our representation here. 
   I think those of us who were elected for the first time last November know that, yes, we were elected partially because of the war in Iraq, but we were also elected because the people of the country decided that they really wanted to make sure their voice was heard in Washington. They thought their voice was being ignored. They said this is our government. We are going to change it by sending people there who will listen to us and will put our desires into action through the legislative process. 
   So I thought it would be wonderful to call attention to the fact that article I does impose, again, not just these powers, but it also imposes responsibilities. And that's what we came here to do, and we recognize that. We want everyone in Congress, both parties, to share in this acknowledgment of what our responsibilities are under the Constitution. I am so proud to have with me tonight and so proud to serve with wonderful people who are committed to the same ideals. 
   I would like to recognize BETTY SUTTON from Ohio, one of our wonderful new Members, to elaborate on article I and what we are doing to realize and to fulfill our responsibilities under article I.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I want to thank my colleague. 
   Before I introduce another one of our esteemed colleagues from the class of 2006, when you talk about your observations after having gone to Iraq, and many of our colleagues have gone, sometimes I think people get the impression that we're just acting like any other pundit talking on television. But, in fact, what you're doing and what the other Members of our body have done when they go to Iraq is to fulfill their responsibilities under article I. Because article I says that Congress shall have the power to provide for the common defense, it says to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a Navy, to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, and so forth, to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining, this is the militia. But all of these powers and responsibilities are given to the Congress not just to say okay to the President, the Commander in Chief, but to make the decisions as to what the appropriate levels of support for those various responsibilities are. 
   So when we talk about going to Iraq to assess the situation there, to talk to our troops, that is not just to go for a matter of curiosity or journalistic curiosity, it's actually to fulfill our responsibilities because we are responsible to make decisions as to what appropriate levels of support are. 
   And with that, I would like to call on my distinguished colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).

   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my distinguished colleague from Ohio. It is kind of interesting, because since we are going back to the kind of legislative history of the Constitution, in the Federalist Papers which do constitute, I guess, whatever official legislative history there was, one of the things that James Madison wrote in article number 51 was, he said, ``But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department'' which would be the executive or the Congress ``consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.'' 
   So when you talk about the efforts of the White House, in this particular case, to withhold information that the Senate requires, and we issued subpoenas, which would be our constitutional means of requiring the information to resist the encroachments of the other branch of government, we have been stonewalled on a number of occasions. And this is the type of activity that the Founding Fathers anticipated. They gave us the constitutional means to resist those encroachments. We need to continue to recognize those and to use them whenever we have to. 
   Now, my colleague from Florida has been standing there for quite a while.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I would like to recognize my colleague from New Hampshire with a question. And that is, we are about to engage in a fairly contentious series of votes concerning appropriations measures. According to article I, section 8, one of the most important powers that this Congress has is the power of the purse. As a matter of fact, in another Federalist Paper, number 58, James Madison said that, ``This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress from every grievance, and from carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.'' 
   As we look forward to our deliberations and our discussions of the appropriations process, I would like the gentleman from New Hampshire to discuss our responsibilities in that regard.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of California at Santa Barbara men's soccer team on their 2006 National Collegiate Athletic Association championship. 
   After a tough, hard-fought game, the Gauchos of UC Santa Barbara claimed the 2006 NCAA championship by a score of 2-1. 
   I would also like to congratulate the UCLA Bruins, the opposing team in the final game, on a well-played season. The Bruins had a season record of 14-6-4 and had three players named to the NCAA All-Tournament team. 
   Although the UC Santa Barbara men's soccer program appeared in the championship match twice in the last 3 years, this is the school's first men's soccer title and the university's second Division I title in athletics. 
   They accomplished many successes this year beyond the NCAA championship. The men's soccer team also won the 2006 Big West regular season championship and had a record of 17-7-1. The team was led to victory by head coach Tim Vom Steeg, assistant coach Greg Wilson, assistant coach Neil Jones, and goalkeeper coach Erick Foss. Also assisting the team was the UC Santa Barbara director of athletics, Gary Cunningham. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again congratulate the student athletes, coaches, and the University of California at Santa Barbara on their 2006 men's soccer team's achievement.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE CARDINALS FOOTBALL TEAM FOR THEIR 2007 ORANGE BOWL VICTORY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to commemorate the University of Louisiana Cardinals' first BCS victory, and I can hardly believe the words coming out of my mouth. 
   To say that this moment was unthinkable to the football world 25 years ago is an understatement. After decades of lost games and revenue, the Cardinal football team was on the verge of packing it in for good. Denny Crum had won a national championship and had just taken the basketball team to its third Final Four in 4 years, and for a town and school that had grown accustomed to winning, faith that next year's football team would be different became harder and harder to come by. 
   But then athletic director Bill Olsen found a believer in the most unlikely of places. Fresh off a national championship and Orange Bowl win of his own, Howard Schnellenberger returned to his old hometown to resurrect the Cardinal football program from the burial ground of college never-had-beens. And he did just that. 
   In only 10 years at the helm of the University of Louisville, Coach Schnellenberger tripled the number of bowl wins in the school's history and laid the foundation for the program that John L. Smith and Bobby Petrino built into a perennial winner, which this year earned a trip to its ninth straight bowl game. 
   The ascent of the Cardinal football program emblemizes a ubiquitous spirit at the University of Louisville, not just in athletics but in all programs, in all walks of life. 
   When the FDA approved the first completely effective cervical cancer vaccine last year, it was two scientists from the University of Louisville, Ben Jenson and Shin-je Ghim, who were credited with the discovery. 
   At Louisville's Jewish Hospital, U of L faculty performed the first three successful hand transplants in the United States and implanted the world's first successful artificial heart. 
   And 3-year-old Chase Ford became the first child to regain the ability to walk after a spine injury, thanks to the work of U of L researcher Susan Harkema. 
   U of L also ranks first among major research universities in National Institutes of Health funding growth and just became the only higher learning institution in Kentucky to promise a debt-free education to students from low-income families through their landmark Cardinal Covenant program.  
   This spirit of success was exemplified by Orange Bowl MVP Brian Brohm, who never failed to live up to the tremendous hype that followed him to the school. His dedication to his team and his hometown grew all the more evident when he chose to bypass an NFL draft in which many predicted he would be the first player chosen so that he could continue his dream of playing in a Cardinal uniform. 
   Receiving 10 of Brohm's passes in the final game and tying the Orange Bowl record, Harry Douglas also captured the spirit of Louisville all season long and set the single season record for receiving yards at U of L with 1,265. 
   These two, along with a committee of skilled runners and receivers and an unmovable offensive line, created an offense that seemed to score at will. Coupled with an impenetrable defense led by Nate Harris, William Gay, Amobi Okoye, and special teams anchored by Art Carmody, the Nation's best kicker, they formed the greatest football team in the history of the University of Louisville. 
   While the Orange Bowl victory is unprecedented in our community, it epitomizes the dedication, work ethic, and success that we in Louisville have come to expect from our flagship university. 
   I stand here today to commemorate one win that served as a exclamation of a stellar season, but the victory is far from fleeting. This Orange Bowl and this 12-win season serve as a benchmark of long-term success; and as athletic director Tom Jurich hands the reins to new coach Steve Kragthorpe, there is no one left in the football world who is not confident that he has handed him a winner.     
   For the players who personified greatness on the field and the coaches who led them, for the program that defied the odds, producing the greatest team in its history, and for the university that consistently acts an example of excellence, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H. Res. 82, commemorating the 2007 Orange Bowl champion, U of L Fighting Cardinals. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, this week Congress will vote on an all-inclusive energy package that will lower gas prices for consumers and put money back in taxpayers' pockets. 
   The Democratic energy plan will require oil companies to pay royalties on leases they have had for years but never paid to use. Big Oil has raked in record profits, the largest in American history this year, while Americans pump hundreds of dollars into their gas tank. It is time Big Oil pay American taxpayers the $15 billion it owes all of us for drilling on the American people's land. 
   For years, Washington Republicans have been showering Big Oil with tax breaks and subsidies. With the big oil companies amassing record profits every quarter, they certainly don't need this corporate welfare. The Democratic plan will repeal these giveaways to the big five oil companies and invest money in renewable money and programs, like LIHEAP, that will help Americans heat their homes this winter. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic energy plan helps Americans who have been suffering from George Bush's failed energy policies for far too long.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, we will work our way through our current financial crisis, but we must not forget how we got to this point. Essentially, George Bush's friends have been playing Monopoly with America. 
   I am sure everyone has played Monopoly; it is all about taking money that is given to you and making more money. The players roll the dice, then buy up hotels and railroads and, yes, houses, largely on credit, so they can take money from other players. The problem with Monopoly, as it is with our economy over the past couple decades, is that the players never have to worry about people or the communities in which they live. 
   Madam Speaker, we have allowed our economy to evolve in such a way that the missions of many of our largest corporations are no longer in alignment with the goals and dreams of our citizens or in the best interests of our society. Like Monopoly, their only goal is to make and end up with the most money. 
   Madam Speaker, we must use the people's power to prevent George Bush's friends from continuing to roll the dice and play Monopoly with America. Then we will have an economy and country that works for everyone.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, by overwhelming majorities, the American people are demanding a change of course in Iraq. After 5 years of a failed Bush administration strategy to bring peace and stability to Iraq, the American people are fed up with the way that is jeopardizing our national security, our military strength and our Nation's fiscal future. 
   The American people no longer listen to the President when he says the situation in Iraq is improving. And they received more proof last week that the President's new way forward strategy, the so-called surge, is only inflaming Iraq's civil war. Casualties among U.S. forces have surged and the political process in Iraq has halted. The President's policy has produced few results on the ground, and yet he is asking both the American people and the Congress for more time. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush has had 4 years to make his policy work, and the situation is not getting any better. It's time that we get back to fighting the real global war on terror so that al Qaeda does not continue to gain strength in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Senate has a chance today to follow our lead, listen to the American people and begin bringing our troops home.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Madam Speaker, in a week when our hearts are heavy with the weight of yesterday's tragedy at Virginia Tech and the anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School, it is important that we also remember America's tremendous capacity for selfless acts of goodness. 
   I refer to a spirit that sets aside superficial desires in favor of the needs of our fellow human beings, a spirit that shows our Nation at its best, the spirit honored during this National Volunteer Week. 
   Last year, as has been said, more than a quarter of Americans dedicated their time to bettering their communities, inspiring by example and improving lives. 
   I am fortunate to represent a community in which passionate leadership and dedicated citizens have enacted community service projects on every scale throughout Louisville. Just during our recent recess, I think a picture has been painted of what people are willing to give to others. On one morning I joined more than 3,000 volunteers of all ages as we embarked on a project to clean up across the communities in furthering the Operation Brightside movement. In visiting schools, we saw parents and grandparents volunteering their time to help kids. In hospital after hospital we saw people of all ages helping our sick. And also in one of the most moving experiences during my recess, two first grade classes at Coleridge-Taylor Elementary had decided to help the troops in Iraq. They went out and collected 200 pounds of candy to send overseas. These were sixth graders who saw the need to give of their time and energy to help others. It was truly an inspirational moment. 
   The great thing about volunteering is it is a way that you demonstrate your citizenship. We talk a lot about patriotism and citizenship in this body, but nothing demonstrates citizenship more than your willingness to spend your dear time to help others. 
   I hope this week does not stand alone in honoring our generous citizens and organizations. And I urge every citizen to join them in discovering the rewards that volunteering has to offer. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 293.

I want to take a moment to extend my thoughts and prayers and those of my constituents in Louisville, Kentucky, to the students and faculty, friends and family at Virginia Tech University. We stand with you today in outrage and mourning, seeking answers and sharing your loss. 
   I rise today in strong support of the Taxpayer Protection Act. Our tax system is tailor made for accountants and those who can afford to hire them. For those who must tread tax season alone, a dearth of regulation opens these citizens up to Internet scams and identity theft. A lack of easily accessible information ensures that money-saving provisions like the earned income tax credit go unnoticed and unutilized, costing Americans hundreds or even thousands of dollars. 
   The Taxpayer Protection Act changes that, turning a bureaucracy designed for accountants into a system made for Americans. This bill will ensure that Americans who benefit from the earned income tax credit are those who deserve it, not only those who are shrewd enough to find it. 
   Over the last 6 years we have seen a tax system that has worked very well for the extremely rich. I urge my colleagues to pass the Taxpayer Protection Act.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, President Bush is out of new ideas. Instead, all he has left is blatant fear-mongering, a strategy that his administration has elevated to an art form. 
   This time, it's the expiration of his Protect America Act that has the President warning of dire consequences, even though his own administration admits that our intelligence community continues to have every tool it needs. Fortunately, the American people are not buying into the administration's latest scare tactics. 
   It's pretty difficult for the President to now decry the act's expiration when he threatened to veto a 21-day extension earlier this month. If the law was so critical to national security, you would think that the President and congressional Republicans would have done everything in their power to ensure that it didn't expire. 
   If Washington Republicans were seriously concerned about the future of the FISA program, you would think they would want a seat at the table as important negotiations continue. Instead, both the administration and Republican leaders have refused to negotiate. 
   Mr. Speaker, no wonder the scare tactics aren't working.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the eight American heroes from Louisville, Kentucky, who were taken from us in the prime of their lives these last 5 years. 
   While they did not serve together, they all shared a special bond of selfless dedication, love of country, and  immeasurable courage. Those noble qualities did not originate when they volunteered to serve in the Armed Forces, but their time serving greatly enhanced and magnified those attributes. In his service, each man proved the valor time and time again, readily meeting every challenge that confronted him with loyalty and devotion. Tragically, and long before we were ready to say good-bye, these brave souls made the ultimate sacrifice while fighting for the United States of America, seven in Operation Iraqi Freedom and one in Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom. 
   Still, for all they shared, these men were also characterized by a wonderful individuality: an incredible athlete and officer, a great dad who would have been a great coach, a third generation warrior called to heaven before he could answer another call to preach the Word of God, a peacekeeper in Bosnia who wanted to come home to Louisville and continue to keep the peace in his hometown, an EMS worker known for empathy, an unflappable National Guardsman, a decorated military officer, and a poet and performer who could light up the stage and brighten your day. 
   Some of these men were known for their sense of humor, others by a sense of purpose, and with each of them, their fellow servicemembers knew they could be depended upon in the most dire circumstances. The men we honor today saved lives, and every one of them is an American hero. 
   Some of them spent a short time in the military; others spent half their lives in the service. And all gave their lives for this country, for our history, for our citizens, and most of all, for our future. 
   We are, each one of us, poorer for their loss but infinitely richer for the time they spent on this planet and the contributions that they made to our community and this Nation. 
   For the families who lost a son, a husband, a father, and for the many who lost a good friend, this is a wound that time can never fully heal. The grief we all share for their loss is not fleeting and demands a memorial of equal permanence. In recognition of these great heroes, I am proposing legislation to rename the Hikes Point Post Office the Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office in my congressional district, the Third District of Kentucky. 
   As our friends, neighbors, and I conduct our daily business in our community, this building will stand in testament for the tremendous sacrifice made by eight brave Louisvillians. When their families see the memorial, I hope they are reminded they are not alone in their grief, not alone in their appreciation for the deeds of these men, and not alone in the celebration of the lives of eight extraordinary individuals who gave us everything they had in their short time on Earth. 
   Sergeant Michael Acklin II, Captain Clayton Lee Adamkavicius, Lance Corporal Robert Lynch, Sergeant Darrin K. Potter, Sergeant First Class Christopher Phelps, Staff Sergeant George S. Rentschler, Petty Officer Third Class Jeffrey L. Wiener, and Sergeant David Neil Wimberg. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in offering these men this honor which will have the same permanence as their positive impact on our country, by renaming the Hikes Point Post Office the Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, in this great land of opportunity, wealth should not be a prerequisite for education, and it should not be a prerequisite for future success. For too many hardworking and qualified Americans, a college degree is the key to a successful career.     
   And for millions more, that education sends them so deep into debt that raising a family is impossible. The College Cost Reduction Act will respond to this injustice with an unparalleled commitment in higher education. 140,000 students and families will save more than $200 million on tuition costs in my home State of Kentucky alone. 
   We've heard a lot during this debate from our colleagues on the other side throwing the word around of ``entitlement'' as if ``entitlement'' is a dirty word. And I will grant that over the years, some entitlements have not been particularly productive, but entitlements can also be significant investments in not only human capital but in the future of this country. 
   And in this particular instance, what we are saying is we are going to make a dramatic step not just to improve the lives of millions of young Americans, but also to make an investment in their futures and the future of this economy. And if we don't do it, the great disparity in wealth between the most wealthy people in this country and everyone else will continue to grow, and we will face an economy in which we are not developing the type of talent that will keep this country at the stature that it has always maintained. 
   So I am firmly against and urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. I strongly support the College Cost Reduction Act because this is ultimately an investment in our future as a country, as a great nation, and the future of many Americans who without this help will be destined to a mundane future, which will mean that our country will result in the same state.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the University of Central Arkansas. 
   The University of Central Arkansas has gone by a handful of different names over the years, but its strong commitment to higher education has remained consistent. The University of Central Arkansas had its humble beginnings in 1907 as the Arkansas State Normal School with only 105 students. The school started as an entity only to train teachers, but now that school has diversified in a way that its founders would be proud of. The University of  Central Arkansas now has 100 undergraduate courses of study, 33 master's degrees programs, and three doctoral programs. 
   The University of Central Arkansas enrolls students from each county in Arkansas, students from 35 States, and students from 55 foreign countries. With current enrollment of over 12,000, the University of Central Arkansas has conferred more than 52,000 degrees in its 100-year history. 
   Madam Speaker, I am glad to see another outstanding educational institution continuing to serve those who wish to advance their education.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise for the first time in this body in support of American working families. 
   Teddy Roosevelt first suggested that all hardworking Americans should earn what he called a living wage. Today, a century later, millions of Americans have been denied his great vision due to baseless fear tactics involving unemployment and a slowed economy. But America's minimum wage was raised regularly for 60 years, and the economy grew, in no small part due to those actions. 
   Raising the minimum wage never led to unemployment. It always forced higher wages across the board, and it helped to forge a healthy and vibrant economy. 
   In my district, 30,000 men and women go to work every day working for minimum wage and come home to a life of poverty. It is our responsibility, our moral obligation, indeed, our great opportunity to ensure that all hardworking Americans have the opportunity to provide for themselves and their families. We have the unique opportunity to approach Teddy Roosevelt's vision that, for an American who works hard, a living wage is the absolute minimum. 
   I urge my colleagues to supports the measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, each year the number of jobs that require a college diploma grows. And with tuition swelling at the rate of 41 percent over the last 6 years, so does the number of capable and dedicated Americans for whom that training is simply unattainable. 
   H.R. 5 does more than save $4,000-plus for 5.5 million students annually; it offers a chance to those who deserve it most. These are students who have put in their work, have demonstrated the desire, and possess the intellect to go to college, but don't have the means. These are some of the best and brightest this country has to offer. These young people are the hope for America's future. 
   Opposing this legislation is to turn our backs on these bright young dedicated citizens, creating a young workforce that is saddled with unmanageable debt, and each year preventing 200,000 of them from going to college at all. By failing to make education affordable, we are telling them we aren't interested in them or what they have to offer. 
   The University of Louisville is among a handful of universities which have developed programs to help low income students who have demonstrated exemplary potential. Their cardinal covenant is an innovative and necessary initiative. Programs like these can be an excellent supplement to sound national policy but cannot substitute for our responsibility to ensure that the capable and dedicated are also educated. 
   We have the chance to act on behalf of our country and our young adults; therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (HONORING MUHAMMAD ALI ON HIS 65TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, and I want to also thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for allowing me to become a sponsor on this important resolution, also a fellow native. 
   Mr. Speaker, boxing gloves are a symbol of fighting for sport; but these gloves, because of the man who once wore them, symbolize so much more: fighting for justice, fighting for equality, and fighting for one's convictions. 
   My home district of Louisville, Kentucky, is known for a lot of things; and when you say the greatest, and particularly the greatest of all time, there is no question who you are talking about. 
   Larger than life now and one of the most recognizable icons throughout the world, it is easy to forget that long before he took his place as the best, and, as he would tell you the prettiest, boxer the world has ever known, there was a young, loud-mouthed speedster named Cassius Marcellus Clay, who despite his slight frame and humble beginnings, had an overpowering cockiness that immediately let you know that, whether or not he was destined for greatness, he was absolutely consumed by the quest. That flare inspired a lore that traveled quickly throughout our hometown. 
   In track and field, they say he won the mile easily and regularly, each time wearing steel-toed boots and running the second half backward. 
   They say on his way to Central High School each day he would race the school bus, being sure to stop at every traffic light lest he gain an unfair advantage over the school bus. 
   And when he finally began to shake up the world, winning Olympic gold at the age of 18, they say Cassius Clay furiously flung his medal into the Ohio River after his newly attained hero status did nothing to alter his second-class status in the racist South. 
   Whether or not these tales are the stuff of legend, the integrity of the message holds true. He was the fastest, most dedicated, most confident we had ever seen. Yet even after he had defeated the invincible giant and became the heavyweight champion of the world, he constantly felt the pain of prejudice and the heartache of racial hate. He turned down the opportunity to merely escape the situation, instead determined to change it. 
   He introduced dazzling quick footwork that even today has never been seen in a heavyweight and lightning left jabs that sent opponent after opponent falling to the mat. But he felt that his was a higher calling, and he chose controversy over comfort. 
   He became Muhammad Ali, and he used his success and fame to speak passionately and eloquently against injustice, racism, crime, illiteracy and poverty, touching and inspiring millions around the world. 
   As he was just approaching his prime fighting years, he was faced with a choice, betray his opposition to war and fight in Vietnam or sacrifice his career and face 5 years in jail. Twenty-five-year-old Muhammad Ali remained firm and was stripped of the title he had defended brilliantly for more than 2 years. 
   He had been knocked down, but he would not accept defeat. For more than 3 years, the former champ defended his name and appealed the decision, while simultaneously touring the country and world speaking tirelessly in the name of peace, justice and equality, now champion in a whole new realm. 
   With his peak fighting years behind him, a unanimous Supreme Court finally overruled previous decisions, granting Ali his conscientious objector status, and affording him the return that most of us thought would never happen. 
   What followed was not merely a comeback but an epic resurgence that featured the Fight of the Century, the Thrilla in Manila, and the Rumble in the Jungle. Ali recaptured the title by reinventing his style with the rope-a-dope in 1974, and in 1978 took the belt an unprecedented third time. 
   In the last two decades, Muhammad Ali has battled the effects of Parkinson's disease, and while the disease has proven a worthy adversary, it is simply not possible to defeat the man who once remarked, ``I oughta be a postage stamp. That's the only way I'll ever get licked.'' Since his diagnosis, he has appeared at countless events to combat illiteracy, poverty, and disease. He famously lit the Olympic torch in Atlanta, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was an honorary captain for the Louisville Cardinals in their Orange Bowl victory this year. 
   His mind remains sharp and his spirit strong. He is a hero. He is among the greatest icons the world has ever known, and I urge you to join me in commemorating his contributions to this country and the world on his 65th birthday.  
   I leave you with the words of the poet and Godfather of Rap, Muhammad Ali: 
  To make America the Greatest is my goal, So I beat the Russian and I beat the Pole. 
 And for the USA won the medal of gold, Italians said, ``You're greater than the Cassius of old.'' 
 We like your name, We like your game. 
 So make Rome your home if you will. I said, I appreciate your hospitality, But the USA is my country still. 'Cause they're waiting to welcome me in Louisville.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chairman, I rise on behalf of Mr. Klein of Florida and myself to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act, requiring Iraq to help support our troops stationed in their country. 
   Oil revenues have helped generate a multibillion-dollar surplus in Iraq that is expected to reach $180 billion within 3 years. Still, American taxpayers send $339 million to Iraq each day, money that can be invested here, as gas prices are soaring, education is lagging, health care is increasingly out of reach, and everywhere American families are struggling. 
   When the administration negotiates a Status of Forces Agreement this year, this amendment will require them to negotiate commonsense terms for Iraq to provide support for our military operations on their soil. This arrangement could be similar to the plan we have with South Korea, where they pay our security costs, or in Japan, which pays for 75 percent of the cost of maintaining troops and grants U.S. base rights. 
   Whatever the arrangement, this amendment would ensure that Americans no longer have to shoulder the burden alone. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must acknowledge that America's continued success will not be ensured unless we equip the leaders of tomorrow with the tools they need today. This means cultivating not just the most privileged and brightest students but the students who grow up with disadvantages. We must nurture the potential of all our children from the very beginning of their lives. We don't have one mind to waste or one citizen to waste. We need everyone to have the greatest ability and preparation to live productive, meaningful lives in our society. 
   For a million students, Head Start is the answer. For those who work hard but remain stuck just above the poverty level, the reauthorization of this program will give their children a chance to soar. I am proud to say that just as we did by increasing the minimum wage, doubling college assistance, and providing health care to uninsured children, this Congress continues to put working families first. 
   With nine in 10 Americans reporting no increase in income the last 6 years, cynicism has replaced hope for too many. We are in a position to restore faith in the future. And as we pass the  reins of our Nation to future generations, we must invest in that future by guaranteeing every child a chance to succeed. 
   I know that in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, thousands and thousands of young children have gotten adequate preparation for schooling that they might not otherwise have gotten because of the wonderful training they received in Head Start. It is not just a head start; it is a very strong foundation to success in education and success in whatever careers our young children may select. 
   So I'm proud to stand here in the House of Representatives, the people's House, and urge my colleagues to support a program which will help ensure that the people we represent are able to enjoy the prosperity and the happiness that our Founding Fathers hoped they would have. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Head Start and begin restoring faith in the future for millions of American families.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to be here speaking on behalf of the American people and the class of 2006, the class that was elected to Congress to change the direction of the country, and that's what we've been set upon to do during these last 14 months. 
   And I appreciate very much the comments of my distinguished colleague from Florida (Mr. Meek) and the great efforts he has made week after week to address the American people on the issues that are of critical importance to them. 
   We are going to talk tonight about the budget resolution as well because this is, above all things, the fundamental responsibility of the House of Representatives, the United States Congress. This is how we deal with all of the tax revenue that we generate in this country and how we essentially steward the funds of the population that depend on us to make good judgements for them. 
   And I'm joined tonight by my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Kagen) who has been a frequent participant in these sessions and someone who joins with us in our commitment to making life better for all Americans, making this an economy and a society that works for everyone and not just for the wealthiest. 
   There are lots of ways to frame budget debates, and there's always a risk that we get much too deep in numbers and we get way too deep in the weeds, and we don't talk about the big picture because the big picture is what most Americans want to deal with. They want the small picture of how it affects their daily lives. But they also want to know what we're about here, what our goals are, what our ambitions are for the American people, what we are trying to do as we work through this $3 trillion budget that we have to do each Congress. 
   And it's been interesting to sit and to stand and to listen to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, those Members who have been in charge of this body and in charge of the Federal budget essentially for the last 6 years and even in the Congress before that for another 6 years, and listen to them try to frame the issues in ways that understandably try to benefit their position. 
   But it's fascinating to listen as they talk about our budget, and somehow, because we don't plan to keep all of the Bush tax cuts in effect ad infinitum, that that somehow represents a tax increase. 
   And I have to remind everyone when I talk about issues that you remember what the Bush administration did and this Congress did when they enacted these tax cuts. They basically provided a sunset. They provided in the legislation that these tax cuts would end, and the reason they did that was because they wanted to be able to project somewhere out in the future that there would be a balanced budget in spite of the fact that they knew they were destined for huge deficits. 
   So they put a sunset, they put an end on those dates. Just as if you were in a business and you say, Okay, for 2 days only we are going to have a sale. We are going to give you 30 percent off. And that's the terms of the deal. So you come in on the fourth day and you say, Wait a minute. I want to pay that lower price. And the store says, Wait a minute. No. This was two days only 30 percent off. So you didn't raise the prices. You can't argue that we raised the prices. This was the way the deal was set up. 
   So now they're trying to have it both ways. They're trying to say we provided a tax cut, most of which went to the very wealthiest Americans, and now we are going to, because you are not willing to extend that tax cut, you are going to raise our taxes. No. We are going to end that two-day sale. 
   But what is really more disturbing than anything else, and I listened earlier to one of our colleagues from Wisconsin, one of your colleagues, Mr. Kagen, that when he was talking about what this budget would mean if we did not extend the Bush tax cuts, it said the average American would have their taxes raised by $1,000 or $1,200 or $3,000 when, in fact, that is kind of the magic of numbers and what you can do with them. Because if you take someone who is making $10 million a year and you raise that person's taxes by 4 percent, which would be essentially restoring the maximum tax rate, pre-Bush tax cut rate to that person, and then you average it over thousands of people, yes, you are going to get an average tax hike of $1,000 per person. But the average American, the average person who is making $30,000 a year is not going to see his or her taxes increased at all under this budget. 
   But you put that person with the person who's making $10 million a year whose taxes might go up a couple hundred thousand dollars, you average all of that in, yeah, you can come up with an average tax increase on all Americans. But that's not the way it works, because the average American will not have his or her taxes increased under this budget. The average very wealthy American will have his or her taxes increased. 
   But that's the way we play games with numbers around here, and it's very disturbing. 
   So it's important that when we discuss these important issues, $3 trillion worth of Federal budget, $1 trillion dollars, essentially, that this Congress has to deal with in discretionary funding, that we be honest, that we be candid, that we paint the accurate picture for the American people and what it means to them.  
   And I would like now to yield to my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin who I know is very much focused on what this budget does and every budget does for the people he represents, everyday Americans in his district. So I'm proud to yield to my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Kagen).

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my distinguished colleague. 
   He raises an important point because there are two different types of expenditures that we make in this Congress and that everyone makes. You can spend money that basically goes down the drain and never yields any kind of positive return, or you can invest money that pays back in manifold times over the years. 
   I know that I call my colleague Mr. Kagen; in fact, he is a physician. I should say Dr. Kagen. I raise that because one of the things that the President's budget did, it would do if we were to enact it, which of course we won't, but is to cut funding for the National Institutes of Health. It seems to me that we're facing, as a country, this enormous exposure financially over the next several generations because of health care costs. We can try to tax our way out of it, raise more money to pay for it; we can try to use cost containment measures, which probably are not going to be that effective because every time you try to cut down on what you spend for health care, you reduce access to it; or we can invest money now in the type of research that will cure the very diseases that are going to cost us the most down the road. So if we spent $20 billion and we're able to cure cancer within the next 5 years, that would save us trillions of dollars long term as a society. The same with diabetes, the same with almost every disease we can mention. Yet the President's budget reduces funding on an inflation basis from the last year's budget. This is the type of thing where we should be investing more money because down the road these will pay off, not necessarily for us, in fact, but for our children and future generations. 
   It's the same way with energy and it's the same way with infrastructure. These are the types of investments and expenditures which this budget, the Democratic budget, emphasizes. This is our focus. And this is the type of expenditure that the President's budget  ignores. And that represents a very fundamental difference in our approaches. 
   Clearly, we have one big elephant in the room. I don't say that in partisan terms. I will use gorilla. We have one big object in the room, and that is our expenditure in Iraq. If we continue to spend $150, $170, $200 billion a year in Iraq, that is money that doesn't represent an investment. It represents money being flushed down the drain. That's something that we have a serious policy dispute with and that's a very controversial subject around the country, but it's the type of expenditure that is keeping us from doing the type of investment that will yield returns down the road. 
   I'm very happy that my colleague mentioned infrastructure and investment because that is where we're going to have to focus our activity, our attention. Because unless we do that, we are destined for the same type of borrow-and-spend society and economy as opposed to an invest-and-reap-the-reward society that we can have otherwise. 
   We have a fundamental debate with our colleagues from across the aisle and with the administration in the White House and we're going to have to continue to fight this until we can convince the American people that the long-term approach, investing in people and infrastructure and research, are the answers to our long-range problems. And the Republican budget, the President's budget, is something that takes us in the wrong direction. 
   With that, I would ask my colleague to respond to or react to those comments.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Thank you. This is kind of a tangent, but it's important to mention because we hear from the other side so many times, I think from the Presidential candidate as well as so many Members, that the answer to the health care crisis is to give families a $5,000 or so tax credit so they can pay for their health insurance. You've framed the issue extremely well; how many families of moderate income can afford to pay? The $5,000 tax credit doesn't mean anything when their health insurance is costing them $14,000 a year. First of all, they don't have the money to spend, so they probably are not paying a lot of tax to begin with. A tax credit is kind of a myth. It's just something that maybe sounds good, but in the real world doesn't work. 
   But you also mentioned a very important element to this, and that's the issue of education. The President and the Republicans have continued to underfund education in this country at almost negligent amounts for a number of years now. 
   We just had a press conference a few weeks ago in my district because we were able to get enough money, a Federal grant to provide scholarships for 500 citizens of my district that would enable them to get an associate's degree. We calculated the amount of increased earning capacity based on that $1 million worth of scholarships and it ended up being $13 million worth of increased revenue earning capacity based on a $1 million investment. Because if you take somebody from a high school degree and you give him or her an associate's degree, all of a sudden their income potential increases by 50 to 100 percent. You're talking about over a lifetime of earning capacity, $250,000 to $300,000 just for that small investment. 
   These are the types of decisions that we have to make, that we're called on to make in these budgeting processes. And I think that represents the real distinction between our party and the party that has controlled this House up until 2007. They want to spend money in very different ways. We want to invest tax dollars to improve the lives of those people who can really generate increased activity in the economy, increased earning.     
   Just on the basis of the question of stabilizing Social Security and Medicare, if you increase somebody's salary from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year, you've doubled their contribution to Social Security. You've doubled their contribution to Medicare. This is the way we dig ourselves out of the hole that we have been in. It's to make sure that every American is earning a decent living and, therefore, can contribute to these programs. It's not to  sit there and say we're going to continue to give Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and many of the wealthiest Americans in this country tax breaks and hope that somehow that results in a better way of life for every other American. 
   I think we have seen enough of trickle-down economics. They tried to sell us that under the Reagan revolution. They've tried to sell us that under two Bush administrations. I think the American people finally realized that that's not the answer to our economic problems and that's not the answer to our economic future. 
   We have seen, and not just in New Orleans with Katrina, that when you have trickle down, unfortunately, it doesn't lift all boats. It drowns a lot of people. And that chart demonstrates, as vividly as it can be demonstrated, what has happened in this country under trickle-down economics. We have drowned those people who are represented in red. Their boats didn't float. Our position is we want to make sure that everybody has the right kind of boat so that when the storms come, they're floating with everybody else. 
   And I think that is something that the American people are catching on to. I think that's why every survey of American attitudes, when you ask people, Who do you trust more to handle the economy, taxes, education, health care? they have said, We prefer the Democrats by substantial margins now. 
   That doesn't mean we're off the hook. That doesn't mean just because people think we have the right answers that we don't have to respond and that we don't have to perform. But I think they have recognized that the other answer is empty, and they have said, we put our faith in your philosophy. We put our stock in you. Now perform for us. That's what we're trying to do with this budget. That's what we hope to do as we move forward into the 111th and 112th and 113th Congresses. 
   I'll yield to my colleague on that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my colleague. And as we wind down, I want to do two things. One is to thank him for dinner, because that was very nice of him to be willing to stand in for me, not that I couldn't have paid, but he was generous enough to treat tonight; and, secondly, to talk about the concept of unity and community.  
   And on the dais to my colleague's right, there are several terms inscribed in that dais, but on my far left the term ``union'' is inscribed. And that's really what I think we have lost track of and lost awareness of in this country, that we are part of something that is very special. But it is a union. It's not 300 million individuals out on their own. 
   And we had an interesting hearing the other day in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and basically the subject was on the subprime mortgage crisis, but it was also related to CEOs' salaries. And I'm not sure it was quite a good idea to combine the two, although they do provide kind of a stark contrast in which many of these companies, namely, Countrywide, had lost lots of money, and yet the CEO had left the company and was still making millions of dollars, $37 million he left the company with. 
   But we also had the former chairman of Citigroup, the CEO of Time Warner, the former CEO of Merrill Lynch; so we had some of the giants of American industry there. And the topic of discussion kept alternating between the subprime mortgage crisis and also the question of CEOs' salaries. And it occurred to me, as we went through this discussion, that many of these CEOs make tens of millions of dollars a year in compensation, much of it related to stock options that they are given, so their compensation ultimately is related to their stock price. 
   And as the conversation went on, it finally came my turn to ask questions. And I addressed these giants of American industry, and I said, I can see how in a comparative market situation that the CEO of Citigroup, which is a $35 billion company, may be worth $10 million a year in salary. I don't have any complaint about that. And even if you lose money in a particular year, I mean if it hadn't been for the talents of the CEO, you might have lost more money; so maybe that was justified. 
   But what the American people see is CEOs making tens of millions of dollars, at the same time feeling, if not knowing explicitly what's on that chart, that their standard of living, even though they are working as hard as they have ever worked, is not improving. And if they are working for one of those companies at a relatively average position, while they are working hard, their standard of living is staying the same and the CEO's salary is increasing. 
   And we all know the data about the disparity between CEOs' salaries and their employees' salaries. It's gone from an average of 30 times in the early 1970s to now 400 or 500 times. And it doesn't matter whether you lose money; they still make these huge salaries. And I asked them, When you have these meetings in your compensation committees and you're deciding and discussing the salaries of your CEO and your upper management, is there ever a conversation or have you ever heard of a conversation that related to how you might improve the lives of your employees, how you might stabilize the communities where your businesses are, how you might help to make this country a better place, or is all the conversation related to how you get the stock price up? 
   And the retired chairman of Citigroup said, very candidly and honestly, No, we only talk about share price. I said, That's a very unfortunate disconnect between what I think we all think is the objective, the ambition of this country, this Union, which is to make life better for everybody, to create jobs, to have everybody realize the American Dream, and yet our largest corporate citizens are only thinking about how they raise their stock price. 
   And I wonder, and I hope to be able to pursue this conversation with other CEOs of big corporations as I serve my terms in Congress, Do you ever talk about raising your standard of living of your employees? How do we get their wages up? How do we improve their benefits? How do we improve their health care situation? How do we stabilize that community and what can we do? And I know there are companies out there who are great corporate citizens. I have some in my own district who do that.     
   But if you don't have the corporate mentality that thinks about the same goals that the American people have, then we have a problem in this country. And I am not exactly sure how to go about it. But I know that the policies that are represented by our colleagues on the Republican side and by this been White House have been ones that say, we're going to do everything we can to facility that strategy of letting those companies do whatever they need to do to jack their stock prices up, and meanwhile we hope that it helps everybody else. 
   And I think that our budget says that we are not going to rely on just an abstract hope. We are going to take steps to invest in the American people, to put money in education, to put money in health care and to put money in infrastructure that will allow those people to make sure they improve their own standard of living. 
   So, we are going to have this debate for a long time. We will have it in this particular context in this budget debate, but as we go forward in this Congress, and in future Congresses. And I look forward to it because I think that the American people want us to do everything we can to help them realize their individual ambitions, and, again, to make ourselves a better Union. 
   So with that, I would just like to ask my colleague if he has any closing remarks, and then we will let everyone go home.

And as I close, I just what to repeat what I have said to many people, and that is that it is such a great honor to be in this wonderful group of people, men and women, elected in 2006, because most of us came to Congress well past the age of 50. We came because we had done what we wanted to do in our professional lives or our business careers, and we said we wanted to make a difference. 
   We weren't here because we expected to spend 25 or 30 years in Congress. We didn't want to be professional politicians.

And nobody is a better example of that than my colleague from Wisconsin, and I thank him for joining me tonight. I look forward to further discussions as we move forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (PROVIDING FOR ADOPTION OF H. RES. 979, RECOMMENDING THAT HARRIET MIERS AND JOSHUA BOLTEN BE FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS, AND ADOPTION OF H. RES. 980, AUTHORIZING COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY TO INITIATE OR INTERVENE IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE CERTAIN SUBPOENAS -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the distinguished chairwoman from the Rules Committee, a native Kentuckyan and someone who has always stood for the finest traditions of this body. 
   In November of 2006, the American people decided to give the Democrats the control of the House of Representatives and the Congress. I was fortunate enough to be elected as one of the 43 new Democrats in that class. 
   And many people have said, in examining that election, oh, we were elected because of the war in Iraq. But that's not what I heard. What I heard when I was campaigning in 2006, and I think most of my colleagues in this class would say the same thing, is we want to return the Government to the tenets of the Constitution. We want to restore the checks and balances that the Founding Fathers prescribed. We want to make sure that this President and every President is held accountable, is not above the law. 
   So when we came here, one of the things we did was to start talking about article I, which established that all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. We started wearing these buttons, article I buttons, and we offered them to Members of both parties, hoping that this would not be a partisan issue and not be an expression of partisanship but, instead, a respect for the integrity of this institution. 
   Unfortunately, most of my colleagues on the other side chose not to wear these buttons. They have chosen to make this a partisan issue in spite of the fact that during the last 6 years before we took control of the Congress, no subpoenas were issued against this President. No efforts to hold him accountable were made, in spite of the fact that in the prior administration a thousand subpoenas were offered by the Republican Congress to the Democratic President.  
   So, unfortunately, this has become a partisan issue when it shouldn't be. To me this is all about institutional integrity, about restoring the checks and balances. 
   Fundamental to our power, legislative power, is our ability to gather information. If we do not stand up for our right to gather information, then in spite of the fact that my colleagues on the other side have said we may lose our prerogatives if we go to court, if we don't challenge the President on this issue, we will have surrendered our prerogatives; and that is the worst fate that we could commit this body to. 
   So I would say, in closing, that many people look at polls today and say the standing of the Congress is at its lowest ebb ever, and they say maybe that's because we are not doing anything. I think it's because the American people recognize that we have been negligent in not upholding our responsibilities under the Constitution. 
   This is an important step in restoring the integrity of this institution and restoring the confidence of the American people in this body in its willingness to respond to the dictates of the Constitution.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, House Democrats are fully committed to ensuring that the FISA law is focused on giving the intelligence community the tools it needs to protect our national security at the same time protecting the constitutional rights of innocent Americans. 
   We've already passed the RESTORE Act, which modernizes FISA, to address these two critical needs. Today, congressional leaders continue to negotiate differences between our bill and a bill passed by the Senate earlier this year. If congressional Republicans were really concerned about our Nation's national security, you would think they would be sitting at the negotiating table ensuring their concerns are addressed. They've been asked to join the talks, but to date they have refused. 
   And National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell says that the President is holding up the legislation in order to get blanket immunity for the telecommunications industry. 
   Madam Speaker, congressional Democrats are committed to strengthening our intelligence community to keep our country safe. And we urge Republicans to put aside partisan politics and work with us on this important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I want to thank my freshman colleagues for the very insightful and compelling arguments they raised concerning our budget, the budget proposal by the President for the 2009 fiscal year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will say that what we are dealing with here is a situation in which those of us who were elected in 2006, freshman Members, so known as the majority makers, came to this Congress because the American people in that election of 2006 thought that the country was going in the wrong direction, and it wasn't so much one thing, I know a lot of people think that we were elected because of the war in Iraq, and certainly that was a factor. 
   I think more than anything else, the American people collectively decided that the priorities that have been established by the administration that was in office, beginning in 2000, we were taking the country in the wrong direction, that we were spending money, that we were emphasizing things that did not represent the best interests of the majority of the American people. They sent us here, therefore, to set a new pattern of doing business, a new way of setting priorities. 
   They wanted us to put the American people first. They wanted us to recognize the true needs of this society, to recognize that government is a way of reorganizing and organizing our responsibilities to each other, that we could, as a government, actually create an economy that worked for everyone and not just for a very few, but that we could, again, set the country on a different direction, that we could use the tax revenues that were flowing to the Treasury to empower all people to make the best of their lives, to contribute to a more dynamic society. We really have set a different direction in this Congress, and I think we need to do much more. 
   But let's think back to 2006 and think about what the American people were confronted with when they looked at Washington. They looked at Washington and they said, we have a government there that is arrogant, that tends to favor the richest people in the country, that tends to favor global corporations, that thinks that if we allow the wealthiest and most powerful people to do as well as they possibly can financially, that there will be a trickle-down effect and it will, quote-unquote, float everyone's boat, and that this is what the proper role of government should be. 
   The American people said, no, we don't buy that. We've tried that. We tried it under the Reagan administration. We saw then that trickle-down economics does not work. We tried that for a few more years under the Bush administration. We found that, no, that doesn't work because, in fact, what we have seen is that from 2001 to 2006, 100 percent of the income growth in this country accrued to the benefit of the top 5 percent of the population, that, in fact, 95 percent of the people in this country did not see their standard of living increase despite the fact that they are working harder, they are working longer. 
   The average family has been working, the average household, 95 hours a week. That's two people working more than full time and still not getting ahead. So the American people said to us, we want to go in a different direction. We think that government can be a tool for progress, it can be a tool to create a society that distributes its benefits more broadly, and that we ought to take the position that rather than trying to let this trickle-down theory flow to everybody's boat that we ought to make a society in which everybody has a really good boat, and that everybody can swim on their own. In fact, the way to create a society that truly works over the long term is to empower every individual to be productive, to contribute to society and to have the power and the freedom and the support to improve his or her way of life. 
   Now we are confronted, once again, with a budget from the President of the United States which does exactly the same thing that they have been trying over and over and over again with very  little success. We have a budget, deceitful in many ways because it pretends to reach a budgetary balance when it really doesn't, and they do it by very deceitful mechanisms, but it sets the wrong priorities. 
   It takes the money away from programs and policies that actually do empower individuals to improve their lives, to make a better society, to make a stronger economy, and it sends the money once again to basically nonproductive activities. We have, once again, a budget that minimizes and disguises the cost of our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of us differ very strenuously on our priorities in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We all understand that we have some serious problems in Afghanistan, and we need to focus there. We also understand that we are spending $3 billion a week in Iraq, most of which we will never see. It never represents any investment in our future. It is money that is down the drain. 
   When you try to compare the benefits of our tax dollars being spent again to promote a vibrant and healthy economy and to help people who need to get their feet on the ground to become productive citizens versus spending money overseas in ways that do nothing to enhance our own standard of living, that we know we have a skewed sense of priorities. 
   That's what we are going to talk about for the next few minutes, and I am very proud to be here with one of my freshman colleagues, someone who is passionate about the need for this country to work for everyone, someone who is as passionate about working for working families as anyone in this Congress, John Hall from New York. 
   I am proud to be his colleague, and I would like to recognize Congressman Hall to further this discussion.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I want to thank my colleague. 
   He referenced the annual profit of ExxonMobil that was reported last week. And I was struck last week on February 1, when I looked at The New York Times on the online version, the list of the headlines of the day, and I thought it was striking because I think it painted a vivid picture of where we are in this world and in this country. The first story was, ``Microsoft Bids $44.6 Billion for Yahoo,'' a lot of money, two corporations vying for each other. 
   The next story, ``U.S. Economy Unexpectedly Sheds 17,000 Jobs,'' the worst jobs report in several years. Then, ``Dozens Killed in Worst Baghdad Attack in Months,'' then ``Kurds' Power Wanes as Arab Anger Rises'' and, then, finally, ``ExxonMobil Profit Sets Record Again.'' 
   I think that was just an incredibly vivid picture of where we are in this world and where this economy stands and how out of whack the priorities of this administration have become. That's why I am so thankful that we are, at least, in control of this House of the Congress so that we can help to set the priorities of this country on a much more sound course.  
   I know that I have had so many opportunities to stand on this floor and discuss these issues with my colleague from Florida (Mr. Klein). I am proud to recognize him now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. One of the things that is most disturbing to all of us is when you hear deceitful discussion of the financial situation of this country. We sat and listened to the State of the Union address in which the President said if we were to not renew the tax cuts that went into effect in 2001 and 2003, that the average tax increase for an American would be something like $1,200 a year. That is a very clever way of saying what the average tax increase would be. The problem is that the average tax increase would be very large because you are taking all of the people who are making a million, $5 million, $10 million a year, and if we reinstituted those tax rates prior to 2001, the 39.6 percent tax rate, some people at the very highest level would pay $40,000, $80,000, $100,000, $2 million a year more in taxes. So when you average that with the normal taxpayer, yes, it comes to about $1,200 a year. 
   If you phrased it another way, and that would be the average American taxpayer would have his or her taxes increased by, it wouldn't be $1,200, it would be like $40 or $50, because the average American working family earns $55,000 a year. And that family, if we did not extend the Bush tax cuts, would see their taxes raised by a very small amount. The people at the higher end would pay a lot more taxes. So the average tax increase, yes, it would be a  lot, but the average taxpayer would not see his or her taxes increased. Of course, we are not proposing that in any event. 
   We have been talking that when we do revisit those tax cuts that we look at the highest income levels. But the point is, when we are getting all of these projections from the administration about what would happen in future years, as my colleague said, if we fix the alternative minimum tax and don't pay for it, and we don't have that additional revenue, yes, we can underestimate the deficit that we will be experiencing during those times. We can make the projections look good 4, 5 years out into the future, but that will not be the case. 
   One of the things I would like to talk about because Mr. Klein mentioned this, the cost of interest on the national debt, which has increased by an extraordinary amount. According to this budget, it would be $4 trillion just since 2001; $4 trillion based on a $5.7 trillion starting point. So we basically have almost doubled the national debt, the entire history, 220 years of this Nation, we have almost doubled the national debt just in the last few years. 
   But here is where we really get a vivid depiction of what this means. We are talking about interest on the national debt of $300 billion a year. The entire expenditure on education from the Federal budget is $100 billion a year. Veterans care is less than that, and homeland security even less than that. This is what has happened to the priorities in our budget because of the irresponsibility of this government over the last 7 years. 
   So this is what we are talking about. This is what we are confronting, and this is why I think all of us in the majority party in the Congress say we need to speak honestly, openly, and intelligently about what confronts us, about the challenges that we face, but also about what has happened over the last few years. 
   All we ask of the administration is be honest about what you are saying, what you are telling the American people. We will have a legitimate debate with you and discussion about where our priorities should be. But first and foremost, we need to be talking about things in absolute terms and be honest and transparent as we discuss how we are going to spend the taxpayers' dollars. 
   I am also proud to be joined tonight by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), the president of our freshman class and a great spokesman for the working families of America.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my colleague and want to yield again to Mr. Hall from New York. But before I do, I just wanted to add that, again, sitting and listening to the State of the Union address and talking about the honesty that we need to have when we have this discussion, and all of a sudden the President for the first time in this State of the Union address takes on the question of earmarks. And all of a sudden he's critical of the Democratic Congress because we had 11,000 or something earmarks. But he never said a word for 6 years while the earmarks expanded to somewhere in the realm of 16,000. 
   Now we can have debates over earmarks. I happen to think, as my colleagues mentioned, that there are some very valid reasons to have earmarks. And I think they have been demonized probably unreasonably. But all of a sudden the President finds fiscal religion this year under a Democratic-controlled Congress when he was silent for 6 years. And the same is true of his passion now for balanced budgets when over the first 6 years of his administration with the Republican-controlled Congress, he never issued a veto, never threatened a veto of any spending bill as we accrued $3.7 or so trillion more in debt, and he was silent. 
   All of a sudden now you have to suspect that the only reason is partisanship. That's what we're trying to get away from in this country, and that's what we are trying to get away from as we discuss the priorities of the country. Because, as you said, we're interested in where the rubber meets the road, programs that help the American people, doing the best for the American people and not necessarily what means doing the best for a particular party. 
   I think what we're seeing, as you mentioned, in the turnout in voters in primaries throughout the country is that's what American people want. They want people who are going to deal with our problems and not deal with partisanship. 
   With that, I will once again recognize my distinguished colleague from New York (Mr. Hall).

   Mr. YARMUTH. I appreciate him mentioning the field of education because you can have, as I mentioned earlier, two forms of expenditure in government. You can have expenditures that are nonproductive, and one of those, I think, is the war in Iraq. Interest on the debt is another one, because there is no long-term payback to those expenditures. Education, investment in infrastructure, as Mr. Walz was discussing, those are the types of things that over the long run do produce increased revenues for society productivity, and they are the type of investments we need to be focusing on. 
   And when we look at this budget, the field of education, and I'm on the Education and Labor Committee and we are dealing with trying to decide whether to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act which is already $55 billion below its authorized levels in funding. And the President, once again, has no increases in funding for education in this budget, which means we fall further and further behind. 
   So while he called his act No Child Left Behind, where, in fact, we are leaving more and more children behind because we are not meeting our obligations to make the kind of investments in people and in an infrastructure that really will pay off over the long run. 
   And I know this is something that is an entire range of topics that Mr. Klein has dealt with and has had to set priorities in his own legislature in Florida, and I would like to yield to him to advance the discussion.

   Mr. YARMUTH. It's always wonderful to discuss these issues with my colleague on the floor. 
   And we have just a few minutes left. We have a fundamental decision to make in this country, and it is a basic choice, and that is what the role of government is, what the role of the Federal Government is. And on the one side, I think we have those that believe the role of the Federal Government is to get out of the way and to let whatever happens happen. And the other side, and I think most of us in this room would agree, that there is a legitimate role for the government to try to promote the type of progress through investments and the proper priorities that will make this a better country, and, basically, whether you believe government has a role in setting the direction of the country or whether it is basically just to get out of the way and let the most powerful people and the biggest corporations decide what is going to happen and let kind of a Darwinian atmosphere prevail. 
   So I would like to allow everyone to close briefly to whatever they have to say kind of related to that fundamental choice we face or to talk about the issue of priorities as we look forward to this budget process again this year.

And I'd like to end where we began, and that is that when these majority makers, our freshman class, was elected in 2006, we were elected because the country thought that the government of the United States had the wrong priorities, that we needed a new set of priorities, we needed a new direction. We've committed ourselves to that new direction. I think as we approach this budgetary process and all areas that we have to do, we will seek a new direction for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4926, the Josh Miller HEARTS Act. This is a bill that will save countless lives at a relatively low cost to taxpayers. 
   According to the American Heart Association, more than 200,000 Americans die of sudden cardiac arrest each year. Even more disturbing is the fact that 50,000 of these deaths could have been prevented with the use of an automated external defibrillator, or AED. 
   AEDs are portable devices used to restart the heart after sudden cardiac arrest. Studies have shown that these devices, which are required in Federal buildings and on airplanes, can be safely used by anyone, including children. Defibrillators talk the user through the lifesaving process and do not deliver a shock unless the heartbeat analyzed through the machine is in need of it.  
   Prompt response to a person experiencing cardiac arrest is imperative, and waiting for an EMS to arrive can be fatal. Utilizing CPR techniques and administering an AED can more than double the victim's chance of survival. A defibrillator shock is the most effective treatment for sudden cardiac arrest. Heart experts at Johns Hopkins University believe that over 500 lives can be saved annually with the widespread placement of AEDs. 
   The legislation put forward today will go a long way towards saving lives in our Nation's schools. This bill establishes a grant program to place lifesaving defibrillators in every elementary and secondary school that chooses to participate in the program. Additionally, the law would require recipients of these grants to train school staff in AED and CPR practices, coordinate with local paramedics, and integrate AEDs into existing medical emergency response plan. These provisions will save the lives of students, teachers, parents, staff and community members in U.S. schools. 
   On any given day, as much as 20 percent of a community's population passes through its schools, and it is our duty to ensure that these are safe places for kids to learn and community members to interact. Since schools are natural meeting places for the public, this bill can save the lives of countless children, teachers, parents and others. 
   Similar legislation has already passed and is making an important difference in States such as Ohio and New York. As a response to the tragic death of 15 year-old Josh Miller, Ohioans instituted a program to place AEDs in schools. Since the inception of the program in 2005, 13 lives have been saved by defibrillators. Similarly, the New York program, in honor of 14 year-old Louis Acompora, has saved 38 lives since 2002. 
   I want to thank families like the Millers and the Acomporas, whose hard work has brought national attention to this issue. They have worked through their grief, and fueled by the tragic loss of a child, have toiled tirelessly to keep other parents from experiencing similar losses. With passage of this bill, Congress has the opportunity to join with these families and prevent future tragedies. 
   Encouraging results and the many lives saved already demonstrate why we must pass this legislation. By putting in place preventive measures like these offered in this bill, we can save more lives. 
   Once again, I express my support for H.R. 4926, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act, which I introduced earlier this year. This legislation will reauthorize the sole source of Federal funding for at least 1 million young people who find themselves homeless or unaccompanied each year. Some of those children are born homeless, but most run away to escape mental, emotional or physical abuse. More than a third of them are victims of sexual abuse in the home. 
   Although they escape terrible conditions at home, for most, what is waiting for them on the street is no better. These youths are raped or assaulted at rates two to three times the national average, they are seven more times likely to contract HIV, and a third of them attempt suicide. For these young people, hope is a distant concept and the future is little more than a dead end. 
   The situation is bleak, but the solutions are within our grasp. My hometown of Louisville, thanks to organizations like Safe Place and Boys Haven, has set the standard for helping homeless youth find a home, get an education and rediscover their futures. 
   I invited Rusty Booker to testify before the Education and Labor Committee last year. Rusty, a fellow Louisvillian, ran away from an abusive home at the age of 12 and went through five different foster homes before finding his path at Safe Place. Rusty showed us that we have the answers, we have the tools to eliminate childhood homelessness and disconnection, but only if we choose to use them. 
   That is the opportunity we have before us today, because despite the tremendous work of our service organizations, the funds and personnel to accommodate the basic needs of our Nation's runaway and homeless youth are far short of meeting the demand and the required infrastructure is simply not in place. We need to do more than just contain these children while we have them. We must set them on a path to adulthood, prepared for the workplace and ready for the world, without dragging the dead weight of a history of neglect. 
   The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act will refocus our resources and give America a real shot at eradicating youth homelessness forever. Thanks to the groundwork laid in Louisville, the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act won't simply extend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act until 2013. It will provide significant improvements and much-needed expansions. 
   Addressing the critical funding shortfall, this legislation will dramatically increase the reauthorization for Runaway and Homeless Youth Act funding to $150 million per year, ensuring that the resources are in place for community-serving organizations to reach every child in need. 
   The bill will also increase the basic center program allotments for small States, make public entities eligible for street outreach program funds, establish grantee performance standards, and finally create a process for developing a national runaway and homeless youth research and evaluation agenda. 
   The progress that we have made in the past year is significant. In fiscal year 2007, 740,000 young people were helped by our HYA programs. But more significant will be the advances down the road. As we work to restore faith in this Nation's future, we must build an America where every child has a chance to learn, succeed, and at the very least have a place to call home. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, which will offer a chance and a childhood to millions of our most vulnerable citizens. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1243 which recognizes the contributions of millions of fathers in the lives of their children. This coming Sunday, June 15, is Father's Day, so this is an appropriate time to stop and commend the millions of fathers who serve as wonderful, caring parents for their children. 
   Fathers can play a special role in the rearing and development of their children, and I commend the millions of fathers across our country for devoting their time, energy, and resources to improving the well-being of their children. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to mention that this is not just a day for children to honor their fathers, or for adults to honor their fathers, it is also a day, I believe, for fathers to recognize the blessing that they have been given to mean so much in the lives of their children. 
   When I was a columnist years ago, I began writing columns about my son and being my son's father. What was interesting about them is each year that I did that, they were always the most popular columns that I wrote because they were human subjects that many people could relate to. 
   The first one I wrote, which was June of 1994, I wrote this: ``When I was growing up, I figured Father's Day was the day when I was supposed to acknowledge my gratitude for everything my dad did for me. Now that I'm a dad, I know it is really something much different. It's a reminder of how wonderful it is to be an important part of someone else's life, to shoulder responsibility, to love without conditions or expectations.''  
   So I want to make a personal comment that Father's Day is about being a father as much as paying honor to your father. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, once again I want to express my support for H. Res. 1243 that acknowledges the importance of fathers in the United States.

   In 1912 the National Safety Council was established by a small group of midwestern industrial leaders concerned about safety in the workplace. Since then, the council has broadened its scope to include the home, transportation and the community. Its membership has grown to over 18,000 companies spanning more than 33,000 locations. Altogether, the council represents 8.3 million employees across the Nation. 
   In 1953, a congressional charter was granted to the National Safety Council to lead the country in injury prevention through safety education and training. The council has had a great impact on the local level by providing a variety of community-based programs and services, including workshops, training, conferences, and by providing a local voice for safety and health education. 
   Through the efforts of the National Safety Council, more than 8.5 million rescuers have been trained and more than 60 million people have taken one of the NSC's defensive driving courses. It is obvious that the National Safety Council's programs have had a profound effect on our Nation, and they  deserve to be recognized for their continuing efforts. 
   The National Safety Council will commemorate this 2008 National Safety Month with their ``Make a Difference'' campaign. The campaign will work to educate the public on emergency preparedness, safe driving, poisoning and fall prevention. 
   Each year, accidental injuries cost Americans more than $650 billion. In the workplace alone, 16 workers die every day on the job. Far too many lives are lost and too many suffer because of preventable accidents. 
   Protecting the citizens of this Nation from these accidents requires the cooperation of Federal, State and local institutions, as well as help from the citizenry itself. Together, we can protect ourselves from accidental injury and death. This June we must encourage all Americans to take time to learn how they can help make this country safer. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again I express my support for the designation of June as National Safety Month. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the progress that has been made of late in the area of adult and amniotic fluid stem cell research is astounding. In my own district, the University of Louisville is curing paralysis in lab animals using adult stem cells. But with each new discovery, the scientists say the same thing: none of these areas of research can replace the vast unique and still unchartered potential of embryonic stem cells. 
   Politics interfering with scientific advancement is nothing new. In Louisville, public controversy was a major obstacle before our pioneering doctors successfully implanted the first artificial heart and performed the first hand transplant. Had the politics of the day prevailed, additional lives would have been lost and incredible progress halted. 
   Today, again on the cusp of discoveries that could save lives, we find ourselves at a similar crossroads. Will we aid progress or impede it?  
   And none--not one of the embryos in question could ever grow into a human life. The researchers are speaking exclusively of embryos that would otherwise be discarded. 
   We can no longer afford to let politics stand in the way of science and allow America to fall behind the rest of the world's medical advances, especially now as the research being conducted with embryonic stem cells holds the unprecedented potential to revolutionize medicine. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 3.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, the politics of fear are alive and well in the Republican Party. Despite the fact that the House and Senate are actively working to craft a strong new FISA bill, Republicans and the White House refuse to attend the negotiations. Instead, they're insisting that this House simply rubber-stamp a bill that was recently passed by the Senate. 
   The decision to boycott these negotiations shows that Republicans prefer a political is sue rather than a strong new FISA bill. 
   Democrats are hopeful that Republicans will consider their decision to sit on the sidelines and will instead join us in crafting a bill that protects our country while respecting the fundamental rights of American citizens. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats passed a bill in November that meets both of these criteria. Then, earlier this month, the Senate passed its own version. As is common procedure here on Capitol Hill, we are now in the process of negotiating the differences between the two bills in order to come up with the strongest bill possible. I would hope Republicans would want to remain relevant and would join us in passing the strongest FISA bill we can.

   ``My brother had a heart attack 2 years after she was diagnosed. A week after his heart surgery, he had a massive stroke which paralyzed his right side, and then he got a diabetic ulcer on his foot and finally had to have his leg amputated. 
   ``Needless to say, their medical bills were massive. They lost everything they had worked for their whole life. I take care of him now, and he needed to file bankruptcy. He needs a ramp to get out his front door, a safe way to take a shower, but there is no help anywhere. 
   ``I believe as an American citizen who has worked, paid taxes, and served his country in the Armed Forces, there should be some sort of help. I don't know what, but with all the intelligent people in Washington, it seems they could come up with some kind of plan for people like these so they don't lose all they have made.'' 
   That was Jonell Stinnett, one voice from Kentucky's Third District.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, it appears that the House Republicans are  operating from the same playbook as President Bush. 
   Over the first 5 months of this year, this new Democratic Congress has approved more than 45 key measures, most of them with strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, President Bush has been a stubborn opponent of our efforts to move this Nation in a new direction. He opposes or has threatened to veto 60 percent of the House's work. 
   The President threatened to veto a Defense authorization bill because he believed it gave our brave soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan too big a pay raise. His administration opposes a bill that would make college more affordable by cutting student interest rates in half. And he has once again threatened to veto legislation promoting life-saving embryonic stem cell research. 
   While the President has been obstructing our agenda for months, House Republicans have jumped on the bandwagon and are now delaying critical appropriations bills. Rather than obstructing the process, Republicans should join us in passing bills that will help us better secure the homeland and better serve our veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (ELDER ABUSE VICTIMS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008, which includes the ElderServe Act, which I introduced last May to protect our Nation's senior citizens from abuse through better coordination of services. 
   In my hometown of Louisville, for over half a century, we've seen first-hand as ElderServe Inc, a local non-profit, has facilitated the coordination necessary for thousands and thousands of seniors to have peace in their golden years. 
   One of the many areas that ElderServe has excelled is providing emergency services to seniors who experience physical or psychological abuse and neglect--problems that afflict more than two million victims nationwide. 
   Experts estimate that only 20 percent of all cases of elder abuse are reported. Still 70 percent of the caseload at Adult Protective Services comes from victims over the age of 65. These instances of abuse and neglect know no boundaries, affecting men and women across all racial, social, socio-economic, and geographic divides. And with the country's 76 million baby boomers approaching retirement age, the problems will only intensify if we don't create a network equipped to respond. 
   The ElderServe Act will create Emergency Crisis Response Teams, or ECRT's, that foster community collaboration between existing services and consolidating services for elder abuse victims. In most communities, victims of elder abuse have great difficulty navigating services and aid. But in Louisville, ECRT's have been incredibly successful in bringing various entities together to provide immediate help and services to elder abuse victims. The approach ensures that elder abuse victims no longer fall through the cracks and are given the housing, healthcare, and follow up they need. For those who cannot go to law enforcement, law enforcement will come to them. 
   The ElderServe Act authorizes the creation of pilot programs that will coordinate local law enforcement, short-term housing placements, bereavement services, adult protective services, legal advocacy services, job placement assistance, health care, and other services. 
   If the program is infused with same passion and care as we have seen in Louisville; if we provide necessary resources, we will have created a reliable place that a senior can turn to, anywhere in the Nation, to recover from and also to prevent elder abuse. 
   America's seniors spent decades working, contributing, and raising families in our communities. Yet each day thousands are assaulted or neglected, with nowhere to turn but an overtaxed, under-coordinated system. For many they receive help too late or not at all. Many give up waiting for help, and others never seek assistance in the first place. The ElderServe Act can change all that. I, therefore, strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Elder Abuse Victims Act and working to eliminate elder abuse forever.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (WELCOME BACK SIMMONS COLLEGE OF KENTUCKY -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of one of the most storied institutions in Louisville's rich history on this day of its rebirth as an independent liberal arts institution, as it was intended. 
   Shortly after the end of the Civil War, 12 forward-thinking former slaves gathered in Louisville, united by the understanding that education would be key to prosperity as free people in America. The institution of higher learning that opened its door 14 years later in 1879 was unique in its commitment to African American education. 
   While many similar institutions were the result of the efforts of white missionaries working to give recently freed people the advantages of American society, Simmons, known at that time as the Kentucky Normal Theological Institute in Louisville, was created in a collaboration that bridged the racial divide. Black Baptists and white Baptists, recently freed and those born of privilege, worked hand in hand in pursuit of equality in education. 
   Early leaders at the school came with impressive Ivy League pedigrees, but as the strength of the institution increased, they turned more and more to alumni that came from within. By the early part of the 20th century, it was difficult to find a finer education than that offered at Simmons College, earning it the nickname: ``The Black Harvard of the South.'' 
   Within four decades of its inception and a half century removed from slavery, Simmons embodied the dream and exceeded the expectations of the dozen visionaries who foresaw education as the tools for equality. Louisville's Simmons College was a liberal arts college of national renown. 
   But like so many others, the economic hardships of the Great Depression devastated the school. The properties succumbed to foreclosure and the institution lost its independence. Despite meeting tremendous adversity, the determination that led Simmons' inception and incredible ascent drove its journey onward. 
   For decades and under several names, the school continued to exist. Most recently, the school specialized in theology, expertly training pastors at Simmons Bible College at 18th Street and Dumesnil. 
   But, Dr. Kevin W. Cosby, the latest in a great tradition of Simmons leadership dating back to Elijah Marrs, William Simmons, and Charles Parish, has led the way to a full restoration of  Simmons' early success as, in his words, ``the mother of black higher education in the State of Kentucky.'' Through his work as president of the school and as pastor at St. Stephen Baptist Church, Dr. Cosby has worked to expand the school to its original home at 7th Street and Kentucky, where, in conjunction with the current campus, it will once again operate as a fully independent liberal arts university. 
   In this capacity, Simmons will again offer students from around the country a chance to realize their potential and excel, giving hope to those who need it. I applaud the vision and fortitude that Dr. Cosby has shown in restoring this indispensable treasure, which is not just a shining light in Kentucky's history, but to the Commonwealth's present and future as well. 
   I hope that it is Simmons, not recent decisions in Washington that could indicate a slow retreat from our strides in civil rights, that portends the course our Nation now treads. It is my great honor to stand on the House floor in recognition of the tremendous national significance and benefit of Simmons College of Kentucky and to say: Welcome back.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, as we pass the reins of our Nation to future generations, we must acknowledge that America's continued prosperity in the global economy will not be ensured unless we equip our children, the leaders of tomorrow, with the tools they need to succeed down the road. 
   To achieve this, we must cultivate not just the most privileged students, not only our brightest students, but also the students who grew up with disadvantages. Indeed, we must nurture the potential of all our children because it is in the best interest of our country to maximize the contributions and success of every American. 
   I recently visited a Head Start program at Indian Trail Elementary in my district in Louisville. The veritable beehive of activity there spoke louder than 40 years of studies on Head Start progress, but they said the same thing: The thoroughly engaged children were actively building a solid foundation for their futures, and they were loving the pursuit. 
   Like their predecessors, the 1,800 Head Start students in Louisville and the 1 million nationwide are making tremendous gains in family literacy, vocabulary, early writing, letter recognition, and social behavior, skills that will pay huge dividends in their future pursuits. 
   We have an opportunity today to extend and improve this program which is so vital to the preparation of today's youth, who in turn are critical to America's future. It is our moral responsibility and I believe our honor and privilege to reauthorize Head Start, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act. 
   Because America's Founders were freshly freed from the shackles of British oppression when they formed this Nation, safeguards against the consolidation of power into the hands of a few can be found everywhere in the Constitution, beginning with article I; 220 years later, we still must strive for those checks and balances in order to form the more perfect union the Founding Fathers envisioned. 
   For nearly 30 years, 1978's Inspector General Act provided much of the oversight required for our government to function as the Forefathers imagined, but today, some Inspectors General would rather impede oversight than conduct it. What else should we expect when we have no protections from the protectors? 
   We have unaccountable appointees in nearly every executive Department and agency, and many serve not to prevent corruption but to preserve it. These are not cases of individuals merely failing to fulfill their job descriptions, but actually instigating the waste, fraud and abuse the American people pay them to ward off. These unchecked appointees have hindered valid investigations, siphoned tax dollars for personal pleasures, and refused to uphold accountability for fellow political appointees. Honest civil servants who have dedicated their lives to improving our government are victims of intimidation, threats and termination. And despite these blatant offenses, our hands are tied. There is no line of defense for the American people. 
   We have gone far astray from the noble aims of this Republic. And let me be clear, this is not a simple case of a few bad apples. The abuses within the Inspectors General offices were invited by the cracks in a failing structure, and they will continue to grow unless we, in this body, take steps to fix the crumbling construction.     
   The Improving Government Accountability Act begins to correct these weaknesses and in so doing fulfills the intent of the Inspector General Act of 1978 and once again upholds the integrity of this Nation's proud creation. The Founders were very clear from the first article of the Constitution in which they granted all legislative powers not to an executive with a consolidated power, but to the Congress. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in utilizing the authority to preserve the checks and balances that our Constitution's crafters held so dear.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Lance Corporal Robert Lynch who was taken from us far too soon when he and two other Marines were killed in Iraq by an IED. In Louisville, the hearts of his family and friends are full of grief as they mourn this tremendous loss, but we are also full of pride as we celebrate the life of an American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice. 
   Robbie's heroism began well before his service in the Marines. At a young age, he conquered Tourette syndrome and became a charismatic joker, an eloquent poet and a caring and empathetic young man. 
   At Seneca High School, he enrolled in the ROTC as a freshman, becoming an instant favorite among the faculty and his classmates alike. In fact, to many, it seemed Robbie was friends with everyone, classmates, teachers, administrators, clerks, everyone. And in Robbie, or Jax, as he nicknamed himself, they had a friend who would send people into hysterics when times were light or cut through the tension with a joke that lightened the mood. In Iraq he used that sense of humor to keep up the spirits and morale of his fellow warriors. 
   But people were drawn to Robbie for more than his affability. Robbie was also the one you knew you could depend on, the one you would go to if you needed help, support or simply a friend. That sentiment was shared by the many at home who loved him and those who served with him in Okinawa in the 1st Battalion, 12th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force. 
   Robbie dreamed of going to Hollywood to sing. He wrote songs and poems that expressed, among other things, his passion for justice and freedom. Tragically, his devotion to service eclipsed his artistic aspirations, and that dream will not be realized. Still, his words remain with us, and I'd like to share just a few. 
   He wrote, ``I don't plan on being a hero to the world. I just want to try to help make it a better one.'' Clearly, Robbie underestimated himself, for in just 20 short years on the planet we are better for having him here, and he is a hero to us all. 
   Today I'm introducing legislation to rename the Fairdale, Kentucky, Post Office the Lance Corporal Robert A. Lynch Memorial Post Office, so that it may stand as a testament to his heroics and strong character. For his selfless devotion to all of us in the United States, he deserves our recognition and thanks. For their sacrifice, his family deserves our support. We are poorer for the loss of him but we, as a community and a country, are better off for the short time we had him. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me today in honoring Lance Corporal Robert Lynch, a patriot, a poet, and a good man.

   One of the most egregious offenses of his proposed budget this year is that, while he calls for nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy over the next 10 years, he once again refuses to fully fund our homeland security programs. In fact, his budget provides only a 1 percent increase, despite numerous unmet homeland security needs. 
   The President drastically cuts grants to first responders, State homeland security and firefighter assistance, and eliminates programs like local law enforcement terrorism prevention, staffing for adequate fire and emergency response, and metropolitan medical response. He even freezes funding to secure critical infrastructure needs like our ports, railways, and transit systems.

Unfortunately, in almost every other instance, President Bush has stood in the way of real progress. He refused to help us provide quality health coverage for 10 million children. He rejected our efforts consistently to change course in Iraq. And he has threatened to veto our appropriations bills that truly prioritize our domestic needs.

   While the President refuses to fund health care for our Nation's low-income children, he has no problem sending billions of dollars to Iraq with absolutely no questions asked. Today alone, the President will spend $300 million funding the occupation of Iraq. With that money, we could insure 246,000 low-income kids. Over the next month, the President will spend a whopping $9 billion in Iraq, which would allow us to insure 7.4 million kids. 
   Mr. Speaker, time and time again, congressional Republicans have approved blank checks for the President to send billions to Iraq, and now they are concerned about $35 billion for improving the lives of 10 million low-income children?

Unfortunately, the only solution President Bush and congressional Republicans come up with is more drilling. They ignore the fact that drilling in the U.S. has recently exploded. Since 2000, the number of wells that have been drilled in this country has increased by about 66 percent, while the price at the pump for the consumer has more than doubled. 
   President Bush and congressional Republicans also continue to push drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Again, they ignore experts who say that opening the refuge for drilling would produce only about 6-months' worth of oil and it wouldn't be available for another 10 years. How is that a strategy for lower prices today? 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats know that American families are feeling squeezed every time they head to the gas station. That is why we continue to pass legislation that should help ease the pain at the pump. It would be nice if the President would support these efforts.

   As the only member of the Society of Professional Journalists in Congress and as a former journalist, I fully understand how assurances of anonymity put a frightened insider at ease and turn a reluctant source into an eye-opening wealth of information. 
   At my newspaper in Louisville, we were able to open doors for the community on several occasions due to confidential accounts of protected sources which would have otherwise remained closed to us forever. Also, at Louisville, we saw what happens when we fail to protect a source's identity. There, Jeffrey Wigand, the famous tobacco whistle-blower, was victimized by threats and intimidation, ultimately losing his job, his family and his home. He is considered a hero today, but for many the lesson from that episode was, if you have incriminating information that will benefit the American public, just keep it to yourself. 
   The first amendment to the Constitution demands the right to free press. Now it falls on Congress to help facilitate that freedom pursuant to our authority vested in us by the first article of the Constitution. And speaking of article I of the Constitution, the article vests all legislative power in the Congress of the United States. It doesn't ask us to ask the White House first whether it approves of what we do. It actually imposes on us, not just the right, but the responsibility to legislate in the best interests of the country. And that's what we are doing with this legislation. 
   Without the Free Flow of Information Act, we, as a country, will be in the dark on certain issues, conscientious journalists will be imprisoned, and potential sources will remain tight lipped.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, last week Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, who led our forces in Iraq when the vast majority of the American public had yet to turn against the war, emphatically agreed with those of us who criticized the invasion and occupation from the start. In calling the situation a ``nightmare,'' Lieutenant General Sanchez referred to the ``unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership.'' 
   But from what I have seen from my seat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, with all due respect to the Lieutenant General, he is wrong. The administration isn't failing to implement the strategic leadership needed to bring peace to the region and protect our young men and women risking their lives in Iraq; they are refusing. 
   David Walker, U.S. Comptroller General, said that widespread corruption is robbing Iraq of the resources to develop the government and is funding the very insurgency we are fighting. Rather than working to end or mend this catastrophe, the State Department has instructed its officials not to cooperate. Instead of using the ``Stabilizing and Rebuilding Iraq'' report to rectify the problem, they classified it retroactively, giving the impression that honest information is seen by this administration as politically embarrassing rather than constructive. 
   Mr. Speaker, regardless of how they see it, they owe it to the American people not to ignore factors that endanger our soldiers, jeopardize Iraqi stability, and squander upwards of $18 billion due to corruption. In today's terms, that is 2 1/2 years of health care for 4 million children through SCHIP. But this isn't merely a case of ignoring crucial information. Our government is actually covering up the rampant corruption, which Inspector General Bowen has referred to as ``a second insurgency.'' 
   With article I of the Constitution, our Nation's Founders protected us against this abuse by calling for a representative government with all legislative powers vested in the hands of a Congress. By defying that mandate, the Bush administration is defying the American people. So I call on the President to return to those Constitutional principles by dropping the veil of secrecy and restoring the open, honest government envisioned by the Framers, demanded by the people, and depended upon by our soldiers. 
   Mr. Speaker, saying ``supporting the troops'' is one thing, but following through with actions is something entirely different. That means admitting our deficiencies so that we can correct them. For the 3,820 warriors we lost in Iraq, and for the more than 165,000 serving there today on the ground, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 734, and call on the administration to level with us and support our troops abroad.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, at a time when the American people are demanding a change of direction in Iraq, congressional Republicans are more than willing to provide the President another blank check to continue the status quo. 
   After 4 years of incompetent planning and bad projections, it is time that Congress hold both the Iraqi Government and the Bush administration accountable. And yet Republican leaders continue to say we should just give the President what he wants, no questions asked. That is what the old Republican-controlled Congress did six times. 
   Later this month, the House is going to have a choice: give the President another blank check to move ahead with the status quo in Iraq, or take the war in a new direction. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans Health and Accountability Act is that new direction. Far from being micromanagement, as many Republicans call it, this legislation sets policy for equipping our troops, policy for refocusing the war on terror, and policy for a responsible redeployment. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to seriously consider this change in direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2258, a bill to extend programs under the Higher Education Extension Act of 1965. 
   In addition to extending the current programs under the Higher Education Act for 5 months until March 31, 2009, the bill also makes a necessary technical correction to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act with respect to nonprofit lenders. This language will ensure the designation of a nonprofit lender will go to those that Congress intended. 
   During this Congress we have made significant commitments to our Nation's students and families by putting resources in the hands of those most in need. H.R. 2669, as passed and signed by the President, does more to help Americans pay for college than any effort since the GI Bill at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   Specifically, the legislation provided a landmark investment of $20 million in additional funding for Pell Grants, reductions in the interest rate on student loans, and the creation of programs to help students manage debt, as well as encourage individuals to pursue public service. 
   Providing this critical funding is a large part of our efforts to increase access on affordability to higher education. The next step is to work on policies that further support access and affordability, such as campus-based aid, TRIO, GEAR-UP, teacher education and the other programs that make up the Higher Education Act. 
   Additionally, we realize that millions of Americans are deeply worried about whether they can afford to send their kids to college or how they will be able to pay the bills while also paying off substantial student loan debt. Looking at how the Federal Government can assist in addressing the rising cost of college will also be a key part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 
   I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the other members of the committee to complete work on the Higher Education Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   LIHEAP, which provides crucial heating and cooling assistance to millions of hardworking, low-income families all across America, grows more important as fuel prices continue to skyrocket and we head toward another hot summer. Already families who qualify for LIHEAP spend, on average, a fifth of their income on energy costs. For hundreds of thousands of Americans, that figure will continue to rise until the electricity is simply shut off. 
   Still, rather than rising to the occasion, this government has backed away from our responsibilities to those families. Even as prices soar and LIHEAP applicants have increased by 20 percent, the average LIHEAP grant has  dropped by 20 percent, leaving millions without the full assistance to which they are entitled and millions more without any help at all. 
   In my hometown of Louisville, I hear from people who work hard every day with less to show for it. Seniors, who deserve to live out their golden years comfortably, now face the choice of paying for medicine, food, or energy. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting full funding for this crucial program so that millions of LIHEAP-qualifying Americans won't be left alone to face potentially life-threatening heat this summer.

We aren't repeating the same rhetoric day after day about opening up our pristine lands and waters to drilling only to save pennies per gallon in 20 years. Instead, we've offered energy solutions for today and for the future. 
   We pressured the President to stop sending more oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which could save about 25 cents per gallon at the pump. We also passed legislation cracking down on price gouging. And now we're calling on President Bush to begin releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   After 7 years of the Bush-Cheney energy policy, written by and for an oil industry raking in record profits, a plan to transition America to a new and more affordable energy future is long overdue. The American people are suffering now and are looking for solutions today. Republicans say we need to open more land for drilling, but the average American family will spend $57,800 on gas before that drilling saves them a penny.

This week, Ty Scroggins made history again, guiding Louisville's Central High School to the Kentucky 3-A Championship, becoming the first African American football coach to win a Kentucky State title. As alma mater to Muhammad Ali, Central is no stranger to athletic success. Still, it took a total team effort, led by Darrell Taylor's inspired rushing, to give the Yellow Jackets their first championship. 
   As the first predominantly and historically black high school to win the Kentucky Gridiron State trophy, their landmark win is a victory for a Commonwealth proud of overcoming adversity as we progress toward real equality. The school that began 125 years ago as Louisville Colored High School now sends 92 percent of its students to college. Renowned for economic excellence, successful magnet programs, and unique entrepreneurial opportunities, few schools so thoroughly prepare students for careers in business, law, technology, and medicine. 
   Four decades ago, Central gave us The Greatest. Today, the school continues to give us greatness. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Central High School, Coach Scroggins, and Kentucky's 2007 3-A football champs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, for too long, many of America's toughest challenges have gone unaddressed while massive debt was piled on the backs of our young generations. 
   Now, this Democratic-led House has proposed a budget that takes our Nation in a new direction and reaches balance in 5 years while lowering the deficit. By contrast, the President's proposed budget does not achieve balance at all, despite his promises to do so. 
   The House budget also puts in place pay-as-you-go spending principles, finally requiring our government to balance and prioritize spending the way all American families must do. Restoring fiscal integrity is not only good for the budget's bottom line, but it is also important in protecting our national security, since much of our Nation's debt is owed to foreign governments. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget resolution begins the process of restoring fiscal integrity to the leftover Republican mess of reckless spending and massive deficits. It is time for a balanced budget that meets the needs of American families without mortgaging our future to foreign interests.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, like my colleague from Kentucky, I rise to honor former Congressman Gene Snyder. Because we find ourselves both as a Congress and a country working to dig ourselves out of a divisive partisan trench, which in recent years has been characterized by petty attacks and contentiousness, my constituents may be surprised to know that I counted Gene Snyder as a friend. 
   Gene, who was always more interested in the public than publicity, told me a story about a persistent reporter who badgered him about a meeting he wanted to cover. Gene didn't want the reporter at the meeting and refused to disclose the location. So when Gene spotted the reporter in his rearview mirror tailing him to the meeting, Gene said to heck with it. He told his aide to head for the mountains, and led the reporter on a 100-mile wild goose chase through Virginia. 
   Now, as a former member of the news media, I won't applaud that tactic, but I admire the competitive spirit it exemplified. In any event, that was the last time that reporter tried to get the best of Gene. 
   Although Gene and I enjoyed each other's company, you would be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of issues upon which the honorable Gene Snyder and I agreed in the political arena. But political issues are only one part of this job, the other being serving one's constituents. 
   As far apart as we sat on the ideological spectrum, Gene Snyder's model of constituent service is one I aspire to closely emulate. In his three decades of service, Congressman Snyder set the example of how to serve a district. He set the bar, and he set it high. 
   When Gene held my seat, we in Louisville knew that we had a representative with an open door and an open ear for all of us. If it concerned our community, no matter, big or small, was unworthy of his attention. He welcomed us warmly, shared a laugh, and left us with a feeling that something would soon be done to address anything from a clerical glitch to the need for a new highway. Inevitably, and remarkably, for an age when distrust of a power-hungry government dominated, the issue would be handled effectively and expediently. 
   As I now work to institute my own open door policy, I am consistently cognizant that I follow the example set by a predecessor and a friend, Gene Snyder. I look to him has a fervent believer that democracy stems not from politicians, but from the citizens we represent, and I endeavor to capture that spirit as he did. 
   Gene Snyder was my representative, he was my friend, and he will be greatly missed. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring his life and service to his constituents.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of National Crime Victims' Rights Week, an opportunity to reflect on the need for victims to be treated fairly, commemorate the progress we've made, and acknowledge the work that remains before us. This is a week in which we rededicate ourselves to the challenges that lie ahead in the fight for critical rights for victims of all crimes. 
   I recently had the opportunity to meet Pat Byron, a woman from my home town of Louisville, Kentucky. Pat's daughter Mary was raped and beaten by her ex-boyfriend as a teenager. He was released from prison without Mary's knowledge, and tracked down the unsuspecting young woman in a parking lot; murdering her on her 21st birthday. 
   Because of the courage of Pat Byron and the leadership in Louisville, in 1994, the community pioneered VINE, Victim Information and Notification Everyday. VINE could have saved Mary's life, and for the last 13 years, it has saved many like her. This technology is now available in more than 2,000 communities in 41 states and guarantees a victim's right to notification and information. 
   Today, one week after the most brutal shooting in American history I urge my colleagues to join me and my community in standing up for victims, not only by commemorating National Crime Victims' Rights Week, but in taking steps like automated crime victim notification to ensure that victims' rights are protected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, the two people most responsible for our Nation's failed energy policy are the two oilmen in the White House--President Bush and Vice President Cheney. 
   From their earliest days in the White House, they surrounded themselves with other executives from Big Oil. As Newsweek reported in 2001, ``not since the rise of the railroads more than a century ago has a single industry placed so many foot soldiers at the top of the new administration.'' And when it came to actually creating an energy policy, Vice President Cheney met in secret with oil executives in Big Oil in the Vice President's home. 
   This administration admits that 95 percent of its energy policy has now been enacted, so let's take a look at exactly what it has produced. Over the past 7 years, gas prices have more than tripled, while for 5 straight years now the major oil companies have amassed close to $600 billion in profits. Meanwhile, our dependence on foreign oil has increased by 753 million barrels a year. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have rejected this failed policy and instead are working to pass legislation that will provide consumers relief while ending our dependence on foreign oil.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, every month this year our economy has shed more jobs than it has produced. Last month was no exception; 49,000 jobs were lost nationwide and unemployment rose from 5 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May. That is the largest 1 month increase in 20 years. 
   As job losses continue on a monthly basis, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the unemployed to find jobs, and it is expected to get even worse. That is why last month this Congress passed legislation to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks. 
   Today, more than 1 million people have exhausted all of their benefits. Washington should provide these workers some additional relief as they continue to pursue a job through these rough times. Yet President Bush and congressional Republicans oppose the unemployment insurance extension, even though they supported a similar extension in 2002 when economic conditions were not nearly as hard as they are today.  
   Madam Speaker, the May jobs report should serve as a wake-up call to President Bush and congressional Republicans to support our efforts to extend unemployment insurance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here once again speaking on behalf of the majority makers, the freshmen Democrats elected in 2006 to bring change to Washington and who have worked very diligently over the last 16 months to begin to reverse the damage done to this country over the last 7 1/2 years. 
   It is interesting, I was planning to talk about what I saw as a very encouraging sign over the last few days, the encouraging sign that we had actually solid bipartisan participation in trying to come up with solutions to some of the very daunting challenges that face this country today, including energy prices. 
   We had a bipartisan vote, an overwhelming bipartisan vote, to restrict additions to the strategic petroleum reserve, something which the President opposes but which overwhelming numbers of both bodies of Congress supported. And I was going to talk about the farm bill in which we had significant Republican participation in coming to grips with a new solution to our farm policy in this country. And I was going to talk about our housing initiatives, how we had significant Republican support last week in trying to craft policies that would help alleviate the serious housing situation we have and to try to keep things from getting worse. 
   But after listening to the partisan attack that I just heard, I have to respond because what we have heard is something that is almost in a parallel universe. It is interesting that my colleagues from the other side speak as if the last 7 or 8 years didn't exist, as if the Republicans weren't in charge of the entire government from 2001 until 2007, as if the national debt did not increase by $5 trillion during their stewardship of this government, as if earmarks had not been developed into an art form under Republican leadership. It is almost as if there is no history that they choose to remember. 
   I can understand why they don't want to remember what went on from 2001 to 2006, and before that many of the policies that were developed under Republican leadership in this Congress prior to George Bush's presidency because they don't want the American people to be reminded. 
   But we know from all of the polls and the voter turnout that we have seen in the last few months, we know that the American people remember what has gone on in these last few years. We know because, as we have seen in a poll over the weekend, when asked which party does the American people trust to deal with the challenges we face as a country, the American people prefer the Democratic policies by a margin of 20 percent, one of the largest margins ever recorded. It is not hard to understand why. What we have seen are failed policies from people well meaning, no question about it, but people who do not believe that government has a role in solving our problems. 
   We see it when people come to the government, when the average citizen comes to the government for help. We see them in our offices every day, and we talk to them at home on weekends. We know that the American people are hurting. They come to us for help. We know that nurses come to us for help. Teachers come to us for help. Social workers come to us for help. They are dealing with the pain of average American citizens every day, and we are trying to do what we can to help them. 
   We know that the other side does want to come to the help of American citizens from time to time if they happen to be the CEO of ExxonMobil, if they happen to be the CEO of Chevron, if they happen to be the insurance executives. Those people can always find assistance from the Republicans. But when the average citizen comes for help, no, no, no, we don't want to do that. Government is not in that business. 
   Well, that's why the American people turned to the Democratic Party in 2006 and said, We have had enough, it is time for a change. We believe that the Democratic Party can help working Americans solve some of the problems that face them. 
   I think we have made a very, very good start. From the very beginning of our leadership in the 110th Congress last January, we took steps immediately to raise the minimum wage which had not been raised in 10 years. We took steps to change the rules under which drug companies dealt with Medicare. We took steps to end the subsidy of oil companies with huge tax breaks when they are making more money than they had ever made in their history. We worked very diligently, and we talked about earmarks. 
   My colleagues on the other side want to make it sound like we invented earmarks, which we certainly didn't. We actually provided for the first time some transparency in earmarks. We said if you are going to put an earmark into a bill, then you have to identify that you sponsor that earmark and you have to attest and swear that you did not reap any personal benefit. You had no personal connection with the recipient of that earmark. Those were not the policies under the Republican Congress when they had in their last budget year 16,000 earmarks. No, you could slip them in there. Nobody knew you got the earmark. You could take credit for it if you wanted to, but if you tried to find out who gave money for XYZ, you couldn't find that unless the person actually took credit for it. We changed that. We required accountability in the earmark process. 
   So it is interesting to listen to my colleagues talk about the horrible leadership that they contend of this Democratic Congress as if the last decade had not occurred. I think the American people have seen through that. I think there is no question that the recent results, not just in polls but in special elections for Congress, reflect the fact that the American people understand that the Republicans are out of ideas. They just are out of ideas. The idea that government will play no role in solving some of the challenges that we have has proven to be a bankrupt idea. They persist in that philosophy, and they persist as of earlier today, and we have to call the attention of the American people that these are not the facts and that there is a very distinct difference between our policies, the Democratic majority, in which we are trying to use government to help the American people while maintaining fiscal responsibility, while maintaining our PAYGO rules so we make sure that we don't add to the Federal deficit and the national debt and that we pay for what we do when we do it. 
   Now, there is a huge exception to that policy, as we all know. We are going to see it on the House, on this floor in the next few days. We are being asked once again to allocate billions and billions of dollars to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are being asked by the President, who now has the lowest job approval in modern history, we are being asked by him to give him a blank check, once again no constraints on his activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, no restrictions on his troops, no new regulations regarding the deployment of troops, just give him the money and let him try to accomplish the mission which he said was accomplished 5 years ago but which has not only not been accomplished in 2008 but which is something, a mission which we still can't define. 
   I would like to ask the administration, and we have on many occasions, if you want our support, if you want us to continue to fund this failed policy in Iraq, tell us what the mission is. Tell us once and for all what the clear objectives are, and we will listen and we will use our judgment and see if that is the type of thing that the American people will support.  
   But as always, we still don't have a clear idea what the mission in Iraq is. It changes on a day-to-day basis. We are being asked once again to spend billions and billions of American taxpayer dollars for a policy which no one really can explain. 
   I think my colleagues, and several have joined me here now, are in the same situation as I am. On a daily basis I speak to people from my district, Louisville, Kentucky, and they say, we need money for this. We have been cut this way. We are going to have to cut services, why can't we just spend a little less in Iraq. Every day I get that question. I probably got it six times today. Why can't we take some of that money we are flushing down the toilet in Iraq and spend it on the American people who are in desperate need of the things that government needs to do. These are some of the issues we are confronted with today. 
   It is my great pleasure to be joined by two of my colleagues from the class of 2006, the majority makers, Mr. Keith Ellison from Minnesota and Dr. Steve Kagen from Wisconsin, and I am going to yield to Mr. Ellison and have him continue this discussion about what we in the majority makers and we in the Democratic majority are trying to do on behalf of the American people.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman. 
   I want to pick up on two of the things that he mentioned because I think these are fascinating contrasts and put into perspective some of the challenges that we face. 
   First, on the subject of oil prices and gasoline 
   prices, he mentioned that 300, the price of gasoline has gone up 300 percent since 2001. What's interesting is, when you look at what we're now paying in Iraq for gasoline, this is one of the truly astounding and very disturbing aspects of our involvement there. 
   And again, as my colleague, our colleague, Mr. Ellison said, we're going to be voting on more funding for the Iraq war tomorrow. The American people need to know that right now we are spending $153 million a month on gasoline in Iraq, $153 million a month. And we're paying $3.23 a gallon for that gasoline. It's probably up since then, but the time that we have the statistics, $3.23 we're paying for gasoline in Iraq. 
   Meanwhile, the Iraqi people, and Iraq is sitting on one of the largest oil reserves in the world, the Iraqi people are paying a subsidized cost of $1.30 a gallon. Now, wouldn't we all love to pay $1.30 a gallon? 
   Now, that's unrealistic, but it's interesting that we're paying for the entire reconstruction cost of Iraq, we have up to this point; we're spending all this money to try and stabilize their country, and we're paying $2 more per gallon for gasoline than the Iraqi people are. That's just one of the strange quirks of our involvement there.

And again, I referenced the fact that not only are we being allowed to, or being asked to write a blank check for hundreds of billions of dollars, as we've been writing for some time now, somewhere over $500 billion total in direct appropriations for the war in Iraq, but we're also being asked to give the Iraqi government a blank check; do whatever you want, no accountability, you get to it when you get to it, you'll decide when things are right for us to be able to leave. It's all up to you. We're helpless.

   Mr. YARMUTH. It's a reasonable question which we are addressing in legislation. And I think the American people are totally justified in demanding that the Iraqi people pick up some of the tab when they're running a $70 billion surplus per year. 
   And I was actually encouraged to hear one of the representatives of the government over the weekend talk about the fact that they intend to do that. But just their intentions don't seem to be much because, again, as you said, there is no accountability method in place. 
   But I want to reference one other thing. And it's getting off on a little tangent, but you talked about the merger between Delta and Northwest, and that's being examined by the Transportation Committee now, and I'm glad it is. 
   One of the things that I've been talking about more and more when I'm talking to the good people of Louisville, Kentucky is, you know, we've allowed, over the last couple of decades, maybe 3 decades, companies to get bigger and bigger and bigger in this country. We really haven't enforced the anti-trust laws in this country in 30 years. And we did it because they said, oh, you know, it's a global economy. We need to be able to get big so we can compete. 
   Well, unfortunately, what they generally mean when they say they want to get big is they want to get big in revenues. They don't want to get big in job creation. They don't want to get big in many things that are the goals that we hold for this country. And when they want to get big, it generally means they want to save money. So they merge, and then they eliminate jobs, and they close facilities, and they destabilize communities, all in the name of being able to compete in the global economy.     
   And what concerns me is--and we had a hearing not too long ago in the Oversight Committee in which we talked to several of the CEOs of very large corporations, and this was about corporate executive compensation. And I asked three of the executives, When you have these compensation committee meetings when you're deciding what your CEO is going to be paid and what your top management is going to be paid, do you ever talk about the impact of these huge salaries and compensation packages on the morale of your employees? Do you ever talk about how you could make life better for your working people, your employees? Do you ever talk about how you can improve the communities that you occupy, that you serve? 
   And the answer was very candid, and they said, No. It's always about just how we get the stock price up and how we compensate our executives. 
   So the question I ask, and it's one that I hope we continue to ask in this Congress, if you want to get big, we need to make sure that your goals are the same as the American people's goals; and I think people on both sides of the aisle would say we have the same goals for the American people.  We want good jobs, we want stable communities, and we want secure families. And if we have a corporate world that has goals that are antithetical to that, then we need to revise our policy on anti-trust allowing these mergers and try to say if you want permission from us to get big and you want to operate in a certain way, we want you to operate in a way that benefits the American people and not just your CEOs and your stockholders.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. The gentleman makes some very good points, and one of the things I just mentioned before you arrived was that over the past few days, we've actually done three things in a bipartisan way; and you mentioned one of them. We passed a farm bill with substantial Republican support. The housing bill, we had a number of Republicans join us; and when we dealt with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in which we said we don't need to be adding any more fuel to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, taking it off the market, decreasing supply when we're at 98 percent capacity; we've never been, in recent history, below 600 million gallons of our 727-gallon capacity; and the bill, the freshman class, we asked the President to do it by himself. The President refused. 
   So what happened? The Senate yesterday voted 97-1; the House voted 385-25. I think it shows it was a pretty solid idea. There can't be that many people who have bad judgment. Maybe there are. But 97-1, 385-25 are pretty 
   good odds. So we spoke to the President in a bipartisan way. 
   So there are situations in which we have found ways to work together, and as you said, that's the way it should be; and I think that's a very encouraging sign. Unfortunately, we have a President who doesn't recognize this body as having any say in policy in this country. He believes he is the decider, and despite provisions in the Constitution in article 1 to the contrary which says the American people are the deciders of policy and the laws through their representatives of Congress. 
   I think we are doing the people's business, and we're doing it in a very responsible way. And I agree totally that it will be wonderful to have a new chief executive in the White House who maybe understands that government is a partnership and the Constitution was written so that it would be--we would have three branches who are not constantly in conflict but who are working together for the American people.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Exactly. 
   I would say you made the right statement. We will never drill our way out of the energy crisis, but we can invent our way out of the energy crisis; and the private sector is in the process of doing that. We need to give them the boost. We need to give them the incentives. We need to provide the tax credits, and in fact, we have tried to do that. And if anything, I think, represents a clear distinction--there is probably nothing that represents a clear distinction between the President's party and ours than the way we have handled the ideas of incentives. 
   The Republican Congress in 2005 voted a 15--well, the number is vague--but it's around $15 billion a year in tax incentives to the oil companies to drill. We've tried to take that tax incentive away, that subsidy, and put it into the types of innovative technologies that will be the answer to our energy crisis, will make us independent of imported oil, and oil totally, and will stimulate and create new economies and new economic opportunity in this country.

   Mr. YARMUTH. There's another element to the philosophy that I think we need to talk about now, and I see it in discussions that we have in our caucus meetings, and I think it's a growing realization that we have to embrace as a philosophy in this body that we can't think just to the next election cycle. We have to start thinking very long-term, and we have to start thinking about investment and investments that will pay off over the long run but will not get us any immediate gratification or recognition so that we can get votes at the next election. 
   And you mentioned health care, and that's certainly an area in which we have to start investing because every dollar we spend on early childhood health care we know pays off 10, 20 times down the road. You can't see it today. The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, won't score it and say, okay, you can take credit for that, but we know that it happens. If children are tended to early on, preventive care, diagnostic work, we catch a hearing problem, a sight problem, you catch them before they get obese, we know how much that returns in savings down the road. 
   The same way with infrastructure. We've neglected infrastructure in this country for far too long. We know we have to make investments in infrastructure, but those are the types of investments that do pay off. It's not like Iraq where every dollar, once you shoot a bullet, once you shoot a rocket, that's money gone. There's no investment there, no return on investment. 
   But infrastructure, health care, medical research, if we could spend, let's say we spent $100 billion over the next 10 years and we were to cure cancer and diabetes, you're the doctor, it would save trillions of dollars long-term.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Well, the gentleman makes a wonderful point, and I'm reminded in a very kind of maybe indirect way of a movie that came out back in the early seventies, and it was called ``Rollerball.'' It was remade several years ago in a very different way. But the movie early in the 1970s was a science fiction movie, futuristic, looking to an era in which geopolitical boundaries had ceased to exist. And the world, instead of being divided into countries, was divided into economic entities. 
   So James Caan, who starred in that movie, played Rollerball, a futuristic game, for the Energy Corporation, and they played against the Communications Corporation. And then there was the Food Corporation, and that's the way the world was divided. 
   And sometimes when you see ExxonMobil with its volume of revenue and profits and some of these other enormous corporations, you say maybe we're not too far from that. 
   So we have to decide, as a Nation, it's one thing to say the world is flat, but that doesn't mean the world has lost its distinctions yet and its delineations into Nations that have souls and have people who believe in their commonness, their common mission, their common ambitions. And that's something that I think every American wants to retain. We don't want to lose that. 
   And I think when we essentially wash our hands in Washington and say corporate America, corporate world just go at it, do what you want to do and we'll take whatever you give us, we're not too far from that unfortunate scenario in ``Rollerball.''

   Mr. YARMUTH. That will be a nice day. And, you know, just following up a little bit on that thought, the image that I get in my mind when I look out over the economic landscape sometimes is that we have a lot of very wealthy, very powerful people who are just playing Monopoly with America, that this is just a game for them. And there are the little houses and the little trains and all the little pieces that are on the Monopoly board, and it's funny money. Unfortunately, it's funny money that many people are being deprived of because of the great concentrations of wealth in this country. 
   And I don't want to sound like somebody who's saying, oh, we've got to redistribute the wealth, we've got to make sure everybody has the same thing. That's not what any of us are talking about. But as Mr. Ellison pointed out before, we have seen the greatest separation of wealth, disparity in wealth in this country than we've seen in almost 100 years. And we've let the pendulum swing much too far to one side so that we've allowed the very wealthiest people to become incredibly wealthy, and almost everybody else has been treading water. 
   As we said, we have not been floating everybody's boat; in fact, we've been drowning a lot of people. And we've got to make sure that everybody has a boat. And I think that's one of the things that this Congress is committed to. 
   So I would like to yield to my friend, Dr. Kagen, for some closing remarks as we wind down this version of the majority makers.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, 150 years ago, the American Printing House of the Blind opened its doors in my home district of Louisville, Kentucky, to make educational materials accessing to blind students. That day in 1858 stands as a milestone, not just for the education of the vision impaired but for the improved education of our community as a whole and the history of learning in the United States of America. 
   Prior to the early 19th century, it was generally presumed that, with rare exceptions, people who were blind simply didn't have the capacity to learn. Through experimentation and repeated  success, it became clear that the blind were failing to learn, not for lack of intellectual capacity, but because information was not presented to them in a manner that they could perceive. Once information was presented in appropriate ways, primarily through touch and sound, blind students began to achieve. 
   In the 1830s, residential schools for the blind began to open across the U.S., and eventually almost every State established a school specifically designed to meet the needs of students who were blind and visually impaired. In those early years, each school produced the tactile educational materials that its own students needed. In 1842, Kentucky joined the ranks of these States when Louisville's Kentucky Institution For the Education of the Blind began making tactile materials for its students in a basement facility. 
   It didn't take long for schools producing these highly specialized materials to realize they were duplicating effort and wasting valuable resources. The idea of developing a national publishing house for accessible materials for people who were blind and visually impaired took hold. Since the facility in Louisville, Kentucky, was centrally located among the existing schools for the blind and had developed an effective distribution system utilizing the Ohio River, our community was selected as the site for the American Printing House of the Blind, which was chartered by the Kentucky legislature on January 23, 1858. 
   Because the expensive process of printing educational materials in raised letters for a small percentage of the population was not commercially viable, Federal funding was sought to assure a permanent source of revenue to support this important work. In 1879, the 45th Congress of the United States passed, and President Rutherford B. Hayes signed into law, the Act to Promote the Education of the Blind, designating APH as the official source of textbooks and other educational aids for legally blind students below college level. 
   Since that time, APH has provided adaptive and specially designed educational materials, including textbooks in Braille and large type, tangible teaching devices, educational tests, and special instructional aids and tools essential for the education of students who are blind and visually impaired. As identified needs require, APH utilizes outside expertise by establishing innovative partnerships with publishers of textbooks and testing materials, commercial manufacturers, universities and many other industries. 
   We in Congress have continued to appropriate funding for APH each year since 1879. As a result, this national, non-profit corporation now serves over 58,000 students into every U.S. State, providing the visually impaired the tools they need to they need to learn and excel. 
   In addition to textbooks and other academic materials, APH manufacturers and adapts daily living tools and materials. Talking computer software provides access to the wealth of information available via the Internet, and electronic mobility devices assist with safe travel from one place to another. APH has developed tools that help people with low vision learn to utilize the limited vision they have more efficiently, and new technologies are delivering reading materials electronically. 
   The technology and treatment are impressive, but here is what stands out. In the 1800s, a child born blind had no future. Losing one's sight ended independence and ambition. Today, that is not the case. Sight is no longer a prerequisite for leading a productive, independent and fulfilling life. And that is thanks in large part to APH. For tens of thousands of men and women without sight, APH has provided the keys to live, learn and thrive. People who are blind now work in our communities. Children who are blind pursue the same dreams as children with sight. And mothers who are blind read stories to their kids before putting them to bed. 
   As we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the American Printing House for the Blind, we also recognize the wisdom of the 45th Congress for their initial investment in educational opportunities for our Nation's blind and visually impaired students back in 1879, and I trust that my colleagues and those who follow will continue to support the successful precedent they set.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, 220 years ago when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution of the United States, they chose to create the United States Congress in its first article. That was their way of ensuring that we did try to form a more perfect Union. 
   Over the last few decades, Presidents and Congresses of both parties, through action and inaction, have allowed our system of checks and balances to go quite askew. Many of us believe that it has reached a tipping point. That is why we will over the next few weeks and months talk about article I, the article of the Constitution which vests all legislative power in a Congress of the United States elected by the people. 
   The Founding Fathers did not want to see peoples' lives be decided by one decider. They vested their power in the people through their representatives. Over the next few months, we hope to help reassert the authority that the Founding Fathers envisioned for this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 
   I want to say that all of us came back this week from our first extended stay in our districts. And of course I had to laugh when the President 3 weeks ago said, Oh, the Congress ought to come back from vacation and get to work on the supplemental bill, which we had already passed, of course. And I said, wait a minute, this is vacation? All we're doing is working 12, 13 hours a day in our districts communicating with our constituents. 
   And I think that from what I have gotten from talking with all of us among our colleagues is that when we were home, we found out what the American people are saying about our track record so far. And just before we came to the floor this evening, one of the Members from the opposing party tried to minimize what we had done over our past 100 or so days in office. And I thought it was amusing because it was, oh, well, they haven't enacted anything. Of course this Congress acted. It acted very expeditiously to raise the minimum wage for our low-wage earners, to cut the interest rate for our students in college who have loans outstanding; and, as Dr. Kagen said, to take action to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and so forth and so on. 
   When I was home, I met with people from the health care industry, and I met inside the health care facilities and I met with people from our educational institutions. We had a forum of higher education, and everybody was so grateful not just that we had taken the action that we did, but we were finally dealing with problems that have faced these various segments of society and had been unaddressed for the last 6 years. 
   So what I sensed when I was home in my district, and I know many of you and our other colleagues have sensed it as well, is that there is a new sense of optimism, there is a new sense of hope, and there is a spirit that we can deal with the serious problems that we face in this country because we have people who are not interested in dogma, we are not interested in ideology. We are interested in solving problems for the American people. 
   That is why I am so proud to be a part of this Congress and this great freshman class because I know that the American people are responding to what we have done already, and I know that they are responsive to the great agenda that we are going to be pursuing for the rest of this Congress.

   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota. And I would also like to echo my great respect and admiration for our colleague from Pennsylvania who has spoken so eloquently on various occasions about the costs being paid and the sacrifices being made by our great men and women overseas, and how much that means to them. And I think this Congress has responded to those sympathies and those emotions in what we have done to actually support our men and women, our veterans, our wounded warriors who have come back from these very troublesome spots in the world. And we have done it with more than words, and that is what is important. 
   In the continuing resolution, as we all know, the prior Congress did not pass many of the appropriations bills. They left it up to us to try and fund most of the government, and we responded in the best way possible: we passed a continuing resolution. But we didn't just pass a sustaining fund because we recognized that we needed to embellish those funds to take care of our veterans and the increased costs that are being incurred by this war we are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. So what did we do? 
   On January 31 when we passed the continuing resolution, we added $3.6 billion to take care of veterans health care. $3.6 billion. We recognized not only our moral obligation to our veterans but also the promise that we made to them. This government, the people of this country made a promise to those people who volunteered to fight for their country that we would take care of them after they left the service, we would take care of their health care. This Congress recognized and realized and responded to that commitment that we had made to them. Unlike prior Congresses, we increased funding by $3.6 billion. 
   But we weren't finished yet. When we passed the supplemental, we didn't just give the President what he wanted to perpetuate this war, which many of us want to 
   leave, but we said we have men and women who are coming back who are wounded, who are seriously wounded. As we have seen in Walter Reed, we weren't taking care of them adequately, we weren't responding to our commitment to them, our moral obligation to them; so we added $1.7 billion more in this supplemental to take care of our veterans, to take care of our wounded warriors. 
   We understand what supporting our troops means, not just when they are under fire when they are in the battlefield, but also when they come home after they made that sacrifice. We have a commitment to them. We have realized that; we have responded. And I think that the American people can be confident that our veterans are being well taken care of by the 110th Congress and by subsequent Congresses, too.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the 40th anniversary of the week Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was killed to commemorate his legacy as continued by Service for Peace. 
   During his short life, Dr. King marched in my hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, on his way to touching millions of American lives throughout this Nation and inspiring the masses with his message of freedom and of peace. Today, I am proud to say that, in no small part thanks to the efforts of Reverend Peter Hayes, our local Service for Peace, and programs like 40 Days of Peace, the MLK Season of Service, and the King Memorial Walk and Peace Fest, the spirit of Dr. King is alive and well in our hometown. 
   Each year, Service for Peace reminds us that though King was taken from us far too early, the gifts he gave to us, his lessons, his passion, his legacy, remain and continue to inspire within us a deep sense of justice. 
   Nationwide, half a million volunteers took part in this year's MLK Day of  Peace, contributed to their communities and committed themselves to peace and justice.     
   This Saturday for the second year in a row I will join with members of the Louisville community for the King Memorial Walk and Peace Fest. We will gather at the Muhammad Ali Center to share stories of yesterday's struggles and a vision for tomorrow's successes, before walking as one to the north side of the Ohio River. Crossing that boundary once was a journey between slavery and salvation, Jim Crow and justice, oppression and opportunity for far too many Americans. But this weekend, when we return to Louisville, we will enter a community proud of its diversity, alive with the spirit of peace, and working toward a more just future for all. 
   While it is true that we cannot bring Martin Luther King, Jr., back, by promoting his teachings, Service for Peace ensures that we will never really lose him, either. The activism of Service for Peace is so much more than a tribute to a great American hero; it is a practical and proven strategy to reduce drug use, crime, violence, and murder in my community and others throughout our great Nation. 
   I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Service for Peace, just as Service for Peace honors the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank my good friend for yielding. 
   And you raised a very important point, and that is that while much of the headlines today talk about a recession and the debate over whether we are technically in a rescission, those of us who campaigned in 2006 and were talking to our constituents at that point knew that this was on the way. We saw the gathering storm, if you will. We saw the ripples in the ocean that became the tsunami. We talked to our constituents. We knew that they were hurting. We knew that their standard of living was not increasing even though they were working harder and harder. We knew they were scared about their retirement and scared about their ability to afford health care. That's what I heard throughout my campaign in 2006. 
   Yes, people were concerned about the war in Iraq. But, Mr. Speaker, that wasn't really what they were talking about on a day-to-day basis. It was, ``I'm really having a hard time.'' And while the President wasn't talking about it at that time and the majority leaders and the majority party in the Congress weren't talking about it, they were talking about it. They were saying, My friend, his company just went out of business or his plant was moved overseas and he had a pension that had accumulated $150,000 and now it was down to $30,000 because his company hadn't adequately funded it; so now what's he going to do? So we heard these problems day after day after day. 
   And I'm proud to say that when we came to the Congress in January, 2007, we didn't wait for somebody to declare that there was a recession. We started immediately. We said the middle class is hurting. We have people at the very lowest ends of the income scale who are working very hard, who are working at or near minimum wage, and we haven't raised the minimum wage in 10 years in this Congress. That's an outrage. And within the first few days of this 110th Congress, we raised the minimum wage. We put it on track to get to the point where, hopefully, there will be a living wage for everyone who works in this country. 
   And we set about looking at college costs. We said that college costs have been inflating at a very, very dramatically high rate, in my State 8 or 9 percent each year for the last 4 or 5 years. People trying to put their kids through college or people trying to put themselves through college are having a harder and harder time. No increase in the amount of financial aid that was available. No increase in the Pell grants. We passed the College Cost Reduction Act, $21 billion in additional aid to help college students get their degrees. So we understood the problem. We were dealing with it early on. 
   It has not been an easy fight. It has not been an easy fight because we have an administration that has this theory that the marketplace is sacrosanct, that it's infallible, that nothing ever goes wrong, that everything will even out, and that we just need to get out of the way. We just need to get out of the way and let these big corporations do whatever they want to do because the marketplace will force them into doing the right thing. And we now, of course, know that's not the case. We now, of course, know that, as we looked at, in kind of the aftermath of the Bear Stearns situation, an astounding fact coming from Wall Street that one-third of all the income in New York City was on Wall Street. One-third. 
   The average wage, including all of the clerical help and all of the support staff on Wall Street, was $380,000 a year. Those are enormous salaries. And when something goes bad to deflate that bubble, it doesn't just hurt those people, as we have seen; it ripples through the entire economy. 
   So, yes, we have some problems that have just hit us now because, again, the bubble has burst. But it wasn't that we were asleep at the switch because, again, we heard these complaints, we sensed these signals 2 years ago when we were out in the campaign trail. I certainly did in my community, a wonderful community that never quite experiences all the booms but never has the busts. We have two Ford plants making vehicles that consume a lot of gas. There's a lot of stress on those because sales are down for those vehicles. We knew that then. We knew that they were negotiating constantly, the company with the union, trying to drive those wages down. People who were making $25, $30 an hour negotiated down so that they were making $15 an hour because they said that they're having hard times, that the company is  suffering. Well, yes, we know the company is suffering. But, meanwhile, the same people doing the same hard work day after day with the same expenses, the same obligations in their life, and now their income has been cut by 10, 20, 30 percent. 
   So we have been at this battle for now 15 months, since we have been in Congress, and we are going to stay in this battle because this is a battle for the very essence of American society. And I'm very proud to be part of a Congress that is committed to making sure that this economy works for every American and not just for the very elite Americans. And that's why I came to Congress. That's why my colleagues came to Congress. And I think over time, given the commitment that we have, we are going to make a difference for the American people.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Will the gentleman yield? We have been joined by another colleague. But I just have to follow up on something that Mr. Klein said because I almost thought he was telepathic there when he talked about the Great Depression. 
   None of us wants to be alarmist here. But when I was in college, I did my senior thesis on speculation in the 1920s. In fact, there is some remarkable parallels between the situation today with the housing crisis and what happened in the 1920s that led to the Great Depression. 
   The similarity is that back in the 1920s, if you wanted to buy stock, you only had to put up 10 percent of the price of the stock. You could borrow the rest of the money. The theory there, because the stock market was going higher and higher and higher, and everybody thought it was going to continue to get higher, happy days are here again, before they disappeared, and that was the psychology. So nobody ever thought about regulating that. Everybody thought that was an endless gravy train. So people would keep buying stock, paying 10 percent down, 10 percent down. 
   When the stock dropped 10 percent, their equity was gone. This happened time after time after time. The same thing has happened now with the housing market when people are lured into markets with low interest rates and then they borrowed against the equity and then when the value started to slip a little bit, they were in a negative equity situation, and that is what precipitated this crash. 
   I am hoping, and I don't believe that the situation in terms of the overall economy is as threatening as that situation was. The parallels are the same. After that situation in the 1920s, we created the SEC, we went to an environment, because the pendulum had swung over to the side of absolutely no regulation, and we saw the problems with that. 
   I listened to Senator Obama today on the campaign trail, and he made I think a very profound statement, and that was: Things go wrong when nobody is looking. That is what we have had over last 8 years, maybe more than that. We decided we didn't need to look at all that stuff. We found out now we need to pay attention. We need to hold all these institutions accountable. We need to set up certain rules. 
   We don't want to swing the pendulum to the other side, as my good friend Mr. Hodes said, but there is a happy medium. In order to avoid the pitfalls that we have experienced in the past, this is the time. I think this Congress is committed to that. 
   I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman. It is good to see our colleague Mr. Hall here as well, and I thank him for his comments. 
   You know, it becomes almost a cliche, and actually an overly used one these days since we have a big presidential campaign, to talk about the contrasts between Wall Street and Main Street. But it has never been more apt, and particularly with the situation we have seen on Wall Street very recently. 
   We have a very serious orientation problem in this country. For many  years, going back probably three decades now, we have taken the position in this country that we are going to let companies get as big as they can get because they say ``we need to get big so we can function in the global economy.'' But the ramifications of letting them get so big with no regulation has been that if they make a mistake, then it doesn't just affect their stockholders and their employees, it affects the rest of the country. Now we have seen that. As you said early on in the opening remarks, the chickens have come home to roost. That is where we are. 
   This Congress, this government, has to start standing up for Main Street, not for Wall Street, understanding that Wall Street provides great benefits for this country at times. But we have to make sure that ultimately we protect the average American working family. That is what this Congress I think has been committed to doing since day one, and we will continue to be committed to that as we move forward. 
   I yield back, and thank you for your leadership, Mr. Hodes.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (THE IRAQ WAR AND THE IMPACT ON AMERICA'S ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, how much longer do the American people have to bear the financial burden of the war in Iraq? Between 2001 and 2008, Congress has appropriated nearly $700 billion for the Global War on Terrorism, most of that money going to fight the war in Iraq. 
   Investing in Iraq rather than our own country has contributed to our Nation's economic downturn. According to Columbia University Professor Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard University Professor Linda Blimes, ``The Iraq adventure has seriously weakened the U.S. economy, whose woes go far beyond loose mortgage lending. You can't spend $3 trillion, yes, $3 trillion, on a failed war abroad, and not feel the pain at home.'' And Americans are definitely feeling the pain. 
   Mr. Speaker, during the minute that I have been speaking, the Bush administration has spent $235,168 on the war in Iraq. It is time that we once again invest in America. Our focus now should be on helping those Americans who face foreclosure, who can't pay their gas and heating bills, and who continue to watch their finances erode, while funding for the war grows every minute.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I used to spend weekends at my father's used car lot and among other things, I saw a lot of haggling. There was a sticker price, but that was just a starting point for negotiation. If you wanted to drive the price down really low, your family would buy two cars at once. Three cars would really sweetened the deal. If the neighborhood had been really smart, they would've all come in at once and bought up the whole lot. 
   I tell you this, Mr. Speaker, because Medicare Part D is buying up the whole lot of prescription drugs and still paying sticker price. 
   Last year, this institution offered a plan intended to save seniors from paying the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs. Now most of them feel cheated by an overly complicated system, many of them aren't saving any money, and a good number of them are actually paying higher prices than they were before. And because we aren't negotiating on their behalf, we can't even tell our struggling Americans that we're doing the best we can. 
   Medicare part D was written for drug companies, by drug companies, and it should be no surprise, it's benefiting drug companies. This policy has yielded windfall profits for big pharmaceuticals, at the expense of our older Americans. 
   We can do better. America expects better. And our seniors deserve better. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this common sense measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that will bring the Nation closer to providing a world-class education to 2.9 million children with disabilities. 
   The last few years we have seen significant advances in diagnosis and understanding of students with autism, ADD, dyslexia, Down's Syndrome, and a dozen other common and treatable disabilities. Where people once thought these students were unmanageable and unteachable, we now know that more often than not, the majority of them are bright, creative students who are capable of success when given the opportunity to learn. 
   In 1975, we took a major step forward with the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. IDEA placed many students with their peers, where the bar was raised on their achievements, and we began to discover how truly capable these students were. 
   Over the last 33 years, educators have revolutionized techniques to help students with disabilities find success, but these tools have not yet made their way into the vast majority of classrooms. And as a result, the system is failing millions of students. 
   The fact that so many students with disabilities, well over half, now study alongside their peers is a tribute to the success of IDEA. But because most educators have not been given the information, resources, or training to effectively work with students with disabilities, the teachers are getting understandably frustrated, the diverse learners are not being helped, and the rest of the class waits while teachers struggle to deal with situations for which they are simply not equipped. The bottom line is it does no good to put students with disabilities in a classroom with a teacher who has not been given the tools to reach them. 
   Make no mistake, the teachers are not the problem, but with proper resources, they can be a big part of the solution. Many teachers have not been trained to individualize instruction for these special needs students. 
   This isn't a straightforward manner of simply developing special curricula.  Spending time with peers is crucial for the development of these students, especially if we want them to attain the social, communicative, and educational skills we know they are capable of. 
   One area I have focused on is educated children with autism. Without the proper training, misconceptions, such as the Rain Man savant, run rampant. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that the Hollywood depiction is an extreme, with highly functional students with Aspbergers on the other end and every level of functionality in between. The signals are abundant, but recognizing them is not just a matter of common sense. 
   The untrained educator may not know why a student with autism refuses to make eye contact, suddenly stops socializing, acts out, or completely cuts off all communication. What's more troublesome is that the wrong response, in many cases the normal, logical response, can send a child into a downward spiral. 
   And what has escaped many is the tremendous scope and urgency of what we're dealing with. Already 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism, and the number is escalating at an alarming rate. An analysis of the U.S. Department of Education special education data revealed that the number of students with a diagnosis of autism has increased more than 500 percent since 1993, and by 2014 the number is expected to increase 1800 percent. 
   We cannot afford to wait to address the needs of these children and others with special needs. That is why I am proposing a new grant program for institutions of higher education working to better prepare general education teachers for success in helping students with disabilities. Institutions would partner with high-need local education agencies to place qualified teacher candidates into the areas that need the most help. 
   The Teach to Reach grants will give our teachers the tools to properly engage students with disabilities. Truly engaging the students not only improves the quality of learning for special needs students but for everyone in the classroom. These grants will provide just the sort of preparation that is needed. Teacher candidates will learn how to use Response to Intervention, a scientifically based intervention strategy that allows a teacher to pinpoint the specific skills students need in order to progress. They will train in positive behavioral support strategies that will enable them to manage and improve challenging behaviors in the classroom and also learn how to work with their special education and related colleagues to develop and implement individualized educational programs so that students with disabilities will have their diverse needs met. 
   In classroom after classroom across the Nation, these grants can make the difference between students trapped by misunderstanding and teachers reaching their students and helping them unlock their potential to succeed in school and excel in life. 
   This program is endorsed by the NEA, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, the Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, and many organizations that advocate for the education of students with disabilities. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment so that we may empower our Nation's teachers to reach all of our children. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (THE CASE FOR BIPARTISANSHIP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, last week this House came together in a bipartisan fashion to address the economic uncertainty that many of our citizens are facing. President Bush worked with both Democratic and Republican leaders of the House to develop an economic stimulus package  that is timely, targeted, and temporary. That plan, which was passed here in the House last week, will help jump-start our economy by putting tax rebates in the hands of 117 million hardworking middle- and lower-income workers. 
   We should be proud of the bipartisanship that made this compromise package possible. I would hope that we could bring that same bipartisanship to bear on the continuing war in Iraq. 
   Last month, the Iraqi defense minister said that his country will not be able to take full control of its security until 2012 and will not be able to defend its borders from outside threats until at least 2018. Democrats do not believe that American troops should be on the ground in Iraq for another decade and neither do the American people. The status quo cannot continue. 
   I would hope that we could continue to work together to bring this war to an end.

<DOCNO>Mr. YARMUTH. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago I was just like most other Americans, trying to evaluate the President's plan to invade Iraq. Unlike most Americans, I was writing a newspaper column and was expected to take a public position on such a national policy. But like most Americans, I was unburdened by the classified and faulty intelligence provided to Members of Congress. 
   I concluded and wrote that the claims made to justify the American invasion of Iraq were baseless, that there were no weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq posed no immediate threat to the United States, that Saddam Hussein was not in any way connected to the 9/11 attacks, and finally that Iraq was not a safe harbor for al Qaeda. 
   I also concluded and wrote that we were rushing into Iraq with no idea of what we would do after the Iraqi regime fell, and also that we had no plan for getting out. The point of all of this reminiscing is not to show that I was so smart, nor is it to say that I told you so. 
   Four years later, as our men and women are still dying in Iraq, the American people know everything there is to know about the situation there. We know as much if not more than the President of the United States. And our ideas about the conflict are just as valid. 
   That is why this resolution is so important and this debate so significant. Tomorrow we will be voting on what may be only a nonbinding resolution, but it is a resounding and unequivocal expression of the National will. This is not simply a group of Congressmen and women explaining their votes. It is the echo of an overwhelming majority of Americans who are demanding a new direction in Iraq. 
   It is the sound of scores of people like me who were sent here by citizens to turn the ship of state around. During this momentous debate, we have heard from some on the other side of the aisle that this resolution and the discussion we are having somehow undermine our national interest. 
   I believe they are selling this institution short. We are displaying for the world what a government of the people, by the people and for the people truly looks like. What we are doing here this week speaks far more clearly and loudly than our bullets and our rockets and even our dollars. When the United States Government so clearly and dramatically reflects the will of its citizens, we may not shock the world, but we make it watch in awe. 
   James Madison wrote that the role of Congress is to expand and refine the public view. He accurately perceived that on most issues Americans assume that their representatives will consider their opinions and work out the details. In the present situation, I believe the American people are shouting at us that it is time to get our men and women out of harm's way in Iraq. 
   I will cast my vote not simply to oppose the President's escalation, but as a statement that this Congress will no longer abdicate its responsibility to expand and refine the public view. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I am as confident about my position as I was 4 years ago. I am confident because I have listened to those who oppose this resolution. I hear only disingenuous rhetoric. The other side accuses us of trying to micromanage the Iraqi conflict, then says we should have our own plan. 
   They say that we are dishonoring our fallen heroes, but then offer no strategy for honoring them other than to simply send more brave soldiers in their place. They continue to talk about victory and defeat, while virtually everyone agrees that we could never identify or define either. 
   They say this resolution is an empty political gesture, and then say it is tantamount to surrender. What they do not give us, and more importantly what the President of the United States has not given us, are any reasons to believe that we are succeeding in Iraq, that the current plans increase the odds of our success, that we are any closer to eliminating the threat of terrorism, or finally that the United States is enhancing its image around the world as the beacon of freedom. 
   We who support this resolution honor and respect our troops. We care deeply about the international reputation of our country. We are unequivocally committed to our Nation's security, and we desperately want America to succeed. By supporting this resolution, we undeniably succeed, because we honor our Nation and its citizens who have entrusted us with the simple, but grave, responsibility to listen to them.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, there's one thing on which everyone in this Chamber agrees, it's that we're in an energy crisis, and the American people are paying the price. 
   So, as we consider a second stimulus package to provide immediate relief and spur long-term growth, I urge my colleagues to also offer assistance where we know people need it: immediately paying for energy. 
   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, provides critical heating and cooling assistance to millions of hardworking, low-income Americans across this country, and now, in the middle of a hot summer and trying economic times, this assistance is more important than ever. 
   In Kentucky, 300,000 people qualify for LIHEAP, but because we have yet to fully fund the program, only a third are receiving the help they need, leaving 192,000 Kentuckians underserved, forced to choose between food for their children and critical cooling and heating needed to get through a long summer and winter. 
   Eligible families spend, on average, a fifth of their incomes on energy. I urge my colleagues to fully fund LIHEAP and provide desperately needed help to struggling American families.

The Republicans have one strategy. It would bring relief at the pump about 20 years from now, a couple of pennies a gallon. That's their approach. 
   Democrats have a different approach. We want to free America's oil. We can release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We now have 700 million barrels of oil in that. We don't need them. We can drive the price down in the market. We can force the gas companies, the energy companies, as we have tried to do already, to drill on the 68 million acres worth of leases they already own to produce oil. 
   Finally, we can open up the 23-million-acre Alaskan National Petroleum Reserve area where there are proven oil reserves and where they are eligible for drilling right now. We have the tools at our disposal immediately to drive down gas prices. We ought to take advantage of them.

   Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, where is President Bush? Last Friday he held a short press conference demanding Congress pass a bailout plan that was still being written, otherwise the economic fallout would be dire. 
   But the President has not been heard from since. If this really is a catastrophic economic collapse, shouldn't the President address the American people and the Congress in a prime-time nationally televised speech? 
   The President needs to explain to the people exactly what is happening in the financial markets and how this plan will help turn things around. This is extremely complicated. With potentially a $700 billion price tag, every American has a stake in what happens with this legislation. 
   If this truly is a crisis on Wall Street, President Bush needs to begin treating it that way. He can't sit on the sidelines any longer. If President Bush is serious about getting this legislation passed, he needs to sell this plan to the American people. 
   If the future of our Nation's economy is, indeed, at stake, President Bush needs to raise the stakes and explain his plan to the American people.

Mr. Speaker, this House has repeatedly passed the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act to authorize Federal funds to be used for lifesaving research on embryonic stem cell lines that would otherwise be discarded. This type of research, conducted under strict ethical standards, is supported by an overwhelming number of Americans because of the hope it offers for the potential cures of many diseases, s uch as diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer and MS. 
   But yesterday, President Bush once again vetoed this important bill. In an attempt to save face, the President instead signed an executive order that will do little to advance essential medical research. The symbolic order is the President's attempt to score political points, but it fails to direct new resources or support for potentially lifesaving research. 
   A majority of this House and a majority of the American people are fed up with the Bus h administration's stifling of this important life-affirming science. Democrats will continue to fight to promote important and groundbreaking research so that we can provide real hope to millions of Americans.
