<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for the preceding speaker, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee. The facts of what he said are absolutely correct. Health care costs are out of control. They are threatening the future of the Medicare program. They are threatening the future of U.S. health care. 
   But the issue before us is a trigger which would have one of two results, only one of two results, cut Medicare benefits or raise Medicare premiums on our seniors. Now, if we are going to address, and we need to address the underlying systemic problems in our health care system, but this trigger, which would simply cut Medicare or raise seniors' premiums, is not the way to systemically address our problems. 
   I believe that it's incorrect to single out Medicare for this treatment, to single out seniors for the overall problem of broader health reform. We need to work together on health reform. I hope the next Congress will give us an opportunity to do that, but the months remaining in this Congress don't. 
   Look, we had to override the President's veto to prevent a 10 percent cut in physician reimbursements under Medicare, cuts that would have threatened universal access of our seniors under Medicare. We had to override a veto. So moving forward with a trigger mechanism that at this hour in the administration is going to cut Medicare or raise seniors' premiums is certainly not the way to address the broader issues of health care costs. 
   I look forward, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we address health care costs. Let's not have this trigger.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (CONGRATULATING ALBANIA AND CROATIA ON BEING INVITED TO BEGIN ACCESSION TALKS WITH THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution. 
   I am very pleased that Albania and Croatia were invited to join the alliance at the Bucharest summit in April of this year. Enlarging NATO has been hugely successful in advancing stability and cooperation among NATO's member states, and this invitation to Albania and Croatia to join the alliance is very welcome news. 
   Unfortunately, another friend and important ally, the Republic of Macedonia, was blocked from joining NATO at the Bucharest summit due to the objection of a single nation, Greece, over the official name of Macedonia. This is very disappointing. 
   Macedonia has made significant economic and political reforms. They have made a strong contribution to U.S.-led military missions. They have been deemed to be fully qualified to become a member of the alliance. 
   Greece is our long-time friend, our valued ally, but their refusal to allow Macedonia into NATO over a bilateral name dispute represents, to my belief, the first time NATO membership has been denied any country due to a bilateral dispute unrelated to strategic defense considerations of the alliance. This is a very troubling precedent. It sets the stage for what could be a pattern, where member states leverage their advantage to nonmember states seeking to get into NATO and try and extract any measure of bilateral concession, all occurring at the expense of the alliance. 
   I strongly support a quick and expedient resolution to the name dispute between Greece and Macedonia so that Macedonia can join Albania and Croatia in signing accession protocols with NATO. I commend the United States diplomat that has led the efforts to resolve this issue. Both Greece and Macedonia have expressed their resolution to continue to work on getting a breakthrough. I encourage their efforts and I urge them, these great countries, these important friends of ours, to rise above the temptation to exploit nationalist themes for domestic political advantage in each of their respective countries. Put that aside, rise above that for the good of the alliance. Resolve this issue and let Macedonia in. 
   The resolution before us commends Albania and commends Croatia for the beginning of the accession process. They deserve this commendation. Please support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The latest example of a White House that runs energy policy by the oil companies, of the oil companies, and for the oil companies is found in the Statement of Administrative Policy threatening a veto on this bill. 
   The White House asks to give basically a blank check to the oil companies to drill wherever they want, notwithstanding the fact they already have authorized drilling for 34 billion barrels offshore. And then the White House opposes our efforts to address speculation. 
   The bill before us is a substantive and measured approach at trying to make certain that the price our consumers are paying at the pump is based on consideration of the supply and demand and not market manipulation. 
   Greater transparency, more reporting of transactions, greater oversight, 100 new personnel at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, greater enforcement, a stronger direction from Congress to drive out excessive speculation: you would think this would be one area where the White House and the Congress could agree. 
   I urge passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank my friend, the chairman, for yielding. 
   I commend the last two speakers on the Republican side because they have at last made it clear what this debate is really about: Is there a Federal role for assisting the private sector in dealing with the management of the infinite risk of terror, or is there not? 
   I'm really surprised to hear in this debate how firmly my friends on the other side of the aisle cling to the notion that the market and the market alone can work this one out. 
   I used to be an insurance commissioner. What I know about insurance is that infinite risk cannot be priced, it cannot be underwritten, it cannot be reserved, it doesn't work. And that is why, right across the face of the insurance industry, we have heard as a body from the experts that they cannot make this coverage work private sector alone. They can whittle away at the edges basically by backing away from risk, coshares, enormous deductibles, the rest of it, but they have not told us they can make this market function. 
   But in the face of what reality holds forth, the minority is unmoved. They don't like government making business work. And so even in the face of a very uncertain construction sector, they would pull this coverage away. 
   Pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the point of the farm bill at issue with this motion deals with a concept of public interest. Will private land adjacent to forest land be protected or will it be sold off and developed into very nice, very expensive private lots, taking land out of general public access and enjoyment? That's really the issue. 
   I believe it's an extremely serious issue, and I'm going to introduce into the Record coverage of this that appeared in the New York Times October 13, 2007, under the title ``As Logging Fades, Rich Carve Out Open Land in West.'' This article cites the prospect of vast timber sales by a company named Plum Creek Timber. And I would quote from the article: 
   ``Some old-line logging companies, including Plum Creek Timber, the country's largest private landowner, are cashing in, putting tens of thousands of wooded acres on the market from Montana to Oregon. Plum Creek, which owns about 1.2 million acres in Montana alone, is getting up to $29,000 an acre for land that was worth perhaps $500 an acre for timber cutting. 
   `` `Everybody wants to buy a 640-acre section of forest that's next to the U.S. Forest Service or one of the wilderness areas,' said Plum Creek's president and chief executive, Rick Holley. 
   ``As a result, population is surging in areas surrounding national forests and national parks, with open spaces being carved up into sprawling wooded plots, enough for a house and no noisy neighbors.'' 
   And the article goes on to talk about the extraordinary pressure, development pressure, for the wealthy few that can spend recreation dollars buying up and carving up land adjacent to the Forest Service. 
   As Logging Fades, Rich Carve Up Open Land in West  
   WHITEFISH, MT.--William P. Foley II pointed to the mountain. Owns it, mostly. A timber company began logging in view of his front yard a few years back. He thought they were cutting too much, so he bought the land. 
   Mr. Foley belongs to a new wave of investors and landowners across the West who are snapping up open spaces as private playgrounds on the borders of national parks and national forests. 
   In style and temperament, this new money differs greatly from the Western land barons of old--the timber magnates, copper kings and cattlemen who created the extraction-based economy that dominated the region for a century. 
   Mr. Foley, 62, standing by his private pond, his horses grazing in the distance, proudly calls himself a conservationist who wants Montana to stay as wild as possible. That does not mean no development and no profit. Mr. Foley, the chairman of a major title insurance company, Fidelity National Financial, based in Florida, also owns a chain of Montana restaurants, a ski resort and a huge cattle ranch on which he is building homes. 
   But arriving here already rich and in love with the landscape, he said, also means his profit motive is different. 
   ``A lot of it is more for fun than for making money,'' said Mr. Foley, who estimates he has invested about $125 million in Montana in the past few years, mostly in real estate. 
   The rise of a new landed gentry in the West is partly another expression of gilded age economics in America; the super-wealthy elite wades ashore where it will. 
   With the timber industry in steep decline, recreation is pushing aside logging as the biggest undertaking in the national forests and grasslands, making nearby private tracts more desirable--and valuable, in a sort of ratchet effect--to people who enjoy outdoor activities and ample elbow room and who have the means to take title to what they want. 
   Some old-line logging companies, including Plum Creek Timber, the country's largest private landowner, are cashing in, putting tens of thousands of wooded acres on the market from Montana to Oregon. Plum Creek, which owns about 1.2 million acres here in Montana alone, is getting up to $29,000 an acre for land that was worth perhaps $500 an acre for timber cutting. 
   ``Everybody wants to buy a 640-acre section of forest that's next to the U.S. Forest Service or one of the wilderness areas,'' said Plum Creek's president and chief executive, Rick Holley. 
   As a result, population is surging in areas surrounding national forests and national parks, with open spaces being carved up into sprawling wooded plots, enough for a house and no nosy neighbors. 
   Here in Flathead County, on the western edge of Glacier National Park, the number of real estate transactions, mostly for open land, rose by 30 percent from 2003 to 2006, according to state figures. The county's population is up 44 percent since 1990. 
   The United States Forest Service projects that over the next 25 years, an area the size of Maine--all of it bordering the national forests and grasslands--will face development pressure and increased housing density. 
   But the equally important force is the change in ownership. According to a Forest Service study, not yet published, more than 1.1 million new families became owners of an acre or more of private forest from 1993 to 2006 in the lower 48 states, a 12 percent increase. And almost all the net growth, about seven million acres, was in the Rocky Mountain region. 
   Institutions, pension funds and real estate investment trusts have been particularly aggressive buyers. Over the last 10 years, at least 40 million acres of private forest land have changed hands nationwide, said Bob Izlar, the director of the Center for Forest Business at the University of Georgia. It is a turnover that Mr. Izlar said was unmatched at least since the Great Depression. 
   Here in the West, questions of clout and class have been raised by the new arrivals. 
   This year, the conservation group Trout Unlimited, which had been considering ending its involvement in disputes between private landowners and fishermen over public access to fishing streams, backtracked after its members rose up in protest. Some members accused the group of siding with the landowners by not fighting for fishermen's access rights. 
   In parts of Colorado where communities have committed tax money to preserve open space, conflicts have erupted on the borders of the public lands over whether the programs--which in many cases buy out an owner's right to develop property, but not the property itself--are simply enriching landowners who keep the land and the public off, too. 
   ``When you're there, you're on four million acres,'' said Michael Carricarte, who bought an 800-acre property in Glenwood Springs, Colo., in 2005, and now has the place, bordered on three sides by federal land, up for sale, asking $23.5 million. 
   ``To get to where our property touched public land would take three hours by public road, but from our house it was 10 minutes by four-wheeler or Jeep,'' he said. 
   Mr. Carricarte, 39, said he was now in the process of selling a conservation easement to the Aspen Valley Land Trust that would lock 600 acres, all bordering public land, into permanent preservation. 
   Longtime residents tied to the old timber economy are finding it difficult to keep up. In parts of New Mexico and Colorado, the timber industry has all but collapsed; log harvests in the national forests have fallen to about one-fourth of what they were 20 years ago in the Rocky Mountain region, and less than a tenth what they were in the Pacific Northwest. 
   Some privately owned timberlands have increased production, but in the West, where more than two-thirds of all forest land is publicly owned (compared with about one-sixth in the eastern United States) private owners, even if they want to allow logging, cannot make up the difference. 
   Ronald H. Buentemeier, a second-generation forester, said he struggled every day to get enough wood to stoke the family-owned mill he runs in Montana, the F. H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company. 
   ``There's not enough private land out there,'' said Mr. Buentemeier, a blunt-talking 66-year-old with a flat-top crew cut. ``We've been pulling rabbits out of the hat to keep going.'' 
   In ways that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, environmentalists and representatives of the timber industry are reaching across the table, drafting plans that would get loggers back into the national forests in exchange for agreements that would set aside certain areas for protection. 
   Both groups are feeling under siege: timber executives because of the decline in logging,  and environmentalists because of the explosion of growth on the margins of the public lands. 
   One of the most ambitious proposals is here in Montana. It would allow some logging in the Beaverhead and Deerlodge National Forests in the state's southwest corner in exchange for the designation of new areas within the forests as permanent wilderness. 
   Some timber companies say that gaining conservationists as allies may be the only way to get back into the national forests, and so stay in business. But both sides say that success will require a turn of the historical momentum against logging in the West that began in the early '90s. 
   A court decision in 1991 involving the northern spotted owl required the Forest Service to manage for more than just timber production. The national forests in the northern Rockies constricted logging, fostering expansion in other forest areas like the South. 
   ``If there's anything the industry should have learned over the years, it's that we can't do this by ourselves,'' said Gordy Sanders, the resource manager at Pyramid Mountain Lumber, one of the mill operators involved in the Beaverhead and Deerlodge negotiations. 
   Many environmentalists say they have come to realize that cutting down trees, if done responsibly, is not the worst thing that can happen to a forest, when the alternative is selling the land to people who want to build houses. 
   Stoltze Land and Lumber, for example, which owns about 36,000 acres near the border of Glacier National Park, has said that the failure of the logging industry would leave the company no option but to sell land into the booming development market. 
   That prospect chills the blood of people like Anne Dahl, the director of the Swan Valley Ecosystem Center, a conservation and education group. 
   ``I'm a former tree hugger who was opposed to everything, every timber sale,'' Ms. Dahl said, ``but now I see that the worst thing you can do is lose it all to development.'' 
   Other new partnerships are emerging. Last year, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Indian tribes, which have a reservation south of Whitefish, joined with conservationists to buy a square mile of land from Plum Creek that was deemed crucial to the endangered bull trout. 
   The tribes chipped in $4.8 million, half the purchase price, and the Trust for Public Lands put together the other half. The two parties recently completed a plan to manage the property jointly, said the Salish and Kootenai tribal chairman, James Steele Jr. 
   Plum Creek, based in Seattle, changed its corporate structure in 1999 to become a real estate investment trust. Some Plum Creek property has been bought by conservation groups, including about 68,000 acres in the Blackfoot Valley northwest of Helena. Negotiations continue for more conservation sales, with money surging into funds organized by groups like the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Lands. 
   Mr. Holley, the Plum Creek executive, said that his company was committed to both the timber and real estate businesses, but that only a small percentage of its land, perhaps 30,000 acres or so, had the combination of attractions--proximity to public lands but also to other amenities, like shopping and restaurants--to make sale for development feasible. 
   The Forest Service, meanwhile, is struggling to find its own balance. A spokesman for the agency said that the national forests across the West were increasingly tilting toward recreation and away from logging. But, the growth in population on the forests' edge also means more need than ever to thin the trees, through some logging, if only for wildfire protection. 
   Tom Tidwell, the regional forester for 25 million acres of national forest that includes Montana, northern Idaho, North Dakota and part of South Dakota, said the Forest Service was eager to keep timber companies in business to help with the thinning. 
   ``We're more in the need of the industry,'' Mr. Tidwell said. ``It's essential that we have someone to do that work so that taxpayers don't have to pay for it.'' 
   One broiling and unresolved issue is who gets to use the land as it changes hands. 
   Most private timber tracts in the West, including those owned by Plum Creek, have traditionally been open to recreational use, treated as public entry ways into the vast national forests, grasslands and wilderness. areas that in Montana alone add up to nearly 46,000 square miles, about the size of New York State. But in many places, the new owners are throwing up no trespassing signs and fences, blocking what generations of residents across the West have taken for granted--open and beckoning access into the woods to fish, hunt and camp. 
   ``Part of our character is that we have so much big sky and open country,'' said Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a Democrat who has publicly sparred with Plum Creek about its land sales. ``We're going to have to be creative. There's no textbook written on how to do this.''  
   So the proposal at issue here is something different. It would provide a new category of tax credit bonds and establish a national program allowing the issuance of $500 million in tax-exempt timber conservation bonds. The way it's structured, the bonds will be issued by a nonprofit organization whose holdings consist primarily of forest lands. Their board of directors would include specified representation of public officials as well as conservation organizations. The funds from the bonds will be used to purchase sizable tracts of forest lands, a minimum of 40,000 acres protected from the kind of development I was referencing earlier. And this acreage would have to be adjacent to U.S. Forest Service lands, basically leveraging the critical area already protected in Forest Service holdings. At least half of the land acquired would be transferred to the Forest Service. The development in previously forest lands not only diminishes substantially the public use and enjoyment potential of this property; it increases significantly the public cost. 
   We've all seen these forest fires across the West and the lavish homes they have taken out. We've also witnessed the extraordinary taxpayer dollars spent fighting to the very best effort of our talented firefighters, trying to protect these beautiful, extraordinary properties carved into areas that were previously pristine forest. 
   Now, an issue was raised in terms of whether this was simply too narrow a tax benefit. The bonds sold under this provision would go to numerous holders of qualified forestry conservation bonds; so there's no special earmark-type interest there. And when you consider the fact that half of the holdings have to be transferred to the United States Forest Service, we think everyone in the country is a beneficiary of this provision in that area. 
   We voted on this once before in the House, debated it as part of the energy bill. It passed 235-181. And at that time a discussion was held. The minority leader raised an issue in terms of whether we ought to be talking about preserving trees and fish or something like that, his argument went, in the context of an energy bill. Well, we decided to at that time--the bill did not ultimately become law; so it's back before us again. But, clearly, there can be no issue raised about its appropriateness for consideration as part of a farm bill. A farm bill is where we address forest issues. General forestry legislation is within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committees. We have passed farm bills that have included provisions addressing forestry, especially on private lands. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service is within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. So we think attaching it to the farm bill certainly makes sense in many respects. 
   But to be candid, this wasn't a provision that originated in the House. It originated in the Senate. I have been party to discussions now going over the last couple of weeks that have involved many, many issues in difference between the House and the Senate. That's what happens when you reach the final stages of bringing a bill out of conference committee. There are back-and-forth negotiations. And this ended up in the bill, a bill that, in my opinion, was improved in very substantial ways by priorities that we also have in the House. Certainly, the $10.3 billion commitment into nutrition, helping people afford food at a time when the cost of groceries has risen so dramatically, this is going to be a feature directly responsive to priorities we've had in the House. It's all part of the negotiation process. There will be stuff in this bill that I think anyone will like. There will be stuff in this bill that people will be less enthusiastic about. It's a great big bill. But in balance I believe this reasonably is in the package. I like the fact that it addresses this subdividing of this forest land adjacent to the U.S. Forest Service. I like keeping the big tracts and expanding U.S. Forest Service holdings at a time when they're under such extraordinary development pressure, which would take it out of, basically, public access and enjoyment. 
   So I think that this proposal is fine in the bill, and I would therefore urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to instruct. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. POMEROY. I have enormous respect for each of the speakers, my friends, on the other side. I think they have made their points well. But I would like us to come back to really what's at stake with the issue in front of us. Essentially, we want to avoid a bridge to wealthy development communities placed into pristine forest lands adjacent to U.S. forests. I earlier referenced a New York Times article covering this extraordinary development pressure that's on these lands.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Reclaiming my time. 
   Well, my friend, I think we are talking about a different section of the economy. In fact, economic analysis of the functioning economy shows that there has been extraordinary wage growth of the wealthiest 1 percent, top 10 percent, consumptive patterns have continued unabated at the peak earning levels in our economy. And it is those people that are the customers for this land. This isn't your average Joe deciding, hey, Ma, let's move to Montana and buy a little forest land. No. There's no jobs there other than former timber industry jobs. The economy is in transition there. These are wealthy people that want to have essentially recreational property in areas we can't imagine. 
   One of the individuals referenced in that article has invested about $125 million in Montana. It talks about his not liking what a logging company was doing. They began logging too much of the view in front of his yard. So he bought the land. He bought all the mountain that they were mining on. That's the kind of guy that we are talking about. 
   They talk about another guy here. They quoted a man named Michael Carricarte who bought an 800-acre property in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, in 2005. He has got the place bordered on three sides by Federal land. And he is now asking $23.5 million for it. 
   This isn't the kind of property that is involved with our earlier discussion about the housing crisis. This is quite a different deal entirely. And it is for those reasons that I think it is important that we act to preserve the public interest. 
   We are in a recession. But it is not a recession that is diminishing the development pressure on forest lands. And we are not going to be in a recession forever. And that pressure, especially as baby boomers age and have this disposable income, is only going to continue. In fact, they talk about the pressure being extraordinary. And again, in Montana, more than 1 million acres are under threat alone. 
   So basically this provision has been fashioned, and if you think about it, a 40,000-acre minimum, it is entirely protected by Fish and Wildlife plans. Now my friend, Mr. McCrery, cites that as a negative thing. I think essentially if the goal of this is to try and preserve property, it might be a good thing. And of course there is a provision for a perpetual conservation easement. So really the aim of this, and I think it will achieve it, is to make certain we don't have private development, little lots with great big houses chunked into the pristine forest. We would like to preserve this. We would like to actually expand the holdings of the U.S. Forest  Service and have the land adjacent to it protected under perpetual conservation easement. 
   So all in all, there certainly is a sound rationale behind this proposal. It was included in the negotiations back and forth between the House and the Senate. And again it certainly invites the kind of questions and scrutiny that this provision has been put under tonight. But I think when you think about the importance in this country of preserving for general public use and enjoyment, we certainly come down on the right side as compared to dividing this into little lots and having that kind of development in this area. 
   So I think that we have covered the area. Is the gentleman ready to close? If so, I will wrap up now or I will reserve the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I am a Democrat representing an energy-producing State, and I will be proudly supporting this bill. 
   This bill creates a very important reserve, a reserve that will serve as a funding base for our efforts to significantly expand critical research in order to develop greater energy independence for our country while continuing those tax credits that have been absolutely essential to the growth of renewable fuels in our country. 
   We face the promise of not looking to the Middle East, but looking to the Middle West for our energy future, and we are seeing across the plains of this country wonderful developments. A 10-fold increase of ethanol production alone in my State is under construction at the present time due essentially to these tax credits that continue to fuel this revolution. 
   What about the issues of a new tax, something that will crack people right at the pump. The reality is we are addressing something that was slipped into a massive bill dealing with the tax needs of manufacturers.     
   As we restructured the tax base on the Nation's manufacturers, in light of international trade pressures, we constructed a bill, moved the bill forward, and at no point in the debate in the Ways and Means Committee or on the floor of the House was there notice provided that a similar tax treatment was slipped in for the oil companies. This is something they did not have before; it is something that has not been long critical to their operations. This was an ill-gotten windfall amounting to $700 million a year, and it is time it be withdrawn. 
   In the withdrawing, however, it is not going to the General Treasury. We are dedicating it, dedicating it to the energy picture. So as we try to move from big oil into renewables, we will have the wherewithal to do it. I urge passage.  
   This bill is an important step for our growing renewable energy industry. H.R. 6 will set up a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, which will allow this Congress to begin to get serious about developing America's renewable energy industries. 
   Through enhanced investment in renewable energy we will not only build a sustainable industry for our State but we will also be helping make America more energy independent and more secure. 
   There will be many new proposals made in the coming months regarding how we should use this reserve, but we must make sure that while we place significant funds into research and development we also continue to place importance on policies and tax credits that have an immediate impact on the creation of renewable energy. These tax credits include those for ethanol, biodiesel and the production tax credit for wind and other renewables. 
   The tax credits for biodiesel and ethanol are set to expire in the next few years. These credits must be extended to ensure that the biofuels industry is able to continue its expansion and meet more and more of our transportation fuel needs. These credits helped spur the development of 350 million gallons of ethanol and over 100 million gallons of biodiesel in my State, North Dakota, over the last 2 years alone. 
   In 2006 over 1 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity came online with another 5.4 billion expected to become operational in the next 18 months easily surpassing the 7.5 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard set for 2012. Meanwhile the biodiesel industry has tripled its production capacity each year since 2004. Expansion of these credits will have a direct effect on the volume of biofuels produced, encouraging the development that we need to lower our dependence on foreign oil. 
   In addition to the biofuels incentives, the production tax credit, which expires at the end of next year, must be extended for 5 years to allow industries such as the wind industry to operate under stabile conditions. Without stabilizing the tax credit, companies like DMI Industries in West Fargo and LM Glassfiber in Grand Forks are in constant limbo. DMI manufactures wind turbine towers and had furloughed over 100 employees in late 2003 after the expiration of the wind production tax credit. LM Glassfiber, which manufactures wind turbine blades, had previously idled all production due to the delay in extending the wind tax credit and was forced to furlough 60 to 70 employees. 
   America has great potential for meeting our energy needs domestically. In order to achieve energy independence we must enact policies that will take full advantage of our renewable fuel potential but at the same time we must also continue to invest in traditional sources of energy such as clean coal and domestic oil production. Technologies such as coal-to-liquids, enhanced oil recovery through carbon sequestration and clean coal technologies hold great potential for increasing the efficiency of these industries while at the same time making them more environmentally friendly. 
   Reliance on foreign sources for our energy supply and the volatility of the Middle East create a national security risk that cannot be ignored. We must work to harness our own Nation's energy resources while also bolstering new and inventive methods of meeting our growing energy needs. We are taking an important first step today and I look forward to the debate on renewable energy that will occur in the coming months.

   Mr. POMEROY. I just also very briefly, representing the other side of the aisle, want to echo the statements so eloquently made by the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
   JERRY, you spoke right from the heart. We can feel the pain that you're feeling on behalf of those who have had their lives just devastated. It's important for them to know that they're going to have your first class advocacy. And you certainly just put that on display tonight. 
   And it's also important for them to know that we offer them our prayers. And beyond that, we will be with them as they rebuild. 
   I represented a city that got flooded, and it took years, but we just had the 10-year commemoration of that event, and this city is back, bigger and better than ever. 
   Now, I've never seen anything like the picture that you put on display tonight. It's a different challenge. A different magnitude of effort's going to be required, but we will be with you. The Federal Government will be there, and we will follow your lead as we fashion a response that meets the need, the tremendous need in the wake of this tornado. I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I hold this picture of Major Alan Johnson and his wife Victoria and their daughter Megan. Alan Johnson lost his life last January 26 in service to our country in Iraq. Major Johnson had served in the National Guard and the Army Reserve for 26 years. Additionally, he had a civilian job. He was still in the public sector. He was sergeant of the Corrections Department of Yakima County in the State of Washington, shift supervisor, one of the largest jails in the State of Washington. 
   You can imagine how awful the surprise for Victoria Johnson, deep in her grief of losing her husband, to learn that his pension in the State of Washington was treated as though, on the day he left on his deployment, he quit work. They offered only return of the amounts he had paid into the pension plan. Now, if he had been an active Washington State employee, she would have received a lifetime annuity benefit. But the law didn't provide for that, and her circumstance has alerted us to a loophole that must be addressed. 
   Legislation introduced by Congressman DOC HASTINGS and me, the HEROES Act, addresses this flaw in our law, a law that presently allows for reintegration of pension benefits for our returning soldiers. This will also mean that should they lose their life in service to our country during their deployment, they are treated as though their life was lost while a fully employed participant in the pension plan. 
   This is desperately necessary. Do it because it is right. Do it for the memory of Major Alan Johnson.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (PENSION PROTECTION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in favor of moving this bill, H.R. 6382, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act, forward in an expedited manner. This bill is important to workers so that their retirement years will be more secure, and to employers so that the cost of the defined benefit pension which they are committed to offering their employees will be more predictable. 
   The Tax Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, are complex and broad reaching laws. When Congress enacts laws to change them, such as in the Pension Protection Act, the interactions between the Code and ERISA are difficult, and we need to make corrections of drafting areas in other aspects of the law that come to light after the bill is passed. That is why we are here today. 
   We need to act quickly. The Pension Protection Act became effective more than 6 months ago, imposing sweeping reforms that affect how employers fund the promises that they make to their employees in the defined benefit pensions. In addition, the bill includes many significant reforms to multi-employers' pension plans that cover union workers. 
   Three months ago, this House unanimously passed a bill that included many of the provisions that are before us this morning, but that bill did not address several key issues of special importance to those employers who continue to weather the storm and are persistently committed to providing a secured lifetime pension benefit to workers. 
   At that time, there was a bipartisan agreement that Congress needed to take further action. It is important that we are here today to complete our work because American workers are anxious about their retirement security. 
   In April, the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that worker confidence in their financial prospects for retirement have reached a 7-year low. Their 2008 Retirement Confidence Survey found only 18 percent of workers very confident they will have enough money to live comfortably through their retirement years. This is down from 27 percent 1 year ago, a drop of nearly a third. 
   I commend the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee for bringing a bill to the floor that gives both public and private sector defined benefit plans the added clarity they need to comply with the Pension Protection Act.     
   Let me also extend thanks to the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, the Education and Labor Committee and their counterparts in the Senate. Their hard work brings us to this point with a bill that provides the needed clarifications of congressional intent that the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service need to implement the provisions of the Pension Protection Act. 
   Today we also have an opportunity to pass a bill that will help the beneficiary of a 401(k) plan who would like to keep the money for retirement savings since the bill before us clarifies the application of a non-spousal rollover provision and the construction worker whose pension may experience underfunding since this bill also clarifies how the notice he or she will get alerts him or her to any benefit reductions. 
   I want to speak for a minute about the asset smoothing provision of this bill, which I believe is substantively very important. Importantly, H.R. 6382 does not leave the gaps that were not included in this bill in this body when it passed a few months ago, because the bill before us today gives relief to plan sponsors from volatility in plan costs faced by employers who provide defined benefit pensions. 
   It allows plan sponsors to use a tool called ``asset smoothing'' to balance out the ups and downs that occur with investments. Several months ago, one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle called on this body to pass asset smoothing quickly. Today we have that opportunity. 
   As we have seen a sharp market downturn occur in the stock market, this tool becomes even more important to help employers plan for pension expenses. With this clarification of congressional intent, employers will not be forced to base pension plan contributions on shifting marked-to-market values. For some large employers, this can mean a difference of several million dollars. Our economy has gone through a patch where over 400,000 jobs have been lost in the last 6 months alone. We do not want to put employers in this pinch between providing pensions or keeping employees on their jobs. 
   Some might think if the employer has to put more money in the pension, it is really a great thing for workers. But there is an important hitch to this consideration. Our Nation's pension plan is a voluntary system and employers can decide that offering a pension simply no longer makes good business sense. 
   We have businesses struggling in this recession. Many plans have been frozen as employers ask, can we continue to provide pension plan coverage? 3.3 million workers have seen their benefit plans frozen in some way, and, unfortunately, when the Department of Labor analyzed the Pension Protection Act, they conducted no research on whether the new stringent funding requirements would accelerate the freezing of pension plans. I believe there is no question the Pension Protection Plan has accelerated the freezing of pension plans, and if we don't pass this act and that smoothing provision in this technical corrections bill, more plans will be frozen. 
   Another important fix included in this bill is the defined benefit pension plans that State and local governments offer their employers. These public plans were caught in the provisions of a Pension Protection Act designed only to cover cash balance conversions. It was never intended to apply to public pension plans. But, unfortunately, the Treasury Department has held that the credited interest provision of public pension plans is limited to a rate no greater than a market rate of return. 
   Under long-existing law that has been in place for decades, the public plans themselves and the political subdivisions or States that sponsor those plans determined what the credited interest rate would be. As a former employee of the State of North Dakota, for example, I have a credited rate of interest on a pension accrual that I had, a vested pension benefit that I have, of 7.5 percent that was determined by the State of North Dakota. It ought to be recognized, as it has been in the past. But under the Treasury provision, no greater than market rate of return would be allowed. 
   Well, public plans not subject to ERISA, but with their unique protections and plan designs, should benefit from this clarification to ensure rates of interest provided by State and local governments. Who in the world are we in Congress, without even thinking that this applied to public pension plans in the first place, to say what the credited rate of interest should be? We have got to trust State and local political subdivisions with this call, and this bill fixes that problem. 
   In conclusion, just let me say that American workers are anxious about their retirement security. Today, Congress can act to address and reduce this uneasiness. It is a very important technical fix before us, and I urge its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1260, a bill that recognizes June 2008 as National Internet Safety Month, and supports helping all citizens, especially our children, to learn more about being safe and responsible online. 
   The Internet is truly transformational technology that over 21 million teens--87 percent of kids across the Nation--take advantage of everyday. While this technology has presented our children with unprecedented opportunities, it has also presented our kids with new dangers. 
   Just as we tell our kids not to talk to strangers when we send them off to school, the digital age now requires us to give our children the same warning when they log on to the Internet. Parents, educators, Internet safety organizations, and law enforcement have taken extraordinary measures to proactively help our children avoid the dangers that exist on the Internet, and we must continue to increase our efforts to raise the level of awareness for the need for online safety. 
   I have long been a strong supporter of internet safety efforts, and I believe that Congress must continuously update our laws to keep our children safe from sexual predators who would exploit our children with this technology. I strongly urge you to support House Resolution 1260 to make sure that all citizens know about the importance of online safety.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, and urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL and Subcommittee Chairman LEVIN for their hard work on the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Through their leadership, for the first time in U.S. trade policy, the trade agreement we are considering today incorporates internationally recognized labor and environmental standards and other key priorities. This was a major achievement and I am pleased that this new Congress has pushed forward a trade policy that will expand and shape trade in ways that spread the benefits of globalization here and abroad by raising standards. Congress is resuming its proper role as an active and full participant in the development of U.S. trade policy. 
   Under these circumstances, a new approach to trade policy--one that better reflects American values and spreads the benefits of globalization broadly--is especially critical. This is the kind of approach that we have long espoused and will begin to implement with the Peru FTA. Once enacted into law, this FTA will lock in these gains and give us a basis to build on in the future. 
   Central among the changes to our current trade policy is a new bipartisan commitment to the inclusion of a fully enforceable commitment that countries adopt and enforce the five basic international labor standards in all future trade agreements. This includes the freedom of association; right to collective bargaining; elimination of forced and compulsory labor; abolition of child labor; and elimination of employment discrimination. 
   I think it is particularly important to note the importance of what we have established with this trade agreement by way of a labor template. The Peru FTA includes basic worker rights, because workers must be a key part of the trade equation. Accordingly, for the first time in any U.S. free trade agreement, the Peru FTA includes protections for the basic rights of workers in its core text. It also prohibits Peru from lowering its labor standards in the future. It also makes these labor obligations subject to the same dispute settlement processes and remedies as all other provisions in the FTA. If Peru fails to enforce fundamental labor rights, or fails to enforce its labor laws, the U.S. Government can sue Peru for not complying with the Agreement. These are the real labor standards that are applied by the International Labor Organization (ILO)--the exact standards we have sought for more than a decade. Notably, Peru has already changed its legal framework to comply with the FTA. 
   I urge my colleagues in joining me in voting ``yes'' for the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (INTERNATIONAL FOOD CRISIS AND HAITI -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, we are in the midst of a global food crisis. Rising food prices are negatively affecting the world's poorest people, who frequently spend 80 percent of their income on food. As a result, the world's most vulnerable populations, including an entire generation of children, are fighting malnutrition every day. Riots and social unrest all over the world over food prices are indicative of the acute nature of this problem. The time to act is now. 
   Over the last 50 years, the United States has been the leader in international food aid. We have been able to sustain this role even during eras that were extremely tough on foreign aid. This doesn't mean that the structure can't be improved, but I do believe it is a strong testament to the current structure. 
   Through the Food, Conservation and Security Act of 2008, also known as the farm bill, we look to address this global crisis by helping to fight hunger and provide food assistance around the world. The farm bill does this by increasing oversight and monitoring of food aid programs. It requires the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to increase the use of program monitors, conduct more evaluations of food aid impact, and implement best practices for food aid delivery. The farm bill will also allow USAID to pre-position more food overseas to respond to disasters more quickly. With greater attention toward identifying food shortages earlier, the food aid programs can reach people in need and respond before crises worsen. 
   I am also very proud to say that the farm bill establishes a $60 million pilot program for local or regional purchases of food aid. This pilot program provides the opportunity for local purchases of food aid commodities while ensuring that the purchases do not cause dramatic price increases or exacerbate shortages overseas. 
   While I am extremely proud of what we have been able to accomplish through the farm bill, this is a serious situation that we must continue to address. As a member of the House Hunger Caucus, I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the issue of world hunger.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in this Special Order. I want to congratulate you and all who have impacted the national defense authorization bill we will be voting on towards the end of the week. 
   You know, the principles of sound budgeting have got to apply to the administration of our government, and that means all facets of our government. We have had leadership at the White House that has basically said we can have a war, and we are going to have it off budget. We don't have to account for it in terms of our efforts toward reaching a balanced budget, our efforts in terms of reducing the deficit. We are going to have it off budget.     
   All it means is our kids are picking up every nickel of this war, as it goes straight on the national debt. That is why I appreciate the principles advanced by the Blue Dogs in H. Res. 97, the Operation Iraqi Freedom Cost Accountability Act, and I applaud you and all who worked so hard to get major portions of it included in the Defense Authorization Act. 
   The four significant provisions of the bill: transparency in how the war funds are being spent. This isn't a black-box proposition. The money is appropriated; the money flows. Where does it flow? 
   I believe we have at the rate of $2 billion per-week burn rate, we are entitled to know. We are entitled to know in much greater detail than we have had before. The Blue Dogs would go so far as to have a Truman Commission looking at war profiteering. 
   If in the depths of World War II, the face-down with Hitler, we could recognize that there were inappropriate funds being spent and worked to get a handle around them, as Senator Truman led with his committee, certainly the same holds true with the war on terror and with Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   There is a book that I recommend and bring to your attention, ``Imperial Life in the Emerald City.'' It is an outstanding inside account of the administration of the Green Zone in the early days after the conflict and into this postwar period in Iraq. It will raise in your mind, as it has raised in mine, any number of deep and troubling questions about how this whole matter has been administered, and that goes to war contracting, and that means we need to take a thorough look at all of that. 
   Part three of H. Res. 97, running the future funding of this war through the regular appropriations process, a principle adopted now both in the budget and the Defense Authorization Act, and the fourth essential component of this bill, moving greater Iraqi responsibility for their policing and security. 
   Now we have a unanimous vote of the Armed Services Committee with the defense authorization bill, and I believe the Blue Dogs can be very happy that the principle of funding this war through the normal appropriations process and greater transparency in how the funds are spent will be the policy of this House, a policy adopted I am happy to say with bipartisan measures. 
   The essential management goals for this war will have to be established by the Department of Defense, and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction will have a much greater say in bringing information on the expenditure of these dollars to this body. There have been efforts, frankly, to hamstring the Inspector General. We make clear in this legislation that the Inspector General's authority goes towards reconstruction funding regardless of the source or the fiscal year. We need to expand our efforts to get a handle on how in the world we have spent to date nearly $400 billion, and the tab flowing just as fast as ever. 
   I think that this represents an important Blue Dog accomplishment. I look forward to voting on the defense authorization bill. Rather than take further time, I ask that JIM MARSHALL, a member of the Ranger Hall of Fame, a member of the defense authorization committee, be one that might further expand in this area. Obviously, his credentials are extremely well established. 
   I would just conclude by saying that the Blue Dogs have stood for accounting principles and solid budgeting in the administration of this war, and we have prevailed with the bill coming out of the Armed Services Committee.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I'm from North Dakota. I can understand why someone from Virginia would want the State of Virginia to get a lot of money for drilling more than 50 miles out, but you know, from where I come from, when you're past 50 miles off the coast, I'm not thinking of Virginia; I'm thinking of ocean. When you're dealing with leases owned by the United States of America, I think of resources that ought to come to the United States of America. 
   By the time this administration is done bailing out Wall Street, we may be looking at a fiscal deficit this year of $500 billion. Sure, it would be nice to just cut a big, old slice and give it to States here or to States there, but what about the Federal Treasury for heaven's sake? 
   I'm from a State that has got some oil. I'm very proud of what's going on in North Dakota. We've got a play called the Bakken shale play. They estimate there are 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil, some of it on U.S. leased land. North Dakota is not getting a big, old slice of that, but we're sure generating a lot of economic activity. Man, it's making our State's economy hum, and the economic activity of this drilling off the coast is going to make a lot of the economies of these States hum. 
   I can sure understand. Look, if I were from Virginia, I'd be saying, ``Hey, give us some money. Give us some of this.'' I understand that, but as a Nation, this year alone, it's going to run potentially $500 billion in the red. Don't you think we have some responsibility to our Nation, to all of the States and to our children? 
   You know, I like this bill, in my coming from an energy State, because it has got so many things in here that are positive. I mentioned our contribution in oil, but we also have a major wind dimension to our State. They call us the Saudi Arabia of wind. If you've ever been up to the high prairies of North Dakota, you'd know what they're talking about. We need to continue the tax support for the drilling-wind energy, and it's in this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my friend, the chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee, the former chairman, now ranking member of the Oversight Subcommittee, for bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor. 
   There are a couple of features I wish to speak to: one, we prohibit use of misleading Internet names. I want to show you why I think that is important. 
   This is Departmentofthetreasury.com. You pull it up and it looks like an official Web page of the Federal Government. However, the second page on this same domain name shows Departmentofthetreasury.com is for sale. Basically, departmentofthetreasury.gov is the protected government name, and dot-com is a private name that preys upon the public believing they are communicating with the Federal Government, and they are not. 
   Now, I think we ought to take some exception to the marketing ``Departmentofthetreasury.com is for sale.'' That is a public name. It is owned by the American people. You can't sell something you don't own, and that is a name appropriately reserved reflecting the Department of Treasury of this country, and nobody should be allowed to make a plug nickel on it. 
   Here is some body of information showing just how lucrative it might be for those who want to prey upon the public using Federal names. There is a domain site called IRS.com, and inconceivably to me, they rang the bell as some prized business concern in the American Stock Exchange this morning. Well, I think a business that preys upon the public with misleading domain names is no business you want to celebrate in ringing the bell of a great stock exchange. 
   In fact, public reports, as reported in the New York Times today, show that their revenues jumped from $17.5 in 2005 to $25.6 million after IRS.com paid $12.9 million for that domain name. I have pulled up IRS.com. Some would say there is clear disclosure; this is not a public site. IRS.com has IRS. It has tax information, and in little tiny, flyspeck language it has the disclosure. It is deliberately built to deceive, and in fact one survey showed that 40 percent of those accessing the site thought it was a Federal site. And even after seeing it, one-third thought it was a Federal site. But they use this site to market information to taxpayers. 
   Just to conclude, the business plan of these enterprises to get people to the site, they then have other services offered on the site. The domain holder, IRS.com, is paid for each link accessed by a member of the public. Some of the things sold on that site represent very low value: refund anticipation loans or expensive tax preparation services. This is a fraud on the public, and we ought to put an end to it. 
   I also appreciate what we are doing, turning up the heat on these refund anticipation loans, or RALs. To me, they represent an exceedingly poor value to the American public. In fact, such a poor value that I can't believe people are accessing them if they knew the facts and knew the costs. The commissioner has identified some of the practices as predatory lending in testimony to the committee. I like giving the Treasury Department authority to deal with people engaged in predatory lending practices. I urge passage of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in favor of moving the Pension Technical Corrections Act of 2008 forward in an expedited manner. The bill is most needed by employers who are committed to providing their employees with a financially secure retirement through a defined benefit plan. 
   Why do we need this bill? Why do we need to act this quickly? Let me just break it down for you. 
   On August 17, 2006, the President signed into law the Pension Protection Act. This bill imposed sweeping reform affecting how employers fund their defined benefits plans maintained for their employees. In addition, the bill imposed significant reforms for pension plans offered to many union workers who participated in multi-employer plans. 
   However, many provisions in the PPA became effective on January 1 of this year. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service cannot implement many of these provisions because they need further clarification of congressional intent. This bill provides the needed clarification for the Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, corporations and other businesses who sponsor retirement plans, as well as working families who contribute to and benefit from 401(k) plans or defined contribution plans. 
   For the employers who have weathered the storm and are persistently committed to providing a secured retirement for their workers, this bill is for you. For the beneficiary of a 401(k) plan who wants to keep money in a retirement plan savings vehicle to finance retirement rather than being forced to spend it currently, this bill is for you. This bill provides clarification for the correct application of the non-spousal rollover provision. 
   For the construction worker whose plan may be experiencing underfunding and could be subject to a benefit reduction, this bill will make it clear when the plan must provide you with the notice alerting you of the plan's funding status. It would also clarify whether you are subject to such a reduction in pension benefits. 
   You see, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about quality-of-life issues for working families and about helping those employers who want to help their employees provide for a financially secure retirement. 
   I encourage my colleagues in this body and in the Senate to keep this bill clean and move it quickly. I encourage them to join me in doing what we were sent here by our constituents to do, provide legislation to help improve their lives. Let's pass this bill and get it to the President before the end of the month, because people are waiting. We have kept them waiting long enough.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As we have just made formally a matter of record, the Pension Protection Act was an imperfect piece of legislation. This technically corrects, not substantively changes, but technically corrects an imperfect bill. It should go forward.  
   We should be doing more, Mr. Speaker, and this is where I want to spend the balance of my time tonight. I am almost shaking with anger at what we are not doing to correct the Pension Protection Act before it will have a very negative impact on the very working people that we talk so much about trying to help. I will give you a couple of examples. 
   There is a provision in the bill, never discussed, that inadvertently changes funding requirements for public pension plans. A plan like the State of North Dakota offers for its employees has a rate of 7.5 percent. Well, the Pension Protection Act in its present form requires them to credit interest at no greater than market rate. Without correction, we are going to have State legislatures reducing the interest credited for their public employees under fully funded public plans. It makes no sense. It needs fixing. It is a mistake. But we can't get the critical people in the critical committees to agree to fixing this. 
   Let's make no mistake about who we are talking about. We are talking about the Education and Labor Committee and we are talking about the Ways and Means Committee. Those are the committees of jurisdiction. We have not been able to get critical an agreement between the leadership of those committees and ranking members on fixing this public provision. And, as a result, for no reason whatsoever, other than an act of Congress that wasn't meant to have this impact, people may have their pensions reduced by Federal requirement. 
   I want those workers to know, Congress didn't mean to do this. But Congress knows that that is the effect of the law we passed, and this is a Congress that can't fix it in a timely fashion because we haven't had the will, we haven't had the time to think about it. We don't care enough. Because of the inattention of this body, if workers are forced to take lower credited interest in these public plans, these workers get less of a pension, and for no reason whatsoever. 
   There is another provision we should be fixing. These provisions are a little more than technical, so maybe should have been another bill, maybe not under the technical corrections act, but a bill we could have brought like tonight under the suspension calendar, a bill to address funding in a reasonable way. 
   You know, a pension is paid over many, many years. Yet the funding balance is determined by things that capture where the stock market is today, what the interest rate is today. Now, that can give you a pretty dire picture if you have got a stock market that is tanking and a low interest rate environment. It may look suddenly like forevermore the plan isn't going to earn much money on its assets. 
   Now, we know that the interest rate is going to change and we know the stock market valuation is going to change. So if you project 30 years based on today's picture, you are going to be coming up with a wrong number. There is something called asset smoothing that lets you basically average a bit so that a bad picture today doesn't mean a draconian funding requirement upon the employer to meet what looks like a funding requirement that is not in fact reality.     
   Now, some might think, well, gosh, if the employer has to put in more money than is really needed that just is a good thing for workers because that means there will be a lot of money in there, and in no way will that solve it. There is a hitch to this. Employers do not have to fund pension plans. Employers can freeze pension plans. They can get out of the pension business. In fact, my friends, 99 pensions have frozen since we passed the Pension Protection Act. 
   Here in a recession, where we have got businesses struggling, they are going to have to pony up on their pensions beyond what they ever have before because in the pension protection act we have got much stiffer funding requirements. Smoothing, which many of us intended to be in this bill, is not in the bill, and we need to add it to the bill. 
   But this Congress, failing to act, is going to leave employers to pay the full bill, no smoothing help. I truly believe, just as I stand here, that there will be plans deciding to freeze, workers losing their pensions because in this time, before we go out on break, we don't address smoothing.

   Mr. POMEROY. Reclaiming my time before I run out of time, this is a pox on both parties. Both parties passed it, and both parties have failed to fix it. 
   I believe the failure, relative to getting this fixed, is on both parties. But the majority party carries a disproportionate burden because we are the majority party. 
   I could not be more disappointed. 
   Getting back to the point I was making about frozen plans, I believe plans will freeze and workers will lose their pensions because asset smoothing is not addressed on the suspension calendar before we go out, before this critical April 15 deadline for pension funding. 
   This is completely unacceptable. It's incompetent, and I am ashamed of this House in failing to address this before we leave. I hope that I have made some people angry by these comments. I have intended to. 
   We need to get after this, and we need to get after it when we are back. If we don't get after it, I assure you, I will be having more of these speeches, because those who pretend to protect the world, the world's workers, when what they are doing is protecting these workers out of their very pensions, the very thing they need for retirement, income security. They are not doing anybody any favors. The games have got to end. The posture has got to end. We have got to fix problems and fix them in a timely way and shame on us if we have fallen short. 
   Let me get back to the bill before us, because it's important. The bill before us is a technical corrections act. This one needs to pass. This is fine. 
   The problem is, there is so much more that needed to be done, that could have been done on a suspension calendar tonight and tomorrow. We didn't do it, and we need to do it in short order when we get back.

   Mr. POMEROY. This is a photograph of Major Alan Johnson, his wife, Tori, and his daughter, Megan. This beautiful family suffered the tragedy of losing Major Johnson in Iraq. Last winter, we buried Major Johnson at Arlington Cemetery. His widow contacted me 2 weeks later to tell me that what had happened in the State of Washington is the pension plan there had simply given the money back that Alan Johnson had paid in as if he had terminated his employment at the time he was called to duty, called to deployment in his status as a Reserve officer. 
   It brought to light a gap in the law that protects our deployed Reservists and Guardsmen. When they come back, this law seamlessly reintegrates them into the pension plan of their employer, but there was no provision if we tragically lose our soldiers under deployment. Included in this bill is the HEROES Act, introduced by Doc Hastings and myself, that allows for survivor benefits to be paid in this situation. It is a very important addition. It is terribly important that survivors of our soldiers who paid the ultimate price have survivors benefits under the pension. This law will afford that. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a letter to this effect from Mrs. Tori Johnson.

   Mr. POMEROY. I thank my friend, the chairman, for yielding. 
   I want to begin by acknowledging the work Paul Gillmor put into this legislation. He and I were the original cosponsors. He was a colleague with whom I worked on a variety of initiatives trying to keep our children safe against those who would prey upon them through the Internet. We miss Paul, but his efforts and his work continue with this legislation. 
   I agree with the words of the chairman in the facet of this bill relating to grooming, and I think stiffening the sentences for those convicted of engaging in deceptive behavior relative to lying about their age to incur the trust of minors with whom they're interacting on the Internet, making that an item that would bring them longer prison time when convicted is a positive clarification to this bill, probably better than the original bill. 
   There is a feature of the bill that was left out, that I'm quite disappointed at, and work is going to need to continue on this one, and that is, helping these Internet sites keep sexual predators off in the first place. 
   We have a number of provisions in our code dealing with what's required of high-risk sexual predators, and I believe it would be appropriate to have a voluntary registry where their names would be required to be on file, and social networking sites could keep them off of their site. 
   I want to especially commend the efforts of MySpace, one of the most popular sites out there, for the extraordinary efforts they've gone to to identify sex predators and keep them off the site; 29,000 are blocked from participating on the MySpace domain because of their efforts, and I think the Federal Government ought to do more to help them. That's work in progress. A lot of bills that come to the floor aren't perfect, at least at this iteration in the legislative process, so this is an aspect of this bill I want to continue to work on. 
   There are a couple of other things that I think are very useful, and that is the authorization of funds to step up the supervision of the Internet activities of high-risk sexual predators, as well as the portion that criminalizes financial facilitation of child pornography. If there is a banker making a buck by basically facilitating the credit card transactions on child pornography over the Internet, that is not an acceptable business practice. It is so not acceptable that we are criminalizing it, and I hope they get that message loud and clear. 
   We've worked a lot with the Judiciary Committee on this bill. I think the chairman's comments about higher sentences aren't something that he is often willing to put in a code. I think that he has been fair-minded in this, and I look forward to continuing to work with him as we get this legislation where it needs to be. 
   Thank you. This is a positive bill. I urge Members to vote for it.

   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I doubt our departed sister, Stephanie, would ever have imagined the impact she had. In fact, the Cleveland Plain Dealer referenced her essential humility even when mentioning her personal electricity in this editorial of August 22: 
   ``I have no illusions about myself,'' Tubbs Jones told the Plain Dealer reporter Fran Henry in 1995. ``It could all go up in a puff of smoke. I'll never lose sight of that.'' 
   Stephanie's presence on Earth has come so tragically to an all too early end, but her achievements--rising from the daughter of a factory worker and skycap to the positions of judge, county prosecutor, five-term Member of Congress--have made a lasting impact at each and every step along the way, especially with the many, many lives she touched. 
   I was privileged to sit by her on the Ways and Means Committee. You could probably call us the odd couple--a reserved, middle-aged man from the most rural part of our country, teamed with the most energetic, charismatic, bombastic, thoroughly urban Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   Over the years, on our committee together, I came to fully understand just how deep and how genuine her passion for others was, especially for those less fortunate, for those needing help. We'd joke about taking turns keeping each other settled down even under considerable provocation sometimes in Ways and Means debate. My counsel of ``take it easy, Stephanie'' would be met in turn with ``now settle down, Earl.'' In one hearing on inexcusable Social Security delays, we both just lost it entirely. I'll never forget that hearing; it's one of my favorites. 
   One of the greatest compliments I've had in this Congress, in any Congress I've served in, was when she'd call me her country boyfriend. She had the most incredible way of making those she met feel better. In the place where smiles, laughter and deep compassion are never in sufficient supply, Stephanie Tubbs Jones will be deeply, deeply missed but never forgotten.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the Speaker. 
   We agree that under normal circumstances a farm bill considered at this time ought to be scored on the March, 2008, baseline. But let me emphatically emphasize there has been nothing normal about the development of this farm bill. 
   We're moving into our 17th month of intensive work on this farm bill. I'm telling you we have encountered every barrier you can possibly imagine, and we are almost done. We have almost got this to conference committee and to the floor. As the majority leader indicated, we are hopeful it will be on the floor next week. 
   During the period of time we have been working on this bill, the House passed this farm bill July 27, 2007, and it took nearly 5 months in addition before the Senate passed its bill, December 14, 2007. If they would have gotten their bill done earlier, we probably could have concluded this. This wouldn't even have come up. We would have had the farm bill out of here by now. The Senate-passed bill, however, is 1,876 pages long; the House bill, 160 pages long. That alone will tell you we had an awful lot of work to reconcile these two bills. 
   The Senate uses a different rule relative to determining baseline, a rule used by the House in the construction of the 1996 farm bill as well as the 2002 farm bill. This principle is pretty simple: If you have done most of the work on the legislation under the old baseline, you can conclude the work. It would undo everything to suddenly have the new scoring requirement. And if the Senate didn't go along, you would have the crazy situation of trying to do one baseline for the House, another baseline for the Senate, trying to meld those in conference committee, and you will never get this thing done. 
   So the gentleman's motion to instruct has an intellectual basis for it, but the reality of this farm bill is we have worked now 17 months building the bill, most of that time under the 2007 farm bill. When we passed the bill in the House, we had no idea what the 2008 baseline would be; so it's not like  we were forum shopping or trying to pick the most lenient number. It was just the only way we could proceed. And if we would at this point in time do a baseline shift, I'm telling you this project, so close to home, gets put back to square one. 
   I have asked my friend and colleague Chairman John SPRATT to join me in this discussion because, obviously, when it comes to budget matters, he has broad respect across both sides of the aisle and I believe he can advance a more detailed discussion on some of the rules at issue as we respond in opposition to the motion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I would just like to point out one quick thing. This is what PAYGO accomplishes. In 2002, pay-as-you-go budget discipline was allowed to expire. The farm bill, when it was passed, added to the baseline $73.5 billion. I believe the gentleman from Wisconsin voted for that farm bill. I did. 
   Now we have an important restoration of pay-as-you-go discipline, and under the 2007 baseline we have accounted for every dollar of spending in this farm bill. No deficit added, no deepening of the deficit, as figured on the 2007 baseline, compared to a very, very different situation in the 2002 farm bill. 
   So the gentleman's motion involves, in my view, pointing out that this might not technically jibe with the House rule. I believe that we have learned a lesson from the gentleman's motion. We ought to have our rule like the old rule where the baseline on a discretionary call by the Budget Chair can continue to be the baseline under which you drafted the legislation, because otherwise all of this work could be lost. We need to get this bill done. And we are this close to getting it done. 
   So with respect to my friend, Mr. Ryan, I would urge that we reject the motion. I will let this statement serve as the close. Let the Ag Committee finish its work; let's pass the farm bill. Let's reject this motion to instruct. 
   I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, this debate has been quite extraordinary for my friends on the other side of the aisle. They create a picture of great concern: poor, poor oil companies. Oil priced globally at over a hundred dollars a barrel. Prices at the pump approaching record levels, certain to hit record levels at the time the North Dakota farmers have to go to plant their crops. Oil companies reporting record profits. Now, not just record profits relative to their earnings and profits of years past. I mean with ExxonMobil, the biggest profit ever posted by a corporation in history. 
   And yet, when we look at trying to break this stranglehold on imported oil and build renewable sources of energy so that our economy is not so dangerously dependent upon imported oil, we look to using as a pay-for for these renewable energy incentives a tax provision exploited by oil companies beyond what was ever intended by the Ways and Means Committee. You have the White House threatening veto. You have House Republicans screaming tax increase. I'll tell you, that is an energy policy completely out of gas. We need to move, and move now, to renewable sources. 
   Take, for example, one, wind power. You know, we are now into a period of time where the wind production tax credit expires at the end of this year. The consequence relative to new products put online is already going to be felt. A recent study by the Solar Energy Industry Association, American Wind Energy Association estimates that if this credit expires, it will cost 6,000 megawatts of new wind energy production, nearly 77,000 jobs, 11.5 billion in economic impact, all in 2009. 
   This is the group on the other side when they were in the majority that allowed the wind production tax credit to expire three times since 1999. They extended it an additional five times. Now, how in the world can we build a renewable energy system when you have got a tax credit that maybe there isn't there, you can never get your financials right, to make the move this country must make to renewables with wind power playing the major role. 
   We need to pass this bill and break this lock that oil companies have had on policies coming out of this Chamber.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are in a time where there is a complete fascination in this administration with contracting out. If you are happy with Blackwater in Iraq, then I expect you are perfectly fine with contracting the debt collection of IRS debt to private bill collectors. But there are some essential facts at issue which should give us pause to reconsider. 
   First, the start-up costs. We were told, in testimony by the IRS Commissioner, this venture was going to cost about $14 million to get up and running. The tab so far, $70 million, five times the anticipated cost to begin this venture. 
   Now, you might say, well, okay, start-up costs are a little more than expected, but how are we doing on receipts now that we have got them fully going, collecting these receipts? We don't have a very good story on that one either. 
   It was anticipated that $46 million to maybe $63 million would be collected. Coming in at about half of that anticipation, $32 million in. It costs five times more to start and bringing in about half as much as advertised.  
   Well, okay, $32 million. It still sounds like a lot. Well, not really when you consider the fact they have been given 118,000 cases with an unpaid debt of $512 million. For the kind of money we have invested, do you know what we are getting back? We are getting about a 6 percent return from this experiment in private debt collection. 
   You might be asking yourself, look, there must be some more efficient way to do this. Well, there sure is. Let's fund the IRS, hire, train, manage the debt collection. My gosh, if there is one government responsibility, it ought to be in making certain that the revenue owed is the revenue raised. 
   And the statistics show by the IRS themselves that for $1 spent on IRS staff collecting debt, you get a 20 to 1 return, $20 back for every $1 spent. Private debt collection, the IRS again projecting, at best, $4 back for every $1 spent. That's $20 if we hire to $1 spent, $4 if we hire to every $1 spent under contracting. And that's their projection. 
   Look, at $32 million collected and $70 million spent, we are collecting 50 cents for every dollar spent so far. That's pretty bad business. If we had spent the $71 million to hire a Federal collection staff, we would have already collected $1.4 billion. That is the total amount they project over 10 years under this experiment of private debt collection. 
   I sit on the Ways and Means Committee. And as we considered this notion before it became operative, I thought this is the most expensive way to do this. It reminded me of that $600 toilet seat that the Department of Defense paid for awhile back. I call this a $600 toilet seat of tax collection. Well, when you look at it, they have taken $70 million to build this gold-plated throne and they flushed away $50 million on this foolish experiment. 
   There are many reasons to end this ill-advised endeavor, and the speakers we present are going to offer those reasons. But the fundamental is it's a matter of dollars and sense, and this don't make sense. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, the unrefuted data is that IRS collection with IRS staff is five times more efficient in terms of dollars received than contracting out. If we are worrying about IRS efficiency, do it on the staff model. 
   And I might say that their cost estimate about this bill contemplates that the IRS would hire no staff, would just forget hiring out contractors, hire no staff, and just walk away from them. 
   No. We have got a very different notion. We want to take the money we are sending to these private bill collectors and hire IRS staff that are going to collect on this five-to-one ratio. We have got a much better, more efficient model to address this issue of unpaid balances owed to the United States.

Of 300,000 conversations that have taken place, 1,000 were the subject of the survey for getting taxpayer satisfaction, and the private debt collectors were able to pick which ones got the survey. So a 1,000 survey sample out of a 300,000 universe, with those stakeholders picking the ones that get to say it, was not deemed as credible by the GAO and not deemed as credible by the majority on Ways and Means.

We believe for every IRS employee, we are going to collect $20. For every private debt collector, the optimistic projection is you are going to collect $4. The reality has been much less than that. So when we are talking about the issue before us, what is the best way to get the money we are owed? The best way to do it is hire the personnel, train the personnel, run an IRS capable of getting its job done.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, my friend is an articulate and forceful advocate. And we are all moved by the story of his time with the accountant, but they did not owe a tax. And basically, there is a figure missing from the motion to recommit he brings before us today, a very important figure: the cost of what the underlying motion to recommit would require. That figure is $498.8 billion. Now, we are a Nation of $9 trillion of debt, $9 trillion of debt, and they bring forward a proposal that would add another $498.8 billion, and they fail to say anything about how they are going to pay for it in their motion. 
   Well, obviously serious-minded legislators like my friend would not bring forward a serious proposal about repeal of the estate tax without some means of paying for it, and that is really what the heart of this motion is. It is not a real estate tax motion. This is a kill-the-underlying-bill motion. 
   The other side has some different priorities. Last week they were against SCHIP, expanding health insurance to uninsured kids. This week they are basically for privatizing debt collection of IRS debt. You like what Blackwater is doing in Iraq; you're going to love sending IRS debt to private bill collectors here.     
   Because they aren't going to prevail on the debate itself, they want to keep the vote from happening at all, which is what the underlying motion to recommit does, sends it promptly back to the Ways and Means Committee, which means the underlying bill is not before the House for a vote.

   This has been a very curious discussion, and statements made have no relation whatsoever to either reality or to history. 
   We just heard the pay-for in this bill described as a massive tax increase that will affect teachers in Texas. This bill goes after hedge fund managers, parking income in Bermuda bank accounts, exploiting tax loopholes and not paying what they owe. 
   The alternative is to do what the minority is suggesting, and that is just to borrow the money, borrow the money and let the kids worry about how they're going to pay it back in their day. Well, at least we have agreement we need to address the alternative minimum tax, but let me tell you why we're worried about borrowing the money. 
   Since President Bush took office, the gross national debt has increased nearly $3.5 trillion. At that rate of borrowing, do you know something? We will borrow an additional $57 million in the course of this debate. It is truly astounding the red ink that they've run this country into, and all we hear from them today is more borrowing, please. 
   You know, they had a chance during their tenure here to fix the alternative minimum tax. They say we shouldn't have to pay for it because it was never intended to act this way. Well, they had 7 years to fix this alternative minimum tax, and instead, you know what they did? They counted the revenue that was projected to come in on the alternative minimum tax to justify those tax cuts, those budget-busting tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 that have put us in this deficit ditch that we find ourselves in.

   A couple of things to respond to. 
   The matter before us involves a pay-for, because unlike much of the work of my friend, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, this majority pays for things that cost the Treasury. 
   Now, the HSA issue he just raised involves tax-free accounts and savings accounts to be used for health care. We ask that there be some verification to show the money withdrawn was spent for health care. That's all. What drives us to this is a report that we had from one account manager that shows these funds being withdrawn for everything from body shop repair to fast food restaurants.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Reclaiming my time, and I only have 2 minutes, this HSA, I believe the gentleman would agree, in fact I think he said it in his comments, is for the cost of health care. It gives a tax incentive cost, a tax assistance to taxpayers for health care costs, not for body shop costs. We don't tax incent body shop costs. So we would like to shut that abuse down. 
   The question is legitimately raised. Is this too onerous? Absolutely not. Many of us have flex savings accounts that are used for medical costs. Now,  all we ask is that the same verification any Federal employee uses when they make a withdrawal in their flex savings account would be used to substantiate withdrawal from the health savings account. This isn't inventing something new. We've done it. It works well. 
   Another feature of the bill that's drawn such objection is this business of putting out of business the whole notion of private bill collectors being loosed on our taxpayers to collect revenues owed the Federal Government.

   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I refer my colleagues to the Washington Post, the front page story today, ``Collectors cost IRS more than they raise.'' 
   We have had, in fact, kind of the bill collection version of the $600 toilet seat for the old Pentagon contract procurements. This was advertised to cost very little, $10 to $14 million, well now up to $70 million and counting, a multiple of what was initially advertised. That's the set-up cost. They said it was going to bring all of this money. Well, the reality is it has brought in only a fraction of the money advertised. 
   And so on a net basis, this whole initiative to bring in money owed us has cost us money. We've been shipping more money to contractors. This is an administration and this is a minority that loves private contractors. And if it costs the Federal Government on the net balance, it doesn't matter because they just so ideologically love private contractors. 
   We should pass this bill and end this failed experiment of private debt collection.

   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I want to begin my remarks by commending the fine job Mr. Reynolds has done today. He has indicated that this legislation uniquely affects him because many of the people at the Pioneer Call Center, a private debt collector hired to collect this debt, are in his district. And I think we all recognize he has done a fine job in fighting for that business activity in his district today. He has given it everything he has, and I commend him for the job he has done. 
   But the reality in the policy context is summed up in a simple headline in today's Washington Post, ``Collectors Cost IRS More Than They Raise.'' Why in the world would we want to continue with an arrangement like that? But there are many other parts of this bill that are simplifying the process and are helpful to taxpayers. And that is why we have the support of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers, the National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, Citizens for Tax Justice, National Consumer League, Consumer Federation of America, and a late-breaking one. In fact, this organization has been mentioned on both lists, the NFIB. 
   Mr. Reynolds has indicated they were opposed to the bill. This is probably a development that broke later than Mr. Reynolds' information. But in fact, they are for the bill and indicate in a ``key vote alert'' that they will be scoring this as a key vote. They indicate that the ``provisions in this legislation seek to enact simpler tax rules and reduce the paperwork burden associated with tax compliance.'' 
   They talk about a few provisions. One of them is that right now we have an onerous paperwork requirement on employers providing cell phones to employees for business purposes. I commend my Republican colleague on Ways and Means, Sam Johnson, for bringing this to our attention. I was pleased to cosponsor legislation with him now included in the bill that  makes this paperwork requirement go away.

   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And so including the Pomeroy-Johnson or the Johnson-Pomeroy bill in this I think was an important feature to the NFIB deliberation that this is indeed lessening paperwork requirements on small employers, and therefore they support it. They do cite a couple of other provisions, another provision of this legislation amending a recent change to the Tax Code that helps tax preparers better assist their clients by changing an established higher standard of reporting for preparers. That creates a potential conflict of interest between clients and themselves. That is addressed in this legislation. 
   And they also talk about the legislation including a 1-year delay of the implementation of the 3 percent withholding requirement by Federal, State and local governments on payments for goods and services which puts both an administrative burden on all parties involved and a strain on the daily operating cash flow of small businesses. There are other provisions, as well, but I appreciate the NFIB's laying them out as they have done on this letter. 
   In balance, this is a bill designed to help taxpayers. That is why we passed it out of the Ways and Means Committee. That is why it is before us on Tax Day. We urge its adoption.

   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, we have just obtained the motion in terms of trying to sort through the tax provisions, with an eye, among other things, to wondering whether or not people holding bonds of municipalities could suddenly find themselves with taxes they didn't think they were going to have when they bought these bonds. 
   Trying to work our way through these, one word jumped out on this motion to recommit that really has shut down all further analysis by us, and that is the word ``promptly,'' because this is yet another one of those motions to recommit that is designed for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to kill the bill they are trying to attach it to. That is because this would take the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act that we want to pass than April 15th and pack it off back to the Ways and Means Committee, dispensing any possibility of passing it off the floor today. It is a procedural move by the minority to try and stop us from moving forward with this legislation. 
   What is unfortunate about that is there are taxpayers that are going to be benefited, benefited substantially, by this legislation, small businesses that right now are subject to IRS audit exposure if they are not keeping detailed call records on cell phones that they give their employees. We want to take this relief away through this motion to recommit? I don't think so. 
   We go through so many positive, taxpayer-friendly provisions in this bill, provisions that have received the support of so many diverse organizations, from the League of Cities, Association of Mayors, NFIB and Consumers Federation of America, it would take that and take it off the table today, preventing the House from moving this forward. 
   Now, you think, why? What is the motive behind a motion like this? Why would they not want this taxpayer bill to move forward? Well, my friends, you can find it on the front page of today's Washington Post. Basically, they are trying everything they can to preserve private bill collectors hired by the IRS to chase after taxpayers. 
   So here on Tax Day, April 15th, we are trying to stop private bill collectors from going after taxpayers on behalf of the IRS, an endeavor that has cost taxpayers millions and brought in not enough by any measure to cover the cost; a forgone revenue opportunity of $81 million, testified by the Taxpayer Advocate, if we simply took the money we sent to these private contractors and hired employees to go ahead and collect that debt. But they are so completely convinced that they have got to pull every trick out of their hat to try and stop our efforts to rein in these private bill collectors that they brought this motion to recommit. 
   I would yield such time as I have remaining to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the chairman. The rhetoric is a little overblown against this bill, as it was the first time it was before us, as it was when we passed it on final passage. 
   The fact is, this bill spends billions less than the last farm bill. This bill increases the baseline on conservation, and this bill is the result of some of the best bipartisan activity I've seen in this place to develop and produce a fine product. It responds to the needs of consumers having a hard time buying their groceries with increased nutrition support. It responds to the struggles of family farmers meeting the incredibly high cost of getting their crop in with better risk protection, and it does so in a collaborative measure. 
   As my friend, Bob Goodlatte, said last week, this isn't Republicans voting for a Democrat farm bill, this is the parties coming together to build a strong collaborative product. 
   I urge us to override the President's veto of this very important bill for rural America.

   Mr. Speaker, I'm surprised to hear my Republican friends talk about their dismay that AMT is not in this package. AMT was not in the President's budget, not one nickel, not one cent. I never heard one word in the Ways and Means Committee, not a word that I can recall, of dismay from my Republicans that the President didn't address AMT. 
   This bill before us is to address a number of expiring provisions including energy. Good gosh, with oil approaching $130 a barrel, you would think we could bust out an energy portion and make an immediate response. The American people deserve no less. 
   Just take, for example, one provision: The wind production tax credit expires at the end of the year. But to be effective, a wind power plant has to be invested, constructed, and turning energy in order to qualify under the 2008 provision for the production tax credit. What that means in real terms is that already activity is being placed at risk. Financing packages are being denied for growing wind power in this country.     
   Our upside potential on harnessing power for wind is immense. But even the, I'd say paltry, 1-year extension under the bill, because this industry deserves much more than 1 year, is placed at risk now by Republican opposition. 
   Fundamentally, we believe if we are going to extend these tax provisions, we need to find revenue offsets so that we don't drive the deficit deeper. I think what this debate is really about is a very different vision. They're happy to just run up the debt even deeper by extending these provisions without the pay-fors. We refuse to do that. As important as these provisions are, we are not going to let our kids pay for them. We will pay for them right here and now by finding the appropriate offsets. 
   So for the interest of the people in this country in getting renewable energy sources, especially wind power, let's advance this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, it's with a great sense of sorrow that I rise to remember a prominent North Dakota journalist and friend, Terry DeVine, whose funeral was held today in Fargo. 
   If North Dakota had a hall of fame for journalists, Terry DeVine would go in by acclamation. He was tough, smart, hard working, and fair. Fortunately for us, he spent most of his career at the Fargo Forum, where over the years we came to know that he had a mighty big heart as well. 
   My indelible memories of Terry include his early years at the Forum, which coincided with my early years in politics. As if my first trip to the Fargo Forum, our State's largest newspaper, wasn't unnerving enough, there was hard-charging Terry DeVine, former collegiate football player, Marine Corps combat veteran. He presented a gruff demeanor that clearly conveyed ``Don't even think of trying to B.S. the Fargo Forum.'' 
   In fact, his journalist skepticism was a point of pride for Terry. After a politician sparked his ire by complaining about what he saw as the unnecessary intrusions of reporters in pursuit of a story, Terry wrote about the role of the press in holding officials accountable. ``The relationship between a reporter and a politician should be like the relationship between a barking dog and a chicken thief,'' he proudly quoted from his former colleague Jules Loh. 
   True to his writing, Terry relished the watchdog role of the press. I consider it a true privilege to have known and worked with Terry DeVine for nearly three decades. I came to admire not just his prowess at writing and running a newspaper but his unflagging intellectual curiosity, his deeply anchored sense of right and wrong, and his compassion for the ``average Joe.'' 
   The Terry we knew ran the gamut, from hard-charging city editor like a character out of ``Front Page'' in the early days to a quieter but steady leader through years of personal health adversity. His quick humor and core values never changed, and in his determined perseverance, he gave us the very best lessons of a remarkably dedicated and talented journalist. 
   I called him a week ago to say good-bye. I wanted to tell Terry of my respect for his career, my enjoyment of our visits over the years, and that in our dealings I felt he had always been fair. Whether I got all that across or not, I don't know. I'm not good at saying good-bye. But Terry, without a hint of self pity, thanked me for the call and he thanked me for our friendship. That was so like Terry: strong, direct, on point. 
   Terry DeVine's career has set a high bar for journalists in North Dakota. Come to think of it, he set a high bar for all of us. He had a life well lived, a career of distinction, and an impact that we will never forget. 
   God speed, Terry.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (MEDICARE IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ACT OF 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-131) -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This debate has a familiar feel. Once again the President has vetoed legislation important to rural America, legislation that was supported by a broad bipartisan consensus in this body. We saw the same thing in the farm bill, overrode him once, overrode him twice, and we need to override today as well. Those that argue that rural interests are best served by standing with the President's position on this are arguing that we ought to pay insurance companies more, cut doctors, cut hospitals and somehow this produces a better health result. It doesn't stand up. 
   This bill provides very important reimbursements, not just to physicians, but also to struggling rural facilities representing the infrastructure for health care in rural America. Passing this bill and overriding the veto addresses physician payments. It addresses critical-access hospitals. It addresses sole-community hospitals. It addresses rural ambulance services. It addresses rural pharmacies. That is why the Rural Health Care Association supports the bill. It is why the Rural Health Care Coalition supports the bill. Please vote to override.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of overriding the President's veto of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, legislation that strengthens the Medicare Program and maintains our commitment to rural America. 
   With an estimated 40 percent cuts in physician payment reductions under Medicare expected by 2016, Medicare's physician payment system is clearly broken. Because of the flawed Sustainable Growth Rate, 2008 Medicare physician payment rates are about the same as they were in 2001. This has prevented some physicians and the hospitals who employ them from making needed investments in staff and health information technology as well as created a great deal of uncertainty and instability for physicians and hospitals as they run their businesses. 
   H.R. 6331 takes an important step forward by reversing these previously scheduled cuts in Medicare payments over the next 18 months while also providing a 1.1 percent update for 2009. This translates to at least $30 million for North Dakota's doctors and hospitals over the next year and a half, bringing relief for many of our struggling hospital systems. I am hopeful that these 18 months will give Congress the time it needs to make commonsense and much needed reforms to the SGR system so that North Dakota hospitals and doctors will have the fairness and stability in Medicare payments they deserve. 
   H.R. 6331 also makes a strong commitment to maintaining access to important rural health services by investing in $3 billion in our vulnerable rural health care delivery system. Rural America continues to be challenged by shortages of health care providers, barriers to health care access, and geographic isolation. In my own home State of North Dakota, approximately 80 percent of the State is designated as a partial or full county Health Professional Shortage Area. In order to address these unique challenges, the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) enacted special payment enhancements to make sure that rural health care facilities and providers have the resources they need to deliver quality care in their communities. 
   Unfortunately, many of these important provisions have expired and further assistance is needed to ensure that seniors living in rural America have access to quality, affordable health care. That is why Representative Greg Walden and I, as co-chairs of the bipartisan Rural Health Care Coalition, introduced H.R. 2860, the Health Care Access and Rural Equity (H-CARE) Act, legislation that addresses these and other barriers to quality health care by recognizing the unique characteristics of health care delivery in rural areas and assisting rural health care providers in their efforts to continue to provide quality care to rural Americans. 
   I am pleased that the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008 incorporates many important provisions from H-CARE that will do much to protect the fragile rural health care safety net. More specifically, MIPPA will do the following: 
   Ensure that rural doctors are paid the same rate for their work as their urban counterparts by extending the 1.0 work floor on the Medicare work geographic adjustment applied to physician payments through 2009, bringing in $9 million to North Dakota; 
   Improve Medicare reimbursements for Critical Access Hospitals by directly increasing payments for critical lab services performed outside the hospital that will benefit North Dakota's 34 CAHs; 
   Boost reimbursements to sole community hospitals by updating the data used to calculate their Medicare reimbursements; 
   Protect access to rural ambulance services by providing rural ambulance providers an additional three percent of their Medicare reimbursement in order to help cover their costs; 
   Require prompt payment to rural pharmacies by Medicare prescription drug plans; 
   Extend a provision that allows 19 North Dakota hospital-based labs to directly bill Medicare for pathology services; 
   Expand access to telehealth services by allowing hospital-based renal dialysis facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and community mental health centers to be reimbursed under Medicare for telehealth services; 
   Reauthorize and expand the FLEX Grant Program to include a new grant program that could mean up to $1 million to Richardton, North Dakota, as they convert from their status as a Critical Access Hospital; and 
   Extend Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act which provides nearly $10 million a year to North Dakota hospitals to give them the resources they need to compete in an increasingly competitive labor market. 
   The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act is a good bill that has been endorsed by the National Rural Health Association and deserves every Member's support.  We should quickly override this veto so that our health care providers can get back to their business of caring for our seniors without the uncertainty that has been hanging over their heads for the last 2 weeks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I am also very pleased to speak in favor of H.R. 2464, the Wakefield Act. 
   I wanted to bring you just a little bit of perspective in terms of the difference this act has made in one young man's life, and I think it's reflective of a number of children who have been saved by having medical appropriate services for traumatic and life-threatening injuries of kids. 
   The Wakefield Act is called the Wakefield Act in recognition of a living memory of a family, the family of Tom Wakefield, who was involved in a horrible head-on traffic accident as they drove to the airport for a winter's vacation. A vehicle crossed the median and struck this vehicle head on, killing Tom and two of his children, one age three and one age seven. Twelve-year-old Lucas lost his arm in the accident and was almost lost as well. 
   Emergency responders on the scene and thereafter saved his life and the life of his mother, Loy. I know this family, and I know their survivors, and I care deeply about them. They have certainly impressed upon me, as they would impress upon any of you, just how vitally important it is that we equip our emergency response to deal with any who may be hurt. And the 40 percent improvement in saving lives of children since the act was initially passed in 1984 shows just how critically important this reauthorization is. I'm very pleased that the Commerce Committee has done the work to bring it to the floor today, and I am grateful for the chance to speak on the bill. 
   I was at an event just this weekend where Lucas, now fully recovering, adapted to his new circumstance. This is a young man that makes me very, very proud. And I believe the Wakefield Act, named in honor of his family, is a very appropriate commendation of the ongoing efforts to keep all our children safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage the chairman in a colloquy and thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Chairman Oberstar, I rise to discuss an issue that is of critical importance to my district. At 1:39 a.m. on January 18, 2002, a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train derailed in Minot, North Dakota. The freight train derailed 31 freight cars, including 15 cars containing anhydrous ammonia. As a result of this accident, the people of Minot were exposed to the largest catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia in U.S. history. They were not at fault. They were sitting ducks in their own homes. 
   After the area cleared, one individual, John Grabinger, had died, and many, many others suffered injuries, including individuals who sustained second degree burns to their skin. And many others are still suffering from long-term permanent physical damage. 
   Some courts are ignoring congressional intent and denying Americans grievously injured in railroad accidents their rights under State law, even when it is undisputed that the cause of the accident was the railroad's wrongdoing. By preempting State law, these courts are leaving injured North Dakotans and others with no remedy at all, since the Federal Railroad Safety Act itself does not provide a remedy or cause of action for victims. 
   I just want to clarify with the chairman the intent of the language found in section 3 on the first page of the manager's amendment. Is it correct that this legislation clarifies that the Federal Rail Safety Act of 1970 does not and was never intended to preempt State law claims for damages?

   Mr. POMEROY. It is my understanding that until 1993, there was no question that State causes of actions were not preempted. The Supreme Court then said they could be, under some circumstances, and some courts since then have been broadening the railroads' immunity from liability under the auspices of preemption. Congress tried before to change the FRSA's preemptive scope, but courts didn't listen. Does this language reflect the fact that Congress never intended preemption of State causes of action?

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I respond to the constructive tone of the proponent of the motion to instruct with just a few words of explanation. 
   Essentially there are two risks that farmers cannot control. One of them is if the prices collapse. And we have seen prices collapse often in the years I have been in the House below the cost of raising the crop. In that circumstance, farmers need help. 
   We also see the risk of production failure where weather and natural disasters produce a broad crop failure. Well, the 2002 farm bill referenced by my friend, Mr. Flake, restored protection for farmers when prices collapse. Prior to that restoration, we had a farm bill that did not respond when prices collapsed, and during the late 1990s we sought not one but two, maybe even three disaster bills to respond to the price collapse. The 2002 farm bill fixed that, and with price support payments that trigger when prices hit a certain low level, we have not had to come the disaster route to deal with price collapse again. The result has been a tremendous savings for taxpayers. We have a farm bill that only pays out when farmers need it, and billions of dollars have been reduced from the baseline for agriculture because the pricing environment has not required the Federal Government to step in with price support. 
   Now as a matter of budget principle, I would think that Mr. Flake, and we all know he is ever-vigilant on budget matters, would very much like bringing disaster on the budget where it is paid for rather than rely on ad hoc disaster payments that are not paid for, that are emergency spending. And so that is what I want to focus on during the balance of my time. 
   We know that in our great Nation there will be production circumstances causing disaster losses, and we know that these are going to move around. 
   This is the U.S. drought monitor for midsummer 2006. We see a broad pattern of drought. The very next year we had other parts of the country facing a drought threat that really could produce disaster losses.     
   So we know that someplace in the country we're going to have extraordinary circumstances that will literally threaten the family farmers in that region. 
   Well, why don't we just move ahead then and, with this farm bill opportunity, address that issue, and that's precisely where the conferees are in terms of completing their work on this farm bill. They have a disaster component of this bill. It is paid for in the spending of the farm bill; no off-budget, no emergency spending. It's paid for in the farm bill. And what's more, it involves important reforms as well. 
   I expect my friend, Mr. Flake, and I agree that when you have ad hoc program, you don't necessarily have the reins around the spending as you'd like. 
   This bill is very spelled out. It only pays if the entire farm suffers a disaster loss as defined in the statute. Earlier ad hoc programs will pay if just a portion of the farm is hit with disaster-type losses. This is whole farm loss that's provided for. 
   And we require the farmer to maintain crop insurance. We don't want anybody relying on this disaster program as their risk protection. They've got to provide for their own risk protection with crop insurance, and this would only cover additional losses in the event of a disaster situation. 
   You might ask, why do you need that if you've got crop insurance? And it's well known that crop insurance leaves a significant percentage of the farmers' costs exposed. 
   Now, let me just tell you, as I wrap up, why this is so important. We have farmers putting in the most expensive crop in the history of U.S. agriculture. The bankers that I have been visiting with in recent days have told me that operating loans to our farmers are running 30 percent above the amounts last year because of the extraordinary costs our farmers are encountering. 
   I had a farmer tell me today that putting in his crop near Edgeley, North Dakota ran $10,000 a day just for the fuel burned by the three tractors. $10,000 a day. That means, while farmers usually put it all on the table and take enormous risk at the beginning of  a planting season, this year, more than ever before, they've got it all hanging out there. And if we don't have protections, those farmers that might find themselves in a disaster loss situation would take a hit that might very well threaten the continuation of that family farm. 
   So we think the best way to deal with this prospect of disaster losses is to put it in the farm bill, make sure that it's paid for, provided in the budget, and that's precisely what we have done. 
   I would resist the motion to instruct, and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank my friend. 
   First, there have been mistakes made in the administration of farm programs. And, for example, the gentleman's illustration about the Texas ranch issue relative to the space shuttle tragedy, that was not under an ad hoc disaster bill, but we believe it was very poor administration of relief under another program called section 32. We would hope that never happens again. Action is taken here to make certain that it doesn't. 
   The disaster bill precludes losses on livestock. Moreover, they can only go in areas designated by the Secretary as having sustained a disaster loss; at which time, in the legislation, it's specified that the whole farm of the applicant has to suffer a qualifying loss. So no more if you happen to live in an area where somebody else got hit, we got a check for you. That's done, and tightened up considerably under this program. 
   We think that all of those are good government provisions. We also addressed in the 2002 bill, and expect it to anticipate continuing in this bill, price support protection in the farm bill. So we have not had, since 2002, a disaster bill to respond to collapsed prices in the marketplace. We expect that that would absolutely continue. We've got a provision in the farm bill to respond to that. No ad hoc disaster required for price collapse. 
   And then the gentleman's question to me, I forgot. I yield back for clarification, and I'll respond directly.

   Mr. POMEROY. Well, I can only speak for the comments the gentleman  quoted from my own debate. And what I was so happy about the 2002 bill is we were restoring a safety net for farmers when prices collapsed. During the earlier farm bill, known as Freedom to Farm, that protection had been taken away and we had to resort to ad hoc disaster bills when the prices collapsed. We took care of that in the last firm bill and we have not had a disaster bill on that since. 
   This disaster bill relates to production loss. And we're always going to have disasters in our country that bedevil some of our farmers relative to disaster dimension losses. We put them in the budget. We specify in tight reform language how the losses would be compensated. And we think it's good budgeting.

   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I will speak under Mr. Flake's time, and thank you for yielding. 
   The reason I yielded back was because I thought this was about ready to draw to a close. There are a couple of points that I do want to make and believe the record needs to make clear. 
   First, under the last farm bill, we haven't added billions. We've reduced billions from the baseline for agriculture. Because we stopped the ad hoc disaster response when prices collapsed, we had a provision in the farm bill to respond when prices collapsed. Guess what? Prices did not collapse, and the farm bill did not need to extend itself to help farmers. The market took care of the farmers. That saved, over the last farm bill, $18 billion off of the baseline in commodity payments. 
   Now, what happens as we try to build the farm bill this year? It means we have $18 billion less to do it. We have come up with a farm bill that has additional spending, every dollar of it paid for without raising taxes. 
   And so this farm bill is a very tightly constructed, paid-for farm bill in contrast to the last farm bill where $73 billion was added to the baseline, none of it paid for, under the Republican majority that previously ruled this Congress. 
   The final point I would make is that we are going to have disasters. They will threaten the very continuation of family farms across this country. It depends who happens to be afflicted with the disaster at a certain point in time. The option before this Congress is we're either going to prefund, pay for, and budget a disaster response anticipating these losses, or we're going to continue to rely on ad hoc, off-the-budget responses, which we believe is a less responsible way to proceed. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding and allowing me to make these rebuttal points.

   Essentially, we didn't have the funding in place to support a paid-for disaster bill. Later, negotiations between House and Senate negotiators, and I have been right in the middle of it, found ways to fund the bill, and at that point in time, the disaster title came back in.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, 75 million American households own their home. About 68 percent of these homeowners have a mortgage, and about 26 percent of those also carry a second mortgage, a home equity line, or both. In total, Americans have about $10.4 trillion of mortgage debt outstanding. 
   The large majority of families are paying their mortgage payments on time, but many families are having a difficult time meeting their monthly mortgage payments as the interest rates on their loans are being reset to higher levels. Missed payments can mean high added fees also apply. 
   In this last year, more families have found that they just can not keep up and end up loosing their home in foreclosure. Both foreclosures and their precursor, delinquencies, shot upward. By August 2007, foreclosures were up 115 percent from last year, and up 36 percent from July. Since economic research shows that a single foreclosure within a city block lowers the value of homes in the area by 0.9 percent, many lenders want to help families stay in their homes. These families work out a new loan with their lender revising the home loans by forgiving some of the debt caused by the decline in housing prices. 
   The last thing these families need is a tax bill for the ``phantom income'' arising from the loss in the value of their home or the amount of debt forgiveness. Today, Congress rips up that tax bill for struggling families as we pass the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. This bill provides relief to those families by permanently excluding debt forgiven under these circumstances from tax liability. 
   Housing is an important job creator in our economy. We still need to keep home ownership a reachable part of the American Dream. With recent reports in the Wall Street Journal showing that demand for previously owned homes tumbled in August to the lowest level in 5 years, we know that the trouble in the mortgage market hurts sales. Home resales fell to a 5.5 million annual rate, a 4.3 percent decline from July, according to the National Association of Realtors. Help for new home buyers is in H.R. 3648. 
   Solid Midwest values helped keep folks in my state North Dakota out of the subprime mortgage fallout, by and large. Yet, we all know that it is hard for young families to scrape together the money to make a significant down payment on their first home. Many of them are not able to purchase their home with a 20 percent down payment. Mortgage insurance protects these buyers that the market  needs, while insuring against the loss in home value in the event of default. 
   H.R. 3648 would help our kids and other would-be homeowners secure their first homes through a long-term extension of the tax deduction for private mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance keeps new homeowners from taking out second and riskier loans to buy their first home. Extending this tax deduction until 2015 treats mortgage insurance as a cost of homeowners hip in the same way as mortgage interest. 
   The bottom line is that foreclosures do not help the taxpayers. It does not help the economy and it does not help our communities. H.R. 3648 is another step that this Congress is taking to restore strength to the Nation's floundering housing market. Providing help to keep families in their homes and to improve the ability of young families to buy their first home from those houses on the market would help ease the crisis we face.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (KEEPING THE INTERNET DEVOID OF SEXUAL PREDATORS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 431, the ``Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act of 2007'' also known as the KIDS Act. This important legislation takes a historic step forward in updating and strengthening our laws to protect our kids from sexual predators online. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, I introduced the House companion to the KIDS Act with our dear departed friend, Rep. Paul Gillmor, a true champion of protecting children from dangerous sexual predators both online and offline. He spent much of his time in Congress fighting to keep our kids safe, and I know that he would be very proud of the passage of today's legislation. 
   When my own kids are online, I want to do everything possible to keep them safe from online predators. Sex offenders have no business being on social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook and the hundreds of other social networking sites that kids are on today. This bipartisan compromise will make it easier for social networking sites to find these offenders and kick these individuals off of their sites so that they are not able to prey on our Nation's children. 
   Under current law, convicted sex offenders have to register where they work, live, go to school, and provide any other information that is required by the Attorney General, This act mandates that the Attorney General use his authority to require convicted sex offenders to register their Internet identifiers such as their email and instant messaging addresses. Failure to register internet identifiers as required will be treated as any other registration violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. &#167;2250. The Department of Justice will then create a system to share this information with social networking sites so that these companies can keep registered sex offenders from using their services. 
   According to a University of New Hampshire study, 1 in 7 children receive unwanted sexual solicitations online. With nearly 90 percent of our Nation's teenagers using the Internet everyday, it is now more important than ever to pass legislation like this that updates our laws to protect our kids from those who would exploit them online. 
   I would like to thank MySpace for their leadership in advancing this legislation and for the proactive steps that they have already taken to delete convicted registered sex offenders from their site. We hope this legislation will encourage others to follow their lead. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Scott, Chairman Conyers, Senator Schumer and Representative Rahm Emanuel for their work on this issue. I would specifically like to thank House Judiciary staff--Mark Dubester, Ted Kalo, Bobby Vassar, Ameer Gopalani and Karen Wilkinson--for their hard work in reaching a compromise on this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with all of you to protect our children from the threat of sex offenders on the Internet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the pride I want to express is, as being a member of the Agriculture Committee, which I also serve on, a day like today makes me especially proud of that membership because what is before us is a collaborative product, the majority, the minority, arm in arm, working this through to build the best farm bill we possibly could. A bill that attends to the nutrition needs of our country; a bill that provides the safety net for family farmers; and a bill that safeguards the highest quality, most affordable food supply in the Western world. This collaborative effort would not have been possible but for the leadership of Chairman Peterson, who, at every step of the way, wanted to be inclusive in his leadership style, having not just the majority but the minority fully involved in writing this bill. 
   I also salute Bob Goodlatte, ranking member of the committee, because he could have walked away, could have said we're just going to do the partisan thing on this bill, but, no, instead played a very important role substantially improving the product of this bill, by virtue of Bob Goodlatte's contribution and the contribution of the members of his caucus on the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Our farmers are putting into the ground the most expensive crop in the history of U.S. agriculture. I had a farmer tell me last week that running three tractors to get his crop in was running a $10,000-a-day fuel bill. They've got horrific exposure. They need the protection of this farm bill. Please adopt it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, legislation that strengthens the Medicare Program and maintains our commitment to rural America. 
   Rural America continues to be challenged by shortages of health care providers, barriers to health care access, and geographic isolation. In my own home State of North Dakota, approximately 80 percent of the State is designated as a partial or full county Health Professional Shortage Area. In order to address these unique challenges, the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, enacted special payment enhancements to make sure that rural health care facilities and providers have the resources they need to deliver quality care in their communities. 
   Unfortunately, many of these important provisions are set to expire and further assistance is needed to ensure that seniors living in rural America have access to quality, affordable health care. That is why I introduced H.R. 2860, the Health Care Access and Rural Equity, H-CARE, Act, bipartisan legislation that addresses these and other barriers to quality health care by recognizing the unique characteristics of health care delivery in rural areas and assisting rural health care providers in their efforts to continue to provide quality care to rural Americans. 
   I am pleased that the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, MIPPA,  of 2008 incorporates many important provisions from H-CARE that will do much to protect the fragile rural health care safety net. More specifically, MIPPA will do the following: 
   Reauthorize and expand the FLEX Grant Program to include a new grant program that could mean up to $1 million to Richardton, North Dakota, as they convert from their status as a Critical Access Hospital; 
   Extend Section 508 of the Medicare Modernization Act which provides nearly $10 million a year to North Dakota hospitals to give them the resources they need to compete in an increasingly competitive labor market; 
   Ensure that rural doctors are paid the same rate for their work as their urban counterparts by extending the 1.0 work floor on the Medicare work geographic adjustment applied to physician payments bringing in $9 million to North Dakota through 2009; 
   Improve Medicare reimbursements for Critical Access Hospitals by directly increasing payments for critical lab services such as blood testing and other diagnostic services; 
   Boost reimbursements to sole community hospitals by updating the data used to calculate their Medicare reimbursements; 
   Protect access to rural ambulance services by providing rural ambulance providers an additional 3 percent of their Medicare reimbursement in order to help cover their costs; 
   Require prompt payment to rural pharmacies by Medicare prescription drug plans; 
   Extend a provision that allows 19 North Dakota hospital-based labs to directly bill Medicare for pathology services; and 
   Expand access to telehealth services by allowing hospital-based renal dialysis facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and community mental health centers to be reimbursed under Medicare for telehealth services. 
   I would also like to express my appreciation of the Chairman's consideration of technical corrections to recently enacted reforms to the Long Term Care Hospital payment system under Medicare and I look forward to continuing to work with him to resolve this issue. 
   Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act is a good bill that has been endorsed by the National Rural Health Association and deserves every Members' support.

   I, frankly, find it astonishing that we're going to have people representing farmers today that are going to be voting against a bill so important to rural America, a bill that enjoys the support of the farm bureau, the farmers union, the commodity groups, so many vital to the food production of our country. And why? Because they're worried about these companies based in places like Bermuda that want to take their money earned in the United States, route it through places like Switzerland, and park it in the bank back in those islands, those beautiful Caribbean islands where they don't have taxes. They would rather protect the tax cheaters in Bermuda than help the farmers in this country. And man, I would hate to go home and try to sell that one, because if that's not priorities tipped on their head, I don't know what is. 
   It's time for this body to do what's right and pass a farm bill so vital to rural America and the family farmers in our country.

I was really surprised to hear my colleague, Mr. Flake, say, in talking about his bill, that farmers participating in the farm program are something like grown children living in the parents' basement. What a complete affront to the hardworking family farmers producing our Nation's food all across this country. 
   It also shows a profound ignorance in just what's involved in family farming, tremendous capital exposed every year you put that crop and risks you can't control, price collapse, crop failure. And the only thing that's going to keep family farmers as our backbone for U.S. food production is a farm program that helps allay these risks. 
   What do we want for our future, vast corporate-style ag production or family farmers producing the abundant food, the high quality, the low cost we've come to enjoy in our food supply in this country? 
   I know what the people back home represent. They want family farms, and that's why they want this farm bill.

   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent farm families in desperate need of the disaster assistance in this bill, and that is why I am so offended by this Statement of Administration Policy threatening veto on this bill. Consider some of the words in the veto threat of the President: ``The farm economy is strong. Both crop and livestock receipts are forecast to be record high in 2007.'' 
   You know, I don't think they get it. National numbers. National averages. These are of no value whatsoever to the individual farm family that gets wiped out in a disaster. 
   Most of the country on Labor Day of 2005 had a perfectly delightful Labor Day weekend. But part of the country got hammered to bits with Hurricane Katrina. I represent people living more than 1,000 miles from there, but we think we need to help those people. When it comes to the North Dakota farmers, who have been devastated, well, they need our help too. These are natural disasters certified by the President. 
   Take a look at this corn. You've heard of ``knee high by the 4th of July''? Well, this was taken in early July. When the wind starts blowing, the temperature soars and the rain stops and the drought takes hold, the families' income goes away. Family farmers lose their crops. Family farmers forced to sell their cattle. Family farmers lose their income. And without our help, without our help tonight, family farmers are going to lose their farms. 
   In North Dakota, this was the third worst drought on record, only following the thirties and the fifties. But we are not alone. Look at this figure. We had farmers through the great heartland, an area by the way providing some of the President's staunchest support, deeply hurting from these droughts and in need of this disaster bill. 
   We need to send a strong bipartisan signal and send it right now, tonight, help is on its way. Please vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of moving this bill, H.R. 7327, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, forward in an expedited manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress needs to provide pension funding relief rightaway before adjourning in order to prevent needless unemployment and unnecessary freezing of pension plans. We also need to help seniors who are forced to take funds out of retirement accounts that are much lower than balances at the end of last year. 
   This bill is important to workers so that their retirement years will be more secure, and to employers so that the cost of the defined benefit pensions, which they are committed to offering their employees, will be more predictable. This bill also provided relief to retirees over age 70 and a half who are required to take a distribution from their IRA or 401(k). 
   I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Education and Labor Committee for bringing a bill to the floor that helps retirees, workers and pension plans cope with the unprecedented volatile investment environment while also including technical tax and ERISA provisions that give the added clarity retirement plans needed to comply with the Pension Protection Act. 
   Let me also extend thanks to the staff of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor Committee and their counterparts in the Senate. Their hard work brings us to this point. 
   It is imperative that we act now. 
   Facing the most severe recession in decades, U.S. companies will need to plan a careful business strategy and keep a firm control on expenses. According to a survey of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), pension costs have become a major concern in this fiscal environment as sizeable increases in pension funding requirements due to the significant market declines will make an economic recovery more challenging. 
   The bill takes important steps to help corporations remain committed to providing retirement promises to workers through defined benefit plans. In addition, the bill includes similar critical relief for multi-employers' pension plans that cover union workers at many smaller employers especially those in construction industry. At the same time if workers are covered in a plan and its funding level falls below a level at which benefit restrictions would apply the bill allows those plans to look at their 2008 funding level and protect workers from a mandated frozen pension. 
   We do not want to put employers in a no win pinch when they would have to choose between providing pensions or keeping employees on their jobs. Our Nation's pension plan is a voluntary system and employers can decide that offering a pension simply no longer makes good business sense. Tonight Congress tells employers we understand that and we want to help you meet your pension obligations in a predictable way. 
   For those retirees who must take a distribution from their IRA or 401(k) account that today has a dramatically lower value than the account at the end of last year, the bill will allow them to not take such distributions in 2009. 
   In conclusion, just let me say that American workers are anxious about their retirement security. Today, the House of Representatives is acting to address and to reduce this uneasiness. It is a very important bill, and I urge its adoption.  
   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

   Mr. POMEROY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I find this debate absolutely incredible. If you pull it up on the Treasury Department's own Web site, the national debt of our Nation this past week went over $9 trillion. 
   And the bright dividing line between the parties in the debate today is that our friends on the minority side want to drive that debt even deeper and that our friends on the majority side say enough additional debt for our children. 
   We either find a way to pay for this AMT fix or 23 million people get a tax increase or we pass the debt on to the children. Now, I am glad about the bipartisan agreement that we should do  something to stop the 23 million from getting the AMT tax hit. But we cannot just run that credit card balance even higher, just lay this debt onto our kids. 
   It's time we face the music and we begin paying for the costs that we are incurring. We have got to put this budget in order, and we need to start with this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this responsible tax relief package. 
   The bill before us today: 
   protects 23 million middle-class tax payers from the Alternative Minimum Tax, including nearly 35,000 North Dakotans. 
   provides tax relief for millions more American families who want a better life for their families by putting more money in their pockets, and 
   protects future generations from tax increases by not adding to our national debt. 
   The president and my colleagues across the aisle say we should not have to pay for this package of tax relief. They are still acting as though they're living in a mythical Alice in Wonderland--in an America where borrowing $9 trillion in debt and running record budget deficits for years doesn't matter. 
   But deficits and debt do matter because every dollar we borrow places a ``debt tax'' on future generations who will have to pay for the decisions we make today. At $9 trillion, each of our children will be responsible for paying $30,000 of that debt, and that is before interest gets added on. 
   We crossed that 9 trillion dollar mark in the amount of outstanding public debt owed by this Treasury just earlier this week. 
   We saw that anxiety over that level of debt can have a short-term impact in the markets on Wednesday when a low level Chinese official suggested that the government may slow  purchasing Treasury bonds. In reaction, the dollar fell sharply and the stock market plummeted by 361 points. That is one day. 
   A huge persistent debt has greater cost for the economy. So, the moral issue today is passing a fiscally responsible bill that protects future generations by not asking them to finance current tax cuts. Each day the average daily interest payment on the debt adds more than $1 billion to the tab we leave behind. 
   My colleagues across the aisle would rather we pay for today's tax relief--tomorrow. Would that leave the cost to our children, who might just end up having to repay the Chinese holders of U.S. Treasury Notes with EUROs? 
   I try to teach my two kids important values. Among those values is teaching them that things worth doing are worth paying for. 
   That same core principle is behind PAYGO. Not paying for this important tax relief signals high disregard for this basic principle that we teach our kids and that motivated Congress to reinstate PAYGO rules. 
   With the massive fiscal challenges the Nation faces in coming decades, it is irresponsible to foist the cost of tax relief today on future taxpayers. Today, this Congress again should face up to that challenge and pay the cost now. 
   Reverse years of failed Republican policies that have mortgaged our grandchildren's future with additional foreign-owned debt. 
   Let's set an example for our kids--we do not let them eat dessert before they eat all their vegetables. Congress should not rush to dessert either. 
   I urge my colleagues to responsibly pay for middle-class tax relief. 
   I also want to express my appreciation to Chairman Rangel of several important provisions in H.R. 3996 that provide millions of American families tax relief and business in our rural communities. 
   The bill helps 4.5 million taxpayers to meet the cost of paying for their children to get the ticket to a better future--a college education. We extend the tax deduction for the cost of college tuition for another year. 
   Also this bill extends for one year the current-law provision that allows taxpayers over age 70 and a half to make tax-free distributions from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for gifts to charities. In the few short months when senior citizens could use these Charitable IRA rollovers to donate nearly $112 million to help the work of worthy charities it is important that this tool for giving, mostly in small amounts of a few thousand dollars or less, remains available to taxpayers. 
   The bill extends for one year an important tax credit that allows: short line railroads that serve many of our rural communities to upgrade the track on these important links that get our products to the marketplace. 
   Unfortunately, fiscal constraint embodied in H.R. 3996 only allowed us to consider extending these expiring tax provisions generally in their current form. We were not able to make these important tax provisions permanent and make needed improvements. 
   For example, the Public Good IRA Rollover Act (H.R. 1419), which I introduced and which has 90 cosponsors, would broaden the charitable IRA rollover to allow younger retirees to get a lifetime income and provided for charities and to allow distributions to donor-advised funds and would strengthen other aspects of the present-law provision. 
   I remain committed to the enactment of these improvements and would urge my colleagues to work with me in that regard. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is a very healthy debate taking place. I so appreciate the budget that has been brought out of the Budget Committee, and I appreciate the ranking member for offering a budget. Because, in offering a budget, now the contrast is clear. 
   Pay-as-you-go is the fundamental foundation of fiscally disciplined budgeting, because it means you have made a decision the deficit goes no deeper. We have heard about the soaring deficits, the astonishing turnaround from a surplus to nearly $3 trillion of deficit spending during the years of Republican control, now yielding us a national debt approaching $9 trillion. 
   I was pleased to see a picture of children raised by a Member of the other side, because I think that is exactly what it is about. We cannot continue to raise this debt on the children, and that is why pay-as-you-go budgeting was passed in the first 100 hours of this new Congress included in this budget. 
   Now, the alternative budget, they take a little different view. They say pay-as-you-go does not apply if you are going to cut taxes; you do not have to pay for cutting taxes. In fact, they cut taxes $470 billion without any pay-fors, just cut taxes. 
   Can you imagine a family sitting down saying, man, we have got to tighten our budget, we have got to cut this, we have got to cut that, we have got to this, we have got to cut that. This is so depressing that I am going to quit working full time. I am going to work half time. 
   It would not make any sense. You have got to count the revenue side; you have got to cut the spending side. That is our plan. 
   But that is not the end of the Ryan budget and what it means in terms of overall budget picture, because they do have cuts. This is an important final point to make. It reminds me a little bit of the budget policies we debated in the 1990s, where they wanted to cut the heck out of Medicare in order to fund tax cuts disproportionately flowing to the wealthiest people of this country. 
   In this budget you have a directive to the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce Committees to cut $250 billion. We know where those cuts are coming from. I am on the Ways and Means Committee. That is the Medicare committee. They are coming right back after Medicare again, taking dollars from the seniors' health care in this country in order to fund these tax cuts for the wealthiest people, to the extent they are funded at all. 
   Here is a chart illustrating the distribution on their tax cuts. This is for those over $1 million. This has been the most regressive series of tax cuts ever enacted in this country. We know the benefit has gone all to the rich, predominantly to the rich, disproportionately to the rich. 
   To think that they fund it out of cutting Medicare, while driving the debt deeper, shows the budget choice. Fiscal discipline, balanced budget by 2012; cutting Medicare, deeper deficits. Go for the Spratt budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I got to be a father late in life so that now I have got an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old at home. 
   And last winter I had a real long, miserable, anxious weekend, one that any parent probably has experienced. I had a sick kid and I didn't know what to do. A fever higher than I was comfortable with. The disposition of my little fellow, very different than usual. And in the end, we sought some medical care. 
   I have spent a lot of time thinking about that weekend as we have thought about this SCHIP because there are families with sick young'uns and they don't know what to do, but they cannot afford medical care. They don't have coverage. They don't have Medicaid for the poorest of the poor. But by virtue of working in a place that doesn't provide employer-provided health insurance, by virtue of earning an income that doesn't let them afford it, they're uncovered. 
   What do you do? The cost of one trip to an emergency room is a month's rent. What do you do? You pray and you hope that the little one gets better. And, fortunately, they often do. But, tragically, they sometimes don't. So when that long-delayed trip to the doctor or the hospital occurs, we have got a runaway health issue that the parent has had to sit and watch develop, all the while trying to figure out how to handle this situation. 
   We can make this problem go away for 10 million children by moving this legislation forward. To me, this isn't a Democrat, this isn't a Republican matter. This is a matter of basic morality. Are we going to help families get access to medical care by getting insurance coverage for their kids so they don't have to pick between bankruptcy  and trying to address their kids' medical problem in a more timely way? It's as simple as that. 
   Gosh, the rhetoric has gotten so heated, this and that, one charge or another. But what we have tried to do is take many of the issues that were offered in support of sustaining the veto of the President stopping this insurance coverage for children from taking place. We tried to address it in this bill. 
   They said families earning $83,000 can get this kind of coverage. It wasn't true, but we have taken steps in this bill to make absolutely certain it couldn't happen under any circumstances. 
   They said parents are getting coverage. Well, there are a few isolated examples of where grandfathered programs allowed that, but we have phased that out. 
   We have listened and we have responded, and it's time for this side to take ``yes'' for an answer because there is something that has got to rise above the daily squabbling in this place, and that is responding to the needs of families to get their kids the health care they need. Vote ``yes'' on this bill.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Chairman, this is a dispute about facts. I flat out absolutely reject the fact that this is costing jobs; in fact, American sugar producers, 146,000 jobs in 19 States, struggling without an increase in their market price for 22 years. 
   Now, this amendment would represent a loss in income averaging $294 per acre. I'm telling you, if you're a farmer trying to make those ends meet and you're taking nearly a $300 hit per acre as a result of this amendment, you are out of business. 
   Don't cost us these jobs. Reject this amendment.

   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object, this is ridiculous. We have an Agriculture Committee. The Agriculture Committee has under it the jurisdiction of the crop insurance program. The crop insurance program's largely governed by the crop insurance law which is going to be up for reauthorization in the next Congress. We are close to completing a farm bill. The gentleman, who is not on the committee but participated in a hearing in the Government Oversight Committee, has developed a keen interest in the crop insurance program. He has advanced an amendment which has been made in order. It would have substantial consequences to the crop insurance program, and it has not had a hearing in the Agriculture Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Some quick facts: the insurance industry operates in this country under an antitrust exemption. It was passed into law in 1945 in the McCarron-Ferguson Act. But for a relatively recent interpretation of the Department of Justice, in constant negotiation, the Federal Government to the private sector partner has always been conducted under the way anticipated under the bill. 
   Twenty years ago I was a State insurance commissioner. At that time there were more than 60 companies writing crop insurance. Now they are down to 16. Why is that? Because there is so doggone much money here? Heck, no. It's because it's a tough line of business to work. 
   I am not saying that we don't need to look at it, but the committee takes out $2.9 billion, and now we got a guy that thinks he knows we can take out billions more. I tell you, you take out billions more, my farmers don't have the vital risk protection they need when crops fail and they need to make the payment back to the banker on their loans. So this is serious stuff. This isn't an academic exercise. This is vital risk protection for the farmers. 
   Vote ``no'' on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning I had an experience I will never forget. In the snow, in the slush and the ice, I joined the family of Major Alan Johnson as his body was laid to rest at Arlington Cemetery. He had lost his life in an IED explosion in Iraq just 2 weeks before. 
   On behalf of the people of North Dakota, I expressed to the extent I could our profound condolences for the family's loss. The major's grieving widow stared into my eyes and said, ``Do what you can for our troops over there.'' 
   This is not just a plea and a prayer of the families of our soldiers, it is the demand of the American people. I believe each and every one of us here shares an intense commitment to our soldiers that comes right from the bottom of  our heart. This debate is revealing a sharp difference between us in how to proceed in Iraq. 
   But there are no differences when it comes to all we share about the valor our soldiers have displayed in service to our country. I have seen it personally in the four trips I have been to Iraq. I have seen soldiers in full battle gear, in 133 degree heat, doing their absolute best to perform their mission. I have seen North Dakota National Guard soldiers charged with training up Iraqi soldiers through an impossible, absolute, language barrier. 
   I have seen other soldiers just back from the life-threatening business of finding and detonating these explosive devices, saving American lives while keeping essential roads open. Like most of you, I have mourned and prayed with shattered families whose sons and daughters have lost their lives in selfless service to our country and all we care about. 
   So I cannot get Tori Johnson's fervent request out of my mind, take care of our soldiers over there. Honestly, there is nothing I care more about as a Member of this House. 
   So, how do we respond? We take care of our soldiers over there by making certain they have the equipment they need as they undertake this most difficult and dangerous mission. We take care of our soldiers over there by making certain their deployments are only for acceptable periods and at acceptable intervals, with enough time at home in between to heal, to rest and to train. But beyond these things, we take care of our soldiers over there when we as a Congress make certain the mission they have been sent to perform has a reasonable chance of success. 
   In a war where so many tragic mistakes have been made, this Congress must not sit quietly by while additional plans are cooked up in Washington, whose only certainty is to accelerate the loss of American lives, compound the already severe strain on our military capability and accelerate the burn rack of taxpayer dollars spent in Iraq. 
   For these reasons, this resolution is a very important opening statement for this Congress to make in Iraq in 97 words. It states our support for our soldiers, while opposing the President's plan to escalate the number of troops we send into the middle of the Shia-Sunni violence taking place in Baghdad. 
   On one of my trips to Iraq, a soldier said to me, ``We can stand up an Iraqi Army, but we cannot create a country for this army to defend.'' This simple truth goes right to the heart of the issue and exposes the flaw of the President's plan. 
   Without the commitment between the warring parties in Iraq to stop the killing and create a political agreement upon which a national government can exist, 20,000 more U.S. soldiers are not likely to bring about a lasting peace. Our soldiers are disciplined and determined. They have superbly performed everything that has been asked of them. 
   However, the United States alone cannot create a democracy in Iraq. Only the Iraqi people can achieve that. 
   A broad group of experts, including the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, the former senior military commander in the region, General John Abizaid, have all rejected the strategy of escalating U.S. troop numbers as a means of bringing the factions of Iraq together. 
   The bottom line is that this troop escalation will increase the terrible cost of this endeavor, more lives lost, more young men and women maimed forever, more tens of billions spent, all without improving our prospects for an acceptable outcome. 
   Under these circumstances, I will vote to oppose this escalation of troops. It is part of what I believe we must do. Under these circumstances, I will oppose this escalation of troops. It is part of what I believe we must do to support our soldiers over there and the American interests they have put their lives on the line to defend.

<DOCNO>Mr. POMEROY. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6532, Highway Trust Fund Restoration as it provides the funding necessary to replenish the Highway Trust Fund and avoid significant cuts in federal highway funding to the States. 
   Forecasts indicate a shortfall of several billion dollars to the Highway Trust Fund in fiscal year 2009 due to lower-than-expected gas tax revenue. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the estimated miles traveled on U.S. public roads has dropped 30 billion miles from November through April 2007-08 compared to the same period in 2006-07. This is the first year-to-year reduction since 1979. As Americans drive less and purchase less fuel, the Highway Trust Fund's shortfall will continue to worsen. 
   As a result of this shortfall, States are facing funding cuts of approximately 34 percent or nearly $14 billion in highway funds. This would include cuts of $70,473,422 in my State of North Dakota, threatening approximately 2,452 jobs. If this shortfall is not addressed, countless bridge and tunnel projects, reconstruction of streets, traffic signals, lighting and safety initiatives will be postponed. 
   I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 6532 which would address these impending cuts by crediting the Highway Trust Fund's Highway Account with the $8 billion taken away from the Highway Account's balance in 1998, and therefore helping the Highway Trust Fund avoid insolvency. 
   The Highway Trust Fund Restoration is a good bill that will provide States with the resources they need to continue to provide improvements to America's highways. It deserves all members' votes on the House floor.
