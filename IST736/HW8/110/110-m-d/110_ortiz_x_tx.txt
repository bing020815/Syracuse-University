<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Chairman, when overzealous employers opposed to union organizing can exert undue pressure on workers, the whole idea of workers having a say in their own future means nothing. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act supports working families by eliminating pressure from employers, who will no longer be able to demand a second election after a majority of workers have already voiced their will. This bipartisan legislation has 234 cosponsors and is supported by 69 percent of the American people ..... and it is long overdue. 
   Workers will retain their right to voice their will on union organizing, either through the standard methods of holding an election or turning in pledge cards. Employee Free Choice Act merely eliminates subsequent--or ``do-over''--elections forced by employers. 
   In addition to eliminating ``do-over'' elections, the bill also strengthens employer-union mediation and arbitration provisions, and it strengthens penalties for violations of the union organizing process. Workers must have the ability to make their union decisions without hostility directed towards them. Those that flout the law should be held accountable. 
   Despite several years of economic growth and high corporate profits, middle-class American families have actually lost ground--squeezed between stagnating incomes and rising costs for health care, education, and housing. 
   Giving workers a free choice to join together to bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions is a critical step to easing the squeeze and strengthening the middle class. The current system for forming unions is badly broken and undemocratic, with employers routinely intimidating, harassing, coercing--or even firing--workers who support a union. 
   Responsible employers already voluntarily recognize a union when a majority of workers sign up for one. It is time that all workers have this free and fair choice in selecting their representative, so they have a fighting chance to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill--and I hope the Senate will follow us quickly--to put real teeth in the law by strengthening the penalties for discrimination against workers who favor a union.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Interior Appropriations bill before us today which includes money for South Texas to address water and wastewater issues along the Border. 
   I particularly thank Chairman NORM DICKS--who, on behalf of the Congressional Border Caucus, offered to increase funding for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Mexican Border program for safe drinking water grants by $15 million, providing a total of $25 million for these important grants. 
   NAFTA brought both challenges and windfalls to South Texas. As South Texas became the front door for international trade, the unemployment rate--at that time in double digits--fell to its present rate as jobs and opportunities became more widely available. 
   NAFTA also brought about greater growth and entire new industries, some cross-border industries. Congress' concerns about the border infrastructure for water and wastewater brought about the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) as part of the North American Development Bank. BECC funding has become a resource for border communities, whose infrastructure now bears the national burden of NAFTA; and NAFTA benefits the entire national economy. 
   These funds added to the Interior Appropriations bill today assist communities in addressing public health and environmental conditions along the U.S.-Mexico border. This money has been instrumental in getting almost seven million people connected to improved water and wastewater systems, ensuring improved living conditions for the residents of Texas, as well as other border states. Through these funds, 54 wastewater projects and 16 drinking water projects have been built. 
   In my South Texas district the City of San Benito, the Brownsville Public Utilities Board, Olmito Water Supply, El Jardin Water Supply Corporation and the City of Los Fresnos have benefited from these funds.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (IMMIGRANT SOLDIERS -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Thank you, Charlie, for allowing me some time to speak tonight, and I would like to acknowledge your leadership in bringing this to the forefront. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we continue the national discussion of immigration and the value of immigrants to our Nation, we must not forget the immigrant men and women who populate our Armed Forces, who fight for freedoms that we all enjoy each day, yet who in the current debate are cast aside as unworthy for citizenship. Yes, more than 70,000 of them serve our military today. 
   Now, they have a unique love of America. They consider this great Nation as a beacon of light that drew them here, with a promise of freedom, of democracy and opportunity. 
   The voices of these immigrant soldiers are remarkably missing from the debate on the value of immigrants in this Nation. I would like to add their voices today. For them, the United States is their only chance to make a new life. Like all soldiers, they don't want our Nation to be harmed. This is their brass ring, the key to the rest of their lives. 
   They are willing to risk their life for this country because it is the promise of what working hard can give you. They come to the United States longing for a better life than they had in their homeland. Their last light of hope resides in what this Nation promises in terms of honoring our soldiers and supporting our troops. 
   Many have said that they would rather fight and die for the United States because they so desperately want their home countries to emulate, to copy, their adopted Nation. They hope beyond hope that their public service in our military will someday influence their home countries, the ones in which they were born, so their families will someday have similar living conditions promised by this Nation and the same economic opportunities. 
   They fear that if America's beacon of light is extinguished, the long-lasting effect of that would inspire great fear, in this hemisphere and around the world. 
   One of the most heartbreaking exercises for me is going to military funerals, as it is for all of us. One of the most heartbreaking moments is with a family after losing a loved one and bestowing citizenship upon the lost soldier after he's buried. 
   At this point, I would like my colleagues to join me in commending the service of Private First Class Rey Cuervo, killed in Baghdad by an IED just before New Year's Eve in 2003. He left behind a young wife, pregnant with his first child, a child of immigrants who will never see his father again, who died for this Nation. 
   I still remember the moment I was there for the ceremony granting Rey his citizenship in 2004 after his death.     
   Tears in the eyes of all who attended the funeral spoke volumes. Yes, so far to the price of citizenship, now so close to God, so that you and I and the rest of the citizens of this great country could enjoy the freedoms and privileges and liberties that we have today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROBSTOWN, TEXAS -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Chairman Clay and my good friend Mr. Issa for bringing this bill to the floor, and I want today to congratulate and honor the ``Biggest Little Town in Texas.'' 
   Robstown has been ``Celebrating a Century'' this year as the city turns 100 years old. This centennial celebration and resolution are especially important to me because Robstown, a city of about 14,000 people, is my hometown. 
   I was born and reared and raised there, attended the public schools there, and had my first job as a printer's devil with the local newspaper, the Robstown Record. 
   Cotton and vegetable farming played an important role in the history and economy of Robstown, named after prominent local leader Robert Driscoll. 
   Robstown is a town where citizens are deeply committed to public service. We've sent sons and daughters to shape the history of local, State and Federal offices. They have all served in our military. They've distinguished themselves in military services. 
   We've had county commissioners, sheriffs, district attorneys, district judges, Federal judges, State representatives, and this proud Member of the Congress, who came out from this little town of 14,000 people. 
   Robstown also has a great athletic tradition. Gene Upshaw, of the National Football League and a great football star, came from this little town of Robstown. 
   Humberto ``Lefty'' Barrera, bantamweight boxer on the historic 1960 Olympic team who later earned an engineering degree at night school, also called Robstown ``my hometown.'' 
   Kathryn Grandstaff, from Robstown, she married Bing Crosby, who we all know. 
   Our students also excel in the classroom, including the Robstown High School Cotton Pickers band, and they have achieved much in the fields of athletics and academics. 
   All year long we have recognized the ``Century of Celebration,'' which included a formal celebration on June 1. 
   One of the greatest traditions is the annual Cottonfest held in October. This year was the biggest ever event that we've had. We have live music, arts and crafts, a sports competition, cookoffs, contests, carnivals and historical exhibits that provide something for everyone in the community. 
   We also have so much to look forward to as our town continues to grow. Robstown enters the 21st century at the crossroads of international trade due to its proximity to railroads, interstate highways, seaports and airports. It is the hub in that area. 
   Robstown will serve as a hub by connecting major railway companies, the Texan-Mexican railway, Kansas City Southern and Union Pacific, with direct links to Corpus Christi, Brownsville, Houston, San Antonio and Laredo. 
   Robstown is also home to the new county fairgrounds and an entertainment venue. 
   My hometown is the future home of an inland port, which will be the first such port in the United States, and the future home of an Army storage facility. 
   And no trip to Robstown would be complete without a good filling yourself up with south Texas' best barbecue at Joe Cotten's. Cotten's is an iconic restaurant where many of you have joined me for lunch in south Texas style. It is where Presidential candidates, athletes, business people, cowboys, riders, astronauts, generals, admirals and other celebrities and thousands of others, they even fly on their helicopters to eat at Joe Cotten's. 
   Robstown is the best of our communities in south Texas, friendly, family-oriented and proud of their history. 
   It was in Robstown where my mother taught me my most important lesson: to always serve the community that gave you so many opportunities growing up. To whom much is given, much is expected. 
   Please join me in honoring Robstown on the city's 100th anniversary, and I join my friends Chairman Clay and Mr. Issa today for bringing this bill to the floor.

   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we have the chance to thank the volunteers of nonprofit organizations who provide support for families and children of deployed members of the Armed Forces for their extraordinary contributions to those families. 
   I want to thank Congressman Tom Davis, Congressman Joe Wilson and others for their contributions and for helping us bring this resolution to the floor. 
   The families of United States troops serve this Nation by providing unconditional love and support for their deployed loved ones. While the government offers significant resources on military installations, when families live far away from a base, it is very hard to access those opportunities. 
   True patriots look at this kind of situation and ask, what can I do for my military families? That's what the patriots did who founded Our Military Kids, Kids Serve 2, and several other organizations that recognize and support military families. 
   These organizations' founders recognized the families' contributions and identified the need to provide opportunities and resources for their families, especially for the families and children of deployed Guard and Reserve troops. 
   The organizations' contributions are so significant that in May, General David Petraeus, the United States Army Commanding General of the Multinational Force-Iraq, personally thanked Our Military Kids for their great work and support for Guard and Reserve troops' families. 
   Our Military Kids is a nonprofit organization which is wholly devoted to offering financial resources and grants for children K-12 of deployed and severely injured Reserve and National Guard personnel. Our Military Kids helps families participate in sports, arts and tutoring programs that are so important to children during those stressful times. 
   Today my resolution puts the House of Representatives on record as supporting the excellent work these nonprofit groups do to support the children and families of deployed troops. I ask the House to support this resolution and thank the founders and volunteers at Our Military Kids and at the other nongovernmental groups that support military families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the May 8 letter from General Petraeus be included for the Record.

   My personal experiences that day are vivid: going to a press conference in the Capitol at 9:30, moving fast to get out of the building when we saw the reports of smoke at the Pentagon. I went to the Pentagon two days later to thank the emergency workers and was touched by their resolve and strength to rescue their fellow citizens. 
   Over the last seven years, our Nation worked tirelessly to improve our Nation's security and to protect our people. We thank our men and women who serve in the military and put their lives on the line every day to ensure that we never have to relive those tragic events ever again.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the FY08 Homeland Security Appropriations bill--the House's first all-encompassing look at the security of our Nation. But I strongly oppose the proposition that a border wall will protect this Nation, and I ask my colleagues to consider what a wall along the Southwest border will do. 
   During this debate my friends in the minority have said they are focused on the funding levels of this bill ..... saying they are too high and wasteful. Here's what is wasteful: according to Customs and Border Protection, every mile of a wall will cost at least $3 million dollars to construct. That doesn't include any funding needed to buy private lands or maintain the fence. 
   In this 21st Century, we have the technology to adequately protect our borders through a virtual fence without dividing communities, adversely impacting our economy, giving up water rights, denying private property rights for landowners on the border, or changing international boundaries without benefit of international treaties.  
   I am grateful that the Committee incorporated the language in the bill to include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as one of the federal agencies with which DHS must coordinate before spending money to build a wall. And I have received a commitment to include the International Boundary and Water Commission to the list of federal agencies DHS must coordinate with, as the bill moves through conference. I thank the Committee for accepting the language in the bill requiring the DHS Secretary to consult with local communities, and to seek their advice before spending money on the wall. That's hardly enough, but that puts a little lipstick on the pig. 
   Rather than spend over $3 million dollars a mile, we should be directing the Department of Homeland Security to utilize technology like ground sensors, unmanned aircraft, vehicle barriers, cameras and human surveillance through Border Patrol. 
   The technology of a virtual wall saves the taxpayers $2 million dollars a mile ..... will be more reliable ..... and actually give the Border Patrol the time and resources they need to detain illegal immigrants or potential terrorists. Virtual technology is proven; this week the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced it would deploy a virtual fence to protect JFK, Newark Liberty International and LaGuardia airports. Much of the technology they are deploying is either currently being used or developed by CBP. 
   We need to be smarter about our border security ..... rather than expect a physical wall to singlehandedly protect our country. Unless you live along the border, you do not understand the uniqueness of border communities. Constructing a fence along the southwest border is going to have a devastating economic impact in our border towns. 
   Much of the area along the border is growing rapidly with more and more Fortune 500 companies moving business to South Texas. What message does constructing a wall send to these companies? Twenty years ago this week, on June 12, 1987--President Ronald Reagan said of the Berlin Wall that scarred Europe: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' 
   We are better than Soviet Europe ..... and an antiquated structure along our borders will not protect our Nation. Protecting the border is of the utmost importance to me, and all Americans. 
   Nearly every single Border Patrol agent, who has confided in me, is certain a wall is not the solution. They would rather receive funding for additional manpower, technology and tactical infrastructure, such as vehicle barriers, to protect our border. 
   I urge my colleagues to save taxpayers money, oppose the handful of amendments before us that throw good money after bad in building a wall that will not protect this great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill--engineered by my colleague from Texas Mr. EDWARDS--which funds vital military accounts and provides the largest increase in veterans funding in the history of the VA. 
   While the central concern for South Texas is a veterans hospital--I understand we must authorize that funding before we can appropriate it. I have talked about this issue with appropriators and authorizers alike ..... and those conversations will continue until we find a resolution to help these veterans get the in patient care they deserve. 
   The Congress is committed to working in a bipartisan way to ensure that our budget honors the service of our veterans and builds a future worthy of their sacrifice. With passage of this bill, the 110th Congress will have voted for historic increases in veterans' health care and benefits programs, totaling nearly $12 billion--including the joint resolution and the supplemental--to meet the needs of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistanm ..... and make up for the Bush Administration's past shortcomings in its treatment of veterans. 
   This bill will provide veterans with the health care and benefits we promised them, resulting in the hiring of more qualified doctors and nurses to improve medical services to our veterans and to reduce waiting times for doctor appointments, and provide more to help veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mental health care issues, and lost limbs so that they can rebuild their lives. 
   For the first time, the budget for VA medical care exceeds the budget of the veterans' service organizations by $294 million. This will ensure quality health care for 5.8 million patients, including about 263,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, which the VA will treat in FY 2008. This significantly reduces the 400,000 claims backlog for veterans waiting for disability and other benefits by adding more than 1,100 new claims processors. 
   The bill also provides much needed maintenance of VA health care facilities (funding level is $500 million above the President's request) to prevent another Walter Reed-type scandal from occurring. A recent VA report outlined 1,000 specific problems at VA health facilities around the country, with a backlog of $5 billion in maintenance. 
   The enormous number of troops returning home with mental health disorders, including PTSD and traumatic brain injury, resulted in the bill including five polytrauma centers and three Centers of Excellence for Mental Health and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). These centers will be fully operational this year to care for those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, including those with TBI. A February GAG report noted about one-third of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are facing mental health challenges, and up to 300,000 troops are expected to return from Iraq suffering from TBI. 
   The bill also protects taxpayers and veterans by including solid steps to ensure accountability and stop wasteful spending by increasing funding for the Inspector General for VA to improve services for veterans and their families and to prevent and deter potential waste, fraud and inefficiencies. 
   To strengthen our military, this bill provides better barracks, housing and training facilities when troops return from combat with an unprecedented $21.4 billion investment in military construction, family housing, and BRAC--  with $207 million more than the President's request. 
   To address end strength, the bill provides funding recommended by my subcommittee to begin the process of adding 65,000 Army, 27,000 Marine, and 9,000 National Guard and Reserve troops. 
   For BRAC, the bill fully funds the 2005 base realignment and closure process at $8.2 billion, and supports the relocation of 70,000 troops from bases in Korea and Europe. 
   All this represents the start we need to pay for a healthy and vital military force to protect our nation today, tomorrow and for the coming decades.

   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of our south Texas veterans, we appreciate the committee's concern regarding access to inpatient and outpatient care for our far south Texas veterans. 
   Let me say I compliment you, Mr. Chairman, for doing such a great job and for having way down in your heart the care of the veterans that served in many, many wars, not only in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   These veterans have to travel upwards of 6 hours each way to receive inpatient care, and many times they have their appointments cancelled. As you know, the VA's currently finalizing a study on options to provide inpatient and outpatient specialty care which will be out this July. 
   And Mr. Chairman, as you know, this war has resulted in many casualties.  We've had over 46 young men killed in this war. We have lost more, between Chairman Hinojosa and I, 46 soldiers. In addition, we've had many more soldiers maimed and injured; and what we would like to see, Mr. Chairman, would the committee work with us to move the issue of a veterans hospital in south Texas forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, Federal budgets reflect our values as a nation. This Nation has rejected passing the monumental debt run up by this administration and past congresses on to their children. We are bringing a new fiscal direction to our budgeting process. 
   Correcting the fiscal course of the country will not be easy, or fast. We did it before, but success only comes with the hard work of passing budget and appropriations bills every year ..... unlike the way past Congresses did it: not paying the bills, running up huge waves of debt in the form of higher taxes on our children. We're about to start doing this right. 
   Our fiscal outlook deteriorated dramatically over the past 6 years. In 2001, the administration inherited a projected 10-year (2002-2011) budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. After paying for tax cuts for the richest among us, that surplus was gone. Between that and the 9-11 attacks, the United States accumulated a mountain of debt, adding $2.8 trillion to our Federal debt burden since 2001. Most of this debt has been purchased by foreign investors, making the U.S. economy more vulnerable to economic and political instability and political pressure from abroad. 
   Deficits matter. It is our moral responsibility to start cleaning up the fiscal chaos wrought by the last Congresses and the President. Living beyond our means comes at a cost to our children and grandchildren who will have to pay off that debt. The irresponsible economic policies of the past 6 years have left a debt burden of $29,075 for a typical middle-income family of four in Texas. 
   Deficits also hurt economic growth by slowing down national savings, which leaves us less to invest in our future. That means lower productivity and wages for future workers. The President's budget continued the fiscal approach that has brought us large deficits and growing debt. 
   This budget is in sharp contrast to the trend of spending our children's money like mad. Today's budget takes the necessary steps to eliminate our long-term budget deficit by adhering to the pay-as-you-go principle, just as families at kitchen tables do every day across the country. 
   A balanced budget must include balanced priorities. For the first time in 6 years, the congressional budget resolution will balance the Federal budget--in 2012--while also defending our country, delivering critical services to children and families, caring for our veterans, educating our children, and growing the U.S. economy. 
   The 2008 budget is the blueprint for the new direction we are taking the American people. It provides greater deficit reduction than the administration in the first 5 years, leading to a budget surplus in 2012 ..... we pay for the budget as we go, not as we hope we'll have a windfall of money .....  
   I am particularly pleased at the matters affecting South Texas, including: 
   The largest veterans' budget increase in American history--$3.5 billion more this year ($32 billion over the next 5 years) for veterans' health care than the President's budget. 
   Greater investment in areas that deal with homeland security, rejecting the cuts to vital first responder and terrorism prevention programs included in the President's FY 2008 budget. Under the President's budget, the State Homeland Security Grant Program--which awarded $277,028,279 to Texas from 2003 to 2006--would be slashed by 52 percent. The Law Enforcement Terrorist Prevention Program (LETPP)--which awarded $70,936,283 to Texas from 2004 to 2006--would be eliminated. 
   Funds to begin implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations to make Texas and our nation more secure. 
   Investments in a 21st Century Workforce for a growing economy and protects middle-class taxpayers. 
   Increasing funding for State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--in Texas, where previous budget cuts left 1,366,710 children without health insurance. 
   Rejecting the administration's proposal to cut Medicare funding by $1,586,784,434 for Texas hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health care providers. 
   Providing substantially more funding for Texas' 4,365,200 children enrolled in public elementary, middle and high schools--providing nearly $8 billion more in 2008 and 11 percent more over the next 5 years for education and training programs than requested by the President. 
   Increasing resources for No Child Left Behind, special education and Head Start--rejecting the harsh cuts and underfunding for these critical education programs in the President's budget. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this budget, and begin a new era of fiscal sanity and investment in our greatest resource--Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, it is enormously fitting that we honor our much-loved colleague by naming a post office after him. Lane Evans epitomizes all that Members of Congress should be: smart, dedicated to the founding principles of our Constitution, a tough-as-nails fighter, a veteran, and a deeply kind man. 
   He represented Illinois' 17th District with excellence and vigor. Lane took care of his constituents as though they were family ..... and he commanded great respect among those for whom he toiled in Congress. 
   A former Marine, Lane served with distinction; then served his country in Congress with that same dedication, integrity, and humility. His service experience largely shaped his career and legacy in Congress. 
   His tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's veterans led to a successful fight for compensation of veterans exposed to Agent Orange early in his Congressional career. As Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Lane expanded benefits for women veterans, pushed for additional medical care for veterans suffering from PTSD, supported veterans' outpatient clinics, and crafted legislation to attend to homeless veterans. 
   Lane knew the bottom line for his neighbors in Illinois was an economy that rewarded their effort, so he worked hard to promote economic growth and equal access in rural communities. He was a giant on the House Armed Services Committee and brought new jobs to the Rock Island Arsenal. 
   Understanding both the national security implications and the resource for Illinois farmers, Lane advocated ethanol-producing resources in his district and championed increased development and use of ethanol and biofuels in Illinois. 
   Not only does Lane inspire all of us who are familiar with his service, but his courageous and brave battle with Parkinson's disease have inspired all of us, plus the millions of Parkinson's sufferers around the nation. Lane is precisely the type of public servant that we all strive to be. 
   In his work in Congress, in his love and work for the people of the 17th district, and for our nations' veterans, Lane embodied the Marine motto, Semper Fidelis (``Always Faithful'').  
   Mr. Speaker, I love Lane like a brother, and I'm proud to support this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in Rock Island, Illinois, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6899, the Comprehensive American Energy and Consumer Protection Act. 
   I appreciate the hard work that the sponsors of the bill--Chairmen Dingell, Rahall, and Miller and my fellow Texan, Chairman Green--have put into crafting this legislation. 
   They considered different viewpoints and different approaches to the energy issue and came together in an inclusive manner that will lead us down the right path. 
   We have heard from our constituents, time and time again, that we need to become more energy independent and we need to produce more of our energy supply domestically. 
   We have heard from our constituents, time and time again, that we need to invest in the future and develop alternative energy resources, such as wind and solar power. 
   We have heard from our constituents, time and time again, that we need to provide tax credits so that our businesses have the incentive and opportunity to produce more energy. 
   And, we have heard from our constituents, time and time again, that we need to act on lowering the price at the pump, which is adversely affecting many south Texas families, farmers, and small businesses. 
   We can look forward to a balanced plan that expands both conventional and renewable energy resources. It will provide for new domestic drilling opportunities, both off shore and on land. It will release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It will spur companies and businesses to do more research and more exploration. It reforms the way royalties are paid between the Government and the oil companies. It provides incentives to conserve our energy use and raise energy efficiency standards. 
   This legislation is a compromise. It directs us in the right direction towards energy independence. My colleagues have called for an all of the above approach when it comes to the energy issue. I believe we have accomplished that.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (REMEMBERING VICTIMS AT VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY AND HONORING HISPANIC WORLD WAR II VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, Hispanic veterans represent our love of this nation ..... they represent the best of our community ..... and their service is a frequent path to greater opportunities for them and their families. 
   I am a veteran, inspired by another veteran who inspired so many of us: Dr. Hector P. Garcia who created the GI Forum, a powerful platform that represents Hispanic veterans who labor on the battlefield for our nation. Dr. Hector Garcia was a personal hero to me. 
   He served the nation on the battlefield ..... and he served us again by making people understand that a soldier is a soldier--that race makes no difference among Americans, particularly when they wear the uniform of the United States. If he were here today, he would have a great deal to say to PBS about the omission of Hispanics when putting together a special on WWII. 
   WWII was the moment in time when Hispanics found their place in U.S. society and found our voice in demanding equality among troops ..... and elsewhere in the American family. And it was Dr. Hector's audacious vision that began a decades-long march in advancing civil rights, voting rights and school desegregation for Hispanics in Texas and around the nation. 
   Here's how it all began ..... the family of Felix Longoria--a brave and fallen U.S. soldier from WWII--wanted his body buried at Three Rivers Cemetery in Three Rivers, Texas. Yet segregation's profound and evil roots ran deep in the heart of Texas then, reaching all the way into cemeteries, and Longoria's burial was refused; he was not white and could not be buried alongside those with whom he had fought in the war. 
   Dr. Hector laid bare the raw racism inherent in the U.S. after this nation fought a global war to protect democracy and our way of life, when even cemeteries were segregated. The fight to bury this war hero was successful and that effort begat the GI Forum, the very first Hispanic civil rights organization in this nation. 
   I was so pleased that--after the Hispanic Caucus engaged PBS in a serious conversation about the lack of inclusion of the story of Hispanics in the story of WWII--PBS understood the enormity of that decision. They will now include the extraordinary exploits of Hispanic warriors in the story of the last declared war our nation fought. 
   Yet, it was not only WWII in which Hispanic Americans were heroes in securing freedom; there were many examples of Hispanic war heroes throughout our history. Today we should also honor our forefathers who played a large part in making--and then keeping--the United States free and democratic; for as long as there has been a United States, Hispanics have played major roles in building our country and defending it. 
   From the American Revolution that freed the United States from England--to today's operation against al Qaeda--Hispanics proudly and bravely served the United States. When the Colonies on the East Coast of what is now the United States rebelled against England, Hispanics played a pivotal role. 
   As Governor of the Louisiana Territory, General Benardo de G&#225;lvez sent money, gunpowder, rifles and other supplies to General George Washington to aid in the revolution. He later served gallantly in the War for Independence by capturing both Mobile and Pensacola--at a pivotal point in the war. 
   Captain Jorge Farragut came to the United States to seek his fortune by fighting the British--first in the Revolution, then in the War of 1812--as part of the U.S. Navy. 
   Hispanics also raised special collections and taxes to aid the fight for independence. After the Revolution was won, Mexican pesos aided in the construction of St. Peter's Church in New York City to celebrate the end of the war. As in the Revolution, Hispanics served proudly in each war and conflict in which the United States participated. 
   In the course of that service, 38 Hispanics have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, our country's highest award for military bravery and service. 
   In the Civil War, David Glasgow Farragut, son of Jorge Farragut, won fame as a Union hero by blockading Southern ports, destroying Rebel ships anchored in New Orleans, and by capturing Mobile for the Union. 
   His contributions prompted Congress to create the title of Rear Admiral to reward him as the first man to ever hold that rank. Farragut was commissioned Vice Admiral in 1864, then Admiral in 1866. 
   Federico Ferm&#225;ndez Cavada, a Lieutenant Colonel for the Union Army, fought bravely at Gettysburg. Rafael Ch&#225;con also served with the Union Army, and attained the rank of Major. 
   Santos Benavides--originally from Laredo--fought for the Confederacy. His rank of Colonel was the highest of any Mexican-American Army officer in the Civil War. 
   Major Manuel Antonio Chavez forced the Confederate Army to retreat down the Rio Grande, preventing the rebels from carrying out their plans to seize the gold mines of New Mexico and California. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Jos&#233; Francisco Chaves of the Union Army assisted in recapturing Albuquerque and Santa Fe. 
   One of the most interesting soldiers in the Confederacy was Loretta Janet Vel&#225;zquez, who fought disguised as a man. Upon discovery and discharge, she continued her service as a Confederate spy. 
   In 1973, Lieutenant Colonel Mercedes Cubria retired from the Army--she was the first Hispanic woman to achieve that rank. Hispanics served bravely for the cause of freedom and democracy in World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. 
   Around 500,000 Hispanics served the United States during World War II, and it is on the shoulders of these great men that the rest of us could see the future. 
   In the years to come, when the military service of Hispanics is viewed through the prism of history, there are certainly a number of young Hispanics whose service to this nation in this new war will distinguish themselves among great U.S. warriors in the 21st Century.

She brought grace and light to the State of Texas and in Washington, D.C. She was a partner to President Lyndon Johnson in the home, on the campaign trail and in the White House. She made things around her prettier, around the environment, and she brought light and beauty to Washington, D.C., to politics and to our Nation. 
   She was so proud of the Department of Education bearing the name of her husband, LBJ, to illustrate her dedication to education. Her legacy will live on in their beautiful family and in the flowers and beauty of the many parks that were inspired by her all over the Nation. 
   At this moment I would like to yield to my good friend, Lloyd Doggett.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren). 
   You know, the Canadian ambassador to the United States and some oil companies have expressed concern about the application of section 526 to petroleum derived from oil sands. 
   North American oil sands are vital to United States oil supplies. Oil sands represent approximately 5 percent of the total U.S. oil supply and are mixed in with fuel derived from other sources. 
   This amendment addresses the concerns that have been raised, while preserving the overall intent of section 526. Section 526 establishes a positive goal for future alternative fuels greenhouse gas emissions. This amendment clarifies section 526 while retaining the standards it sets for greenhouse gas emissions. 
   This amendment would simply provide an exception to section 526 by exempting contracts for generally available fuels that are not predominantly produced from nonconventional petroleum sources, thereby addressing the uncertainty regarding the presence of fuel from oil sands mixed with fuel from other sources in existing commercial processes. And my friends, all I can say is there's always a first time. 
   I'd like to compliment my friend for coming up with this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 584, a bill introduced by my friend GENE GREEN of Houston, which names the Department of Education Headquarters Building in Washington, DC, after President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
   President Johnson's legacy is vast and mostly underappreciated. He was a visionary in terms of groundbreaking social legislation that literally changed the way this country elected leaders, treated one another in the workplace, and educated our children. 
   President Johnson passed away over 30 years ago, and is survived by his First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson. Despite the groundbreaking work in education and so many other levels, no Federal buildings bear his name in the national Capital area. 
   In May 1964, Johnson called for a nationwide war against poverty and outlined a vast program of economic and social welfare legislation designed to create what he termed the Great Society. Central to his vision of a nation no longer hindered by poverty and hate was an education for every child, no matter what their economic status. 
   During his time in office, President Johnson passed over 60 education bills, including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and created the Head Start Program. Taken together, these legislative feats form the basis of public education in the United States today. 
   President Johnson grew up in San Marcos, TX, seeing abject poverty all around him and seeing the power scheme that separated white children from Hispanic and African-American children. From his earliest days, he concluded the only true equalizing influence in our Nation was through an equal education for all Americans, no matter what their skin color or their economic status. 
   The Department of Education headquarters building on Maryland Avenue, SW., in Washington, DC, has no name on it today. Bearing the name of our 36th President would be a fitting tribute to the life and legislative accomplishments in education of the Johnson presidency. 
   While novel in his day, the Johnson administration's policy to place a national priority on education is supported by large majorities of both parties today, illustrating the long-term righteousness of Johnson's cause. 
   Truly, the only silver bullet to equalize people in this Nation is education. That was LBJ's vision, and perfecting that vision should be our duty in the 21st century. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas for his work in bringing this bill to the floor today.

   Chairman MURTHA is doing some very heavy lifting for the Nation, and I thank you for your work. 
   This bill also contains a significant investment for South Texas, which contributes significantly to the Nation's military readiness. As the House point man on Readiness matters in our military, I have been deeply concerned that the Iraq conflict has eroded the readiness of the U.S. armed forces, perhaps for a generation. 
   At a time when we need to be more ready than before, this is a tremendous cause for alarm. 
   Today's bill addresses many of our current needs associated with: beefing up today's ground forces--our boots on the ground overseas; addressing the many failings of this administration and the last Congress in ensuring our military is ready for any challenge we need to meet, such as finally providing oversight of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan; fully funding critical needs at depots that supply our troops; providing funds for National Guard equipment to make us safer here, and make our soldiers safer on the battlefields; and providing assistance for wounded warriors. 
   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his hard work on the bill; and the gentlewoman from New York for her work on this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to lament the tragedy that has held our attention and broken our hearts nationwide as we hear more and more about the massacre at Virginia Tech this week ..... And I thank my friend the gentleman from Virginia for bringing this resolution to the floor today. 
   Sometimes a child of this nation is pathologically disturbed beyond control or even hope of understanding that murderous pathology ..... but in the events that follow horror--Columbine, or 9-11, or the massacre at Virginia Tech ..... or standing on a faraway battlefield ..... or even the spectacle of being the object of nation ridicule ..... our children have inspired us with their guts and their fast reactions in the face of numbing shock. 
   They reacted well to events that defied understanding, and touched our hearts and gave us a glimpse of our future. Our nation is in the hands of these extraordinary young people, all over the nation ..... those almost too young to remember Columbine, tempered by their early teenage prism of 9-11. This nation should find our comfort in the lessons from our children: adversity brings hope and when the worst of humanity shows itself, the best of humanity raises up to heal together. 
   Just now, there are thousands of facts still unknown about the Virginia Tech massacre ..... thousands of second guesses about all manner of the university response ..... and certainly thousands of questions and many more stories to come. 
   Today, I join parents from South Texas and around the nation as we pray for the students that were lost in Blacksburg, for their families ..... and for the millions of students and parents now psychologically wounded by the reality that students in college are hardly safe from dangerous minds and wounded souls. 
   To the families of those who lost loved ones, whose loved ones were wounded, and for the families of those students at Virginia Tech mourning their friends ..... know that this House--and the larger American family--are praying for them and standing with them at this most difficult moment. We are also praying for the family of the gunman; and we urge that there be no retaliation for these hideous acts. 
   When a parent sends a child to college, we are so proud. We are also worried about the choices they will make as they leave the safe harbor of our homes and neighborhoods ..... but today, there's a whole new horror to contend with. 
   As we learn more in the coming weeks, my colleagues and I are committed to finding new solutions to the monumental problems our schools and colleges face in protecting the safety of our children. And we will remain forever sobered by the fact that nothing can ever completely protect us--or our children--from a madman intent on killing.

   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the chorus of voices in commending the achievements of the Rutgers University women's basketball team and applauding the character and integrity of their student-athletes in the face of unmitigated outrage and public humiliation. 
   This is to thank these young women--and their coach--for the life lessons they taught all of us, both on and off the basketball court. Their stoic dignity and remarkable grace under tremendous pressure and embarrassment were nothing short of a central moment in our national life. 
   I may be the only one who didn't listen to Don Imus' radio show--I've never been a fan of talk radio, particularly talk radio that exists to exacerbate the pathology of hate speech among us that pointedly seeks to diminish our fellow citizens because of race or gender. 
   Many people find that funny. I don't ..... and submit that if something is truly funny, everybody laughs. When an audience sucks in their breath in horror, they are not amused. 
   Free speech? Of course it is, and anybody in this country can say anything they want to, anytime they wish, and they can be as hateful or mean as they choose to be. But, Imus' show went out over the public airwaves--owned by all of us--and was supported by advertisers at MSNBC and CBS. Free speech does not mean you can hurt people over the public airwaves, and it does not mean advertisers must continue to support that hateful speech. So let us not blur the issue on that. 
   The young ladies of the Rutgers women's basketball team overcame all the odds to get to the final game of the NCAA women's championship, and they came heartbreakingly close to winning the national championship. Their grace and extraordinary sportsmanship was first evident at that game and afterwards ..... then under the glare of the national spotlight as objects of Imus' cruel ridicule. 
   It is important to note here that it was the advertisers on Imus' show that showed the most backbone in pulling their ads, essentially saying: our consumers don't appreciate this, goodbye. Had they not pulled their ads, Imus would have completed the familiar cycle of apology and continued ridicule of women and minorities in the name of humor. 
   The advertisers could not help but be moved by the image of these student athletes calmly relating how the words that hurt so much affected them. Their quiet dignity moved this nation--and was the exact opposite image of a shock jock trying mightily to hold onto a job so he could continue to make fun of them and many other minorities. 
   I thank these young women--and the leadership of their coach--in teaching all of us a lesson in how this nation treats all our citizens, how we use the public airwaves, and the power of consumers with advertisers in winnowing out that which is hateful entertainment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the premiere component of today's forces, our Nation's Special Forces including soldiers, sailors and marines. These are the forces we turn to when we must do the impossible, do it quietly, and do it smartly. I am proud to commend them on their 20th year of service to this Nation. 
   Our Special Forces were born of necessity in the aftermath of the aborted military operation attempting to rescue American hostages held in Iran. Since that time, they have been the very tip of our spear; they are the first forces to go into the dangerous places, and it is upon their resilience and brilliance that rest our success or failure in the early going of any operation to which we have committed our military forces. 
   The past 25 years have seen a marked shift in the operational spectrum of threats, and Special Ops is our answer to unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, strategic reconnaissance, civil-military operations, psychological operations, humanitarian assistance and search and rescue. 
   Special Forces are so important to the current conflicts in which we are engaged, they are the lead combatant command, covering both wars. 
   Special Forces is populated with many individuals recognized for distinction and valor, including 48 Congressional Medals of Honor. While bombs and bullets are our blunt force, the Special Forces is our scalpel. They are forged in four common truths: Humans are more important than hardware; Special Forces cannot be mass-produced; quality is better than quantity; and capable Special Forces cannot be created after an emergency. 
   Today we honor that mindset, and thank these Special Forces for their leadership and bravery. We also honor their families, who offer them tremendous support while they are deployed.

   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, I want to say thank you to both Chairman Bordallo and my good friend from Alaska (Mr. Young) who have had an opportunity to spend time in my district. 
   Today I rise in support of H.R. 4828, the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park Boundary Expansion and Redesignation Act of 2008. The battle of Resaca de la Palma--fought in 1846 in what is now the city of Brownsville, Texas--marked one of the early victories in the United States-Mexican War for the American forces. 
   General Zachary Taylor, who would later become the 12th President of the United States, was a very notable participant in this battle.     
   The United States troops suffered 45 men dead and 228 wounded; Mexican forces counted 169 dead and 228 wounded. 
   H.R. 4828 will expand the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site, currently under the National Park Service, to include the Resaca de la Palma Battlefield site. 
   The bill will preserve the battlefield site, support education and special events there, and develop an interpretive trail with exhibits, living history programs, and other community gatherings. 
   The site will also conserve the increasingly rare Rio Grande delta landscape and protect native chaparral, prairie and brush, and native species. It used to be more than 100 acres, but now it has been reduced to 34 aches of land, so we need to preserve this site. 
   Though the battle at Resaca de la Palma was fought by two warring nations, it is historically significant because it is unique to the south Texas border culture. More than just a relic of the past, the Resaca de la Palma Battlefield is a vast, outdoor classroom that preserves a vital piece of our Nation's history. 
   My hope is that scholars, historians, and everyday citizens will learn and appreciate the sacrifice of all those who perished here on this battlefield. 
   A coalition of local groups, community leaders, and private citizens has done a tremendous job in maintaining the Resaca de la Palma. I wish to thank them for their hard work and dedication in preserving an important piece of our Nation's history. 
   But it is now vital for the site to have full support and resources that only the National Park Service can provide. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation. 
   And I thank you and Chairman YOUNG and Chairman BORDALLO for supporting this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2829, the Financial Services--General Government Appropriations bill. This bill enhances key American priorities, while providing less overall than the President requested for agencies in this bill. 
   We are committed to making our tax system fairer for millions of Americans--and to enhance enforcement to make sure everyone pays what they owe, not just those who play by the rules, while improving taxpayers' services. This bill will spur job creation and make the economy work for everyone--by restoring the President's cuts in small business loans, rejecting his efforts to slash capital and financial services available to underserved communities (CDFI), and by strengthening consumer protections. 
   We are also working to make sure that every vote counts in our elections, and to strengthen law enforcement, both against terrorism and in the war on drugs. This bill meets two key commitments of this Congress: it has complete transparency on its earmarks, and it also cuts the amount for earmarks in the bill in half. 
   Our bill lowers the cost of Small Business 7(a) loans and rejects the President's proposal to stop this program that helps small businesses start-up and grow. The 7(a) loan program accounts for roughly 30 percent of all long-term small business borrowing in America, and is the only source of affordable, long-term financing for many of our Nation's small businesses, including many in South Texas. 
   I'm pleased that the bill includes greater access to capital for economic development in disadvantaged and rural communities. We reject the President's proposal to cut by 50 percent the availability of credit, capital and financial services to underserved communities through the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Instead, our bill provides $46 million more than last year to support economic development and financial services in disadvantaged and rural communities through housing loans, micro-business loans, community development banks and credit unions. 
   The report lists the recipient and the sponsor for each earmark contained in the bill. Of the 165 earmarks in the bill, 148 were requested by lawmakers and 17 by President Bush. Furthermore, each sponsor has filed a certification that the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse have no financial interest in the earmark, which is publicly available. 
   I am pleased the committee included funding for the University of Texas at Brownsville's International Trade Center. Brownsville has always been the front door to international trade given its proximity to Mexico and the land and sea ports in the city. This funding will be used to establish an International Trade Center at the UTB International Technology Education and Commerce Campus (ITECC) which will house all of the services required to conduct international trade including: international law, accounting, banking, insurance, logistics services, export-import marketing services, U.S. customs, government trade services and industry showrooms for specific target sectors such as medical, communications, and computer technology. 
   By concentrating all of the components for trade in one location the ITC will generate significantly higher levels of international trade and associated jobs in Brownsville, making this an excellent investment in South Texas and the Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, today's CHAMP bill is one of the best pieces of legislation the house has considered in a decade. It illustrates the difference between how this Congress writes legislation and how the Republican Congress wrote bills; today's bill favors children, the Republican bill favored insurance companies. 
   This bill will provide health care to 11 million kids--five million who currently lack health insurance and six million who are currently covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP--by reauthorizing and improving SCHIP. In Texas, more than 120,000 will benefit. 
   This bill also reverses the Republican drive to privatize Medicare and strengthens Medicare to: ensure beneficiaries' access to their doctors; expand preventive benefits, mental health services and physical, occupational and speech therapies; reduce costs for seniors and people with disabilities with low incomes; protect consumers; and extend policies that protect access to health care in rural communities. 
   Congress created SCHIP in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. This year, six million children have health care because of SCHIP. The program has worked well in Texas. This is an excellent investment for this Nation given that health care costs without insurance would be much more expensive. 
   The funding for SCHIP expires September 30. If Congress does not act, these six million children will no longer have access to quality, affordable health insurance. These children are in working families with parents who either cannot afford insurance or hold jobs that lack health care benefits. 
   The President highlighted his support for SCHIP while running for re-election in 2004, yet the Bush Administration and our Republican colleagues propose underfunding the program significantly, which would cause millions of children to lose coverage. 
   The CHAMP Act protects Medicare from privatization and promotes fiscal responsibility by reducing overpayments to private plans. Current overpayments to private plans cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. According to nonpartisan analysts, private plans are paid, on average, 12 percent more than traditional Medicare--and overpayments to certain plans exceed 50 percent. 
   These overpayments are the result of a decade-long campaign by President Bush and Republicans in Congress to privatize Medicare by undermining traditional Medicare and promoting private insurance. Republicans believe that the greater the number of beneficiaries enrolled in private plans, the easier it will be to privatize Medicare. 
   The CHAMP Act guarantees seniors and people with disabilities can continue to see their doctors by preventing scheduled physician payment cuts from taking place. 
   The CHAMP Act extends expiring provisions that, if left unchanged, would negatively affect rural beneficiaries' access to physicians, hospitals, home health, ambulances, and lab services--all of which are important to south Texas. 
   The bill also adds important consumer protections to Medicare. It provides States with the authority to regulate private plans' marketing abuses and increases penalties for violations, enables all beneficiaries to switch Part D plans if plans alter their formulas. This empowers low-income beneficiaries to change plans at any time. It also requires greater quality reporting to ensure patients are getting the best care available. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill--and I encourage the President to do the right thing and sign it, our children and their grandparents are waiting.

   Well, this Congress will not proceed down that road. Before we can begin the regular funding process, we have to pay the bills the last Congress ran up, then did not pay. That's where we are today. And it is a position none of us are happy about. 
   There is a long list of items that should be in this CR that would have benefited the people in my south Texas Congressional district, but since the previous Congress could not be bothered to pay the bills, we will have to begin again to put these in our appropriations bills this year. 
   Among the many items that will now go unfunded is an improvement to help speed up repair of helicopters coming home from and going back to Iraq and Afghanistan at the Corpus Christi Army Depot. 
   The items that this CR is not funding are not the wasteful spending that characterized the last several Congresses. The items we are cutting here are important national priorities for the health, education and well being of our children and the less fortunate among us, as well as defense priorities for the Nation. 
   Just this morning, I chaired my first Readiness Subcommittee hearing--a joint hearing with Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee--where we heard time and time again about how much more help the depots needed to repair the equipment our soldiers in the field need so very much. 
   Not including the funding for helicopter repair at CCAD is part of the price we--as a nation--are paying for the disregard the previous Congress showed for the readiness of our troops, and for the disposition of the job Congress is elected to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan resolution. 
   I could ask a question, were we ready to go to war? I don't think so. 
   I just want to put a little of the history of Iraq in context. And we probably remember these names, Specialist Edgar Hernandez, Specialist Joseph Hudson, Specialist Shoshana Johnson, PFC Jessica Lynch, PFC Patrick Miller and Sergeant James Riley. They were all members of the 507th Maintenance Company that went missing after an Iraqi ambush in Nasiriya on March 23, 2003. 
   They were a maintenance company. They weren't supposed to be in front of the infantry. And, of course, we understand this is war and there is a confusion.     
   They were taken prisoners. But this illustrates for us again that we were not ready for this war from the beginning. We went in with too few soldiers, who, by the way, were not greeted with flowers or parades. This administration went against the recommendations of the Chief of Staff of the Army, General  Shinseki, who said, you know what, we need no less than 250,000 troops to overwhelm the enemy. So what happened? We went in with less than that. What was the goal? To go straight to Baghdad. And we left the left flank, the right flank completely open. Not only that. With thousands of ammunition dumps all over the place in Iraq, you know what? They were ready for war. They were ready for us. But we were not ready for them. Because a lot of things went wrong in this war. The intelligence was flawed. It was wrong. And, my friends, I am saying this because we cannot afford to make a another mistake such as this. 
   I was just at a hearing about an hour ago, 2 hours ago, and let me read to you what the Chief of Staff of the Army, Schoomaker, said just a few moments ago. He said, ``After years of insufficient investment in the Army, many of our units were underequipped and not ready for deployment, especially in our Reserve units. To meet combatant commanders' immediate wartime needs, we pulled equipment from across the force to equip those soldiers deploying into harm's way, a practice that we are continuing today to meet current operational needs.'' 
   My friends, we are at war. We support our soldiers. The men and women in uniform are in dangerous places around the world to do their duty on behalf of all of us, military, civilian, Republicans, Democrats, and independents. 
   This resolution is very simple: Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq; and Congress disapproves of the decision of the President of the United States, George W. Bush, who announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq. 
   Now, it is going to take more than 21,000 soldiers. You have got to send support troops. So I think sometimes I wonder whether if we could just pause or take time off so that we could regroup or correct the mistakes. But you can't do that when you are in the middle of two wars. 
   This is a different mission, and we ask our soldiers to do the best that they can, and then we say that we need for the Iraqis to stand up so we can stand down. My friends, if we cannot even equip our military, how can we expect to equip the Iraqis so that they can stand up?

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, a government of the people only works when transparency and accountability are the watchwords of the day. This is vital when it comes to contracting. Democracy suffers when our government spends taxpayer money on contracts that can include fraud, waste, and abuse. 
   Nowhere is this more apparent than in defense-related contracts that are single-sourced  and rarely overseen. Our troops don't have the equipment they need in the field; and taxpayers are losing billions in fraud and abuse in contracts. 
   The bill before us today ends waste in Federal contracting, by reducing the use of no-bid contracts, mandating disclosure of no-bid contracts and contract overcharges, and closing the revolving door between government procurement officials and private contractors. The wasted money would be far better used to improve readiness needs--currently in deep crisis. 
   We have to reconstruct our military that has been decimated by the Iraq war. A good beginning to that long and difficult task is providing open competition in contracting in order to provide the best services for our military in both wars. 
   Congress has exposed a pattern of reckless spending, poor planning, and ineffective oversight in contracting that has resulted in the waste of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in no-bid contracts for Halliburton and for contracts for Hurricane Katrina. 
   This legislation builds on the progress we are making to return to the basic principles of fiscal responsibility and to restore Congress's role as a check and balance to the Executive Branch, particularly on training and equipping of our troops, in order to make this government more accountable to the American people. 
   Specifically, the legislation would change Federal acquisition law to require agencies to limit the use of emergency no-bid contracts and to increase transparency and accountability in Federal contracting in an effort to protect the taxpayers' money. To restore accountability in the Federal contracting process, the bill would instruct agencies to minimize the use of no-bid contracts, promote the use of cost-effective fixed-price contracts, and limit the duration of no-bid contracts awarded in emergencies to one year. 
   It also promotes transparency by requiring public disclosure of the rationale for using no-bid contracts, and requiring agencies to report to Congress on overcharges in contracts. To improve the integrity in contracting, the bill closes the revolving door between government procurement officials and private contractors. 
   Spending on no-bid contracts has more than doubled under the Bush Administration with a 75 percent increase in spending on contracts that reward companies for every taxpayer dollar spent, not saved with more than $2.4 billion squandered on no-bid contracts for Halliburton in Iraq, with another or the other $23 billion for other abuse-prone contracts. That money lost to fraud and abuse would have gone a long way in equipping our troops in the field. 
   Mr. Chairman, our military readiness is in crisis in no small measure due to the waste, fraud and abuse that is inherent in how this government has awarded contracts in Iraq and elsewhere. I ask the House to join me in supporting this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, and I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter and the members of the full committee and the staff for doing a great job. 
   The bill before us begins to address our growing concerns about the readiness posture of our Armed Forces; yet the breadth and the scope of our readiness has been deeply damaged by virtue of operations and many years of ignoring this problem. Our troops and their equipment have been stretched by extended combat operations, and the strain is evident in declining readiness, shortfalls in training and difficulties in equipping our forces. 
   These problems have grown to immense proportions, and this bill is a significant step to reverse the decline and to rebuild our military. Included in the bill are some significant readiness policy initiatives and investments that will help restore the readiness posture of our military. 
   First, this bill establishes a Defense Readiness Production Board to identify critical readiness requirements and to mobilize the defense industrial base to speed up the production of military equipment. This board will bridge the gap between readiness needs and resources to help repair our worn-out equipment. 
   The bill also creates a $1 billion Strategic Readiness Fund to give the board and the Department of Defense the ability to rapidly attend to pressing readiness needs. 
   This bill begins to address other shortfalls in maintenance and training by providing $250 million for unfunded training requirements and an additional $150 million to restore aviation maintenance shortfalls. 
   And we're very concerned about the readiness of our National Guard. Our bill requires the Department of Defense to begin measuring the readiness of National Guard units to support emergencies in their home States, such as the recent tragic tornadoes in Kansas. These readiness reports will allow the Congress and each State's Governor to evaluate the needs of each State and address problems before a disaster occurs. To help restore the shortfalls, the bill includes a $1 billion investment in National Guard equipment. 
   We also include provisions that require plans and reports to Congress on reconstituting our prepositioned war stocks. We also authorized more than $21 billion for military construction, family housing and to implement base realignment and closure. These funds include money to support grow-the-force initiatives for the Army and Marine Corps and to provide facilities to accommodate new recruits and missions. 
   Other significant provisions include proposed changes to the National Security Personnel System, depot initiatives and numerous important policy initiatives by the Department of Defense. 
   This is a good bill, and I am pleased to have helped in some way in shaping this bill. It reflects our bipartisan desire to improve readiness and to provide for the men and women in uniform. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, the way to support the troops is to give them what they need on the battlefield, and what they need when they return home from their service to reset--or rest and fix the force for future missions. 
   This government must be accountable to our troops and their families, the only people actually carrying the burden for these wars today ..... along with our children, for whom we are leaving the cost. 
   Today's bill provides much needed money for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan ..... policy that requires accountability from the Administration ..... and funding to heal the readiness of our troops. 
   It is not the best bill we could get, but you never have a perfect bill. 
   But the predicament we are in now demands we support this bill. 
   We have so many emergencies on our doorstep now ..... mostly because the last Congress refused to see the negative impact operations in Iraq had on our military readiness, leaving us vulnerable as a nation ..... and leaving important national business undone. 
   Support for the troops is entirely about giving them what they need to fight the battles we've committed them to fight ..... and this legislation does just, with one eye on the future ..... something previous Congresses failed to do. 
   I wish the Congress would have put more energy into readiness oversight over the past 5 years to prevent the current situation ..... but all we can do today is go forward. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting our troops--and this funding for them. 
   Today's bill addresses many of these readiness concerns, with additions above the President's request to support our troops, including: 
   $2 billion more to address the current readiness crisis of our stateside troops, including ensuring that they are better equipped and trained; 
   $1.1 billion more for military housing allowances; 
   $3 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for troops in Iraq ($1.2 billion above the President's request); 
   $1.6 billion for body armor; 
   $9.7 billion to train and equip Afghan and Iraqi security forces. 
   It also fully funds the BRAC accounts so communities like the Coastal Bend of Texas--and others adversely affected by base closure decisions--can plan appropriately for that eventuality. 
   So many Americans are coming home alive--yet traumatized in their minds or bodies--to an extent we have never seen before. The scandalous treatment of heroes at Walter Reed--and the fact that it took a newspaper story to change it--is testament to the gigantic challenges facing military and veterans' health care. 
   The Supplemental includes funding for new initiatives to enhance medical services for active duty forces and mobilized personnel, and their family members (appropriating $2.1 billion more than the President requested.) These initiatives include: 
   $900 million for Traumatic Brain Injury care and research and PTSD treatment and research; 
   $20 million for facility improvement at Walter Reed. 
   The bill includes $1.8 billion over the President's request to address the health care needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and the backlog in maintaining VA health care facilities, including: 
   $30 million for at least one new Level I polytrauma center; 
   $9.4 million in operations costs for new polytrauma residential transitional rehab programs; 
   $10 million for additional transition caseworkers; 
   $10 million for blind rehab programs; 
   $100 million for enhancements to mental health services; 
   $20 million for substance abuse treatment; 
   $8 million for polytrauma clinic support teams; 
   $25 million for prosthetics; 
   $228.9 million in additional funds to treat veterans from both wars. 
   This bill is an excellent starting point for this new Congress to begin the long overdue oversight of the defense department. We are far ahead of the past Congresses in giving our troops the true support they need--with appropriate funding and acknowledgment of the strain and burden of Iraq. 
   While the ideal situation for Congress is for the authorizing committee to determine policy, that's coming very soon. I am grateful to Chairman Murtha for the extraordinary lengths we've gone to in this bill to protect our soldiers by certifying their readiness, protecting the military readiness of the United States. 
   While this bill is not perfect, it is an extraordinary first step. 
   As the Readiness Subcommittee Chair, let me offer the House some perspective on the current state of our readiness: 
   In the National Intelligence Estimate declassified on Feb. 2, the U.S. intelligence services note that--absent a remarkable reversal of fortunes in Iraq--they find that ``the overall security situation will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter part of 2006.'' Further, the NIE determines: ``even if the violence is diminished ..... Iraqi leaders will be  hard pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the time frame of this estimate''--which is 12-18 months. 
   The NIE goes on to say that if the U.S. were to leave Iraq, a greater, wider civil war would erupt, saying: ``the ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] would be unlikely to survive as a non-sectarian national institution, and neighboring countries might intervene openly in the conflict.'' 
   Now, common sense tells me that will be the case whenever we leave ..... today, manana, this summer, next year ..... or 50 years from now. Whenever we leave Iraq, the unclassified intelligence estimate guides us on what we can expect. Our choice is in how long we remain ..... and how many more brave and patriotic volunteers--who carry the battle for this Nation--are lost in Iraq. 
   Today we have a chance to begin that change--in the purest way we can support the troops ..... men and women, and their families, who are alone in carrying the burden for the Iraq war. 
   The readiness of our next deployers--our ability to be prepared for current and future threats--is diminished due to the war in Iraq. We've worn out our force and their equipment, and that has huge implications for our ability to handle the threats to come. 
   The GAO has looked at this ..... and come away saying the Army itself ``cannot determine the extent to which the existing inventory reflects what the Army needs'' ..... and GAO notes that: ``until these strategic and management challenges are addressed, the Army will face uncertain risks should new conflicts occur.'' 
   GAO also reports that all services ``have drawn heavily from their prepositioned stocks to support [the ongoing wars]'' ..... and ``these sustained military operations are taking a toll on the condition and readiness of military equipment and the Army and Marine Corps face a number of long-term challenges that will affect the timing and cost of equipment repair and replacement.'' 
   GAO concludes: ``the Army's decisions today have profound future implications for the entire department and potentially affect our ability to respond to a conflict.'' 
   Last year, Congress established a Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, which has also reported back to us. They tell us point blank: ``DoD's failure to appropriately consider National Guard needs and funding requirements has produced a National Guard that is not fully ready to meet current and emerging missions.'' 
   The Commission says more pointedly: ``The lack of sufficient and ready equipment is a problem common to active and reserve components. 
   In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the U.S. to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.'' 
   Army Chief of Staff Schoomaker told the Commission: despite the readiness of troops overseas, ``88 percent of the forces that are back here in the U.S. are very poorly equipped today in the Army National Guard.'' 
   The Commission also noted that state governors ``have become increasingly concerned about whether their National Guard forces would be available to respond to emergencies here at home.''

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to ask for your help to bring clarity to a disagreement in principle between the Department of Defense and the military depots over the definition of parts supply functions as they pertain to depot-level maintenance. 
   The 2005 BRAC Commission transferred supply, storage and distribution management functions to the Defense Logistics Agency without fully understanding the critical difference between parts supply from storage and in-process parts supply.     
   Without this clarification, military depots could lose control of parts movement during hands-on depot maintenance. Depot maintenance of war-related equipment is a critical piece of the services' reset program, and this clarification would ensure reset continues without disruption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. The bill before us today reflects our concern about the continuing decline in the readiness posture of our Armed Forces. 
   And I would like to thank the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Forbes from Virginia, for his help in bringing together this excellent bill. He played a very key role and was very instrumental in putting the readiness and military construction bill together. I would like to say thank you for a great job. 
   Also, Chairman Skelton. 
   And my good friend who is going to be retiring soon. DUNCAN, you and I have gone through a lot. Thank you for all the work that you've done, and we hope to continue on. 
   More than 6 years of continuous combat operations have strained readiness. This strain is manifesting itself in more aspects of our military forces. The bill authorizes $143 million for operation and maintenance. To address the readiness shortfalls in equipment, training, and maintenance, we have added $932 million to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, National Guard, and Reserve operations and maintenance accounts. 
   In addition, we have added funds for Army training, pre-positioned stocks, and aircraft maintenance in our authorization of the fiscal year 2009 supplemental. 
   In response to the Defense Department's increasing reliance on contractor services, this bill requires a comprehensive analysis of what constitutes an ``inherently governmental function.'' It requires the Office of Management and Budget to develop a single definition that may be used consistently by all Federal agencies. 
   The bill includes provisions to address civilians deployed in combat zones. It gives DOD authority to extend the waiver of limitations on premium pay. It also asks for a thorough review of the medical policies and treatment procedures for civilians deployed to support military operations. 
   To address depot workloads following equipment reset, the bill requires the Department of Defense to contract for an independent assessment of the depot capability that will be needed in the future. 
   The bill takes several actions related to energy and environmental policy. It authorizes $80 million for energy conservation projects and updates installation energy reporting requirements. 
   For military construction, base realignment, and closure and family housing in fiscal year 2009, the bill authorizes more than $24 billion. 
   The bill includes several provisions related to BRAC. In the time since the 2005 BRAC Commission reported its recommendations, we have seen costs increase almost 50 percent and the savings have declined. If a future administration were to request a new round of closures, the BRAC process will need to be dramatically different. As such, this year's bill repeals the BRAC Commission and the process that arrived at the 2005 decisions. At the same time, we remain steadfast to completing the 2005 BRAC round on time, by September, 2011, and have fully funded the administration's request. 
   To address our alarm at finding our troops in run-drown and broken barracks, the bill directs that $500 million in the fiscal year 2009 supplemental be used to arrest the declining state of military facilities. 
   The bill also does many good things for South Texas, which I represent. I am pleased that the replacement of the main production facility at Corpus Christi Army Depot was authorized. Corpus Christi Army Depot is the cornerstone of aviation readiness for the Department of Defense. It is vital that the current outdated facility be replaced so that dedicated employees of Corpus Christi Army Depot can continue to deliver products to the military in the most efficient and timely manner. 
   I support H.R. 5658, and I am proud of what this bill does to restore strength to our military. This is a very responsible bill. However, I'm disappointed that our committee adopted an amendment to provide the Department of Defense funding for the southwest border wall. I hope that in the future, defense funding will not be used to build walls. 
   That said, this is a good bill. The chairman of the full committee and the ranking member have done an outstanding job.

   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the long-awaited legislation this nation has desperately needed since the 9/11 attacks on our democracy ..... yet which was pushed to the back burner by the previous Congress. 
   I'm proud that--within the first 100 legislative hours of this Congress--we are considering this bill to make our Nation safer by implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations left out of the Intelligence Reform bill in 2004. The bill also goes beyond the Commission's recommendations by requiring, within five years, 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound shipping containers. 
   I represent two major ports in South Texas--the Port of Brownsville and the Port of Corpus Christi, which also has a strategic sealift command--and the array of possibilities for terrorists to access our Nation through shipping containers is amazing and horrifying. 
   Implementing the Commission's recommendations will make us safer by enhancing homeland security, strengthening efforts to stop the proliferation of WMD, and promoting strategies to reduce the appeal of extremism, particularly in Muslim parts of the world. 
   Today, we are--at long last--making a number of substantial improvements to homeland security, including: distributing homeland security grants on the basis of risk alone; creating a stand-alone grant program for interoperable communications for first responders; requiring a 100 percent inspection of air cargo over the next 3 years; accelerating the installation of explosive detection systems for checked baggage; and mandating a strategic plan to deploy explosive detection equipment at passenger checkpoints. 
   Today's bill also offers provisions to prevent terrorists from acquiring WMD by creating a U.S. Coordinator for the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism and a blue-ribbon commission to recommend further reforms. We also strengthen efforts to eliminate nuclear black-market networks, easily the greatest danger to the civilized nations of the world. 
   Through this bill we offer strategies to reduce the appeal of extremism by providing assistance for expanding modern educational programs for Arab and other Muslim youth around the world, as well as promoting economic opportunities, education reform, human rights, and democratic processes in the countries of the Middle East. 
   This is a good day for this nation ..... and when the president signs this bill into law, we will be a safer nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (RECOGNIZING ANN RICHARDS' EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO TEXAS AND AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, today we are here to pay tribute to the life of the late Governor of Texas, Dorothy Ann Willis Richards. And I want to thank Chairman Waxman, the majority leader, and my good friend, DANNY DAVIS, for bringing this bill to the floor, and my colleagues for taking time from their busy schedule to do what we are doing today. 
   America and the State of Texas both suffered a great loss on September 13, 2006, when Ann Richards met our Maker after a brave struggle with cancer. 
   Growing up as the son of migrant workers in segregated South Texas, I was painfully aware of the power dynamics in place that placed those of privilege high above the working poor. Ann Richards sought to turn that tide around. During her service as Governor of Texas, she appointed more females and minorities than any Governor by far. 
   It was Ann's spunk and her dedication to the people of our beloved State, all the people, that earned her love and admiration of millions of Americans. 
   Following her philosophy of life in public service, ``well-behaved women rarely make history,'' Ann's charm and passion for life propelled her far in the history books. 
   A lifelong public servant, Ann began her career as a Texas school teacher. She later served in Austin as Travis County Commissioner and Texas State Treasurer prior to being elected State Governor in a historic campaign. 
   During her entire public service career, Ann remained a teacher, teaching Texans that the advantage of working together benefited the economy of our State. Even today she still teaches us. 
   Ann Richards is remembered today and always not only for her accomplishments, but also for the way she carried them out. Her disarming wit and wisdom won opponents time and time again. Her big as Texas hair, hearty laugh, piercing blue eyes, and smiling face are unforgettable. She was one of those people you just couldn't help but like, and today I am so happy that they gave us time to honor a great American, a great Governor, and a great friend, Ann Richards.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3222, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, given the many challenges faced by our Nation--and our military--I'm pleased that the House moved the Defense Appropriations Conference Report so quickly. 
   Chairman Murtha is doing some very heavy lifting for the Nation, and I thank him for his work as well. 
   This bill contains a significant investment for south Texas, which contributes notably to the Nation's military readiness. 
   As the House point man on readiness matters in our military, I have been deeply concerned that the Iraq conflict has eroded the  readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces, perhaps for a generation. 
   At a time when we need to be more ready than before, this is a tremendous cause for alarm, as we are prosecuting two separate wars. 
   Today's bill addresses many of our current needs associated with: 
   A pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, 
   Beefing up today's ground forces--our boots on the ground overseas, 
   Addressing the many failings of this administration and the last Congress in ensuring our military is ready for any challenge we need to meet, such as finally providing oversight of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
   Equipping our National Guard to help offset some of the equipment lost to active duty needs in Iraq, and 
   Providing assistance for the men and women who are hospitalized at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which was the center of tremendous shortcomings earlier this year. 
   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his hard work on the bill--as well as the rest of the leadership in the House--for their deep and abiding respect of the U.S. Armed Forces and the unique challenges they face at this moment in time. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill to provide a comprehensive, regional approach to economic and infrastructure development in areas that need it the most, including South Texas. 
   The Southwest Regional Border Authority helps areas along the U.S.-Mexican border, which have: a 20 percent poverty rate, unemployment rates much higher than the national rate, and a lack of capital to spur business growth. 
   This bill offers a significant investment for federal-state partnerships to help economically distressed and underdeveloped areas that have experienced high levels of unemployment, poverty, or population loss. 
   The bill provides an unprecedented amount of money to develop transportation and infrastructure, provide job skills training and support business development. 
   I am personally offended--as are my constituents in South Texas--that the only infrastructure Congress has approved along the border is a wall ..... a wall that won't work and that is entirely about political expediency, not border security. 
   Developing the South Texas infrastructure helps ensure that this region can support the trade that churns through the U.S. economy. 
   South Texas faces a host of challenges in terms of economic development and infrastructure to support trade all along the Southwest border--and the only way to tackle it is all together, not piecemeal. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this bill that is important to both the border region--and the Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, this budget is a commitment to restoring fiscal responsibility while providing for programs that boost economic growth, create new jobs, and provide tax relief to millions of middle-class families. 
   When the President presented the last budget proposal of his administration last month, he cemented his legacy of fiscal irresponsibility. Since January 2001, a $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus has been converted into record deficits and mounting debt. 
   The budget, which will outline Congressional spending for the next fiscal year, rejects the President's original proposal of cutting Medicare/Medicaid, key education programs, and the COPS law enforcement agency grant programs. 
   In contrast to the Administration's budget proposal, this budget passed by the House reaches a balance by FY 2012. It ensures that, under the adopted pay-as-you-go principles, any new spending is offset and does not add to the deficit. 
   With over 20 million middle-class American families facing the burden of paying the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, we have included fiscally responsible legislation that will provide a one-year `patch' and provide AMT relief to those families. 
   This is a budget that defends our Nation and provides for our Nation's veterans and wounded heroes. It increases veterans funding for FY 2009 by $3.6 billion above current levels and $38 billion over the next 5 years. Our budget also allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat 5.8 million patients in 2009 and rejects the $2.3 billion in health care fee increases imposed by the President's budget proposal. 
   The budget also prioritizes resources to restore military readiness that has been worn down by repeated deployments and more than 6 years of war. As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, I am fully aware of the need to restore the strength of our military and protect our country from future attacks. 
   Despite the President's insistence on not expanding children's health insurance program, CHIP, this budget includes a reserve fund to provide up to $50 billion for CHIP. The President's budget proposal also cuts Medicaid by $94 billion over 10 years and a whopping $479 billion from Medicare over the same period. That is unacceptable and Congress rejects those cuts. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this fiscally responsible budget that properly funds our nation's priorities.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, today we begin the process of keeping our promise, our unique moral responsibility to the troops returning home to their families' arms. 
   Many of those warfighters are deeply wounded in body, mind and soul, and it is our responsibility to care for them, to treat their bodies and their minds. 
   I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his work in marking this bill with great speed, also the ranking member, Mr. Hunter, and the House leadership for moving this bipartisan bill so quickly. 
   This legislation provides more funding for caregivers at military hospitals along with training and oversight to guarantee that America's wounded troops will also receive committed quality care. 
   When we marked this bill in the Committee on Armed Services, I added an amendment which places a 1-year moratorium on all unannounced public-private competitions for work performed at medical facilities. It also requires a report from DOD on each competition still underway to allow Congress to understand the actual cost savings, and the effects of contracting on the quality of work and the workforce personnel before allowing the contracting to go forward. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I am a frequent visitor not only to Walter Reed, but to Bethesda as well. In the aftermath of the investigative series about the substandard services and housing at Walter Reed, it turns out that the mismanagement of the health care of our troops had much to do with a flawed contracting process. 
   This bill imposes a 1-year moratorium on future A-76 competitions at the Department of Defense for work at medical facilities. The problems we discovered with the contract at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are only the tip of the iceberg. At the moment Walter Reed should have been ramping up to care for the increased number of wounded warriors, they were single-sourcing a maintenance contract and watching some of their best talent walk out the door as they were caring for a large and growing number of patients. 
   In a September 2006 memo, the garrison commander admitted that he had difficulties in retaining and hiring skilled personnel. 
   This came about for several reasons: DOD wanted to contract out the maintenance work; the proposed firings of former workers; and, of course, BRAC. 
   We need to step back and review whether contracting is the right way to find cost savings and efficiencies for military medical facilities. And we must make certain that we have not sacrificed service or performance of the health care mission for our wounded fighters. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this bill to reform the administrative process and restore the confidence in the integrity and efficiency of the disability evaluation system and begin a better transition of servicemembers to the Department of Veterans' Affairs programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, this is the second time in so many weeks we are standing up for America's children. After the President vetoed the State Children's Health Insurance bill, he has still not seen the light ..... but he has felt the heat. 
   Since that veto, and a flurry of negotiations to tweak the bill to engage the President to sign it, the American people have spoken out with gusto: they believe this is a commonsense bill that will serve our children. 
   And so this bill is before us again. 
   I urge Members of the House and the President to stand this time with working families and children ..... not with insurance companies. The President's veto cut off health care for over 120,000 kids in Texas. 
   Congress created SCHIP in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. This year, 6 million children have health care because of SCHIP. The program has worked well in Texas. This has been an excellent investment for our nation, given that health care costs without insurance would be much more expensive. 
   The President highlighted his support for SCHIP while running for re-election in 2004. Today we are giving him--and those who stood with him in sustaining his veto--one more chance to do the right thing for America's children. 
   This children's healthcare program was never intended to replace Medicaid. It only covers the children of parents who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but earn too little to purchase private health insurance. For the President to continue to misrepresent this fact shows a tremendous lack of sensitivity for working Americans who often take on two jobs to simply feed and clothe their children. 
   It is these families who need to know we are on their side, and I urge the President this time around to join us in taking care of ``the least of these.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We are the last hope of children and families all over this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Madam Speaker, this is a defining moment for the state of health care in this Nation ..... a defining moment for this Congress ..... and a moment when the country will watch this government take sides. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance bill is one of the best pieces of bipartisan legislation the House has considered in a decade. It lays bare the most significant difference between what this Congress supports and what the President--and those who stand with him in support of his veto--supports. 
   Supporters of SCHIP stand with working families and children ..... opponents here in Congress--and the President--stand with insurance companies. The President's veto cut off health care for over 120,000 kids in Texas. 
   There's just no lipstick to pretty up this pig. The President's veto was downright mean. He leaves a legacy of a war he won't pay for and children he won't give health care to. Being for war and against kids is an awful record and a horrible legacy. 
   Those who stand with the President today in sustaining his veto of this bipartisan bill will bear the ridicule of that record the next time they face the voters. 
   Those who do an unpopular thing--knowing it is the right thing to do--are rewarded by history. History will accurately note that those supporting the President in this veto are doing the bidding of the health insurance companies, at the expense of our children. Those supporting the President's veto are doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons. 
   Congress created SCHIP in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. This year, 6 million children have health care because of SCHIP. The program has worked well in Texas. This has been an excellent investment for our nation, given that health care costs without insurance would be much more expensive. 
   The President highlighted his support for SCHIP while running for re-election in 2004. Today he--and those who stand with him in sustaining this veto--show their true colors: say one thing in political campaigns, do another when the moment comes to record your vote ..... when the rubber hits the road. 
   I urge my colleagues to override this veto. We are the last hope of children and families all over this country. They are watching us--all of us.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, it was a dark day when this House strong-armed and bribed members into passing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare that served the pharmaceutical industry--rather than serving the seniors unable to afford prescription drugs. 
   Finding the way to fix the entire program will take us a while longer ..... but I am proud that today we are attacking one of the most egregious parts of that law, the portion that was designed as payback for the pharmaceutical industry. Paying the full cost of the prescription drugs makes the cost for this program astronomical; and the fact the law prohibits the government from negotiating for lower prices was particularly galling. 
   Now, in the first 100 legislative hours of the 110th Congress, we are passing this bill to cut the cost of health care and improve access to medicines by requiring HHS to negotiate with drug companies or lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. This bill we consider today will certainly save millions of dollars taxpayers now pay to have a prescription drug benefit 
   Mr. Speaker, I am incredibly proud to stand today with you, with our colleagues, and with millions of seniors and U.S. taxpayers as we ensure that Medicare's drug component serves senior citizens, not the pharmaceutical lobby.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of HR 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. 
   A college education continues to be a great path to prosperity. But more and more, high college prices and other obstacles are putting a college degree further out of reach for our students. In addition to rising tuition, students and their families face a complex federal student aid application process and student loan industry. 
   The legislation will streamline the application process for financial aid, will allow for students to better manage textbook costs, and increase college aid and support programs for veterans and military families. 
   Many college students--including 37 percent of Hispanic students--receive Pell Grants each year, and this bill will now allow students to receive these vital grants year round. 
   It also increases authorization levels for the TRIO program to $400 million and GEAR UP program to $950 million, both of which prepare low-income and first-generation students with the challenges for college. 
   Many students find themselves in financial troubles because they are not aware of the rising costs or the details of the loans they take out. This legislation will hold student loan lenders more accountable for any potentially predatory actions, but students and their families will now have more information about all the options and costs to attend college. 
   Though we have passed this important piece of legislation, we are by no means done with higher education issues. The President's budget cut funding to Hispanic-serving institutions, and I will work with my colleagues to ensure those institutions receive proper funding. All students deserve to have as many resources as we can provide to them to better themselves and their positions in life.

<DOCNO>Mr. ORTIZ. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ORTIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to begin a responsible redeployment of our forces now in Iraq. The defense of our homeland is paramount and we are vulnerable for an attack. The war in Iraq has damaged the readiness of our military. Our ability to defend our Nation is at stake. 
   Today's report on benchmarks is further evidence that this Administration can only see the situation in Iraq through rose-colored glasses. It's time for serious policy makers--for American patriots--to find a way out of Iraq so we can focus on defending our Nation against al Qaeda, as well as other threats to national security. 
   This administration has no plan to defend the United States, and they did great damage to the defense of this country with the ``catch and release'' operation they had on our southern border. ``Catch and release'' sent all non-Mexicans who came in illegally to the interior of the Nation with a paper compelling them to return for deportation. 
   By virtue of ``catch and release'' we face the prospect of possibly hundreds of cells already in country awaiting an attack order. 
   What happens if al Qaeda attacks a nuclear facility? Do we have a plan for that? Who moves into defensive and containment posture? Do we even have the troops presently in country to provide that defense and containment? 
   What happens if there is an attack on a military base? There will be military officials nearby, but how will they respond? 
   What happens if there is a bio-chemical attack in an American city? Who responds--and how will our citizens be protected? 
   A shoulder launched weapon from a building top in New York, Washington DC, or another major American city would be devastating ..... and show our lack of preparation 6 years after 9/11 when many of us ran from these buildings, not sure we would ever see them again. 
   Today's report about the resurgence of al Qaeda is no surprise for us. Ever since Congress was deliberately misled by the President into authorizing the Iraq war in 2002, the war in Iraq sucked precious resources away from our focus on al Qaeda. When we invaded Iraq in 2003, the Iraq al Qaeda presence was in a single village in Kurdistan along the Iranian border. Today, it is impossible to estimate the number of al Qaeda fighters we have drawn to Iraq through our invasion. 
   We inadvertently aided al Qaeda through our invasion of Iraq by giving al Qaeda a recruitment opportunity for radical Muslims throughout the Middle East; giving al Qaeda the means to perfect urban warfare; tying down our military in Iraq, giving al Qaeda space to grow and operate, and most urgently, deeply damaging the readiness of the U.S. military and making the U.S. less safe for ourselves and our children. 
   At least one branch of this government must begin the painfil process of finding an ending to our involvement in a civil war we facilitated. 
   Many colleagues here seem to believe our withdrawal will leave behing an even bloodier civil war. I agree; but that will be the case whenever we leave there ..... be it today, tomorrow, next year, or a decade from now. The only difference we can make in that regard is how many American souls will die on the Iraqi battlefield between now and the day our forces withdraw. 
   Others have pinned all hope on the fledgling Iraqi government seated on March 16, 2005 ..... a government that has been unable to elect a Speaker for their Parliament and rarely produces a quorum. We have lost 1,282 American soldiers during the same time. 
   Bear in mind, al Qaeda is not the only threat we face in the future ..... North Korea, the militarization of South America ..... and many other threats are a reality for this nation in the decade to come. We must be prepared for all of them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill.

   I also want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes) for his help in bringing together this excellent bill. And I would like to thank my staff because they did a heck of a good job meeting with Senate staff and many other committees before bringing this bill to the House floor. 
   I am proud to say this bill focuses on restoring the readiness of our military. However, there is much work to be done. Significant investments will need to be made in the upcoming years by Congress and the next administration or we will risk breaking our forces. 
   This bill continues the work of the Armed Services Committee to restore readiness by authorizing $154 billion for operations, maintenance and training, and $25 billion for military construction. And $8.6 billion for the Army and $1.8 billion for the Marine Corps was authorized for the repair and replacement of equipment. 
   To address depot workloads following equipment reset, the bill requires the Department of Defense to contract for an independent assessment of the depot capability that will be needed in the future. 
   The bill takes positive steps to restrain the Department of Defense's increased reliance on the use of contractors to perform critical functions, including development of a single definition of ``inherently governmental,'' development of policies on personal conflicts of interest, and limits on personal service contracts. 
   We continue to take steps to look out for our deployed civilian employees by lifting limits on premium pay and allowing them to voluntarily sign up for additional life insurance. 
   But I am concerned that the bill does not address the Department of Defense's aggressive use of public-private competitions. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bill. It is a very good bill.
