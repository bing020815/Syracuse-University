<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. I hear my colleagues on the other side talking about political games and partisanship and process. The GI Bill of 1944 made the middle class of this Nation. Many of us are here today because of the GI Bill. My dad came back from World War II and was able to get some education, but he bought a house in Levittown, New York, for a couple grand, and we became part of the middle class for the first time in our history. 
   It's time for a GI Bill for the 21st century, and that's what this supplemental has. It says to our young men and women who are fighting, We're going to pay for the full cost of college for 4 years when you get back; we're going to take care of some of the living expenses if you have a family, and we're going to put the National Guard and Reserve that are doing so much of the fighting in Iraq as eligible for most of the benefits for the GI Bill. That's what we need in the supplemental. 
   We have a supplemental for the war. We need a supplemental for the warrior. The fact the first year, 2 years of this bill for the GI Bill was paid for, we  spent the same amount in 2 days of the war in Iraq. This is a reasonable amount of money to spend on those who have given us so much. 
   General Washington said over 220 years ago, The single most important factor in the morale of our fighting troops is a sense of how they're going to be treated when they come home. When they come home, many of them with amputations, many of them with psychological wounds, we want to say we're going to make sure we take care of you, we're going to make sure you get some college education, we're going to make sure that you can take a part of the American dream. That's what we owe our soldiers. That's what we owe our Reserve and National Guard, and that's what this supplemental has. 
   I don't care. You can talk about partisanship and political games. We're talking about the welfare of these young men and women who have given so much. Let's give them a part of the American Dream.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (MICHAEL A. MARZANO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is to name the VA Outpatient Clinic in Hermitage, Pennsylvania, after U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Michael A. Marzano. It was brought to us by Congressman English and Congressman Altmire from Pennsylvania.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1594, a bill to name the VA Outpatient Clinic in Hermitage, Pennsylvania, after U.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Michael A. Marzano. 
   A native of Greenville, Pennsylvania, Sgt. Marzano courageously overcame a wrestling injury to his knee during his senior year of high school to realize his long held aspirations of becoming a United States Marine, four years after initially being denied entry for this reason. What tenacity! 
   In fact when called up in 1999, having won several amateur titles, he was training as a boxer in preparation for competing in the 2000 Olympics. But he sacrificed it all for his country to serve as Marine. 
   I think we can all agree that it takes a special kind of courage to volunteer one's self to serve in harm's way for the good of our Nation. Well, Sgt. Marzano volunteered twice to serve as a member of our military armed forces. For his last tour, Sgt. Marzano enlisted with a Marine Reserve unit with the specific intention of serving in Iraq. 
   Duing his tour of duty in Iraq, Sgt. Marzano served in Iraq with Ohio's 3rd Battalion, 25th Regiment of the 4th Marine Division, and was a leader among his fellow Marines. 
   According to one of the many veterans' organizations supporting the dedication of this VA clinic in his honor, ``he performed his duty with honor and heroism and was a shining example to his men, to the U.S. Marine Corps and to everyone who served and continues to serve our great country.'' 
   On May 8th of 2005, Sgt. Marzano was part of a Quick Reaction Force serving in the city of Haditha in Al-Anbar province, Iraq. Sgt. Marzano and the members of his team were tasked with protecting the rest of the force as they battled several insurgents who had overrun a local hospital. The local hospital contained many workers and patients who were held captive as insurgents used them as human shields. 
   Sgt. Marzano and his small group heroically kept the insurgents at bay providing the platoon the time they needed to engage the enemy and turn them back. Tragically, a suicide bomber driving in a vehicle borne with an improvised explosive device detonated in the area where Sgt. Marzano's quick reaction force was operating, killing Michael and three of his fellow service members. 
   Because of the valiant actions and sacrifice of Sgt. Marzano, Lance Corporal Lance Graham, Sergeant Aaron Cepeda, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Jeffrey Wiener, the Marines were able to secure the area under siege and free the Iraqis trapped inside the hospital which had been set on fire by the explosion of the IED. 
   No doubt, Sgt. Marzano is a true hero. His good nature, leadership-by-example and love-  of-country demeanor, as well as many other fine attributes, are missed by many who knew him both inside and outside of the Marine Corps he so dearly loved. 
   Sgt. Marzano's family has carried on his spirit of service by becoming actively involved in programs to benefit the men and women of our Nation's Armed Services, including the Packages From Home organization which sends care and comfort packages to American troops deployed around the globe. His mother, Margy Marzano, is known as one of its best volunteers. There is also a scholarship fund established in the name of Sgt. Marzano to assist high school athletes in the Mercer County area go to college. 
   Dedication of this VA outpatient clinic as the `Michael A. Marzano Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic' would be a fitting tribute to the brave service of Sgt. Marzano. In making the ultimate sacrifice for our country, Sgt. Marzano's remarkable heroism was displayed on behalf of our country, and we must never forget his legacy. 
   I thank my colleagues, Congressman ENGLISH and Congressman ALTMIRE for introducing this important legislation.  
   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Altmire).

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for H.R. 5736, a bill to name the veterans clinic in Gadsden, Alabama, after Col. Ola Lee Mize. 
   It is a great honor for me to stand here before you to talk about Col. Ola Lee Mize. He received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the Korean War, and he deserves our further recognition. 
   The Medal of Honor is awarded in the name of Congress to a person who distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States. 
   As a member of Company K, then Sergeant Mize courageously defended ``Outpost Harry'' near Surang-ni, Korea, on June 11 and June 12 in 1953. His deed was one of personal bravery. He clearly distinguished himself by exhibiting tremendous courage. He served our Nation by going beyond the call of duty while facing the enemy and was willing to risk his own life to protect the lives of others. 
   Colonel Mize and his company faithfully defended a strategically valuable position when the enemy launched a heavy attack. Upon learning that a comrade on a friendly listening post had been wounded, he moved through the intense barrage accompanied by a medical aid man and rescued the wounded soldier. 
   On returning to his main position, he established an effective defense system and inflicted heavy casualties against attacks from determined enemy assault forces which had penetrated into trenches within the outpost area. During his fearless actions, he was blown down by artillery and grenade blasts three times, but each time he dauntlessly returned to his position, tenaciously fighting and successfully repelling hostile attacks. 
   When the enemy onslaughts ceased, he took his few men and moved from bunker to bunker, firing through apertures and throwing grenades at the foe, neutralizing their positions. 
   When an enemy soldier stepped out behind a comrade, prepared to fire, Col. Mize killed him, saving the life of his fellow soldier. After rejoining the platoon, moving from man to man, distributing ammunition and shouting words of encouragement, he observed a friendly machine gun position overrun. He immediately fought his way to the position, killing ten enemies and dispersing the remainder. Fighting back to the command post and finding several friendly wounded there, he took a position to protect them. 
   Later, securing a radio, he directed friendly artillery fire upon the attacking enemy's routes of approach. At dawn he helped regroup for a counterattack which successfully drove the enemy from that outpost. Col. Mize's valorous conduct and unflinching courage reflect lasting glory upon himself and upon the noble traditions of the military service. 
   Besides having been awarded the Medal of Honor, Col. Mize has been awarded the Bronze Star, Good Conduct with Two Loops, National Defense Service, Korean Service with two Bronze Stars, and the United Nations Service. 
   Today, by passing H.R. 5736, which would designate the outpatient clinic in Gadsden, Alabama as the Colonel Ola Lee Mize Veterans Clinic, we honor his bravery and courage and of course that of all soldiers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alabama, ROBERT ADERHOLT, for introducing this bill. And I urge the support of my colleagues. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (CELEBRATING THE 120-YEAR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND STATE VETERANS HOMES -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Paul Hodes of New Hampshire for crafting this resolution which calls for the celebration of the 120th anniversary of our Federal Government's first grant of aid to State veterans homes. 
   I would also like to recognize the National Association of State Veterans Homes, representing 135 State veterans homes throughout the country. They were founded to increase the State veterans home representation and help facilitate communication with one another. They have worked to improve the quality of care, the services and treatment of our Nation's veterans who reside in State veterans homes. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized to contribute up to two-thirds of the construction of State nursing homes or renovations of existing State homes. This funding helps provide quality care for our Nation's veterans. When veterans are no longer able to care for themselves, they must be given the care necessary to continue their life with dignity. 
   Recently, we appropriated $165 million for 2008 to provide aid to State veterans homes to continue to provide care for our veterans. This will help alleviate some of the financial burden as the cost of veterans' care continues to rise without compromising the quality of that care. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must honor a servicemember's sacrifice that has been made by providing the quality of care our brave men and women deserve. It is important that we all support this resolution. With the current war on terror, there are thousands of brave servicemembers that are in the line of fire as we speak. They, too, might need this care. It is our duty, our responsibility, and our moral obligation to continue to provide them with this care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of this resolution. I praise the great work and service that State veterans homes have provided for the past 120 years. I look forward to their continued success and for this strong partnership to continue for many years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a State veterans home in my district in Chula Vista, California. I visit there regularly. The morale there is very high. And I think probably one sign of their high morale is that the percentage of voting that comes out of that home is very, very high. So it shows that, not only are they cared for, but they take an interest in the government that they have to elect. So I ask that my colleagues join me in support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I introduce the author of the legislation, I just want to say in introduction, unfortunately, suicide prevention has become a major part of our responsibilities to both active duty and our veterans. 
   It is a terrible statistic, Mr. Speaker, but as many Vietnam veterans have now committed suicide as died in the original war. That is over 58,000. We have to do as a Nation a better job. The Army just announced recently that the suicide rate among active duty and recently discharged has now reached Vietnam proportions. So we have to do a far better job and we intend to do that. 
   The author of the original legislation, Mr. Boswell from Iowa, saw this very clearly and introduced this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, one of the top priorities of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in this Congress is to address the needs of our returning servicemembers. The House passed H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, on March 21st of this year. I'm pleased the Senate also made it a priority to act on this important legislation. I believe the bill shows a clear compromise in our efforts to provide help to those in need. 
   One of the most pressing issues facing our men and women is mental health care. I believe that if we send our men and women off to war, we must, as a nation, do all we can to address their health care needs when they return. We cannot ask them to fight and then forget them when they return from battle. Veterans suffer a higher risk of suicide than the general population. The stress of combat, combined with the stigma that exists for servicemembers and veterans seeking mental health care services can have disastrous consequences. 
   We must do everything possible to improve the VA's mental health services, and its ability to detect, and help, those veterans most at risk. H.R. 327 will provide the important tools to assist the VA in strengthening suicide prevention, education, and awareness programs within the VA by mandating a comprehensive program for suicide prevention among veterans. 
   I thank my colleague Mr. Boswell for introducing this bill, and I thank my colleagues for their support.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell).

   As a Nation, in the name of Joshua Omvig and for his family and for all the families who have suffered from suicide, we have got to do a better job as a Nation. We have just got to do a better job. We know what will happen if we fail. 
   Vietnam veterans have paid a heavy price for our refusal to look at mental health as important as physical health, for our refusal to look into the souls of our young veterans and recognize that they are crying out for help. 
   So we have to get this right, and this is a good step in doing it. 
   Again, I thank Mr. Boswell and all the Iowa Representatives for taking a tragedy that befell Joshua Omvig and his family and turning it into a positive that will help all of us in America achieve better health care for our veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 327.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support of H.R. 1808, a bill to name the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, after our former colleague, Charlie Norwood. 
   Charlie Norwood served as a Captain in the United States Army from 1967 to 1969, beginning with an assignment to the U.S. Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1968 he was transferred to the Medical Battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam and served a combat tour at Quin Yon, An Khe, and LZ English at Bon Son. 
   During his tour, he participated in experimental military dental practices that are now standard procedure for the armed forces. Captain Norwood was one of the first participants in the Army's outreach program that delivered dentists to forward fire bases in lieu of transferring patients to rear treatment areas. He provided some of the first field-based dental treatment of military guard dogs, and assisted in non-dental trauma care in Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. 
   In recognition of his service under combat conditions, he was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After Vietnam, Captain Norwood was assigned to the Dental Corps at Fort Gordon, Georgia, where he served until his discharge in 1969. 
   He remained a member of The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Order of the World Wars until his death. H.R. 1808 would name the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, as the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''. 
   Naming a VA facility after this hero and strong veterans advocate is a proper honor for an honorable soldier.

   Mr. FILNER. I want to thank Mr. Kagen for bringing this story and history of a brave American and a great hero for Wisconsin. I wish your guys from Green Bay, whether they be quarterbacks or heroes, would have names we could pronounce. But we thank you for telling us the story of Milo Huempfner, and we look forward to the naming of the facility in Green Bay after him.  
   Mr. Speaker, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) was established in 1918 by President Woodrow Wilson. It is the second highest military decoration of the United States Army and surpassed only by the Medal of Honor in order of precedence. 
   The DSC is awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life and this extraordinary heroism must take place while the individual is engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States. The act of heroism must be so notable and involve risk of life so extraordinary as to set the individual apart from his comrades. 
   It is an honor for me to stand before you today to talk about one such individual--Milo C. Huempfner. 
   Mr. Huempfner was the most decorated serviceman in Brown County during World War II. In 1944, PFC Huempfner committed acts of extraordinary bravery and heroism during the final European campaign of World War II. 
   On December 20, 1944, in Belgium, PFC Huempfner was driving a truck loaded with ammunition that went off the road. Sending his only comrade back to seek help and safety, Huempfner proceeded over the next 4 days and nights to wage war, single-handedly, against an entire German armored column. 
   During this time, he warned off numerous American and British troops from the area who otherwise would have been slaughtered by the Germans occupying the area. 
   After his military service he remained heavily involved in veterans activities. 
   H.R. 2408 would name the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Green Bay, Wisconsin, as the ``Milo C. Huempfner Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic''. 
   Given his unselfish service to his country, it is only fitting that we name a Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in his honor.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (SUPPORTING AND ENCOURAGING GREATER SUPPORT FOR VETERANS DAY EACH YEAR -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, this is an important resolution, and we have heard the many reasons why, and I thank Mr. Baca for bringing this resolution to the floor. But after we give our speeches on Veterans Day, after we have given all the tributes, let's come back and do some real work that we have to do to really honor our veterans. 
   I agree with the gentleman from Arkansas. Let's pass that appropriations bill. If you add the money that is in the appropriations bill for 2008 with the continuing resolution we did earlier this year and the supplemental resolution we did earlier, we have added more than $13 billion for the health care of our veterans for this year over last year. That is a 30 percent increase. That is unprecedented in the history of the VA and will put in place all the programs that many of us want and know that they are needed, deserved and earned. 
   But let's go further than that. Let's pass together a GI Bill for the 21st century, a bill that not only increases the benefits to a realistic fashion for education and home loans, but brings in  the Guard and Reserve units to be eligible for the GI Bill's benefits. They are doing half the fighting in Iraq and yet do not have full benefits when they return home. So let us include the Guard and Reserve. 
   Let us include an absolute right to mental health treatment. We cannot neglect mental health, PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), and other mental conditions. While we can deal with the visible wounds a lot easier, we cannot forget the invisible ones. 
   Let us work together to end that atrocious claims backlog. Over 600,000 claims for disability compensation are pending at the VA. People have died while waiting for their claim to be adjudicated. Others have lost their home because they didn't have the income. We can cut through that bureaucracy, not just add, as the budget has, 1,000 more people, but really look at a whole new way, a nonadversarial way of dealing with the claims for disability. We can do that. 
   For too many people, VA means ``veterans adversary.'' VA should mean ``veterans advocate''. We can do that. Let us make sure that every young man and woman that comes back from Iraq and Afghanistan is diagnosed for both traumatic brain injury and PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder. We are going to let tens of thousands of young men and women out of the service without adequately understanding these wounds, some of whose symptoms are invisible for some time. They are ticking time bombs that, coming back to society, will create enormous problems for our social structure. So let's diagnose it. Let's treat it early. Let's bring the family in. Let's make sure that we have treated the mental illness that is so prominent in a war like this that we are unfortunately pursuing. 
   Let us end homelessness for our veterans in America. We can do this. This is not rocket science. We know what it takes. We have all, as I said earlier, been to Stand-Downs. We know how to bring the community together to give homeless veterans the support they need to reintegrate. And I tell you, we are already seeing the problems that we saw in Vietnam. We have suicide rates of our current vets that are the highest rates since Vietnam. We have homeless Iraqi vets on the street. So let us not make the same mistake again that we did in Vietnam, but let us remember we have both new veterans and older veterans. We have to serve both. This Nation can do it, we should do it, and working together, we will do it.  
   Each year on Veterans Day, Americans come together to honor our Nation's heroes: the 25 million veterans that have served our country. 
   House Resolution 237 encourages Americans to demonstrate their support for veterans. It is important to let these heroes know that this grateful Nation honors their service to our country. 
   On this 88th Veterans Day, I urge all Americans to take the time to show appreciation to those who have answered the call to duty. 
   Although, we can never adequately thank them for their service and sacrifice to our Nation, today, on Veterans Day and everyday, we can humbly salute our brave veterans and soldiers. 
   Our nation has a proud legacy of supporting the men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country. 
   As a nation, we have a sacred pact with all those who served in uniform and we owe them a debt of gratitude. 
   Our country is founded on the principles of democracy, American values and faith that those who fight for freedom will defeat those whose cause is unjust. 
   I know I speak for the Nation when I say that we stand united behind our courageous men and women in uniform. 
   We must be united in seeing that every soldier, sailor, airman and marine is welcomed back with all the care and compassion this grateful Nation can bestow. 
   No other group of Americans has stood stronger and braver for our democracy than our troops and veterans. 
   Veterans Day should not be observed just once a year--our Nation's heroes must be celebrated, honored and remembered for their service to our Nation--the whole year through. 
   Veterans have kept their promise to serve our Nation--and we, as a free and democratic country, must keep our promises to our veterans. 
   As Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, it is my honor to serve the veterans of this Nation and I encourage my fellow Americans to do the same. 
   I encourage all Americans to reach out to veterans. Thank them and their families for their amazing sacrifice. Learn more about their great contributions to our country and gain the wisdom of their personal stories of our nation's history. 
   Americans have learned, again, the truth behind the inscription on the Korean War Memorial--``Freedom is not free.'' And no one has paid a higher price and sacrifice for our freedom than our veterans. 
   Pause to remember the noble service and high sacrifices of those who have worn this Nation's uniform. 
   On Veterans Day and the whole year through, join me and take the time to show your gratitude to those who have answered the call to duty.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill which condemns the action that resulted in damage to our Vietnam Veterans Memorial. We all know that this memorial recognizes and honors the men and women who are veterans of our Nation who served in one of America's most divisive wars. The memorial grew out of a need to try to heal the Nation's wounds as America struggled to reconcile its different moral and political points of view on this war. In fact, the memorial was conceived and designed to make no political statement about the war. It was designed to bring us together. It was designed as a place where everyone, regardless of their opinion of the war, could come together, remember and honor those who served and those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of their country. I think all of us, wherever we were during that terribly divisive time,  feels at peace and feels a relationship to those people who served our Nation. 
   The memorial, as I said, has paved the way towards reconciliation and healing, a process that still continues. That's why, Mr. Speaker, I think we were all so disturbed when we heard about the senseless act of vandalism that happened earlier this year. Someone walked along that memorial with some type of oil applying it secretly on the wall as they walked by. The unknown oil has done real damage to the polished granite surface. But it did more than damage the wall, Mr. Speaker. It damaged the respect we have for our Nation's veterans and their sacrifice, damaging the healing process; and it takes us, as a Nation, back to a time when we did not honor or take care of our returning Vietnam veterans. 
   It takes us back to a time when many people in this country confused the war and the warrior. If you did not like the war, you said to heck with the warrior. That was a deep mistake on our part, Mr. Speaker, a tragic mistake, and one, as a Nation, we still suffer from today. 
   We did not provide these veterans the care they needed. We didn't welcome them back with honor and dignity and respect, and we're paying a price today. More than half of the homeless on the streets throughout America tonight, are Vietnam vets, over 200,000. Others still suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, other ailments. And as I said earlier, as many Vietnam veterans have now committed suicide as died in the original war. We, as a Nation, have to rectify this wrong. We have to take care and provide the health care, the treatment and the support that our Vietnam veterans deserve and need. We have to say that we are sorry for the treatment that they received when they came home, and honor these courageous men and women for their sacrifice to this Nation. 
   Anything that subtracts from this healing process is an outrage to the honor and memory of these brave veterans who fought and died for our country. And that is exactly what the senseless, needless act of vandalism that was perpetrated on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial does. It rubs salt into the wounds of our veterans that are still healing, and dishonors those that deserve nothing less than our Nation's honor and gratitude.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, through this resolution we condemn this act. We condemn those who are responsible. The oil is not just a stain on a piece of granite; it is a stain on the fabric of our Nation, a Nation still healing from a divisive war but a Nation that honors the sacrifices of its soldiers and veterans. 
   Maya Ying Lin, who designed the Memorial, said, `` ..... this Memorial is for all those who have died, and for us to remember them.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, let us remember their patriotism and valor and let us condemn the discordant acts of those who seek to tarnish them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS OF SEPTEMBER 7, 2007, RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO THE VIETNAM VETERANS WAR MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Carter. I thank all the Members who spoke on this legislation. It is an important bill. But I must say, we ought to go further than this resolution. 
   Mr. Poe said voting for this resolution means we're standing up for our troops. Well, I just spoke recently to the Annual Convention of the Vietnam Veterans of America. I'll tell you what they define as standing up for our troops--and there will be legislation embodying all of this soon. It would mean that we would look at the 200,000 Vietnam vets who are on the street homeless tonight and solve that moral blot on our record. 
   Most of us go to Stand-Downs every year, where the whole community comes around for 3 days and provides security and comfort, medical attention, dental health, legal assistance, clothes for the homeless vets in that community. The community comes together and has a holistic approach of drug and alcohol abuse and job counseling. So we know what to do for those 3 days. But the last five or eight Stand-Downs that I've addressed I said, I'm tired of coming to Stand-Downs. We should have Stand-Downs 365 days a year. That's what the Veterans Administration ought to do. With a $100 billion budget, you would think we could take care of the Vietnam vets who are homeless. That would be standing up for the troops. 
   In addition, many of them have been fighting for decades to get compensation for an agent orange disability. And the law, while we have extended the areas to which presumption applies and give these brave veterans health care and disability compensation, there is still too many areas that are not awarded a claim. 
   At this stage (I would like to talk to Mr. Johnson later about this), I would say all these agent orange claims, if they have medical backing and help by a veteran service officer, are presumptive, and have them stop fighting after all these decades and get the care and attention that they need. 
   I will tell you, I have just got a list of 500 veterans from one State, Vietnam vets, who got Parkinson's disease in their early fifties. That's way earlier than the average age of on set for the general population. So it's obviously Vietnam that was the cause. Yet the law says there is no proof that agent orange caused Parkinson's or Lou Gehrig's disease, and so they're shut out. That's a shame. They served us; we should serve them. Let's grant all these agent orange claims. 
   And we ought to, according to the representatives at the convention, give the status of ``mandatory'' or ``assured funding'' to the health care for our veterans. Right now, health care in our budget is called ``discretionary.'' We fight over it every year, Democrats, Republican, House, Senate, VA Committee versus everybody. We should not play politics with veterans health care, and we should have a guaranteed mandatory budget. 
   Those are the things that would really tell our Vietnam vets that we care about them. So let's pass this resolution. The wall is, as we've heard today, so important to our memories, to our healing, to those brave men who fought for us. But let's go further and really give the Vietnam vets a thank you and pass legislation that will not only end homelessness and grant the agent orange claims, but give mandatory funding for the VA health care budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (PROVIDING FOR CONCURRENCE BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENTS IN SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 797, DR. JAMES ALLEN VETERAN VISION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act of 2007. 
   I was glad to be able to work with my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses, to get here. I want to thank Mr. Rangel and his staff for their guidance on the provision that fell under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   I especially want to thank our colleague from Madison, Wisconsin, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin, who led the effort for this, who got it to the floor today and who will explain it in whatever detail she thinks is important.  
   I note that this bill was previously introduced in the last Congress; however, it never became law. I am glad this Congress has the opportunity to do more for our blind and vision impaired veterans. 
   The Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act of 2007, named after a noted physician and ocular pioneer who worked for over 35 years in the VA, would allow veterans who receive veterans' disability compensation for impairment of vision in one eye to be eligible to receive additional disability compensation for impairment of vision in the eye that is not service-connected, where the impairment in each eye is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less or of a peripheral field of 20 degrees or less (the definition of ``legal blindness'' adopted by all 50 states and the Social Security Administration.)  
   H.R. 797 also directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to match and compare VA needs-based pension benefits data, parents' dependency and indemnity compensation data, health-care services data, and unemployability compensation data with the National Directory of New Hires maintained by DHHS, for the purpose of determining eligibility for such benefits and services. 
   It would also authorize $5 million for establishing, improving and expanding for the operation and maintenance of state-owned veterans' cemeteries. Additionally, the bill will repeal the time limitation for States to file for reimbursement costs for interring unclaimed veterans' remains, making it retroactive to October 1, 2006. 
   Finally, this measure extends the authorization of the veterans work study program until 2010. 
   This bill affects an estimated 5 percent of the 13,109 veterans who have service-connected blindness or loss of vision in one eye. As of September 17, 2007, 1,129 service members have sustained serious eye wounds in combat according to the Defense Armed Forces Institute of Surgical Pathology (any of which may later lead to blindness). 
   Also, it is reported that many of the over 4,400 traumatic brain-injured OIF/OEF servicemembers will likely suffer from serious vision-related complications and at least 57 percent of all eye injuries of this war are caused by lED explosions. 
   Walter Reed Army Medical Center alone has treated close to 540 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom service members for visual injuries and over 230 of our soldiers unfortunately have sustained legal blindness in one eye. 
   It is worth noting, that in 2002, Congress passed and the President signed Public Law 107-330, which included a provision to correct a similar deficiency in the Paired Organ law for hearing loss. In 2006, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a legislative hearing and received favorable testimony on H.R. 2963, a bill similar to H.R. 797. In that hearing, the VA supported H.R. 2963. 
   This is important and meaningful legislation for our men and women in uniform--who have fought and are fighting for our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this resolution and urge swift consideration of the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act of 2007 by the Senate before the end of this session of Congress.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield whatever time she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin).

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, at this time I will include in the Record an article published in the Ophthalmic News on protective eye gear, and I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this resolution.  
   Protective Eye Gear Essential for Modern Soldier: Ocular Injuries Have Climbed to Number 4 Slot Behind Amputation, Traumatic Brain Injury, PTSD  
   BALTIMORE.--Ocular injuries during war have steadily increased from as far back as the Civil War because of the vulnerability of the face and eyes on the battlefield and the increasing use of fragmentary weapons. Thomas P. Ward, MD, described how ocular injuries have changed and how to prevent them here at the Current Concepts in Ophthalmology meeting in Baltimore. 
   The meeting was sponsored by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, and Ophthalmology Times. 
   ``What we learned about eye injuries was not just learned from the current war in Iraq but from several previous wars,'' said Dr. Ward, a private practitioner in West Hartford, CT, and former ophthalmology consultant to the U.S. Army's surgeon general. The percentage of ocular wounds received on the battlefield has increased steadily over the past century, from less than 1% during the Civil War to about 13% in the early phase of the war in Iraq, he added. 
   ``That 13% is much higher than would be expected if we were considering only the random chance of a projectile hitting the eye,'' Dr. Ward said. ``The eye has a very small profile, i.e., only 4% of the face and 0.27% of the body surface area.'' 
   He recounted that, through June 2006 at the Echelon III-level combat support hospital in Iraq and Afghanistan, 1,086 ocular injuries occurred. Of these, 207 were primary eye injuries. In the remaining 879 eye injuries, another organ was the primary injury (usually the brain or a limb). The eye injuries represented 13% of all patients who sustained injuries. Many more ocular injuries occurred in the local populace, he said. 
   The eyes are so vulnerable, he explained, because they are preferentially exposed during combat, whereas the rest of the body, except for the limbs, is protected with armor. 
   In addition, the types of munitions used have changed over the past century. During the Civil War, if a soldier was hit by a cannonball or minnie ball, he likely would die, and ocular injuries were not an issue. Modern weapons, however, generate numerous fragments when they explode. ``Modern hand grenades, for example, fragment into about 2,000 individual projectiles, and the eye is exceptionally vulnerable to small fragments,'' Dr. Ward said.  
   Other lessons: 
   penetrating injuries are the most important type, accounting for up to 50% of all ocular injuries, and 
   there is no delayed primary closure in ophthalmology; the primary repair almost always is the definitive repair. 
   Finally, because of the nature of modern weaponry, ocular injuries often are bilateral. More than half of all eye injuries (57%) are caused by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The remaining injuries were caused by rocket-propelled grenades, gunshot wounds, mortar and shrapnel, land mines, and other causes. 
   Surprisingly, according to Dr. Ward, the incidence of endophthalmitis was 0%, despite the fact that approximately 25% of ocular injuries are caused by intraocular foreign bodies. Another factor that did not seem to affect the incidence was that the foreign bodies were not removed for weeks in many cases. Dr. Ward wondered whether the lack of endophthalmitis may have been the result of the use of topical and systemic third- or fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. 
   The IEDs being used are increasingly more powerful, and Dr. Ward showed that the injuries sustained with more recent ones cause more damage. 
   Many more eye injuries do not result in evacuation to the combat support hospital, he said. ``As of late 2005, approximately 3,000 ocular injuries were reported as having been treated and the soldiers returned to duty. There were a total of 14,559 eye-related patient encounters by optometrists in the theater of war. This [number] from the Army is considered low as the result of inconsistent reporting,'' Dr. Ward emphasized. 
   Armor to protect the eyes has been used over the centuries, and it has been shown to be effective in eliminating war-related problems. Sympathetic ophthalmia, Dr. Ward pointed out, developed in about 0.3 percent of ocular injuries during World War II. Only one documented case has been reported by U.S. forces since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   A statistic that emphasizes the importance of prevention is that ocular injuries hold the number four slot for disability behind amputation, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. The verdict is in, my colleagues. Both the Defense Department's health services for returning troops and the Veterans Administration are strained to the limit; they are almost to the breaking point. For as much money that we give them, we have not prepared for the influx of the troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The evidence is clear. 
   What was happening at Walter Reed that was outlined in the Washington Post has, in fact, educated the whole Nation. We have had cover stories in the news magazines on how veterans are falling through the cracks. There was an incredible documentary on ABC News by Bob Woodruff and how his brain injury was treated and how fellow vets had their brain injuries treated. And yesterday on CNN we had a story on how Iraqi troops returning were homeless already. 
   We simply have got to meet this test as a Nation. The Democrats are trying to do that. We put an additional $3.6 billion into the continuing resolution to fund this year to help our troops. And in the supplemental we have $3.5 billion for our Nation's troops. It is time to support our troops when they come home

   Mr. FILNER. When the Democrats became the majority of this Congress earlier this year, we promised to keep our contract with our Nation's veterans, to keep our contract. 
   So how have we done during the first four months as Democrats? Wherever we stand on the war, wherever we stand on the war, we are committed to make sure that every young man and woman who returns from that war gets all the care, the love, the attention, the honor, respect and dignity that this Nation can bestow. 
   And in the first three budget bills that went by this House, in the last 3 months, we were able to add over last year's total over $13 billion for veterans health care; $13 billion, that's almost a 30 percent increase over last year. The biggest in the history of the Veterans' Administration. 
   And we're going to use that money to make sure that the terrible brain-injured veterans that come back, those who have physical scars or mental scars (PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) will get all the care that an advanced Nation can give. 
   As a nation, we are not doing our job now, but we Democrats are committed to making sure the job is done.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As noted, this bill is ``as amended.'' And I want to thank the members on my committee on both sides of the aisle, particularly Mr. Boozman of Arkansas and Mr. Lamborn of Colorado, for their very constructive amendments. Mr. Boozman will talk later on what he did, but we have extended the authorization for the work/study program at his request for 5 years, so thank you for your amendments to that. And we thank Ms. Baldwin, who has brought this to our attention and is very committed to the health care of our veterans of this Nation. 
   So we are glad all to work together to get this to the House floor today. This has been introduced in previous Congresses, but we are glad it is on the floor now. It would allow veterans who receive veterans disability compensation for impairment of vision in one eye to be eligible to receive additional disability compensation for impairment of vision in the eye that is not service connected, where that impairment in each eye is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less, or of a peripheral field of 20 degrees or less. 
   Suffice it to say that there was a great blind spot in the law that did not cover our veterans who would need the help. 
   It would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to match and compare VA needs-based pension benefits data, parents' dependency and indemnity compensation data, health care services data, and unemployability compensation data with the National Directory of New Hires, maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, for the purpose of determining eligibility for such benefits and services.     
   It would extend authorization of the veterans work/study program until 2012 at the suggestion of Mr. Boozman, and allows for a bronze ``V'' marker in lieu of a government-provided headstone or marker for burials in a private cemetery, at the suggestion of Mr. Lamborn. 
   It would affect an estimated 5 percent of the 13,000 veterans who have service-connected blindness or loss of vision in one eye. As of April 2006, the Walter Reed Medical Center alone has treated 140 returning OEF/OIF servicemembers for visual injuries. 
   I urge Members to support the bill. It is the least we can do for our veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, today we have the first bills that are coming out of the Veterans Committee this year. We are going to have an ambitious agenda for our committee, an agenda that in fact is demanded by the American people. 
   We have seen in the last few weeks enormous attention paid to the treatment, or lack thereof, that is given to our Nation's veterans, whether they are from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the first Persian Gulf War or now from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We have seen the Washington Post articles which detailed the problems at Walter Reed. We have seen news magazines have cover stories on how veterans are falling through the cracks of the system. We have seen on ABC News, Bob Woodruff, do a very moving piece on how brain injuries are treated, or perhaps not treated. We have seen stories in the press of homeless, already, from veterans of Iraq. 
   The American people understand that we are not treating our veterans the way we claim to be. The American people, I think, understand that the treatment of our warriors is a part of the cost of war, and we simply have to provide for those brave men and women who have fought for our Nation's freedom. 
   So we have an ambitious agenda in front of us, Mr. Speaker. These first items today address some specific areas that demand attention. I thank the Members from across the aisle for their support not only of these bills, but I think for the agenda that we are going to pursue in the future. 
   And it is time, Mr. Speaker, that we say as a Congress and as a Nation, no matter where we are on this war in Iraq, that when those brave young men and women come back we are going to treat them with all the love and respect and honor and care that American veterans should have. And we make that pledge on both sides of the aisle. 
   As I said, one of the top priorities of our committee is to address the needs of returning servicemembers from Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in the areas of mental health.     
   I believe that if we send our citizens off to war, we have to address their health care needs when they return. We cannot say, support our troops, support our troops, support our troops, and then forget them when they come home. 
   It turns out, I think unsurprisingly, that veterans suffer a higher risk of suicide than the general population. The stress of combat combined with the stigma that exists for servicemembers and veterans seeking mental health care can have disastrous consequences. It has already occurred for returning veterans, maybe a couple  hundred. We must do everything possible to improve the VA's mental health services and its ability to detect and help those veterans most at risk. 
   This bill, H.R. 327, is an important step in the right direction. It comes to us from our colleague from Iowa (Mr. Boswell), who has taken the tragedy from a family in Iowa and turned it into constructive measures so that tragedy will not be repeated in other parts of the Nation. And we thank Mr. Boswell and his colleague, Mr. Braley from Iowa, for bringing this to our attention. 
   This bill will provide important tools to the Veterans Administration to assist the Department in strengthening suicide prevention, education, and awareness programs within the VA by mandating a comprehensive program for suicide prevention among veterans. 
   Again, I thank Mr. Boswell for introducing this bill. I thank Mr. Miller and his colleagues for supporting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all urge passage of H.R. 1284, the so-called Veterans' Compensation, COLA, Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act. It would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, effective December 1 of this year, the rates of veterans' compensation to keep pace with the rising cost of living in our Nation. The rate adjustment is equal to that provided on an annual basis to Social Security recipients and is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index. 
   Regardless, Mr. Speaker, of where any of us are on the current war in Iraq, we all believe that our returning young men and women who have served this Nation so courageously get all the attention, care, respect and love that we can give as a Nation. Nothing bothers any of us more than to see returning troops, whether it be at Walter Reed or any of our VA hospitals, have to face the bureaucracy that seems indifferent, and does not provide the services they need. 
   The cost of serving these veterans, which includes this annual COLA, is a continuing cost of war. We will have from Iraq and Afghanistan an increase in injuries and disabilities that will yield an increase in claims for compensation. Over 1.5 million servicemembers have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan without any end, it looks like, in sight, and the President calls for more troops. Therefore, the Veterans Administration, as well as the military hospitals, can expect a significant increase in the number of new claims for compensation and new demands on the health care system. I think that recent events have shown that neither system is adequately prepared for that onslaught, and, in fact, the systems are stretched to the breaking point. 
   We as a Congress, we as a Nation, have got to give our veterans all the care that they need, all the resources they need, and we as Congress have to provide accountability for the spending of those resources. 
   Let me say that certainly we on the Democratic side, and I am sure supported on the Republican side, have made major increases in the resources to our veterans care that is now demanded from our Nation. I am told that the budget resolution will have an additional $6.6 billion over what we appropriated last year for the Veterans Administration. 
   You know that we appropriated an additional $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2007, the year that we are in now, in the so-called continuing resolution, the biggest increase of any department in that continuing resolution. 
   The supplemental that we will be considering at the end of this week has $3.5 billion for military and veterans health care: we say if you are going to deal with the cost of war, deal with the costs of the warrior. 
   So just in 60 days, Mr. Speaker, the new majority in the Congress has provided an additional $13.5 billion for the care of our Nation's veterans, and that is a bigger increase than was totaled in the last 5 years combined. 
   So I think we are responding to the Walter Reed scandal. We are responding to the tragic suicides that came from indifference from the bureaucracy. We are responding to the needs of traumatic brain injury that have so increased in this war. We are responding to the needs of those who have post-traumatic stress disorder. We are responding to the needs of a Veterans Administration that is backlogged 600,000 disability claims. 
   So we are going to respond with the dollars. We also need to make sure we have accountability, and we will have more to say on that in the future. 
   Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living adjustment for veterans compensation to make sure that inflation does not erode the purchasing power of veterans and their families who depend upon this income to meet their daily needs. This bill before us, in  fact, will benefit all veterans from the World War I era through the current conflicts. 
   So I hope that we will have support for this. I would like to add my thanks for the increases that I talked about just a second ago in this budget for 2008 and the continuing resolution for 2007 and the supplemental that we will be considering to our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who insisted that we care for our Nation's veterans; also, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey of Wisconsin; to his chairman of the subcommittee that looks at veterans affairs, Mr. Edwards from Texas; and the chairman of our Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt, all of whom said we are not going to fail this test that America is faced with today, the test of whether we are going to make sure that our veterans get the care they need

   This measure restricts the ability of a court to order change in a custody arrangement that predates the deployment of a servicemember. It mandates that once a deployment is completed, the custody arrangements will be reinstated if changed during the deployment. The bill also requires that a court may not consider the absence of the servicemember because of deployment as a factor in determining the best interests of the child. Importantly, this bill provides courts with the ability to order a temporary custody arrangement or to prevent the reinstatement of a prior custody arrangement when the servicemember returns upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interests of the child. 
   We are faced with a conflict between the protection of the rights of our servicemembers, which is a Federal responsibility, and child custody issues, which are traditionally within the purview of our States. I believe that Mr. Turner's bill strikes the necessary balance between these interests and provides an important safeguard for our servicemembers and their children, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, we are coming to the conclusion of the 10-bill package that the Veterans' Affairs Committee presented today on the floor in anticipation of the Memorial Day holiday. We honor those whose lives were lost serving their Nation, and in their memory we have presented these 10 bills that provide a variety of benefits in all kinds of ways. And I thanked all the members of our subcommittees, but I want to thank the staff on both the majority and minority side who have participated in the drafting and the amending of these bills.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Thank you, Mr. Buyer. 
   Madam Speaker, as I said, as we prepare for Memorial Day, I think all of us in this Congress want to assure the servicemembers who have served this Nation in the past and those who are deployed today. 
   We are fighting a war that is very divisive in this country and in this Congress, but we are united in saying that every young man and woman who comes back from that conflict is going to get all the care, the love, the attention, the honor, and dignity that they deserve. 
   They are coming back with enormous difficulties, many of them. Because of the advances in our medicine and the incredible expertise on the battlefield of those who medivac these injured out, the incredible medical teams in the forward base hospitals and the regional hospitals and in Germany, we are saving lives that in previous wars would not have been saved. If you survive a battlefield injury, you will have a 95 percent chance of surviving the war. That is an incredible statistic when compared to any other war in history. 
   But that means, when these soldiers come back there is a very high percentage of those with brain injury, a very high percentage of those with psychological wounds, one of which we refer to as PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder. And we have an obligation as a Nation to treat every single one of these with the maximum quality of health care that they can get in this Nation. And yet, we have had examples of soldiers all around the Nation who have simply not gotten the attention that they require. 
   We have had reports of soldiers showing up to medical facilities saying they had PTSD or suicidal thoughts, being told that there was nobody to meet with them for 4 or 5 weeks, and they would go home and commit suicide. We have had lots of reports of those who did not receive adequate care. At the same time, we were not getting the full information on the numbers of cases of PTSD, the amount of resources needed to deal with them, or the number of suicides that were committed or are being committed by our Nation's veterans. 
   Madam Speaker, each month we have 1,000 suicide attempts by those under care of our VA system. And those under care mean only about one-fifth of all the veterans in our Nation. That is an astounding statistic which says that we have a job to do about mental health and about dealing with these, especially psychological injuries. 
   And we know what happens if we don't do our job right with these young men and women. We already had the canaries in the mine with our Vietnam vets. When our veterans returned from Vietnam, many of us who were opposed to that war made a mistake. We did not differentiate between the war and the warrior, and so the warriors did not get all the care, the love, the attention, the honor, and dignity that I talked about earlier. And this society has paid a heavy price for that. Individuals, families, neighborhoods have paid a heavy price. Half of the homeless on the street tonight, Madam Speaker, are Vietnam vets, about 200,000. 
   There have been more deaths by suicide of Vietnam vets than died in the original war by combat. And we have had the head of our mental health agency in this Nation say that the same will be probably true of Iraq; we will have more suicides than battlefield deaths. 
   That is not only a tragedy, but it is a preventible tragedy. We have to say that we are going to put the resources in to deal with these issues. It is part of the cost of war. As I said earlier, Madam Speaker, we are spending $1 billion every 2 days on the war in Iraq. Surely we can spend the hundreds of millions or billions that are required to treat the mental health needs of our older veterans and our newer veterans. This is absolutely required. We must do this job and do it right. 
   As George Washington said, the biggest factor in the morale of our fighting troops is the sense of how they are going to be treated when they come home. We have to do a better job of treating them when they come home. 
   Our committee, Madam Speaker, and this Congress provided in this fiscal year and the coming fiscal year almost $20 billion of new money for health care. That represents over a 40 percent increase in the budgets that we started off with 2 fiscal years ago. Our job is to make sure that the money is spent right, our oversight job. Now that they have the resources, are they hiring the  mental health professionals? Are they doing the diagnoses and treatments? 
   It is absolutely apparent, Madam Speaker, that tens of thousands of our young people are getting out of the military or the Reserve or the National Guard without being adequately diagnosed for brain injury or PTSD. Let me say that again. We have tens of thousands of our young people being discharged from the military or from the Reserve or National Guard without diagnosis for PTSD or brain injury. That means tens of thousands of ticking time bombs are out on the street. We need to do a better job. 
   There is a stigma against adequate evaluation and early treatment. The military, or at least many members of the military, seem to give their younger troops the sense that it is not macho, it is not marine-like, it is not soldier-like to have mental illness. That it is a weakness. You have got to buck up, sergeant, and not have any mental illness. So we have folks who get a questionnaire about some of the risk factors, and they just say no. They know they are supposed to say no, because they want to be home, they don't want any influence on their future career or any possible promotion. So there is a dynamic within our military not to adequately diagnose. 
   The VA says they have mandatory screening for these illnesses, for these injuries when people come to the VA for treatment. Well, they may not come to the VA for treatment. We don't have an outreach that goes after every single one of them. And when they come in, they get a questionnaire by an intake clerk of two questions. Anybody who wants not to have any of the stigma of mental illness knows to say no on those two questions. Besides, we are told there are 15 risk factors for PTSD and suicide. Why don't we ask about all of them? Why don't we have a mandatory evaluation by competent mental health personnel before anybody gets discharged or leaves the National Guard or leaves the Reserves? This has to be done, Madam Speaker. We have to get rid of the stigma and do it in a way where we allow the soldiers to do it as part of their company, for example, so they have that comradeship and with their family to help both diagnosis and treatment. 
   So we have a big job to do as we celebrate this Memorial Day. We have a job to do with the 1.6 million troops who have been deployed already, 800,000 of them have returned home. We have a great deal to do with the other 23 million of our veterans from previous wars.     
   We have to do this job right, Madam Speaker. And on this Memorial Day, let us recommit ourselves to doing the job right.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (HONORING WOMEN IN THE ARMED FORCES AND FEMALE VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased, as a cosponsor of H. Res. 1054, to recognize the service and achievements of the women in the Armed Forces and the nation's women veterans. I thank my San Diego colleague, Congresswoman Susan Davis, for introducing this important resolution. 
   These women have been the unsung heroes of every war since the Revolutionary War. So, as we approach Memorial Day, it is fitting that we sing their praises. They are playing an increasingly prominent and important role in our nation's military forces. 350,000 are now serving, making up 15 percent of active duty personnel, 15 percent of Reserves, and 17 percent of the National Guard. More than 185,000 have been deployed since 2001. 
   Women veterans are second only to elderly veterans as the fastest growing segment of the veteran population. 255,000 women use VA health services today. There are 1.7 million women veterans, 7 percent of the total veteran population--expected to be 10 percent by 2020. 
   As Chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I want to report that Congress has responded to the challenge of meeting the needs of women veterans. Today, there exist within the Department of Veterans Affairs, two main offices specifically focused on addressing the needs of women veterans, put into place by Congress. 
   The 102nd Congress passed landmark legislation (P.L. 102-484) which authorized VA to provide gender-specific health care at VA medical facilities. The position of Director of Women's Health was also created by this law. This position has recently been elevated to the Chief Consultant on Women Veterans' Health, Strategic Health Care Group, reporting to the Undersecretary for Health (of the Veterans Health Administration). At each medical center, a Women Veterans Program Manager is ready to assist women veterans with their health care. 
   More recently, Congress passed P.L. 108-422 to extend VA's authority to offer Military Sexual Trauma Counseling and Treatment to active duty service members. 
   In addition, The Center for Women Veterans was established by the 103rd Congress in P.L. 103-446 to oversee the Department's programs for women veterans. The Center Director reports to and is an advisor to the VA Secretary on matters related to policies, legislation, programs, issues and initiatives affecting women veterans. To name a few of its activities: 
   Perform outreach to minority women veterans, homeless women veterans with children, elderly women veterans, and women veterans living in rural areas. 
   Monitor transition assistance program (TAP) briefings to ensure that the gender-specific information about benefits and services is provided to women service members. 
   Monitor VA Office of Research and Development to ensure that VA research includes the issues of women veterans. 
   Their goal is to identify any programs that are unresponsive or insensitive to women veterans and to address their deficiencies. The center is concerned with Department-wide legislative policies, within the VHA and VBA (Veterans Benefits Administration) and NCA (National Cemetery Administration), as well as the State offices. 
   The center is holding the 4th National Summit on Women Veterans' Issues on June 20-22 in Washington, DC. 
   H.R. 4107, the Women's Veterans Health Care Improvements Act, has been introduced by my colleague serving on the VA Committee, Stephanie Herseth Sandlin. This is one of a number of ways that we are currently working on behalf of women veterans. 
   The House VA Committee continues to provide oversight to ensure that the laws we have passed are doing the job and that women veterans are receiving the information, benefits and care they deserve. 
   In the light of these actions by Congress, it is my hope that all women veterans will receive the care and benefits they have earned through their service and accomplishments that we recognize here today.

   Mr. FILNER. I would yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a package of 10 separate pieces of legislation that honors our Nation's veterans, our Nation's most deserving citizens, appropriately enough, as we prepare to honor them on Memorial Day. As we honor our fallen heroes, we cannot forget those who need either health or other benefits from our Nation. 
   That is what these bills do. They extend benefits in a whole range of areas: Health care, substance abuse and spina bifida, reimbursement for emergency treatment outside the VA facilities, construction of new facilities to serve these heroes. We also address our responsibility for oversight of the VA by mandating the revision and update of administrative policies so that the VA can better serve our veterans. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, we have had many opportunities for oversight recently. We have had in a court case the discovery of e-mails which seem to indicate that our VA management was not being totally transparent on the number of suicides, for example, of our recent Iraqi veterans. Just last week, another e-mail was discovered that indicated that we should not adequately diagnose PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and instead give these young men and women lesser kinds of diagnoses, which would cost us less. 
   It is unacceptable to the Congress of the United States and to the American people that the administration set up to serve our veterans would be finding ways to save money and not treating the veterans for their needs. We intend to root that kind of attitude out of the VA and to make sure that all our veterans, whether they are just coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan, or those that served us earlier in Vietnam or World War II and Korea and the Persian Gulf War I, to make sure that all of their needs are met, and that is what we are committed to and that is what these bills on the floor today indicate. 
   We also address the compensation cost-of-living adjustment that is so important to our veterans who base their income on the dependency and indemnity compensation. They need an annual increase to cover the cost of living, and this bill before us today will assure that. 
   It is my hope that on this Memorial Day we, as a Nation, remember the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A half century ago he said ``Those who have long enjoyed such privileges as we enjoy forget in time that men,'' and he would say, I am sure today, women, ``have died to win them.'' President Washington, over 220 years ago, said, ``The best guarantee of the morale of our fighting troops is a sense of how they are going to be treated when they come home.'' 
   So let us remember these words of Roosevelt, of Washington, as we prepare on Memorial Day to recognize and remember those heroes who have died in uniform. Our Nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment, and we have to make sure that they know that we appreciate them and we know that our liberty, which we enjoy today, depended on them. 
   The bills before us today have come from all of our legislative subcommittees. Members on both sides of the aisle and all the committee worked very hard. I want to thank Chairman Michaud of the Health Committee, with his Ranking Member Miller of Florida, I want to thank the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Ms. Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota, and Mr. Boozman of Arkansas, and also the chair and the ranking member of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Hall, and the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Lamborn.  
   We are now looking at H.R. 3681, which would authorize the VA Secretary to purchase national media outlets to inform veterans of their benefits. You would think we would not have to do such legislation, Mr. Speaker, but apparently we do. Over the past 2 years, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has conducted several hearings to determine how to improve the outreach to our veterans, and while various agencies have made tremendous improvement, more needs to be done to inform veterans of the entitlements they rightfully deserve and how to access those benefits. 
   Providing our veterans the information they need on television is a crucial component that can affect the livelihood of our veterans and their dependents. So I ask all of you to join me in supporting H.R. 3681. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   What H.R. 3889 does is require the VA to conduct what is called a longitudinal study for at least 20 years of the veterans who began participating in the VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program. The bill requires annual reports to Congress to assist with better management of the program. 
   It's an important step in ensuring that the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program has services that are meeting the needs of our veterans as they seek to heal from their injuries and reenter civilian life. 
   So I hope we all support H.R. 3889.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (JUSTIN BAILEY VETERANS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, this bill is named after Justin Bailey, who was a veteran of the Iraq War who died in a domiciliary facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs while receiving care for PTSD and a substance use disorder, a very tragic story but one that seems to be becoming all too familiar. 
   We have seen in recent weeks internal communications between members of the VA staff who we rely on to treat soldiers like Justin Bailey who seem to not take the symptoms of PTSD or suicide very seriously. They try to manipulate the data so we don't know all the facts. They try to get cheaper treatment if a diagnosis other than PTSD is made, and we are not serving our veterans when this occurs. We must not take lightly the commitment of servicemembers like Justin Bailey who choose to defend the country and freedoms that we enjoy. 
   We know the problems that veterans who have served in past wars face. We know about post-traumatic stress disorder. We know about the high reported incidence of substance abuse, and that it is what we call a common co-morbidity to mental health issues. And we, of course, unfortunately know about the high rate of homelessness. We know about these issues because we have seen entire generations of veterans tackle these problems, many without proper support from the VA and many who find themselves on the streets homeless or we see in statistics on suicide. 
   We must commit ourselves that whatever is necessary to prevent the newest generation of veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq will be done so they do not experience these same devastating issues. 
   There is growing concern about the reported effects of combat deployments on Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom servicemembers. The suicide rates are on the rise back to where they were in our Vietnam era. 
   We know the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder among these veterans has been estimated at about a third. I think if you include hidden symptoms of traumatic brain injury we're up to probably double that or more. 
   We know that the rate of homelessness amongst this group is growing. The same cycles that we saw with Vietnam are repeating themselves. 
   We cannot as a Congress, as a Nation allow this to happen again. We must reinforce our commitment to take care of those who have served. This is a cost of war. We're spending $1 billion, Madam Speaker, on the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars every two days, $1 billion every 2 days. Shouldn't our servicemembers get all the treatment they need? We have the money. It's a question of our will and our priorities.     
   So I urge you to support H.R. 5554. We would improve and expand the VA health care services available for veterans for substance use disorders, and require that all VA medical centers provide access to the full continuum of care for these disorders. 
   We also want to make sure that the Secretary reaches out to our OIF/OEF veterans with substance abuse disorders, and make sure that the funding is in place for the full continuum of care no matter where a veteran lives. 
   We also ask for a complete report on the services furnished by the Department in the last fiscal year, and have a 2-year pilot program on providing assessment, education and treatment via the Internet to veterans with substance use disorders. And finally, we would require the VA to conduct a review and report on the residential mental health facilities within the system. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5554. We will hear from Congressman Michaud from Maine, the chairman of our Health Subcommittee, who wrote this bill. And he will have a chance to really explain it better after we hear from our ranking member. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ensuring that our brave men and women have a comfortable home to heal from the injuries of war is the very least we can do for our veterans. This is especially true since the last time this VA pamphlet was published was 30 years ago, in 1978.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill is called the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, which was introduced by myself and Mr. Rodriguez of Texas. And I want to thank our ranking member, Mr. Buyer, who, of course, supported this legislation and helped us to get here with unanimous support from our committee. 
   The fact that we were able to get this bill to the floor only a month after its introduction shows the House leadership's commitment to our Nation's veterans and their survivors. 
   Since 1976 Congress has passed a measure to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the rates of basic compensation for disabled veterans and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation, so-called DIC, to their survivors and dependents, along with other benefits, in order to keep pace with the rising cost of living. The disability COLA here would be effective on December 1 of this year and will be equal to that provided on an annual basis to Social Security recipients. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill will provide over 3 million disabled veterans from the World War I era through the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan that VA estimates will be receiving disability compensation for the coming fiscal year. It will help over 300,000 of their survivors during the same period. 
   Many of the nearly 3.5 million recipients of these benefits depend on these tax-free payments not only to provide for their own basic needs but those of their spouses, children, and parents as well. Without an annual COLA increase, these veterans and their families would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly erode.     
   We would be derelict in our duty if we failed to guarantee that those who sacrifice so much for this country receive benefits and services that don't keep pace with their necessities. I know we have had some disagreement over the past weeks over what, and how, our priorities for veterans should be funded. But on this bill, there is no disagreement. The veterans compensation COLA is included in the CBO baseline. In layman's terms, that means we have already paid for this. 
   Regardless of whether or not you agree or disagree with the funding of the war in Iraq, our young men and women who have served in our Armed  Forces deserve to be adequately compensated for injuries due to their military service. We fund the war, we must fund the warrior, and their families and their survivors, by ensuring their benefits will keep pace with their living expenses. Let's ensure that these benefits make ends meet at the end of the month. 
   Madam Speaker, as we approach our country's 140th Memorial Day commemoration, I ask all my colleagues to support this bill and send a clear message of support to our troops: You will be taken care of when you return, and we will not forget your sacrifice. 
   No action by a Member of Congress is more irritating to many Americans than those who say they support the troops but then turn a cold shoulder when those same troops come home, become veterans, and need our help to become whole again. That costs money; money we should not hesitate to spend, just like our military men and women did not hesitate to offer to lay down their lives to defend our freedom and the way of life that we cherish. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider these facts when voting on the full portfolio of veterans' legislation that is under consideration on the floor today, and of course to support passage of this bill, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee for doing so much for veterans in this bill. And I want to add my thanks to Congressman Young from Florida. He and his wife, Beverly, have been an incredible inspiration. So we want to say on the record from our side of the aisle how much we appreciate you and your wife's efforts on behalf of our veterans. Thank you. 
   Mr. Chairman, what this bill does and what our previous bills that we have passed here, the continuing resolution that we've had for this year, the supplemental for the war, added more than 30 percent to the health care budget from last year for the health care of our veterans. That's an unprecedented increase, and it comes at a time when we have unprecedented needs. So your work, Mr. Chairman, has been incredible for all of the veterans and their families in this Nation. 
   No matter where we stand on the war, and there's a lot of divisiveness in this House about the war, we are united in saying, through this bill, that when every young man and woman comes back from Iraq or Afghanistan, they are going to get all the love, the care, the attention, the dignity, the honor that a Nation can bestow; and we are committed to that. 
   And we are committed, not only to those veterans who are just coming back, but to those who are with us from World War II, from Korea, from Vietnam, from the first Persian Gulf war. We're going to take care of them all. 
   We do not think that the problem with the Veterans' Administration is that there are too many veterans. We think we have to get the resources into the VA, and then have the accountability that it's spent wisely. 
   We have an administration that says, support the troops, support the troops, support the troops; but when they come home, as we have seen in Walter Reed and other places, too many times they're on their own. They slip through the cracks. 
   Virtually everyone who comes back from this war has evidence of either brain injury or PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and we simply don't have the resources to treat them. There are waiting lists. There are people told to call back, go home. 
   We had a young Marine in Minnesota who went to his hospital because he thought he had PTSD because he was thinking of suicide. What happened? He was told he was 28th on the waiting list, to go home. And he went home and committed suicide. That is a crime and we are not going to commit those crimes on our returning heroes. We are going to look at not only the brain injuries, not only the PTSD, but to make sure the backlog of pension disability claims is taken down to zero, where it's now at 600,000. 
   We've got a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of work to handle all these heroes from World War II to the present,  and with your budget, Mr. Chairman, we're going to be able to do this. We thank you. And we're going to work to get the accountability and the work done that lets these heroes know that their Nation is worthy of their sacrifice.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (URGING AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONALITIES TO VISIT THE AMERICAN CEMETERIES, MEMORIALS AND MARKERS -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are about to take up a package of seven bills that have come to the floor from the Veterans Committee, a committee which I am very proud of that has worked together over the first 4 or 5 months of this session to keep our contract with our Nation's veterans. And there is no better time than just before Memorial Day to say thank you. Memorial Day celebrates those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation's freedom. We are here on the floor today to say thank you to those, and to those who are still deployed, and to veterans from past wars. 
   In the recent election, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats promised to do more for our Nation's veterans. We said we had a President who was saying, support the troops, support the troops, support the troops; but when they came home, where was that support? Walter Reed ripped off the veil of our incompetency of dealing with veterans and showed that so many were not getting the care they were promised and people thought they were getting. 
   We have had story after story in the Nation's press about how returning veterans with PTSD or brain injury have not been getting the care which this Nation has promised at the highest quality medical system in the world. So we have to do better. 
   We have a system that is really about to break and collapse. What we saw as the majority party is that the first thing that had to be done was give the VA the resources to carry out the job; secondly, we had to have accountability for the spending of those resources. 
   Well, in the first three spending bills that went through this House, we were able to add $13 billion for the health care of our veterans. That is an unprecedented increase from one year to the next, an increase of 30 percent in the health care budget. 
   We have put in the resources to clean up the backlog of claims for disability pensions that have built up to 600,000. We have put in the money to open up new Centers of Excellence for traumatic brain injury, to finally give the mental health care that the tens of thousands of veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan need. 
   We call it PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, but virtually every soldier subject to at least five blasts that would give them brain injury, seeing their buddies shot and killed in front of them, maybe having to kill even by accident some innocent people in Iraq, they come back with tremendous mental issues. They have to be worked out. They need medical care, and too many have been falling through the cracks. 
   So we have said we will provide the resources to make sure that does not occur. We have provided the resources to meet these needs. Now we have to have accountability for their spending. The Veterans' Affairs Committee of this Congress has pledged to do that. 
   So we have a collection of bills on the floor this afternoon to say thank you to our Nation's veterans, thank you for your efforts in this war, thank you for your efforts in past wars, and we honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice on Memorial Day. 
   This resolution before us now, H. Res. 392, comes to us under the leadership of the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), and I thank him for his activity on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This resolution encourages people to visit the cemeteries, memorials, and markers overseen by the American Battle Monuments Commission. I am sure many people who hear this say, what is the American Battle Monuments Commission? 
   In 1923, Congress created the Battle Monuments Commission to control the construction of military cemeteries, monuments and markers erected to honor American servicemembers killed on foreign soil. Host countries provide the necessary lands for these sites to the United States in perpetuity and free of charge. 
   The Commission cares for 24 military cemeteries and 25 memorials, monuments and markers in 15 nations around the world. These sites serve as the final resting places for almost 125,000 Americans who fought in the Mexican-American War through World War I and II. The Commission takes special care that all cemeteries under its supervision are maintained to the highest standard attainable. 
   The Battle Monuments Commission extends an open invitation to all to visit these splendid shrines and go beyond the most well known, like Normandy, and venture into others. Each site has its own sense of history, sacrifice and beauty; each offers a different and unique experience. No two have the same garden or architecture. Perhaps only the spiritual qualities are similar. 
   In less than a month from now, on June 6, the Battle Monuments Commission will commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the D-Day landing by opening a new Normandy American Cemetery Visitor Center. Under construction since 2002, the center will tell the story of the American servicemembers memorialized at Normandy. 
   I encourage everyone to visit this new D-Day center and any of the other sites under the jurisdiction of the Commission. 
   Overseas American cemeteries are lasting reminders of America's willingness to come to the defense of others. These tangible symbols of American values endure long after the fighting is over. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamborn for bringing this resolution to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are continuing with a packet of seven bills from the Veterans' Affairs Committee that is really a thank-you in prelude to Memorial Day, a thank-you to our Nation's veterans. Memorial Day is a tribute to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. 
   What we are saying is we're honoring them and all our veterans who are living with us in the United States. And as I said earlier, no matter where we are on the current debate on the war in Iraq, we are united in saying that every young woman, every young man who returns from that battle gets all the care, the attention, the love, the honor, the dignity that a grateful Nation can bestow. And that's what we are saying in these bills today. 
   We have already passed a bill which extends from 2 years to 5 years the ability of any returning servicemember in combat to access the VA health care system. Two years was not sufficient for those who might have brain injuries, who might have PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder. These are, in many cases, hidden diseases. You don't know that you have it. A doctor may not diagnose it at first, and so as time goes by, you may feel the need to access the VA health care system. So we have extended that from 2 years to 5 years. 
   In addition, we have passed a new outreach program to meet especially the needs of rural veterans, and we will continue this package in the hour ahead. 
   Veterans returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should be able to depend on medical services that they want being available in the system of health care that was built to take care of them and their unique needs. 
   For those returning veterans seeking care in a VA health care system, we know that the most common health problems are under the category of musculoskeletal ailments, principally joint and back disorders. We hear a lot about brain injury and PTSD, and those we have to give a lot of resources to, but 42 percent of veterans coming to the health care system have been presented to the VA with the needs of joint and back disorders. 
   This bill, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act, requires  that chiropractic services be made available in not fewer than 75 VA medical centers by the end of December 2009 and all the health care centers by the end of 2011. 
   Undoubtedly the returning servicemembers will be able to benefit from this care. I speak from experience as I have had chiropractic care a good part of my life. I am confident that with expansion of these services within VA, many veterans will be able to find relief from their pain. 
   Since the creation of the VA health care system, the Nation's doctors of chiropractic have been kept outside and all but prevented from providing proven, cost-effective and needed care to veterans. So we are grateful that access is becoming wider and wider. 
   The support for VA chiropractic service is bipartisan. Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi released a policy directive before his departure several years ago regarding the true and full integration of chiropractic care in the VA. 
   Secretary Nicholson and I have developed a solid working relationship, and chiropractic care is an area where we will be working closely together. Both Republican and Democratic Members have supported the inclusion of chiropractic care in the VA. 
   I have worked very closely with chiropractic patients, particularly our veterans, as well as with various associations dedicated to the profession such as the American Chiropractic Association. 
   Veterans are returning home from combat expecting to receive needed services. Let us not disappoint them. Expansion of chiropractic services is the right thing to do, and it is the least we can do for our returning heroes. 
   I urge support of H.R. 1470. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (EARLY ACCESS TO VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION AND EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill, the Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act, was authored by my good friend from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman), and we appreciate his efforts over many years on behalf of our veterans. I was glad that we could get this bill to the floor today. It is the last of seven that say thank you to our Nation's veterans as we come up on Memorial Day. 
   This would extend vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to members of the Armed Forces who are  determined to have a disability incurred while on active duty of at least 10 percent and likely to be discharged from service due to that disability. The servicemembers would still have to qualify under usual vocational rehabilitation and employment criteria of at least 20 percent, with an employment handicap of 10 percent with a serious employment handicap. 
   H.R. 2239 will help veterans begin their rehab earlier and will be very beneficial to those veterans in extended convalescence which could be over a year. This is the ideal time, as veterans will still be on active duty, continuing to receive their military pay, making it easier to support his or her family. One of the factors that leads to servicemembers dropping out of vocational rehabilitation and employment is the need to support their families. 
   Due to the severity of the injury or injuries, most veterans will be expected to experience a drop in pay once they are discharged. However, if a veteran begins their rehab immediately, they may be able to enter the job market much earlier. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2239. It is an important bill. This is the least we can do for these brave men and women. It will ease the transition from the military to civilian employment market. And, again, I thank Mr. Boozman for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, we have come to the end of a day of thanks to our Nation's veterans. We have seven bills, all of which will go to really improve our services, our health care, our sense of commitment to our Nation's veterans. We have had seven good bills today, and I think they will all be approved by this body. 
   I was a professor of European history before I became a Congressman, and I used to talk about the Roman world. And there was this famous Roman senator named Cato. And Cato would end all his speeches, no matter on what subject, which they might be about the sewer system of Rome or they might be about gladiator games or war against the Parthians or whoever, but he would always end his speech, no matter what the thing was, and everybody would expect it and he sort of became the laughingstock of the senate because they would know he would end all his speeches with ``and we must destroy Carthage.'' And nobody paid any attention to his speeches because they were all waiting for that conclusion no matter on what subject. 
   So with that little history lesson, I urge my colleagues to unanimously support H.R. 2239.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill comes to us from the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre), and we thank him for his leadership on veterans outreach. 
   If I had to sum up this bill in one phrase, I would say that it allows local organizations to provide more bang for the buck by having greater resources at the local level. 
   This bill requires the VA to partner with State and local governments, through grant opportunities, to reach out to veterans and their families to ensure receipt of benefit for which they are eligible and assist them in completing their benefits claims. 
   As we have seen from recent news reports all over the country, we still have veterans slipping through the cracks of this system. They are either unaware of their veterans benefits or are having difficulty getting those benefits processed. 
   This bill establishes a grant program for the VA to provide to States' outreach activities, cooperative relationships and benefit claims development. The grant program allows State veterans agencies to award a portion of the grants to local governments for outreach purposes. 
   In addition, the grant allows funding for education and training of State and local government employees for accreditation to provide outreach services. It may also be used to establish a local government veterans service program. 
   The bill prohibits any portion of the grant to be used by the State for administrative purposes and requires the VA to allocate grants based on veteran populations. 
   The bill limits grant use by States to less than 50 percent of the cost of State and local government outreach activities and prohibits grant funds from supplanting State and local funds for such activities. 
   H.R. 67 authorizes $25 million annually, in fact $1 per veteran in our Nation, to improve outreach to veterans and remove some of the significant obstacles veterans must overcome to access their benefits. This is particularly true in rural areas, which Mr. McIntyre represents. The bill also contains performance measures to ensure that grant recipients are properly fulfilling the requirements of the program. 
   The bill is supported by the American Legion, Military Officers Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, National County Veteran Service Officers, National Organization of Veterans Advocates, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY IN SOUTHERN COLORADO REGION -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to bring to the floor a bipartisan bill authored by Congressman Salazar of Colorado with Congressman Lamborn of Colorado. It establishes a veterans cemetery in El Paso County, Colorado. 
   Southern Colorado, which includes El Paso, Colorado, and the city of Colorado Springs, has the second highest concentration of veterans living in the United States. Currently those veterans and their families who wish either to visit a veterans cemetery or have their loved ones interred must travel into the Denver metropolitan area to Fort Logan National Cemetery. 
   Not only is this an undue burden, but the Fort Logan cemetery is running out of room. To alleviate this problem, H.R. 1660 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery for veterans in El Paso County, Colorado. This was a fitting tribute to those Americans who have served our Nation with honor. The veterans national cemeteries of the United States demonstrate the desire of a grateful Nation to appropriately commemorate those who have served in the Armed Forces. 
   Since 1862, close to 3 million burials have been made in the VA national cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs manages 125 of these cemeteries nationwide for our veterans. Of these, 58 of them are no longer accepting interments. Thus, the  need to build new cemeteries is quite urgent. 
   As we lose more and more of our greatest generation of veterans and face the increasing prospects of additional fatalities of Iraq, this country, at the very least, needs to ensure that veterans are provided a dignified, accessible and well-maintained final resting spot. This bill would go a long way in making that happen. 
   It is supported by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans and Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
   I was proud to see the bipartisan approach taken by two members of our committee, Mr. Salazar and Mr. Lamborn, to make sure that this bill got through the committee. They both worked cooperatively and tirelessly to get this bill to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, not all of the returning veterans from the OEF/OIF suffer from obvious wounds. Those who suffer from an external injury are readily identified and receive immediate care for that injury. However, many of our returning veterans, and on this I include, Mr. Speaker, Guard and Reserve units who have been ordered to combat, are coming back with injuries that are not external. They are hidden wounds of the war, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, forms of brain injury, which may not be evident without further diagnosis, which may not be evident to the soldier or to the doctor looking at him. 
   Unlike the physical wounds, mental wounds are not easily identified and may go undetected. PTSD is a mental health condition that is triggered by a traumatic event which causes an intense fear and/or helplessness. Some of the symptoms for this condition include reexperiencing the trauma through nightmares, obsessive thoughts, flashbacks. We know that this condition may not reveal itself for many months or maybe for years after experiencing the event. 
   We listened to veterans, veteran service organizations, family members, and we heard them say that their returning veterans needed more time to access the VA health care system when they came home from war. 
   Conditions like PTSD and traumatic brain injury are the driving force behind this bill, the Returning Servicemember VA Healthcare Insurance Act of 2007. It extends from 2 years to 5 years following discharge or release the eligibility period for veterans. And, as I said, we include Guard and Reserve units all those who served in combat during or after the Persian Gulf War are eligible to receive hospital care,  medical services, or nursing home care provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It provides for an additional 3 years of eligibility for veterans discharged more than 5 years before the enactment of this act who may not have enrolled in the VA health care system. 
   This system is recognized throughout the country, and indeed the world, as providing safe quality health care to our veterans. Two years was simply not enough time for returning OEF/OIF veterans to utilize this very important benefit. We are fixing that with this piece of legislation. It is a bill that will have a profound effect most immediately on our veterans returning from war. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for his helpful amendment to this bill. As I said earlier, this is a very important bill to thousands and thousands of returning veterans. They have basically unfettered access to one of the best health care systems in the world without going through a lot of red tape, without going through a lot of paperwork to prove that they are eligible. They will have 5 years. 
   And it is most important for our Reserve and Guard units, who are not eligible for the benefit structure of the VA system. They are not eligible for most of the benefits of the GI bill. And we are trying to make an effort to bring them in under the VA benefits under what we call ``total force structure.'' 
   So this bill is important to thousands of people, those that are coming back from the Marines or Army and those that are in the Guard and Reserve units. All of them now will have 5 years where these hidden injuries, brain injury, or post-traumatic stress disorder may become evident, and they may seek help. Now they will be able to do it without any of the bureaucratic entanglements. And I think this will have a remarkable impact on the lives of our Nation's veterans. 
   And I will tell you, as George Washington said more than 200 years ago, ``The morale of our fighting troops is dependent, most of all, on how they feel they're going to be treated when they come home.'' When they know they will have 5 years to come to the VA, they will know that a Nation is caring for them and is responsive to their needs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would point out this is one of the most important bills on the floor today or at any time. It's called the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act of 2007. 
   The wounded from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are returning with multiple injuries due to the use of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. This often results in servicemembers and veterans needing polytrauma care, and has caused an increase in veterans with brain injury, or TBI. 
   We are going to have tens of thousands of these young men and women with these injuries. Among veterans and servicemembers that return from OEF and OIF and treated at Walter Reed for injuries of any type, approximately 65 percent have TBI or a comorbid, as they call it, diagnosis. Survivors of TBI experience physical, cognitive, emotional and community integration issues. Because of their injury, their capacity and initiative to seek appropriate care on their own is diminished. 
   We are also faced with thousands of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with milder cases of brain injury. This milder case often is missed and goes untreated, and symptoms may often mirror that of PTSD. Indeed, according to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, in prior military conflicts, TBI was present in up to 14 to 20 percent of surviving casualties. The numbers for operations in OEF/OIF are predicted to go much, much higher. 
   We must ensure that the health care and services that meet the needs of returning servicemembers are available and accessible, while never forgetting the needs of veterans from previous conflicts. This bill provides for mandatory screening of veterans for traumatic brain injury. It requires the Secretary to establish a comprehensive program of long-term care, of postacute traumatic brain injury rehabilitation at four geographically disbursed polytrauma network sites. It provides for the establishment of TBI transition offices at each Department polytrauma network site to coordinate health care and services to veterans who suffer from moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries. It requires the Secretary to establish a registry of those who served in Iraq who exhibit symptoms associated with TBI. 
   This legislation establishes centers for TBI research, education and clinical activities, and requires the Secretary to establish a committee on the care of veterans with TBI. In addition to the provisions that address health care, research and treatment for veterans, this legislation also provides for veterans who reside in rural areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a very important bill. We will hear soon from Mr. Michaud, the chairman of our Health Subcommittee, who was the primary author of this, who has been a leader to make sure that we serve the veterans who come back with these incredible injuries, that they receive the proper care that they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, let me just conclude by saying like everything else about this war, the administration did not prepare either for the fighting, the aftermath, or the treatment of the  veterans coming back. We simply left thousands of our veterans without adequate resources to treat these brain injuries or PTSD or other issues that arise. No matter what denial that comes from the minority party, no matter what denial comes from the administration, we have not prepared for adequate treatment of these veterans. We are passing legislation today to do that, and we will not deny that there will be thousands and thousands of brain-injured veterans. We should bring them home now and we should treat them well when they get back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Duncan and Chairman Oberstar for this creative solution to a very difficult problem. 
   I happen to live at the border. I represent the whole California-Mexico border. Through my district, at least 4,000 trucks a day pass through. That means across the whole border three or four, five times that will cross. The volume is enormous. There is no way for us to inspect this incredible volume of traffic. In fact, when there was a test case several years ago of inspecting all the trucks, they found 100 percent of the trucks had either insurance or safety violations. 
   We are dealing with issues of insurance. We are dealing with issues of truck safety. We're dealing with issues of driver certification and jobs on this side of the border. There's no question that these certifications are just not the same standards that we apply. We have fraudulent use of papers. There is enormous difficulty in getting accountability. 
   But, in addition, if we allow the truckers to cross they will be in this country and able to take jobs away from our local companies, especially small trucking companies. It costs them about 150 dollars to go to L.A. from San Diego and back. A Mexican trucker will do it for 50 dollars. That puts all our guys out of business if the administration proposal was allowed to go through. 
   So I thank the Chair for coming up with this creative solution. This is a bad, bad vision that the administration has to allow all trucks across in a way which does not really meet the safety or insurance or certification standards that we have in this country. And we're going to have a major accident somewhere, and the people in America are going to say how did this happen. 
   Well, we intend in Congress to make sure that we keep our safe roads and we keep our jobs for American truckers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. I thank the gentlelady, and I thank the leadership of Ms. Woolsey and Ms. Lee of the Progressive Caucus. 
   Madam Chair, I rise this morning as the Chair of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee in proud support of the Progressive Caucus budget. 
   Other budgets fund the war; this budget funds the warrior. I am going to repeat that: Other budgets fund the war; this budget funds the warrior. 
   Most of us in the Progressive Caucus are against the war in Iraq, but we are united in our view that when these young men and women come home and all the other young men and women who came home in the past, that they get all the care, the support, the honor, the dignity, the love that a grateful Nation can bestow. 
   We are united in saying we will honor those who come home. They have done everything we have asked, they have been brave and courageous, they have had incredible wounds both physically and mentally, and we are going to give them the care, love, respect, and honor that they deserve. 
   This is the only budget before us today that says we will have what is called ``mandatory funding'' of veterans health care. Mandatory funding means we don't have to wait 5 months like the Republicans did last year when they didn't fund the Veterans Administration for the first 5 months of the fiscal year. Assured funding, mandatory funding, means that they will be funded on the first day of the fiscal year, and they will get automatic funding that doesn't have to go through a political fight. 
   We have a President that says support the troops, support the troops, support the troops. The speakers on the other side say support the troops, support the troops, support the troops. But when they get home, who is supporting them? Who is supporting these brave young men and women when they come back? We saw what happened at Walter Reed. We saw what happened to Bob Woodruff when he had traumatic brain injury--and those who were less fortunate than he didn't get the treatment they needed. We heard about the young marine who went to a Minnesota hospital saying he had PTSD and was thinking about committing suicide, and they said he was number 28 on the waiting list, come back in a month. He went home and he committed suicide. That is not a Veterans Administration, that is not a country that is welcoming its troops home. It is time that we fund the warrior and not just the war. Vote for the Progressive Caucus budget.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 521, a measure to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.'' Indeed, I wholeheartedly support Congressman Phil Hare in his efforts to bring this measure to the floor today and I appreciate his quick actions on this matter. As many know, Mr. Hare was the District Director of Congressman Evans for many years and now represents the 17th district of Illinois himself, the district that Lane Evans represented for 24 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lane Evans served with distinction in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1982; he was elected 12 times in a row by the good people of the 17th district of Illinois. Indeed, they proudly sent their best from the heartland America to serve America. 
   Lane has always been a champion for working families, students, servicemembers, veterans and military families. He went to college and law school on the GI Bill and returned to Illinois to be a legal aid lawyer, representing the less fortunate among us.

Shigeru Yamada is an extraordinary young man who has faced much personal adversity in his life but has been a model student, athlete and member of the Chula Vista community. He has worked hard to overcome his personal tragedy while attending school and being active in civic organizations. Yamada came to the United States legally in 1992 at the age of 10 with his mother and two younger sisters and due to tragedy and changes in the immigration laws, he was to be deported despite the fact that he has assimilated into American society. The passage of this bill in the House brings justice one step closer to Yamada. We want and need more people like him in our country and he deserves the opportunity to become a citizen.  
   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on many issues, especially in these special orders, and tonight a very important one, the effect of deployment on our families, our military families. 
   You know, this is a war that has gone on the second longest in our history. There are over 4,000 young men and women who have been killed. There have been at least 30,000 casualties that we account for of Americans, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. That 30,000 official figure, by the way, compare that with the following statistic: Over 800,000 veterans have already returned from this war in Iraq.     
   Over 300,000 of them have filed claims for injuries, whether physical or psychological, while in battle, 300,000. Compare that with the official figure of 30,000. It is a factor of ten. Something is not being told to the American people here. 
   But then, think of all the families involved of those who have been killed, the best and brightest of our young men and women, the casualties that we admit, the hundreds of thousands of casualties when they come home. Not only do they have to deal with fatality or grave injury, they have to deal with income problems. A spouse may have to take care of her husband and lose two incomes. 
   What about the children? Over 1 million children of those deployed or were deployed or will be deployed, how do they take daddy coming home, or not coming home, dealing with violence that is a symptom of PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder, dealing with an amputated father or mother, dealing with brain injuries?  
   This is something that we as a society have got to deal with. It is part of the cost of war, and the cost of war that we have been asked to take on doesn't cover this. We have to fight for every penny for veterans and their families. 
   The President says support our troops, support our troops, support our troops. But when they come home, who supports the troops, and who is looking after the families? And that is what we are dealing with tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Let me focus, if I may, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, on the children. And children have to deal again with dad or mom away for extended periods. You mentioned the Lopez family. Or the problems may really begin when dad or mom come comes back, amputated legs, spinal cord injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder. 
   Now, this is something that our VA or DOD or administration ought to be worried about, and yet it was left to the private sector to figure out, what do we tell our children? How do we answer something at an age-appropriate level? 
   And I want to thank the Sesame Street Workshop who produces Sesame Street, the nonprofit educational organization, for its leadership. As you mentioned, there are hundreds and thousands of children of military families who are impacted every day by the deployment of one or both of their parents. They responded to this 2 years ago by making an outreach tool to help families and their young children cope with the challenges of deployment: A DVD featuring Elmo who struggles with military deployment of his father, and urges his viewers to share their emotions and fears directly with their parents. After watching this video together, families have found a new opportunity to talk with their children and communicate together as a family. 
   Here is the first DVD that Sesame Street did under a Talk, Listen, and Connect series, Helping Families During Military Deployment; and also in Spanish, Partides Militares Bienvenidos Cambios. And that was distributed with the help of the military and the help of the VA to hundreds of thousands of young people. 
   Just yesterday, Sesame Street launched a new DVD, a new series called Deployments, Homecoming, and Changes. And that addresses the level of anxiety children may experience after multiple deployments, as well as to help young children gain an age-appropriate understanding of a parent's combat-related health condition so the family can heal together. The DVD features again Elmo and Rosita, and intersperses the Muppets with real families like the Lopez family that you showed us earlier. They are meant for children, but spouses and friends and relatives facing a complicated transition of multiple deployments or the physical and psychological wounds. 
   I invite, by the way, all Members of the House of Representatives to meet Elmo and the Cookie Monster next Wednesday on May 7, at 4:00, at HC-5. Sesame Street will bring Elmo and the Cookie Monster. You can take pictures with him or her, I am not sure, and pick up a copy of this DVD. It will be distributed free to military families all over the Nation. 
   I hope every one of our colleagues picks up a copy, watches it, and helps distribute it in their own districts. This is an important tool that was produced for us by people who care about what is going on. 
   And I will tell you, we are now in the Month of the Military Child. We want to honor the children of military families. But we have now a tool to reach children. This is aimed at very young children below the age of five. And if they watch what is going on, again, I have seen some of the previews. One of the children of a parent with a prosthetic leg was shown bringing the leg to dad to try to make that situation sort of natural and a part of life and not something to be ashamed of or to fear. And so Sesame Street uses the power of video to connect with soldiers and their families and of course the children. 
   You can watch the video yourself. Go to sesameworkshop.org/tlc for Talk, Listen, and Connect; Hablen, Escuchen, Conecten, at sesameworkshop.org/tlc, and you can see that and watch it for yourself. 
   I would just like to say to my colleague from San Antonio, who is a psychologist and has dealt with children in his professional life and is a great aid on our veterans committee for issues of mental health and the issues we are talking about today, we thank you for your leadership, Mr. Rodriguez.  
   Mr. Speaker, let me also thank Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for her steadfast support of America's children and her interest in the needs of veterans' families. 
   Every day the men and women of our armed forces sacrifice to protect and preserve our way of life, whether by putting themselves in harm's way, or by enduring time away from their loved ones at home. 
   I would like to recognize Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational organization behind Sesame Street, for its leadership in serving the most vulnerable population of the Armed Services--the thousands of young children in military families who are impacted every day by issues related to deployment. 
   Sesame Workshop has responded to the needs of the 700,000 children under the age of 5 who have a parent in the military. In August 2006, Sesame Workshop launched a critically needed outreach tool to help families and their young children cope with the challenges of deployment. 
   In this video, Elmo struggles with the military deployment of his father and urges his viewers to share their emotions and fears directly with their parents. 
   After watching this video together, families have found a new opportunity to talk with their children and communicate together as a family. 
   Just yesterday, Sesame Workshop launched its second phase of its Talk, Listen, Connect series of videos for military children. 
   This newest resource kit is titled, ``Deployments, Homecomings, Changes'' and it addresses the level of anxiety children may experience after multiple deployments as well as help young children gain an age-appropriate understanding of a parent's combat-related health condition so the family can heal together. 
   These new outreach materials are meant for spouses, friends, and relatives of military parents and children who are facing the complicated transitions of multiple deployments or who have returned home with combat-related health injuries, both physical and psychological. 
   Elmo is again filling an unmet need for developmentally appropriate resources for young children. 
   This project has garnered overwhelming support from the military community, with nearly 400,000 of the original kits requested from active duty, National Guard, and reserve families to help build a sense of stability and resiliency during times of separation and change. 
   April is the ``Month of the Military Child.'' Today, we are taking the time to honor the children in military families and acknowledging the personal sacrifices they make and the challenges they overcome. 
   I applaud the critical work of organizations like Sesame Workshop whose project, Talk, Listen, Connect, has the sole purpose of helping make the lives of these children and their families a little easier during some of the most difficult of times. 
   I commend Sesame Workshop for its work to help empower children and adults alike, as well as help families overcome adversity together in order to bring hope for the future. 
   Sesame Workshop uses the power of video to connect with soldiers and their families during these difficult times. The video honestly addresses the sadness, confusion and anxiety  with sensitivity and clarity for the 700,000 pre-school kids in this country whose parents serve lengthy and frequent deployments. 
   This video is available to watch on the internet. Just search for Sesame Workshop and TLC. 
   You can also order a kit on the web site--for your neighbor, your co-worker, or even your own child--that might be struggling with the extended deployment of a parent, or adapting to a parent that has returned home but is suffering from visible or invisible wounds. 
   As a Nation, we must do more than simply say we support our service members and their families. We must follow through with true deeds and bold action that will ultimately assist our military families as they make the transition into civilian life. 
   I urge you to learn more about Sesame Workshop and share these extraordinary resources with military families you know. 
   This video will begin to build a dialogue between children and parents, as well as this country and our Nation's military families. America cares for our military families and this Sesame Workshop film shares this message of support. 
   We need to make sure the fabric of our society is strong enough to ensure the well-being of the military family and I want to thank Sesame Workshop and the many organizations that contributed to this project. 
   Again, my thanks to Congresswoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for your leadership on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL AVIATION MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the Speaker and I thank our House Speaker for bringing this to the floor today, H. Res. 444, a resolution which supports the goals and ideals of National Aviation Maintenance Technician Day, honoring the invaluable contributions of Charles Edward Taylor, regarded as the father of aviation maintenance, and recognizing the essential role of aviation maintenance technicians in ensuring the safety and security of civil and military aircraft. 
   With all the concerns, Mr. Speaker, today about safety and airlines, it is the men and women who actually do the maintenance that we depend on so greatly. 
   It was Charles Edward Taylor who built and maintained the engine that was used to power the Wright brothers' first controlled aircraft, the Flyer, and he was born in 1868. He is widely regarded as the father of aviation maintenance, and was a vital contributor of mechanical skills in the building and maintaining of early Wright brothers engines and airplanes. Taylor also built the wind tunnel used by the Wrights to test their early designs. He became a leading mechanic in the Wright Aircraft Company when it was formed in 1909. In fact, when Calbraith Perry Rodgers made his famous cross-country trip in a Wright brothers aircraft, he paid Charles Edward Taylor $70 a week, a pretty large sum at the time, to be his mechanic. Taylor followed the flight by train, making required repairs and preparing the aircraft for the next day's flight throughout the cross-country trip from Long Island to California. 
   Although Taylor was largely ignored by history, it is important to note that the Wright brothers were very close friends with him, and remained in close contact with him throughout their lives. 
   Charles Edward Taylor saved enough money from his ventures to buy several hundred acres of farmland near the Salton Sea, which is located in my district. However, the economic climate of the time eventually brought him to poverty, and he died penniless in 1956 at the age of 87. He was buried at the Portal of Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation in Burbank, California. 
   Mr. Speaker, the humble beginnings of the aviation maintenance profession belies the fact that all of us in the Congress and our constituents rely on the work that these technicians do every day. They play an invaluable role not only in ensuring the safety of commercial aircraft, but also ensuring that our men and women in uniform have safe, reliable planes and helicopters while in their combat and training. Thanks to these dedicated, well-trained professionals, the United States has by far the safest air transportation system in the world. We owe aircraft mechanics a debt of gratitude for their service to the flying public. 
   We are hearing a lot today about consolidations in the airline industry, and some airlines have already been outsourcing aviation maintenance abroad to cut their costs. I urge everyone in this Chamber to remember how critical it is for our own safety to have a well-trained U.S.-based workforce to fix and maintain our aircraft. As the airline industry seeks to cut costs and merge, it is very important for all of us to keep a watchful eye on the impact of these consolidations on aviation maintenance technicians. We cannot afford to cut corners when it comes to safety. 
   Mr. Speaker, 45 U.S. States have already declared May 24 to be Aviation Maintenance Technician Day within their jurisdictions. My resolution is intended to support these efforts and honor aviation maintenance technicians, including the first, Charles Edward Taylor. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H. Res. 444. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Madam Chairman, we have an administration that says support the troops, support the troops, support the troops. Then they give us the budget that cuts support for veterans over the next 5 years, year by year by year, and with a modest increase for health care that barely covers inflation. It cut every single account in the veterans budget, including  construction, including research, all of the way through. So we restore, if I'm correct, Mr. Edwards, we restore all of those cuts. 
   And for the seventh year in a row, the President said, Let's increase enrollment fees. Let's double the pharmaceutical copays, and we, for the seventh year in a row are saying ``no.'' But not only did they increase the fees, they made a calculation that several hundred thousand veterans would not be able to pay those fees and be thrown out of the health care system. That, in a time of war where we got our troops fighting, they're going to throw veterans out of the VA health care system. That is disgraceful, and we said ``no'' to that. 
   And I thank the gentleman for making sure that we respected these warriors. It's part of the cost of war to treat the veterans correctly. Mr. Edwards and Mr. Spratt, you provided for those veterans. The whole country thanks you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support House Resolution 1287, a resolution commending the Honor Flight Network, its volunteers, its donors and friends for enabling World War II veterans to travel to our Nation's Capital to see the World War II Memorial created in their honor. It is a pleasure for me to stand before you today to pay tribute to the Honor Flight Network. 
   This is a nonprofit organization that was created solely to honor America's World War II veterans for all their sacrifices by bringing them to Washington, DC without charging them a penny. The visit for them is to reflect at the World War II Memorial and visit with their fellow veterans. 
   The memorial, as you all know, honors the 16 million veterans who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II, the more than 400,000 that made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation and the millions who supported the war effort at home. 
   The memorial itself is a testament to the spirit, sacrifice and commitment of the American people to the common defense of our Nation and equally important to the broader causes of peace and freedom from tyranny throughout the world. Above all, the memorial stands as an important symbol of American national unity, a timeless reminder of the moral strength and awesome power that can flow when free people are united and bonded together in a common and just cause. I sincerely hope that every World War II veteran will eventually be able to experience this great memorial, which we specifically created in their honor. 
   I am saddened, Madam Speaker, that not all veterans will be able to see this remarkable site. But, fortunately, the Honor Flight Network has made this dream a reality for many veterans by helping them see firsthand the memorial, an experience that certainly live with them and their families for the rest of their lives. 
   This program was conceived by Earl Morse, a physician's assistant and retired Air Force captain, to honor the veterans he has taken care of for almost three decades. After retiring from the Air Force in 1998, Earl was hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs to work in a small clinic in Springfield, Ohio. 
   In May of 2004, the World War II Memorial was finally completed and dedicated in Washington, DC, which quickly became the topic of discussion amongst his World War II veteran patients. Earl repeatedly asked these veterans if they would ever travel out to visit the memorial. Most felt that eventually somehow they would make it to D.C., perhaps with a friend or family member. 
   As summer turned to fall and then winter, these same veterans returned to the clinic for their follow-up visits. Earl asked if they accomplished their dream of visiting the World War II Memorial. 
   By now, for most of the veterans who were asked the question, reality had settled in. It was clear to most of them that it was simply not financially or physically possible for them to make the journey. Most of these heroes were in their eighties and lacked the physical and mental wherewithal to complete a trip of their own. Families and friends lacked the resources and time to complete a trip to D.C. 
   Earl could tell that the majority of the veterans had given up all hope of ever visiting the memorial that was specifically created to honor them, their sacrifice and their service. That is when Earl decided that there had to be a way to get these heroes to D.C. to see this memorial. 
   In December of 2004 Earl asked one of his World War II patients if he could personally fly him out to D.C. free of charge to visit the memorial. The patient, Mr. Loy, broke down and cried. He said at his age he would probably never get to see his memorial. He accepted the offer, and soon thereafter Earl received help from other pilots to make these hopes and dreams a reality for other veterans. 
   At the end of the first year, Honor Flight took 137 World War II veterans to their memorial. The mission and ideals of the program began to spread across America. One individual, Jeff Miller, from Hendersonville, North Carolina, led the expansion into areas not serviced by direct commercial flights to the Washington, DC area, and HonorAir was born. 
   In February of 2006, Earl and Jeff combined efforts and cofounded this Honor Flight Network. By the end of 2006, almost 1,000 World War II veterans realized their dream of visiting their memorial. The program presently has 69 hubs in 30 States, and by the end of this year, the Honor Flight Network hopes to have a hub in all 50 States. 
   One veteran who was able to have this experience, Ed Vitikas, put it best. He said, ``It's the trip of a lifetime.'' In the future, Honor Flight plans on paying tribute to America's other heroes that served during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, followed by veterans of more current wars. 
   Today, by passing House Resolution 1287, we express our gratitude and heartfelt thanks to an organization that has given so much to our veterans by commending the Honor Flight Network, its volunteers and donors, for enabling World War II veterans to travel to our Nation's Capital to so the World War II Memorial created in their honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our colleagues, Jerry Moran from Kansas, David Hobson from Ohio and Heath Shuler from North Carolina, for submitting this resolution. I ask that all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In conclusion, maybe as a segue to a bill we have in a couple minutes, this is a memorial to World War II veterans. For over 62 years, the Filipinos, who were drafted to fight in World War II and helped us win the battle in the Pacific, have not been granted the rights and benefits of being veterans of our Nation. They played a very important role, slowing up the Japanese advance, harassing them so that MacArthur could return, and continuing to help us fight the battle of the Pacific. We would not have won the battle in the Pacific as quickly as we did were it not for our Filipino World War II veterans. 
   I just want to say for the record that I and millions of people around the country regard this World War II Memorial on the Mall as also commemorating the contributions of the Filipinos who fought by our side in World War II. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, this bill, rights a wrong that has existed for more than 60 years. Filipino servicemembers played a critical role in the United States' victory in the Pacific during World War II. 
   They exhibited great courage, as we all know, in the epic battles of Bataan and Corregidor. Many died in the famous Bataan Death March. Those who survived, and others who escaped, continued to harass the Japanese as guerilla units. When MacArthur returned, they joined in the victory of the retaking of the Philippines. 
   This bill would provide a one-time payment to the courageous Filipino soldiers who fought side-by-side with American GIs. There is no disputing the valiant service that these men provided in the Pacific. 
   Unfortunately, during a less-than-noble moment in our history, Congress passed the Rescission Acts of 1946, which stripped them of their veteran status and denied them the right of any benefit. While some veteran benefits have been restored for a few soldiers on a limited and piecemeal basis, for the large majority, they have never received a dime for their service. This is wrong.  
   When these men were called up to service by President Roosevelt, they were still considered Americans who were under territorial rule. Even if decades later, we must recognize the service of our Filipino soldiers and demonstrate the gratitude all of our soldiers deserve for doing what they were asked to do nobly and without complaint. 
   Let me remind you what President Truman said when he signed the so-called Rescission Acts, even though he disagreed with part of it. Truman said the passage and approval of this legislation ``does not release the United States from its moral obligation to provide for the heroic Filipino veterans who sacrificed so much. Philippine Army veterans fought as American nationals under the American flag and under the direction of our military leaders.'' 
   H.R. 6897, as amended, will give a long overdue one-time payment of $15,000 for U.S. citizens and $9,000 for those who were citizens. By doing this, we will provide a small, yet meaningful, measure of recognition and thanks to these brave men who deserve far, far more. 
   It is time that this Congress and our Nation recognize their contributions to the successful outcome of World War II, recognize the injustice visited upon them and act to correct this injustice. To those who ask if we can afford to redeem this debt, I say we can't afford not to. The historical record remains blotted until we recognize these veterans. 
   I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting these veterans and would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, let me say this is an important bill for our Nation, for our moral standing, and for our historical standing. There has been a blot on our record for the last 62 years. We now have a chance to remove it. 
   I am surprised to hear from my friend, Mr. Stearns, that he wants to play off one veteran against another and say there are higher priorities. That is what he and his ranking member objected to in our pay-for in S. 1315. 
   As we deal with the very real problems of our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, we have 24 million other veterans to care for, whether they be from the Persian Gulf War I, Korea, Vietnam or World War II. We have injustices. I don't think the gentleman from Florida would have any problem dealing with the injustices from Vietnam where we have not honored our Agent Orange claims, and we will try to take care of that. I don't think he would have any problem honoring the atomic veterans of World War II who, involved in the testing of atomic weapons, were not told of the dangers and risks, and they have cancers today that they cannot get compensation for. We have to correct that. 
   So, yes, we are involved with the current veterans, but we also have to correct injustices of the past as we are trying to do here in this bill on Filipino veterans. 
   Madam Speaker, I misspoke when I said I didn't have any further speakers, and if Mr. Stearns wants more time, he can take from us before Ms. Richardson takes the floor.

   Mr. FILNER. What you ask, I think, has already taken place. We do, in fact, compensate those who were our allies, whether from Laos or Cambodia or Thailand. 
   But more importantly, in World War II, Mr. Stearns, there were nationalities of 67 countries who fought in the war to help us. We have compensated the nationals who were not our citizens of 66 of those countries. Only one has not been, and that is the Philippines. It  is true that they got their independence after the war in 1946, and the $200 million that you referred to was given to that new government. But they simply have not received the compensation and benefits that we granted to other nationals of World War II, to other nationals in Korea and Vietnam. There is a real historical precedent for all of that.

   Mr. FILNER. I want to end the debate now. Mr. Stearns, I appreciate it. You pointed out, by the way, the discrepancy in the funds between this one and my H.R. 760, which I think was about $900 million. You are right, this is not my first choice. This is a second choice brought about by the actions of those who opposed it and would not allow it to pass. 
   Mr. Stearns, You spent a lot of time on the $200 million from 1946. By my quick calculations, each of the quarter million veterans at the time would have received less than $1,000 at that moment. 
   Madam Speaker, I think we have a historical record to correct. I strongly urge my colleagues to correct it.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that my colleagues on the committee were able to work together to craft this important piece of legislation. The Chair of our Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Ms. Herseth Sandlin, and her ranking member, Mr. Boozman, provided really strong bipartisan leadership that was important in this bill. As I said when starting this package of bills, we must never forget the great debt we owe to all of them. We have to remember the courage and sacrifice demonstrated daily by those who serve our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, when our servicemembers return home, it is our solemn obligation to protect and serve them with the same commitment and dedication which they protected and served us. H.R. 1315, as amended, would contribute to just that level of commitment. 
   Under current law, transitioning disabled servicemembers who are temporarily living in housing owned by a family member are barred from receiving financial assistance to make necessary adaptations to their housing. This bill before us clarifies this point of law and ensures those veterans have the resources necessary to enjoy a comfortable and independent lifestyle. 
   This legislation creates a scholarship for students interested in earning a degree or certification in blind rehabilitation. In return for these scholarships, these students would provide 3 years of service to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The effect of this program will be a needed staff increase to meet the growing needs of our vision-impaired and blind veterans. 
   I must say, Ms. Herseth Sandlin, we ought to look at this for some other needs of the VA, whether it is nursing or psychiatry or whatever. This way of encouraging and incentivizing those who could serve our veterans is a really fine approach. 
   The bill will, furthermore, bring more efficiency and accountability to the veteran employment process by facilitating greater coordination among the U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, and Labor. It allows for a more transparent view of data concerning complaints submitted by the National Guard and Reservists regarding difficulty obtaining employment. 
   Ensuring that our servicemembers are afforded a seamless transition from active duty to civilian life is an issue that we in the committee are keenly aware of, and I am glad to see needed language in this bill. 
   Finally, this bill corrects a technical error in current law to increase the U.S. Department of Labor's Advisory Committee on Veterans Employment Training and Employer Outreach by one representative from the existing 15. 
   We all stand united here in this House in caring for our veterans, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1315, as amended 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, as with the last bill, I want to just thank both the chair, Mr. Michaud of Maine, and the ranking member, Mr. Miller from Florida, for their great leadership and bipartisan cooperation to get an important piece of legislation out. 
   This bill, the Veterans' Health Care Improvement Act of 2007, combines a lot of different ideas from Members on both sides of the aisle, and we are pleased to have this bill on the floor today. 
   Certainly, the mental health and well-being of our newest generation of veterans is a serious cause for concern and deserves our fullest attention. 
   The VA reported in April of this year that of the OEF/OIF veterans who have separated and sought health care through the VA, mental disorders rank second of frequency of possible diagnoses amongst these veterans. 
   Post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, is the number one health concern. At this point, over 39,000 returning veterans have received a provisional diagnosis of this, and we are looking into, in fact, maybe a systemic underestimation of those who are diagnosed and, therefore, to get treatment. 
   Mr. Speaker, the composition of the fighting forces in Iraq and Afghanistan today is unique from past conflicts. Guard and Reserve forces make up a large percentage of those fighting, around 50 percent or a little more. Though only 19 percent of the Nation lives in rural America, 44 percent of U.S. military recruits come from rural areas. 
   We must ensure that their health care and services meet the needs that they deserve and have earned. It must be available and accessible to all, and I would say we will take up as a committee the broad subject of rural veterans sometime in the near future. 
   This bill requires the VA to award grants to conduct workshop programs to help heal and better the lives of veterans who need it through therapeutic programs such as art, writing and music to name just a few. It establishes a grant program to provide transportation options to veterans living in rural areas that will help to lessen the burden on veterans who are unable to drive long distances due to their disability or illness. 
   It also provides permanent authority to the VA to treat veterans who are subject to chemical and biological testing. This is an obligation we owe to those who have served. 
   We provide also for readjustment counseling and mental health services. We include contracting with community mental health centers in areas not adequately served by VA and contracting with nonprofit mental health organizations to train OEF/OIF veterans in outreach and peer support. 
   We address issues affecting homeless veterans and their families. The VA has now become the largest single provider of direct services to homeless veterans, reaching 25 percent of homeless veterans a year through various programs. Our aim is to make it 100 percent. Many communities have recently gone through what they call stand-downs, 2- or 3-day efforts to bring the whole community in cooperation to provide the services that homeless veterans need, whether they be medical or dental or legal or drug abuse counseling, of course, food and clothing; and we do that in 3 days a year in many communities. It is up to the VA to do that 365 days a year for all our veterans, and we estimate over 200,000 on the streets tonight who served our Nation. 
   Prior to becoming homeless, a large number of veterans have struggled with PTSD or had addictions acquired during or worsened by their military service, and we want to expand and extend the counseling services for these veterans. We expand programs to 12 locations throughout the Veterans Health Administration and extend this program through 2011. 
   The VA domiciliary care programs are an essential piece in assisting veterans and providing needed services to help them recover and become productive citizens again. We enhance in this bill the capacity of such domiciliary care programs, for female veterans especially. 
   Finally, we want to authorize VA to provide financial assistance to provide supportive services for very low-income veteran families who reside in permanent housing. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2874 takes care of the men and women who have so selflessly taken care of us. It provides our veterans with the quality health care programs and services they need and they so richly deserve. It is another down payment, another measurable piece of keeping our promise to those who have kept their promise to us

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, before I get to these specific bills, let me just say, as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, we are at a critical time in our Nation in dealing with our veterans. George Washington said it best over 200 years ago when he stated that ``the morale of our active duty troops depends foremost on how they sense they're going to be treated when they come home.'' So we have a lot of work to do. 
   We have a Secretary who has announced his resignation. Recently, just last week, the Dole-Shalala Commission released its report on some major changes for the VA and the DoD for the way we deal with our veterans and our wounded warriors. We need someone in that position, I think, who will shake things up a bit, who will not only do the Dole-Shalala recommendations, but go further and really talk to two bureaucracies that have to do business far better than what they do. Too often, VA means for our veterans ``veterans adversary'' instead of ``veterans advocate.'' 
   We have older veterans, like we're going to be dealing with in the bill up now, and we are going to have hundreds of thousands of new veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a critical job that we must do. And I always say, no matter where we are in the war in Iraq, we're going to make sure that every young man and woman who comes back from the war gets all the love, the care, the attention, the honor, the dignity that a Nation can bestow. 
   So we have a big job to do. And this package of bills we have today addressed both older veterans that we still have to care for and make sure any injustices that came up in their treatment are taken care of, as well as the needs that are so critical, whether they be brain injury or PTSD of the new veterans. We have to deal with both groups, and we have to do it right. 
   I want to speak now on H.R. 23, the Belated Thank You to the Merchant Mariners of World War II Act. 
   This is a bill that is six decades overdue, Mr. Speaker. And I think today we are on the verge of doing a historic thing, that is, providing a way to finally give the heroic merchant mariners of World War II the belated compensation that they've so richly earned and deserve. 
   I think this Congress not only has to treat those new veterans coming back from Iraq, but we have the responsibility to correct the wrongs of the past, and this is one of the grave injustices that deserves rectification. 
   There are over 250 Members of this House who have cosponsored H.R. 23. But for those who haven't, let me tell you about the sad history of these forgotten heroes. The Merchant Mariners of World War II traversed the dangerous U-boat laden waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, faced down fierce attacks from enemy aircraft, and were instrumental in every theater of war by carrying 95 percent of all tanks, supplies and troops during World War II. As a result, they suffered the highest casualty rate of any of the military branches. 
   It is indisputable that the allied forces would not have been able to begin, sustain or end World War II in victory without their valiant and selfless service. It is also indisputable, Mr. Speaker, that these men now are entitled to be compensated for their service. 
   After the war, they did not receive the recognition as veterans, or the benefits of the unprecedented GI Bill of  1944, which, in many people's minds, they had earned. We all know the profound effects of that GI Bill on building the middle class. We all know that the education and ability to buy homes led to the creation of the success of the generations following World War II. 
   At the signing of that bill in 1944, the GI Bill, which gave these veterans unprecedented education, housing, small business loans and health benefits, President Roosevelt himself declared, ``I trust Congress will soon provide similar opportunities to members of the merchant marine, who have risked their lives time and time again during war for the welfare of their country.'' Succeeding Congresses up until now have never done that. 
   Their fight for equity continued for all the time since then, and even for the time after they finally attained veteran status after a lengthy court battle that was decided in 1987, which by then, 40 years after the war, over 125,000 merchant mariners had died. 
   We've had the distinct privilege at the Veterans' Affairs Committee of receiving the heart-wrenching testimony of some of these veterans, one of whom was a named party in the lawsuit which finally gave him veteran status, a merchant mariner named Stanley Willner. Stanley was captured, interned, beaten, starved and tortured as a POW for 3 years. In fact, he was actually one of the unfortunate groups of allied forces that were forced to build the infamous bridge over the River Kwai. Upon release, he weighed a mere 74 pounds. When he returned home, his wife didn't recognize him, but neither did his country. He received just 2 weeks of medical care and little else for his service to this Nation. What a miscarriage of justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was only due to a sad confluence of powerful events after the war that this country did not bestow the brave men of the World War II Merchant Marine with veteran status. Their service was recognized by all the leaders of the Allied Forces from Generals MacArthur to Eisenhower.     
   I will include a list of quotes regarding their courageous service in the Record. I will also add a letter from the four maritime unions, the American Maritime Officers, the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association, and the Seafarers International Union, expressing their strong support for H.R. 23, as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, the time has come to right this enduring wrong. To me, failing to correct the injustice suffered by the merchant mariners for the past six decades is equivalent to an employer telling a group of 20-year-olds at the same company doing the same job that 85 percent of them will receive additional health, education, housing, and loan assistance benefits for the rest of their lives for their service, but the remaining 15 percent would not. Then, over 40 years later, the employer is forced to recognize the mistake and informs the 15 percent, sorry, we will give you what has not expired, but nothing else. 
   Where is the fairness? Where is the equity? How do you measure the loss of these benefits, the missed opportunities and the dreams unrealized? That is what H.R. 23 tries to make up for, to create the semblance of equity that the mariners of World War II so richly deserve by providing a monthly stipend to qualifying mariners on a first-come-first-served basis.

   Mr. FILNER. I thank Mr. Miller for bringing us this bill, because working with Mr. Michaud of Maine, we have an important piece of legislation that most people would have thought dealt with a problem that didn't exist. 
   Mr. Speaker, hospice and palliative care is a continuum of comfort-oriented and supportive services provided across settings, including hospitals, extended facilities, outpatient clinics and private residences. The VA offers a complement of hospice and palliative care options as part of a comprehensive health care benefit of provided to all veterans who are enrolled in our system. 
   Under current law, a veteran receiving hospice care in a nursing home is exempt from any applicable copayments. However, if the hospice care is provided in any other setting, such as an acute-care hospital or at home, the veteran may be subject to an in-patient or out-patient primary care copayment. This policy penalizes a veteran who chooses to remain at home for their hospice care or who, out of medical necessity, receives hospice care in an acute care setting. 
   Mr. Miller recognizes this injustice, and through H.R. 2623, corrects the inequity by exempting all hospice care provided through VA from copayment requirements. It would also align VA with the Medicare program, which does not impose copayments for hospice care. At the end of life, veterans should not have to worry about paying for the comfort that the hospice care provides. 
   It's the right thing to do, and I am pleased that my colleague from Florida has taken leadership on this

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. I thank the gentlelady, and I thank you for your leadership, which has come very early in your congressional career. It's nice to be here. Thank you for allowing a Congressman from San Diego to join you in this celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Port of Los Angeles. 
   As a representative of San Diego, there are a lot of things we don't want to imitate about Los Angeles, but we look with envy at the economic engine that the Port of Los Angeles represents. It is truly, and I say this with some envy, Southern California's gateway to international commerce, maintaining its competitive edge with record-setting cargo operations, groundbreaking environmental issues, progressive security measures, and diverse recreational and educational facilities. 
   The port's economic contributions are far-reaching. The port is connected directly and indirectly with tens of billions of dollars in industry sales each year in the Southern California region and in the Nation, translating into hundreds of thousands of local jobs and billions of dollars in wages, salaries and State and local taxes. 
   One out of every 24 jobs in Southern California is generated by the port. That's almost 260,000. One out of every $23 paid in wages and salaries, almost $9 billion, comes from the Port of Los Angeles.     
   Almost 1 1/2 million jobs are generated nationwide, and the port generates almost $1.5 billion in State and local taxes. 
   So this economic engine is far-reaching. We marvel at what you have produced there. We hope to take away sometime some of the congestion that the previous gentleman talked about by expanding our Port of San Diego, but we look at you again for a model of how to do these things. At least one business in every congressional district in this Nation imports or exports goods through the Los Angeles port complex. It is truly America's gateway, and we have an opportunity provided by you to recognize the 100th anniversary, and we hope there is unanimous support for your resolution.

   Not only have we for the first time with fiscal years 2008 and 2009 exceeded  the budget requests in the so-called independent budget, which is put together by veterans' groups for veterans, and for the first time we exceeded them 2 years in a row. Not only that, but with the fiscal year 2007, which we had to pick up, and several supplemental bills which we had to pass, we have added, in my calculation, over $17 million worth of new money for the health care of our veterans, which is an unprecedented 40 percent increase since Chairman Edwards and Chairman Obey have been chairmen of those committees. That is incredible. 
   We have put resources in place to do the job for our veterans, but the Veterans Administration doesn't always do what we intend, or do it with the efficiency that we would like. Many of you have heard the horror stories of young people going to medical centers, asking for PTSD help, post-traumatic stress disorder, being told that they can't get an appointment for 5 or 6 weeks, going home and committing suicide. 
   We have had the Secretary of the VA tell me, when I said, Aren't a thousand suicide attempts per month by our veterans a concern? He said, No. It's consistent with the literature. We have had a Secretary, Under Secretary of Defense say that 300,000 PTSD victims of our forces in Iraq and 320,000 victims of brain injury were not a problem because those were just symptoms of those injuries. They didn't really exhibit full-blown PTSD or full-blown traumatic brain injury and therefore they weren't concerned about it. So their concern, Mr. Chairman, has not always equaled our commitment here. 
   My two amendments would try to have dealt with that in a way that I hope and I know the chairman will work with me in the future. 
   Do you know that tens of thousands of our young people leave Iraq and Afghanistan, whether they are in the active duty or the Reserves or the National Guard, without any evaluation by medical personnel for either PTSD or brain injury? 
   We have to do something about that, Mr. Chairman. I have proposed, and we will work with you as we authorize what I am calling a Hero's Homecoming camp, to say that every soldier with his or her company, with his or her family, will be evaluated by medical personnel for brain injury and PTSD, and before they are discharged from the service. I had asked for $10 million to cooperate with the DOD to do that. 
   In addition, one of the chief weaknesses of the Veterans Administration is they don't like outside help. They don't ask for community support. All over this country, people want to help our troops. So I have asked at some point for $250 million for community grants to help our soldiers in their own communities who have mental health and other injuries for their treatment and rehabilitation. 
   This is something I think we have to do, Mr. Chairman. I know you agree with me in principle. I know this is not the time and place to debate that or put that in the bill. Your commitment to our soldiers, sailors airmen, and marines is well known. Just putting that out there, that we have to do this community support, mandatory evaluations, that I know that we can work together. 
   I will withdraw the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for allowing me to take a few minutes on this amendment. As we are very much concerned with our Iraqi and Afghanistan young men and women who are returning with grave injuries, we cannot forget our older veterans and the justices that we have to make up for. 
   We can go back to World War II where we have atomic veterans who have not yet received compensation for being in testing areas without being told. We have merchant mariners who never got benefits of our GI Bill, who are in their eighties and we need to say thank you to. 
   We have a group of veterans who were drafted into the Army in 1941, all the Filipinos who were in the Filipino army and various units and various irregular areas defending that territory. That was a territory of ours. And we drafted all the soldiers into our Army with the promise that they would have benefits later. 
   Those Filipino soldiers, over a quarter million of them, held up the Japanese advance for weeks and weeks and weeks beyond their scheduled advance. It allowed us back home to prepare better and for MacArthur to return. And though the Japanese overran the Philippines in the terrible battles of Corregidor and the famous death march of Bataan, the surviving soldiers were able to harass the Japanese through guerilla work, and they were not strong enough to resist MacArthur when he returned. In fact, it was the Filipinos, bravely alongside their American counterparts, who helped to win the war in the Pacific. 
   After the war was over, after we had won in both the Atlantic and Pacific, the Philippines were granted their independence, and the Congress of 1946 said, You got your independence. You take care of your veterans. Yes, you saved America, but that is your problem, not ours anymore.  
   Although President Truman signed the legislation which embodied that in law, he said, We must repair this important travesty. We promised those veterans full benefits. We have taken them away. We have to go and give them back. That was 62 years ago, Mr. Chairman, and that travesty still burns in the hearts of the Filipinos who are alive, and their family members. 
   The amendment I have in front of the body says that, basically, We are sorry, but thank you.     
   It provides a pension for those brave Filipino veterans. This is a moral necessity for America to close the chapter on World War II. This is a moral necessity for this Congress to make up for a mistake that was made 62 years ago. 
   I know many Members of this body agree with remedying this moral disaster, and yet we have had problems of how we pay for that and how we somehow use the budget to make sure that we are helping these deserving veterans, while not taking away from our brave young men and women from either World War II, Vietnam, Korea, the Persian Gulf war 1 or the present conflicts. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I am trying to figure out a way to do that. I know the vast majority of this body agrees with me, and I look forward to working with you to find a way to do that. 
   I know there are other speakers on this amendment. I would hope that we have a colloquy with the chairman on his time in a few minutes. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from Texas continue to reserve his point of order?

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, yesterday the GAO sustained a protest filed by Boeing Company over the Air Force's decision to award a lucrative contract for aerial refueling tankers to a team led by Northrop Grumman and the European firm behind Airbus. 
   GAO's decision followed a 100-day review of the Air Force's selection process for the $35 billion tanker program. In the decision, GAO recommended that the Air Force reopen discussions with the contractors, obtain revised proposals and make a new decision. The Air Force was also directed to reimburse Boeing for the cost of the protest. 
   I am very pleased, as many Members of this body are, as millions of people across America are, and we hope the Air Force completely rebids the contract. But this opens a whole bigger issue that we ought to be discussing. 
   We need to step back, take a look at the bigger picture--the impact of the Defense Department contract outsourcing on American jobs. As we know, the American economy was founded with a base of manufacturing jobs. Today, it is still those jobs that keep the economy strong. 
   Right now the stock market is down, the dollar is down, unemployment numbers are up. It doesn't take a Harvard MBA to see our economy is faltering because of the erosion of manufacturing jobs. 
   Let's keep our jobs in America!

   Mr. FILNER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent the southern part of the City of San Diego where we had thousands of evacuees, hundreds of homes lost, a really terrifying situation for many people. Of course, getting back on their feet will be a major, major challenge. But what we saw, as we have heard from my colleagues, is cooperation, cooperation from all levels of government, from the cities, the fire districts, county, State, Federal, and also international, which no one has mentioned up to this point. I watched as 60 firefighters, bomberos as we call them, from Tijuana, in Mexico, came to help and were a part of the team as we fought the Harris fire in southern San Diego. I think that was a very important contribution. 
   I had the opportunity to talk to the President as we flew to the fires. He understood that he needed to be visible very early, which was very hopeful, and that FEMA had to be proactive and not just reactive. The blue shirts of FEMA were on the job and visible everywhere, and their local assistance centers were set up very much earlier than in any previous disaster, I think. And that gave hope to many people. Those assistance centers, again, before even many of the evacuees had been allowed to return home were there and helping people. 
   We saw the hope on people's faces as they saw this cooperation in getting help from everywhere. And although they face a very difficult time, they do have hope. It was the volunteers, of course, our firefighters and our officers, police officers and other first responders, but the volunteers came from all over. Some of them had evacuated their own homes. Some of them lost their own homes. Teachers and others were there to help the children while away the time and even learn while they were there, people who brought food, people who brought clothing and psychological help, massages and medical help. So all of these people were involved. It was an incredible sight to behold as we went to Qualcomm Stadium or any of the evacuation centers around the county. You saw everybody pitching in. It was that coming together in San Diego that will give hope to the people who face challenges in the future and that got us through this very terrifying time. 
   I thank the House for this resolution in support of the people of California.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF UNITED STATES MERCHANT MARINE VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. I thank the chairman not only for his kind words, but for bringing this resolution to us on National Maritime Day, and for his making the connection between what we are doing today and the historical record that we as a Nation, I think, have to recognize and correct. 
   This resolution, H. Res. 413, does recognize the heroic and brave service of the Merchant Marine veterans who have gone unheralded by this country for far too long. Of course, this is the best time to do this, on National Maritime Day, which was first celebrated in  1933. It is intended to recognize the invaluable role that the maritime industry in general and the Merchant Marine in particular served to our Nation's economy and to our security. 
   Throughout our Nation's history, the Merchant Marine has played a crucial part in ensuring our freedom and security during war and in transporting our commerce during peace. 
   This day was conceptualized by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who firmly believed, as we continue to, that the Nation needed a strong Merchant Marine to serve as an auxiliary to our naval and other military forces during war. In fact, the Merchant Marine has participated in every war since serving as the Nation's first Navy, helping George Washington's Continental Army defeat the British. 
   After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 29 Merchant Marine Academy cadets operated a fleet of boats in New York Harbor, transporting the firefighters and other emergency equipment workers and medical supplies. 
   It is interesting to note that the United States Merchant Marine Academy is the only one of our five military academies that will send its cadets into war; and, in fact, we have lost 142 of those cadets since World War II. 
   Today, more than 8,000 merchant mariners serve in the Military Sealift Command, most working in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. 
   I thank my colleague for bringing up the situation of our World War II veterans. As he said, it is too late to give them education benefits. But I have a bill, H.R. 23, that says we want to give you a belated thank you with a payment for the last years of their life, most of whom are over 80 right now. 
   During World War II, these merchant mariners traversed the dangerous U-boat-laden waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific, faced down fierce air attacks from kamikaze planes, and were instrumental in every theater of war by carrying 95 percent of all tank supplies and troops during the Great War. As a result, they suffered, as was pointed out, the highest casualty rate of any of the military branches. 
   It is indisputable that the allied forces would not have been able to begin, sustain, or finish World War II without their valiant and selfless service. 
   When I first heard of the plight of the merchant mariners of World War II, I could not believe the treatment that they have received. They did not receive any recognition as veterans that they deserved, or the benefits of the GI bill which they had earned. And their fight for equality continued for over 40 years, when they finally attained veteran status after a lengthy court battle. By then, over 125,000 of them had died. 
   I actually had the privilege of receiving the heart-wrenching testimony during a hearing before the Veterans' Affairs Committee from one of the named parties in that suit, in the 1980s, a merchant mariner named Stanley Willner. He was captured, interned, beaten, starved, and tortured as a POW for 3 years. He actually was one of the unfortunate group of Allied Forces who was forced to build the infamous bridge on the River Kwai. 
   Upon release, he weighed a mere 74 pounds. When he returned home, even his wife couldn't recognize him. Well, neither did his country. The brave merchant mariner received just 2 weeks of medical care and little else for his incredible service and sacrifice. What a travesty of justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many more stories like this that tell about the merchant mariners of World War II, of opportunities lost and dreams foreclosed. It is long overdue that we treat these veterans the same as we try to do with all other veterans: Do our best to make them whole again. 
   As such, in recognition of the 74th anniversary of National Maritime Day, I invite all of the country and my colleagues to join me in recognizing the brave men and women of the sea who, like the Merchant Marine veterans of World War II, serve selflessly to ensure our Nation's continued safety and prosperity by voting in favor of this resolution, and then taking action, hopefully in a few weeks, where we give a belated ``thank you'' to the merchant mariners of World War II and pass H.R. 23.

   I want to thank all the Congress colleagues from Georgia, especially my Atlanta colleagues Mr. Johnson and Mr. Lewis, and especially the Senator from Georgia, Senator Isakson, for making sure this is on the floor today. 
   The poor state of a lot of the infrastructure of the Veterans Affairs is well-known. 
   Through what we call the CARES process, the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services, the department found that the existing inpatient wards at the Atlanta VA Medical Center are far below community standards. 
   This renovation project will go a long way to address the American with Disabilities Act accessibility requirements, the needs of women veterans, particularly as they relate to privacy issues, and the improvements in efficient functional design. 
   These deficiency corrections are long overdue, and we think they will be met  here. These infrastructure improvements to utility systems will include the plumbing, electrical, fire and safety concerns on the inpatient floors. 
   With the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, it is even more important that the VA is able to provide the best health care available in the most updated and modern facilities. 
   In fiscal year 2005, this project received $20.5 million, and S. 1396 provides the reauthorization of this project to move forward. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Buyer, for his cooperation. I know that he has great respect for the CARES process and would like to consider all of the facilities in one construction bill. We are pledged to do that early next year, but I think this is an obvious need at this moment, and I look forward to working with the ranking member to make sure we meet the needs of VA infrastructure across the whole country, and we intend to work together and do that early next year. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would also thank you for forging this legislation in a bipartisan way which you will hopefully have unanimous support with this Congress. This program we're trying to roll back I think is one of the most dangerous programs this administration has ever tried to put into effect. 
   I represent the entire California-Mexico border. It is my district. I know what happens with these trucks at the border. We haven't dealt with issues of licensing of drivers, we haven't dealt with insurance or safety of the trucks, not even mentioning the jobs that are lost to American truckers. 
   Let me just tell you two things very quickly about what goes on at the border. 
   The Federal Motor Carrier Transportation Administration issues what it calls a tamperproof sticker, a green sticker to say that this truck is safe. I have been in Tijuana and I have seen these windshields which have the tamperproof sticker put on different trucks. So they haven't tampered with the sticker, but they put it on a different truck. 
   I have seen papers that supposedly guarantee insurance of a truck. A company that owns 10 trucks will buy an insurance policy for one truck and pass that paper around to all of the other ones. They're very difficult to distinguish. They pass the muster at the border and they're free, under this program that we're trying to stop, to move around in our Nation without really having any choice. 
   We could go on for hours on this. We have looked at all of these different aspects that the administration just refuses to look at. 
   So, Mr. DeFazio, thank you for bringing this to us. We have got to stop this program. We've got to stop it now and save both jobs and lives of American truckers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important bill that we simply must pass this year because it extends authorities for a whole number of veterans programs. And I want to thank my ranking member, Mr. Buyer of Indiana, for his cooperation and support to get this bill on the floor today because, as I said, we have got to get this done before the end of this congressional session. 
   H.R. 6832 includes the text of several other pieces of legislation; for example, the text of H.R. 5856, the Department of Veterans Medical Facility Authorization and Lease Act of 2008, that we passed on this floor by a vote of 416-0 back in May. As the new fiscal year begins on October 1, it is essential that the VA have the legal authorities it needs to move forward in providing world-class facilities and better access for our veterans. 
   In addition to providing these authorizations, we extend a number of expiring authorities, including the authority to collect from insurance companies and third parties for the cost of certain health care. These provisions were slated to expire at the end of this month. It also extends the VA authority to receive data from the IRS and the Social Security Administration to verify income levels for veterans in certain programs. 
   We extend here also the authority of the VA to conduct recovery audits of fee basis and other medical service contracts when a veteran receives care at a non-VA facility, such as the bill we just passed with Mr. Moran. 
   We make permanent here the VA authority to treat veterans who participated in tests conducted by the Department of Defense at the Deseret Test Center from 1962 to 1973, which included the program known as Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense, or Project SHAD. This authority expired last year. We have to do more for those who have been subject to those tests, and we will look at legislation, especially by Mr. Thompson of California, in the near future. 
   We extend the reporting requirements for the Special Committee on PTSD, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and the Committee on Care of Severely Chronically Mentally Ill Veterans. These committees are vitally important as we seek to provide the best care for our veterans in dealing with these mental health issues. 
   We repeal the sunset on inclusion of noninstitutional extended care services as part of the health care provided to our veterans, and extend the authority of the VA to provide nursing home care for certain veterans, which was also slated to expire at the end of this year. 
   We increase the number of veterans among our most severely disabled veterans who would be able to participate in the VA's Independent Living Program. Long-term care services are a vital component of our health care for veterans, and will only increase in importance in the years ahead. 
   H.R. 6832 also makes permanent the authority of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans and reporting requirements for the Women's Advisory Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have often stressed the importance of the housing provisions in the original GI bill that was enacted in 1944. This act, of which over 8 million veterans took advantage of, probably created the prosperous and stable middle-class in our Nation. We recently passed an update of the GI bill that we called the 21st Century GI Bill, which brought education benefits up to the standards that this century requires, but we did not reform and improve the VA home loan program in that GI bill that would have in fact remained true to the spirit of the original GI bill. The housing crisis that is affecting all of our society in all areas of our country would be helped by broadening authority of the VA in this area. 
   Both my ranking member, Mr. Buyer, and I have introduced legislation to reform the home loan program, and H.R. 6832 brings both of our pieces of legislation together. We were able to provide temporary authority for the VA to make loans at levels that matched other Federal housing programs in an earlier bill this year, but that authority expires at the end of the year and VA will be forced once again to essentially limit its guarantee to a maximum loan amount of $417,000. What we do here is to extend that authority until 2011 to guarantee loan amounts up to $729,750 in certain parts of the country. We also extend the authority of the VA to make so-called hybrid adjustable rate and adjustable rate mortgages in their program, which also expires this year. 
   Finally, H.R. 6832 will make it easier for veterans to refinance their home loans with the VA. We authorize the VA to provide the same maximum loan guarantee for veterans, refinancing non-VA loans, as it currently provides for loans guaranteed by the VA. It will enable veterans to refinance the loan at up to 100 percent of the value of the underlying property. Currently, the VA is only able to finance up to 90 percent. 
   I know that I speak for Mr. Buyer in that we wish we could do more right at this moment to help our veterans weather this housing crisis, but this bill provides real help, and will make a real difference in the lives of thousands of veterans facing the housing crisis and our economic slowdown. It is extremely important that we pass H.R. 6832, and meet our responsibilities to our Nation's veterans. 
   I thank the minority side for its great cooperation on this. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008, and I want to especially thank Congressman Ciro Rodriguez of Texas for his sponsorship of the House bill, which was H.R. 5826. 
   I am pleased that we are here today working with the Senate to get the bill passed. After passage here today, the bill goes directly to the White House for the President's signature, and this will ensure that our veterans will not be delayed in getting their cost-of-living adjustment. 
   Since 1976, Congress has passed a measure to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the rates of basic compensation for disabled veterans and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation, referred to as DIC, to their survivors and dependents, along with other benefits, in order to keep pace with the rising cost of living. 
   This disability COLA would become effective on December 1 of this year and will be equal to that provided on an annual basis to Social Security recipients. It will benefit over 3 million disabled veterans from the World War I era through the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan that VA estimates will be receiving this compensation in FY 09. It will also help over 300,000 of their survivors during the same period. 
   Many of the 3.5 million recipients of these benefits depend upon these tax-free payments not only to provide for their own basic needs, but those of their spouses and their children and often parents as well. Without an annual COLA, these veterans and their families would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly erode. We would be derelict in our duty as a Congress if we failed to guarantee that those who sacrificed so much for this country received benefits and services that keep pace with their necessities. The veterans compensation COLA is included in the CBO baseline, which means in English that we have already paid for this COLA.

   Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleagues and I were able to work together to craft this important piece of legislation regarding our rural veterans. I want to thank the Subcommittee on Health chairman, Mr. Michaud of Maine, and Ranking Member Mr. Miller of Florida for the bipartisan leadership they demonstrated in working on this important bill. And, of course, the leadership on this bill has been for many years Mr. Moran of Kansas. 
   As we all know, many rural veterans face significant challenges accessing veterans' health care services due to their geographical distance from VA facilities and limited transportation services. Some of these veterans must face commutes of several hours just to utilize some simple health care services. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs has acted to better provide health care service to rural veterans, and I appreciate the action they have taken in the past. However, more can and should be done to ensure that our rural veterans have adequate access to care for the services to which they are entitled. 
   This bill, H.R. 1527, would supplement existing VA efforts by requiring the VA to conduct a 3-year demonstration project to allow rural veterans in four Veterans Integrated Service Networks to elect to receive covered services through non-VA providers. It would allow some rural veterans to receive health care locally, eliminating  the frustration and hassle of a lengthy commute to the nearest VA medical center. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1527. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Moran for his leadership over so many years on these issues and I just want to make a couple of points in closing. 
   Next year when we come back, Mr. Moran, I hope that we could even refine what you have done here a little further. You have made a very important leap forward in dealing with our rural veterans, and you have used the mileage as the distinguishing characteristic. 
   In part of my district, for example, in Imperial County, California, our veterans are within probably this 120 miles, and yet it is not just the distance, it is the isolation. There is a mountain between two counties in my district. It is not easy to cross over that. So the mileage is not just the only factor. We have got to get some measure of isolation, I would think. 
   In addition, that county is a very poor county. Many of our veterans do not even have cars. They have to rely on what you so appropriately mentioned, and that is the volunteer efforts of some van drivers. But they are not always there, and they are not always on the day that is needed. So, without cars and being particularly isolated, I think we have to refine that definition of the highly rural veteran. 
   Let me make just one more point. What you have done here, Mr. Moran, is very specifically designate criteria for which people are eligible to go outside the VA system. I think you have done that very appropriately, and we have been fighting for that for many years. 
   The Presidential candidate on the Republican side, Mr. McCain, takes that too many steps further. He has advocated a credit card for every veteran to use in any facility. I think that is the wrong approach. 
   I had the honor over the last month, Mr. Speaker, of going to the national conventions of the Disabled American Veterans, of the American Legion, of the Jewish War Veterans, of the Military Order of the Purple Heart; and I would say unanimously they objected to this so-called credit card for veterans. It supposedly is to increase access, but I think its effect would be to undermine the whole VA health care system. 
   So while we can I think make sure that access is guaranteed for people in some very specific situations, like the bill that Mr. Moran has before us, I think we have to keep the integrity of the VA system by not allowing that credit card proposal of Mr. McCain to go forward. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1527, as amended.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for the bill to name the VA Medical Center in Miami, Florida, after Bruce W. Carter. 
   I have a biography, but I never knew Mr. Carter and I'm sure Ms. Ros-Lehtinen knows him best or knows his record the best.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support of H.R. 4918, a bill to name the VA Medical Center in Miami, Florida, after Bruce W. Carter. 
   For his actions during Operation Idaho Canyon in the Quang Tri Province of the Republic of Vietnam in 1969, PFC Bruce W. Carter was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 1971. The citation reads, in part:  
   Pfc. Carter and his fellow marines were pinned down by vicious crossfire when, with complete disregard for his safety, he stood in full view of the North Vietnamese Army soldiers to deliver a devastating volume of fire at their positions. The accuracy and aggressiveness of his attack caused several enemy casualties and forced the remainder of the soldiers to retreat from the immediate area. Shouting directions to the marines around him, Pfc. Carter then commenced leading them from the path of the rapidly approaching brush fire when he observed a hostile grenade land between him and his companions. Fully aware of the probable consequences of his action but determined to protect the men following him, he unhesitatingly threw himself over the grenade, absorbing the full effects of its detonation with his body. Pfc. Carter's indomitable courage, inspiring initiative and selfless devotion to duty upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.  
   H.R. 4918, which would designate the VA Medical Center in Miami, Florida, as the ``Bruce W. Carter Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' honors the service and sacrifice of this Marine Corps hero.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (MICHAEL BILIRAKIS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SPINAL CORD INJURY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support to name the VA Spinal Cord Injury Center in Tampa, Florida, after our former colleague, Michael Bilirakis, and I thank Mr. Miller for bringing us this important resolution. 
   One of the virtues, I guess--although some people advise against this--of naming a facility after someone who's living and who's a former colleague is that we remember him. It's not a historical kind of moment. We have known Michael for many, many, many years in this House, and his efforts, of course, brought this particular center into being. And it's fitting that we recognize his efforts. 
   But he was responsible for a great many things. His background was in the Air Force where he served for 4 years. He left for the Congress in 1982, served here for 24 years, retired at the end of the last Congress, and we miss his advocacy for veterans. Although, his son, GUS, has taken his place and is a member of our Veterans' Affairs Committee and I'm sure will achieve greatness in terms of his advocacy for veterans, also. 
   I just have to say personally about Mr. Bilirakis, if he is listening. Mike Bilirakis was a little old fashioned. He believed in civility, that, in fact, we should relate to each other as human beings. We could differ on issues, but we have to speak with respect and complete integrity in the way we deal with each other. 
   I will tell you that he was not always happy with some of my statements in my years on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, but he would not just let them go. He came up to me and explained why he thought I should take a different tone.     
   And he convinced me that working with the other party, working together on the committee, in fact, you can achieve much more. He really became the conscience of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I think he made that committee far more civil, and we miss him, of course, today. 
   I admired and watched him for many, many years deal with the issue that not too many people understood, it was called ``concurrent receipt,'' that those who were retirees from our Armed Forces but who also were disabled from their time in the service would get both payments because they earned them both; and yet the law had offset them, and so the disabled veteran was actually paying for his disability. 
   Michael Bilirakis fought tirelessly to get rid of that offset, to have, in fact, concurrent receipt. He was able to achieve his goal for about half of the veterans. We're going to continue his work. And I know Gus is taking the lead to make sure we get full concurrent receipt and really honor him not only in the naming of this center, but in finally achieving that goal for really millions of veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

His work on the Commission for the Future of America's Veterans is important. It's going to be very timely. It's going to be significant. And I hope we all listen to what he says in his new role on that commission. 
   And, Michael, if you're watching, I don't always meet your ideal of civility, but I remember your teaching. I remember your example every day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, we are debating House Resolution 1098, although the ranking member spent all of his time on a bill called S. 1315 which earlier passed the full Senate by a vote of 96-1. Would 96 Senators support a bill that cuts nearly $1 billion in special monthly pension benefits for elderly veterans? No, because that's not what S. 1315 does. And in fact, the leader of the minority party, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, voted in favor of this bill; and he said, I certainly believe that we should compensate not only the thousands and thousands of veterans who get the money from the bill but the Filipinos for their brave service to our Nation. 
   But we are on House Resolution 1098 to honor the Year of the American Veteran. I will tell the Speaker that in the last year and a half of a Democratically led Congress, about $17 billion of new money came into the VA system to help the health care of our veterans. That is real contribution to health care. That is real contribution to mental health that we need to deal with. 
   We have thousands and thousands, even though the Department of Defense refuses to admit it, of young men and women coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan with traumatic brain injury and PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. These require months and months, if not years and years, if not decades, of treatment from a grateful Nation for their service. We have put the money in that will begin to do that job. 
   Of course, our committee has to continue with oversight over bureaucracies that tend to respond rather slowly. But in our Resolution 1098, in our budget which meets the veterans' groups so-called independent budget, which is put together by them, and for the first time in the history of the independent budget for 2 years in a row we exceeded their budget from this Democratic Congress. So the Year of the American Veteran is not just words. It's budget dollars, it's commitment, it's programs, it's support for our brave veterans, like I said, whether from this war or earlier wars. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to unanimously support House Resolution 1098. 
   I would also ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1291, which comes to us courtesy of Mr. Rodriguez from Texas. I just want to point out that what we are doing here is expressing the gratitude for the contributions of the American GI Forum as it celebrates its 60th anniversary. We all know that the GI Bill of 1944 made an immense impact on the lives of returning veterans by guaranteeing educational, medical, housing, and other basic benefits. 
   Though this legislation was groundbreaking, it takes much more than words on paper to ensure that institutional goals are implemented. One man who understood this was Army Major Hector Garcia, who realized that the disparate treatment and denial of benefits to many Hispanic veterans must be ended. To carry out this purpose, he inspired to rally around him a group of fellow veterans who formed the American GI Forum. 
   Their motto is, ``Education is our Freedom and Freedom Should be Everybody's Business.'' The ideals which they stand for, equal education opportunities, equal economic opportunities, equal justice under the law, and equal political opportunities are ingrained in the fabric of American values. Since its inception, branches around the country have reached milestones in veterans' issues, in education, and civil rights. 
   Knowing the effects of unequal treatment, Army Major Garcia devoted himself to standing up for the isolated Hispanic members of our veteran community. We are happy to honor the organization he founded. We look forward to working with them for the common good and welfare of veterans for many years to come. 
   The broad-ranging and comprehensive initiatives which the GI Forum has undertaken over the last 60 years include the cofounding of SER-Jobs for Progress, Incorporated, a top-10 national Hispanic nonprofit organization, and the National Veterans Outreach Program, which is designed to assist military veterans in securing affordable housing and provides counseling and employment assistance services. 
   It is not the years though, however, that the GI Forum has existed, but how much it has accomplished that indicates their impact and why we are honoring them today. Leaders of the forum, from Army Major Garcia, on to the current president, Antonio Gil Morales, have an irrepressible spirit and a dynamic energy, using their benefit for the benefit of others. 
   Today, the GI Forum continues to challenge disparate policies on behalf of Hispanic veterans by challenging barriers and enhancing understanding. For their support of all veterans, specifically Hispanic veterans, and their leadership in being a beacon of hope and an avenue of involvement for returning veterans and ordinary citizens aspiring to improve conditions within their communities, we take the occasion of the 60th anniversary of their founding to recognize the GI Forum with this resolution as evidence of the high esteem in which it's held by all its members. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I would just ask my ranking member from Indiana not to think that any institution in this country, even at a time when we are nominating the first African American of a major political party for President, that discrimination and racism has been cleansed from the American body politic. It exists, it is real, and we have to commit ourselves to continually fighting against it. 
   That is why this resolution is so important. It reminds us of those who took on the struggle when it was so blatant and so urgent. But that struggle is not over, and we have to recommit ourselves to ending racism and discrimination in any form.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This resolution, 1231, supports the goals and ideals of Vietnam Veterans Day. I don't think we have to remind this body that the Vietnam war was a very divisive time in this country. One of the lessons that we should draw from Vietnam is that although we may disagree about a war, as we do about the current one in Iraq, we must never, never disagree about the importance of honoring the service and sacrifice of the men and women who serve our Nation. We must never confuse the war with the warrior. We must never, never forget the warrior. 
   This war that we are engaging in Iraq is only exceeded in its length by America in the Vietnamese war, the longest conflict in our history. More than 3 million Americans served in southeast Asia. More than 58,000 Americans lost their lives on the battlefield. Over 300,000 Americans were wounded, and that was at the time of the war itself. We know because we did not honor these heroes when they came home and we did not have the resources in place, especially with regard to mental health, that we inflicted a terrible, terrible future on many of those soldiers. 
   Half of the homeless on the street tonight are Vietnam veterans. We think that there are more suicides by Vietnam veterans than who died on the original battlefield. That's a terrible, terrible blot on America for not honoring our veterans. And certainly we cannot make the same mistake again with those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   So we have a Vietnam memorial. We must always remember the service and sacrifices. A day of remembrance is a particularly fitting way to remember the painful lessons learned. But we could do some more material things, too, and I hope that the cooperation and goodwill shown by my ranking member at all times will make sure that we up the budget, for example, to deal with the homeless veterans on the street--most of them are Vietnam veterans--that we grant their Agent Orange claims that they have fought for for decades, that we provide some security for them and increase the budget that is aimed at their future as citizens in this Nation. 
   So yes, let us pass this resolution. But let us move on in the context of the budget and in the context of other legislation to really honor these warriors who, when they came home, did not get that honor. 
   I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support of H.R. 2245, a bill to name the VA Outpatient Clinic in Wenatchee, Washington, after Elwood ``Bud'' Link. 
   Mr. Link, along with his comrades from the Cashmere Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1045, was the driving force in getting a VA clinic built in North Central Washington. A veteran of World War II, Link worked tirelessly to bring accessible health care to his rural community. 
   And according to the Northwest Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, ``Bud may not be the highest ranking veteran in the community or the one with the most medals. But if you ask us, no one stood taller than him in the veteran community and naming the [clinic] after him will inspire us all to greater heights.'' 
   In a newspaper article on the opening of the clinic, Mr. Link's widow stated that the message of Link's work for veterans was ``if you want to get something done, get a group behind you and go for it.'' Mr. Link did just that, and today, the veterans of rural Washington have a veterans' health care facility. 
   So today we not only honor the work of Elwood ``Bud'' Link, we also, in a very real sense, recognize the efforts of all of our veterans who work tirelessly day after day to ensure that their comrades get the health care benefits that they earned in service to our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, everywhere I go across the Nation I find leaders like Bud Link who don't just care about their own benefits, their own next appointment with the VA, but all the veterans, and they work in their community to make sure that we as a Congress respond to those needs. And I hope that we continue to respond to them. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

I want to thank Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey, who offers this resolution, and it will recognize our Nation's veterans for their sacrifice to our country. 
   Currently, brave men and women who are fighting in missions throughout the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan, do not have an exact avenue to let us know what has occurred or let us know how to appreciate or spread that appreciation to others in our society. This resolution will provide an avenue to educate our children about the sacrifice our servicemembers and their families are making. 
   Veterans Educate Today's Students Day will designate November 10 as VETS Day that would call for teachers, civic leaders, and veterans to carry out programs to educate children about the service of our Nation's veterans and their sacrifice. VETS Day is a day students can be taught to appreciate that because of our Nation's veterans we are able to enjoy the many freedoms that we take for granted. VETS Day should be the day we highlight veterans' service, American freedoms and pass on to our children our American ideals. This is why I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of H. Con.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As we approach Veterans Day in another week, it is important that we, as Members of the House, not just give our speeches and ride in the parades on Veterans Day but we actually do things that will help our veterans, say thank you for their service, and make sure they get the benefits that are due them when they return home, and that they also avoid pitfalls that come about because they are serving their Nation abroad. There are many examples of this, and we are going to correct a few today. 
   The first and most important, I think, is to assure that when our service men and women are abroad, when they are in active duty, that they do not face credit problems as a result of that duty if they miss some payments on bills back home. Our colleague, Mr. Brady from Philadelphia, chairman also of our House Administration Committee, has looked at this problem and has come up with a solution.  
   Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 513, as amended. 
   I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Congressman Robert Brady of Pennsylvania, for crafting this important bill to help protect our Nations veterans. I'd also like to thank the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity Chairwoman, STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN, and Ranking Member JOHN BOOZMAN for the strong bipartisan leadership they demonstrated in working on this legislation. 
   When called to duty, servicemembers across our Nation leave their loved ones, school, and work behind. 
   Unfortunately as we are witnessing today, some of these servicemembers are returning to letters of delinquency from credit lenders and credit bureaus due to their extended military service abroad. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must honor our servicemembers' sacrifice by providing them with the resources and financial security needed to protect what they have left behind, so that they may have the peace of mind that their financial interests are protected while serving our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, a credit score impacts all aspects of your life. It represents you as a consumer and indicates to the potential lender if you are trustworthy of repaying your debt. It also determines whether you will qualify for a good interest for a home loan, buying a car, or even school loans. 
   H.R. 513, as amended, would protect these men and women while they are at war, by providing an explanation in their credit report. This explanation would be generated by a consumer reporting agency, and delivered in conjunction with a consumer report or credit score. 
   It will indicate in the consumer report, or credit score, that the consumer was adversely affected during a period in which the servicemember was on active duty outside the continental United States in support of a contingency operation.  
   To qualify, a person would have to be a member of the National Guard or Reserve, have the account open prior to deployment, and served a specifying period of service of no less than 180 days. By including a military service deployment explanation, any person who requests the credit score or consumer report of the servicemember will be informed of a potential reason of non-payment or missed payments. 
   Currently, there is no credit protection offered to the men and women in the National Guard and Reserve. 
   Furthermore, this legislation alleviates the servicemembers' concerns over negative financial implications of their deployment. 
   Regardless of your view on the war, we all stand united in caring for our veterans. I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 513, as amended.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady) to explain how this bill will help our active duty forces when they return home.

   Mr. Speaker, this war in Iraq has involved our National Guard and Reserve units to an extent that has never before been the case. And many of our laws simply do not reflect the new force structure that you see in Iraq. And that is what we, as a committee, are working to change. For example, the National Guard and Reserve units, even if they are in active duty, as they are in Iraq, are not eligible for the same benefits from the GI Bill as our active duty troops. We are going to change that. We are going to change a number of things. And I thank Mr. Brady, the gentleman from Philadelphia, for making sure that the Guard and Reserve groups have the protections in law that our active duty troops already have. We must protect their jobs, their credit ratings, and their quality of life as they are away from home in active duty supporting our Nation. 
   The laws have not kept up with this force structure. This is one of the ways that we're going to change that. So we're going to make sure that when they come home, they are recognized and not penalized for their active duty.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of this legislation, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Porter), who will speak on his resolution in a few minutes. 
   I want to point out that Abraham Lincoln, during his address at Gettysburg, said that ``the world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' In that spirit, and to make sure that people will long remember what was done, Congress created the Veterans History Project in the year 2000 with unanimous support from this body. 
   The Project directed the Library of Congress to establish a national archives for the collection and preservation of videotaped oral histories of our veterans, as well as the copying of letters written during their time of service and diaries they kept. So there is a national repository of this very important part of our Nation's history. This worthwhile investment of time and resources is a gift that can be given for generations and centuries to come. The goal of the project is to capture the personal stories of our Nation's heroes so our children and their children can more fully understand the history of this century. 
   For a lot of reasons, we find that our Nation's heroes, when they come back from combat, do not even let their families know exactly what happened. They feel like they were just doing their job or don't want to bring up some memories, and so those stories will go with them to their grave. But with this project, we can tap into the stories of more than 24 million veterans who are still alive today, including 3 million from World War II, who are leaving us at the rate of more than 1,000 per day. 
   It is important that these stories are told, and more important that these stories are told from the mouths of those that were on the front lines and participated firsthand as history was made. 
   This oral history project requires the cooperation of volunteers across the country to get not only the veterans to come forward to offer their stories, but also the family members and friends to capture their accounts. 
   So, H. Res. 770 calls on the people of the United States to interview at least one veteran in their families or communities according to guidelines provided by the Veterans History Project. It also encourages local, State and national organizations to participate in support of the effort to document, preserve and honor the service of American wartime heroes. 
   As chairman of the Veterans' Committee in the House of Representatives, I have had the opportunity and the honor to hear the many accounts from these veterans. I hear the sense of pride that comes along with the duty of defending this country. I know that my father served in World War II, but I never fully got the stories, I don't think, that he had in his memory, and I wish we had captured before he died. 
   So, I encourage all Americans to reach out to their veterans, thank them and their families for their amazing sacrifice, learn more about their great contributions to our Nation, and gain the wisdom of their personal stories of our Nation's history. Each and every one of us should learn more about the American Folk Life Center at the Library of Congress because their staff is always glad to work with researchers and volunteers to expand their library of these stories. 
   Volunteers and participants become historians themselves. They can collect audio and video recordings, create a collection of recordings to be available for public use, or collect written materials relevant to personal histories of war veterans. 
   So, on this Veterans Day, let us, again, do more than just give speeches and ride in parades. Let's join and take the time to show the gratitude that we have to these veterans by asking them to relate their stories for the preservation of history. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution to recognize our Native American veterans who have served and continue to serve this Nation with honor and with pride. I represent a county in California, San Diego, that has one of the largest numbers of Native American tribes in our Nation, and I have heard many of their stories. We know that Native Americans have participated with distinction in U.S. military actions for more than 200 years. Their courage, determination, and fighting spirit are well documented throughout our history. 
   It is well recognized, also, that Native Americans have the highest record of service per capita when compared to other ethnic groups. Presently, there are almost 200,000 Native American military veterans alive today. At least 18,000 of the 22,000 Native Americans currently in uniform have been deployed at least once to Iraq or Afghanistan as of July of this year. 
   Native Americans who volunteer for military service aspire to uphold their proud cultural tradition. This warrior tradition is a willingness to engage the enemy in battle. This characteristic has been clearly demonstrated by the courageous deeds of our Native Americans in combat. Five Native Americans have been among those soldiers who distinguished themselves by receiving the military's highest award, the Medal of Honor. This medal is given for military heroism ``above and beyond the call of duty.'' These warriors exhibited extraordinary bravery in the face of the enemy and, in two cases, made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. 
   This House, led by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, had the enormous privilege of naming two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in honor of these heroes just last June. Charles George was a member of the Cherokee tribe from North Carolina and private first class in Korea when he was killed on November 30 of 1952. During battle, George threw himself upon a grenade and smothered it with his body. In doing so, he sacrificed his own life, but saved the lives of his comrades.     
   Ernest Childers was a member of the Creek Tribe from Oklahoma and a First Lieutenant with the 45th Infantry Division. He received a Medal of Honor for heroic action in 1943 when, up against machine gun fire, he and eight men charged the enemy. Although suffering a broken foot in this assault, Childers ordered covering fire and advanced up the hill, single-handedly killing the snipers, silencing two machine gun nests, and capturing an enemy mortar observer. 
   The warrior tradition is exemplified by strength, honor, pride, devotion and wisdom. These qualities are a perfect fit with our Nation's proud military traditions. 
   I urge the people of our Nation, I urge the Members of this Congress, to make sure we have a day honoring our proud and brave Native American veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill comes to us from our colleague from Chicago, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and this would repeal the law that requires the termination of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans on December 31 of 2009. We cannot let this important committee vanish. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, over 14 percent of veterans are from racial or ethnic minority groups. African Americans comprise about 10 percent. The rest are Hispanic, Asian, or Native American. However, the Census Bureau projects that the number of minority Americans will shift significantly in the future and will grow to about 35 percent of the total population by 2050. Undoubtedly, that will be reflected in the percentage of people of color in the military, which is already steadily on the rise. 
   This trend has been true for black women who are joining the military at a greater rate than they are represented in the overall population and in a greater ratio than their male counterparts. In fact, black women comprise almost 35 percent of female servicemembers. This pattern will affect the VA's mission and scope, and it must be prepared to respond to properly deliver benefits. 
   Congress developed the Center for Minority Veterans and the Advisory Committee in 1994 to advise VA and Congress on providing health care and delivering benefits to minority veterans because there were disparities in such service. We had hoped to improve VA practices for future generations of minority veterans. This center has issued an annual report since 1994, and it's mandated to focus specific attention on African American, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and Pacific Islanders, which it has done by conducting town hall meetings and site visits to such places as inner city Los Angeles and Native American tribes in Alaska. 
   The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs has explored these disparities and has been greatly assisted by the Committee on Minority Veterans. Its recommendations regarding outreach, research, education, staff diversity, translation services, and housing have been extremely enlightening and have resulted in many improvements. 
   At the present time, the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans is due to sunset in 2009. This bill would prevent this from occurring and would serve to bring permanent awareness to cultural, racial, and ethnic issues among veterans to Congress and VA leadership. 
   I urge this Congress to support the bill and allow the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to continue its work uninterrupted and fully supported. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Let me just say in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that I think it's safe to say that for every single Member of this House, when they have town meetings with veterans, the single biggest complaint is the disability claims system. They've been waiting months, years even--decades--for decisions. This is an insult to their service. We have a long way to go in changing that. This bill is a big step toward erasing that incredible backlog. This situation is the biggest single factor that leads veterans to think that ``VA'' means veterans' adversary instead of veterans' advocate. So we have to change it. It is going to be changed as rapidly as we can, and I encourage all Members to support this bill.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. I want to thank Mr. Boozman, and he included parts of a bill from Ms. Herseth Sandlin and from Mr. Welch from Vermont, another new Member who has been a great participant in our deliberations.  
   I would like to thank my distinguished colleague, Ranking Member John Boozman in the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, for his bipartisan efforts in crafting H.R. 6221, as amended, Improving Veterans' Opportunities in Education and Business Act. 
   I also want to thank Subcommittee Chairwoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Congressman Peter Welch for introducing language included in this important legislation. 
   Many of our veterans today are currently transitioning into the workforce or continuing their studies in higher education. 
   Some of our disabled veterans own small businesses, while others are receiving training to pursue other careers. Our veterans deserve to receive the necessary resources to succeed in life after the military. We must work together to ensure that our Nation's heroes are equipped and provided the training they need for their future careers. 
   H.R. 6221 would clarify a provision in current law that was intended to assist veterans in the Federal procurement process. This provision has been interpreted by the VA General Counsel that it does not apply to agents acting on behalf of the VA. H.R. 6221 would clarify congressional intent and require any entity that purchases goods and services on behalf of the VA to comply with the contracting goals and preferences for small businesses owned or controlled by veterans. 
   Language introduced by Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota would authorize $10 million for VA to conduct a 5-year pilot program to expand the veterans' campus work study program. 
   Eligible work-study may include positions in academic departments and student services, such as jobs in tutoring, research, career services, and campus orientation. 
   Language was introduced by Representative Peter Welch of Vermont to authorize $60 million for the next 10 years to fund the Service Members' Occupational Conversion and Training Act, commonly called SMOCTA. 
   SMOCTA is a successful training program that was instituted in the early 1990's and targeted to servicemembers leaving military service with few or no job skills to transition to the civilian marketplace. 
   The program assists veterans in obtaining meaningful employment after their military service and is a timely program that would greatly assist today's returning veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must honor our men and women who dutifully serve our Nation. 
   We must serve our disabled veteran small business owners and students with opportunities to succeed, and fund successful programs that develop job skills needed in today's workforce. Our servicemembers deserve the proper training and provisions that ensure a seamless transition into civilian life. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 6221, as amended.  
   Since this bill is authored by Mr. Boozman, I will reserve the balance of my time to allow him to explain it.

   Mr. FILNER. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, all of us have been to hospitals, we have been to homes where we have seen disabled veterans, whether from the current war or previous wars. We all know that a major factor in their recovery, especially mentally, is a sense of self-worth, a sense that they have a future, a sense that although they have problems physically, they can overcome that and be productive members of our society. 
   For many of those veterans who were athletes or who were participating in athletics, the opportunity to participate again competitively is one of the most meaningful things they can have in their recovery. And what this program will do, the Paralympic Program, is give both disabled active duty and veterans, the opportunity to compete, to train, and to have that comradeship with fellow athletes, and to show that they are indeed human beings who can participate in this society. That is a major, major part of the healing process. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this.

   Mr. FILNER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We have a number of bills on the floor today, all of which will go to improving both the health and the benefits of our veterans, to whom we owe so  much. The bill on the floor now comes to us from Mr. Cazayoux of Louisiana, one of our newest Members, but who has already taken an active role on the Veterans' Committee. In addition, the bill includes elements of bills from Mr. Doyle of Pennsylvania, Mr. Walz from Minnesota, Mr. Buyer from Indiana, and Mr. Hare from Illinois, and addresses a number of policies in the VA which directly affect our Nation's veterans. 
   Within the care the VA gives, there is a small population of veterans who suffer from nonservice-connected but catastrophically disabling injuries. These veterans are stuck in an extreme paradox. They have injuries so severe that it prevents them from maintaining employment and causes them to utilize many more health services than other veterans. Yet, because of the nonservice-connected nature of their injuries, they are forced to bare the burden of copayments, which many of them are ill-equipped to pay. This bill will eliminate the injustice by prohibiting the VA from collecting copayments from this particularly vulnerable population of veterans. 
   The bill also addresses VA's ability to provide counseling, training, or mental health services to family members of veterans who are seeking treatment for nonservice-connected disabilities. Currently, VA is unable to provide these essential family support services unless the veteran is an inpatient and these services are needed for his or her discharge. 
   The policy is out of date and is a remnant from the days when the VA was primarily an inpatient system. This bill removes those restrictive requirements and will allow the VA to provide those services to families in need. This is particularly important for our newest generation of veterans, many of whom are struggling with PTSD and depression. 
   Section 4 of this bill addresses an issue that many veterans face on a daily basis. It is a battle against chronic and acute pain. The pain lingers long after the physical wounds of war have healed and affects the quality of life of many veterans. Although the VA has worked on a national pain management strategy, its implementation remains uneven across our system. This bill will require the VA to develop and implement a systemwide policy on pain management. We thank Mr. Walz from Minnesota for bringing this to us. 
   The VA is also currently authorized to collect third-party payments from veterans' insurance companies, but due to ineffective procedures, over a billion dollars go uncollected annually. This is money the VA can reuse for providing medical services to veterans. To address this issue, the VA began a demonstration project of a Consolidated Patient Accounting Center in 2005, and has some success in improving revenue collections. In Section 5 of this bill, we require the VA to establish no more than seven other CPACs, (Consolidated Pain Accounting Centers) to enable it to improve its billing performance. 
   This service, Mr. Speaker, has been outsourced for the last 5 or 6 years on a sole-source contract. I would urge the VA right now, on the floor, I am urging them in letters and, if necessary, legislation, to open that bidding process to a wider variety of contractors, many of whom have systems to save almost a billion and a half dollars per year, that is not collected for the VA. That money would go directly back to the services of our veterans. 
   The VA is also the largest provider of HIV/AIDS care in the United States, but its policies regarding HIV testing are based on best practices that date back to the 1980s. The CDC revised their HIV testing guidance in 2006. It now recommends that HIV testing be a part of routine clinical care and that separate written consent for HIV screening should no longer be required. 
   Section 6 of the bill brings the VA care in this area up to current standards of practice and provides VA the flexibility to update their screening standards in the future without congressional intervention. 
   Every provision of this bill, we believe, will improve the quality of health care of our veterans. It comes to us on a unanimous basis from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. I thank the Speaker, and I want to thank my distinguished colleague, the chairwoman of our Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Ms. Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota, for her bipartisan leadership in crafting this bill, Improving Servicemen's Civil Relief Act and USERRA Protections Act of 2008, to help protect our Nation's veterans. Congresswoman Susan Davis from my hometown of San Diego, Congressman Patrick Murphy who will be heard from soon from Pennsylvania, and Congressman John Carter from Texas also introduced language that is part of this legislation. 
   When they are called to duty, our servicemembers across the Nation leave their loved ones, they leave school, they leave work behind. Unfortunately, as we have many examples today, some of these servicemembers find difficulty in spite of presumed law to get back their old job, to get back into their housing or their enrollment at an institute of higher education. We have to make sure that all these men and women who are called up for service who do their duty don't have to face these difficulties which many thought were protected in law. We must honor their sacrifice by providing them with adequate protections so that they may have peace of mind that their interests and their families' interests are protected while serving our Nation. 
   This bill will protect these men and women by encouraging courts to use their full equity powers, including temporary or permanent injunctions, temporary restraining orders, and contempt orders, to protect the rights and benefits of these veterans. This section would amend title 38 by changing the ``may'' word to ``shall.'' 
   Language that was authored by Congresswoman Susan Davis of California requires institutions of higher education to refund tuition for servicemembers who have not received academic credit, or allow servicemembers the opportunity to reenroll in the same academic status prior to their military service. The language also places a cap on the interest of student loans at 6 percent while the student is fulfilling military service. 
   As we will hear, language was included by our new member, Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania, to allow servicemembers to terminate or suspend service contracts such as cell phone, housing, or utility contracts, due to a permanent station of change of station or deployment orders. And Congressman Carter of Texas included the allowance of the spouse of an active duty member to maintain the same State of residency as the servicemember for State taxation, and to allow the spouse to claim the same State as the servicemember in regards to State and property taxes, and voter registration. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must honor our men and women who dutifully serve our Nation. When they leave home, they should not have to worry about receiving a negative academic status, paying for a service which they cannot use, or paying taxes in a State for this which they don't claim. They should be afforded the rights and benefits that they honorably are fighting for. I urge my colleagues to support the bill to protect these servicemembers and veterans. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1642) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that, to the extent possible, an enhanced-use lease for a homeless housing project at the Department of Veterans Affairs facility known as the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center, located in North Hills, California, shall provide that such housing project shall be maintained as a sober living facility for veterans only, and for other purposes.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2642. We all know that homelessness among veterans is a pervasive problem. Estimates are that there are 20,000 to 30,000 homeless veterans in the Los Angeles area alone and more than 200,000 probably on the streets of our entire Nation. Many of these homeless veterans also have substance abuse problems. 
   My colleague and friend, Congressman Brad Sherman, has worked with veterans in the San Fernando Valley community to mobilize community support for veterans-only housing, a project that will use two buildings at the VA Sepulveda complex to provide housing and supportive services for homeless veterans with substance abuse problems. 
   The bill before you will ensure that the Sepulveda veterans facilities and resources are used for veterans only. It also provides that all qualified housing organizations receive the opportunity to compete for the homeless veterans housing project at Sepulveda. Most importantly, this bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that, to the extent possible, an enhanced use lease for a homeless housing project at Sepulveda shall be maintained as a sober living facility for veterans only with adequate staffing and security. 
   Additionally, this bill will ensure that all qualified housing organizations receive the opportunity to present competing proposals to the VA for a  homeless veterans project at the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California. 
   Mr. Speaker, two worthy and good nonprofit organizations, New Directions, Incorporated, and their partner, A Community of Friends, made a proposal to local VA administrators and local elected officials and community representatives to enter into this lease with the VA for a veterans-only housing project for recovering substance abusers that would in fact be alcohol-free and would have adequate staffing and security. All the parties that were brought together by Mr. Sherman agreed to these commitments. 
   But just last summer, the nonprofits abandoned that proposal and sought enhanced-use lease to deliver a project that was substantially different than what everyone had agreed to earlier. They took these steps after discovering additional funding sources through Housing and Urban Development that it believes might be available for this project if it opens these facilities to residency by non-veterans and allows the use of alcohol. 
   Mr. Speaker, how can you begin to help homeless veterans who are trying to get their lives together, trying to recover from addictions to drugs and alcohol, but putting them in a facility that allows the very thing from which they are trying to recover? It does not make any sense. 
   This bill does not stop the Secretary of the VA from entering into a lease, but it does ensure that the Secretary conduct a diligent search to find a qualified organization with the experience, efficiency and funding sources to deliver a veterans-only, sober living facility and to enter into a lease with the organization best suited to deliver the projects. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1642. I also ask for their continued support for our Nation's veterans. This bill is the least we can do to help ensure our homeless and recovering veterans have an environment that allows them to reach their goal, clean and sober. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the concerns that the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite) raised. I think the concern should be directed to the VA Secretary who, if he had asked for a competition on proposals, wouldn't be negotiating with just one group. 
   I personally have talked to groups that say they would offer proposals which would guarantee all veterans and would guarantee sober living, and we are convinced it would not take 2 years, but could be done rather quickly. 
   I think Congressman Sherman can answer with much greater expertise and I would yield to him such time as he may consume.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Chairman, as the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I rise in strong support of the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act; and I yield to myself what time I might consume. 
   I want to thank Congressman Skelton and Congressman HUNTER. This is a great bill. As a Nation and as a Congress, we were faced with a test, a real challenge, whether we can respond to the conditions of our Nation and of our veterans and our active duty troops. The revelations of what happened at Walter Reed presented us that challenge, gave us that test, and I say with confidence that this Congress is meeting that test. 
   This is step two in meeting that test. Step one was to make sure we had sufficient resources in the budget of this Nation to meet the needs not only of our existing veterans who have more and more need, whether they are from World War II or Vietnam or the first Persian Gulf war or the great influx of veterans that we are going to have from Iraq and Afghanistan. We already have over 700,000 returning troops who are now veterans, and we are going to get hundreds of thousands more. 
   In the so-called continuing resolution that was passed by this Congress a few weeks ago, the Veterans Administration was the only agency that got a significant increase from last year's budget; and this Congress added $3.6 billion to veterans in that one continuing resolution. 
   The supplemental for war that passed this House last week, led by Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Skelton, Chairman Obey, and Chairman Edwards, we said that the supplemental for war has to also have a supplemental for the warrior--for the health care of our returning veterans. Both in the Defense Department and the VA, we put in almost $3.5 billion; and in the budget resolution that we will be considering today and voting on tomorrow, the Democrats have put in $6.6 billion above the 2007 levels. That, in 90 days, is over $13.5 billion added to last year's budget for the care of our veterans. 
   George Washington said it very clearly, that the morale of our active duty troops is dependent on the sense of how they are going to be treated when they come home. 
   The first step of infusion of money, the second step of the Wounded Warrior Assistance bill, says that we are going to meet the challenge, that we understand that the costs of caring for our veterans is part of the cost of war, and that no matter what we think about the war in Iraq, we are united in this Congress and in this Nation that every returning young man and woman gets all the care and love and respect and honor that this Nation can deliver. That is what this bill says, that we are all committed to making sure that the care of these veterans is first in our consciousness. 
   Both the Defense health care system and the VA system is stretched to its limits. We have underfunded it over the years. We are asking from very dedicated professionals in the VA system to do more and more with less and less resources. 
   The strain is evident wherever you look. The strain is evident at Walter Reed. The strain is evident when a young Marine shows up at a VA hospital in Minnesota and says, I think I have PTSD and I am having thoughts of suicide, and he was told that you are 28th on the waiting list, come back in a few weeks or a few months, and he went home and he committed suicide. The strain on our system is shown by events like that, and we are committed to making sure that they do not continue. 
   So we have to live up to our responsibilities, both for the returning Iraqi and Afghanistan veterans and to those who have served our Nation going back to World War II. 
   In many instances, the problems are exacerbated because of jurisdictional and procedure roadblocks between the Defense and the Veterans Administration. So we have to remove those roadblocks; and, as chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I have worked closely with other members of our committee who will speak today, with Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter of the Committee on Armed Services, to make sure we are working off the same page. 
   This legislation takes important steps in making the servicemember's transition from the Department of Defense to the VA a seamless transition. We have been using that word for a long time, but we still have great cracks in that system. It is not seamless, but this bill would mandate the Department of Defense to provide disabled servicemembers who are being separated or returned from the Armed Forces with a written transition plan, a road map pointing the way to programs and benefits offered to them as veterans. 
   It would institute a formal process for transmitting reports and other information to the Veterans Administration from the active duty situation. 
   It would require both the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration to establish a joint separation and evaluation physical.     
   Physicals now are done by two different agencies and with two different standards and with two different bureaucracies. It is sometimes a hellish situation for returning active duty troops. We have to have a fully interoperable medical information system so that two agencies can speak to one another, so that the veteran coming home will have on his record in the VA all the things that occurred to him when he was on active duty in the military. 
   If we are going to make the handoff in the continuum of care successful, if we are going to make sure there is a seamless transition, if we want to make sure that we don't fumble information that puts at risk the returning servicemembers, we have to take these steps. These steps have are not newly invented. They were first expressed in earlier reports, the President's Task Force, for example, to Improve Health care for our Nation's Veterans, talked about this transition. I hope we are providing both departments with the resources and the tools they need to get that transition right. 
   Mr. Chairman, our concern is for the health of our fighting men and women when they come home that they get that health care taken care of, both in the Defense Department hospitals and in the VA system. Let's work seamlessly. I urge support for H.R. 1538. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As I said earlier, Mr. Chairman, we have a test as a Nation. Are we going to make sure that every returning young man and woman from Iraq and Afghanistan has the best facilities, the best health care, the best treatment, the best love, the best commitment that we, as a Nation, can offer? And are we going to make sure that their predecessors, from World War II to the present, are also given that same care and commitment?  
   There are 200,000 homeless vets on the street tonight, mainly from the Vietnam era. We cannot allow that to continue. 
   We have a 600,000 claim backlog for disability payments. We cannot allow that to continue. 
   We have facilities that need to be repaired and rebuilt. We have needs for Agent Orange veterans and atomic veterans. We, as a Nation, must take up this challenge and must meet it. 
   We had significant new resources provided in the budget matters that have come before us in the last 60 days. This Wounded Warrior Assistance Act is the next step as we try to make sure that those who faced danger and life-threatening situations in Iraq do not have to face a bureaucracy which threatens to kill them off. This is a step to change that. We are going to have a seamless transition, and I thank the Chair for his commitment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of this resolution. 
   Let me just say, as Chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee of this House of Representatives, no matter where we stand on this war, no matter where we vote on this resolution, we are going to make sure that the brave young men and women who come home get all the care and all the support they need from a grateful Nation. We will show what support of the troops means when they do come home. 
   Now, those who voted for the war back in 2002 are sometimes asked, Knowing then what you know now, how would you have voted? 
   Well, Madam Speaker, we knew then what we know now, and we know now what you are going to know a year or two from now. 
   Let me read to you what I said 4 1/2 years ago when we had the debate on Iraq: ``I rise in opposition to this resolution to grant unilateral authority to the President. I cannot believe that the Members of this body are ceding our constitutional authority to this President. And they can give me all the fancy whereases and phrases and put all the fig leafs and write all the report language they want, but this is a blank check. This is a Gulf of Tonkin resolution. This is a violation not only of our Constitution but will lead to a violation of the U.N. charter. 
   ``Wake up, my colleagues. Why would anyone vote to do that? That is not our constitutional responsibility. And when we vote on this resolution, will America be safer? No, I think America will be less safe. We will dilute the war against terrorism. The destabilization of the area will lead to the increased probability of terrorists getting nuclear weapons. Al Qaeda is probably cheering the passage of this resolution. Now is their chance to get more weapons.'' I said that then. 
   Then we talked about the imminent threat. You guys threw the imminent threat at us. What a lie. And what are you saying now? We are emboldening our enemies and demoralizing our troops. I heard the word ``sabotage.'' I heard the word ``retreat.'' 
   I will tell you what demoralizes our troops, my colleagues. What demoralizes our troops will be the failure to provide adequate health care when they get home. What demoralizes our troops is the story of just a couple weeks ago when a young marine went to a VA hospital in Minnesota suffering from PTSD, and they said, You have got to go on a waiting list. And this young man committed suicide. That is what demoralizes our troops. That is what we have to prevent here, and that is what we are working on to do. 
   I said back in 2002: ``I have heard all my colleagues on the other side calling us appeasers, those who are going to vote against this resolution. We are  wishful thinkers. We have our eyes closed. We sit on our hands.'' And, of course, now we want to cut and run. 
   Well, I tell you, Madam Speaker, no one on this side is suggesting cutting and running. Making peace is hard work. Just ask Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Ask Gandhi. Ask Nelson Mandela. They didn't cut and run. They were peacemakers. And they changed the history of this world. 
   So let us not hear talk of retreat and sabotage and surrender. We want action for peace. We want it now, and we want the United States to be part of that action. 
   I said also in 2002, Madam Speaker: ``There is a whiff of Vietnam in the air. I had a constituent call me and say, `You know, if you enjoyed Vietnam, you are really going to love Iraq.' The mail is running 10-1 against this war. Protests have already begun around the Nation and around the world.'' 
   I said to the President then that ``you came to the office as a uniter, not a divider. Yet we have gone down the road to division in this Nation. You can see it. You can smell it. You can hear it. And we are going to get more. 
   ``So let us not go further down that road, Mr. President. Rethink this policy. A country divided over war is not a country that is going to make any progress. Let us have a rethinking of this war.'' 
   That is what I said in 2002. You guys didn't want to listen to us then. The President didn't want to listen to us then. You really should listen to us now and listen to the people of America who voted in 2006 to change this policy. 
   Let us respond to the American people. Let us vote against escalation. Let us begin to bring the troops home. Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.

   Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are considering two bills. This first one, S. 2162, as amended, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008, and the next one is going to be about the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. These are two bills which passed the Senate, and is an omnibus bill that includes legislation from the Senate and from the House. 
   Many of our Members have legislation in this bill. And they are two bills that are really going to be great for veterans, greatly enhance the benefit in both the health field and on the benefit field. 
   As we have discussed these bills, we have learned much about the needs of our Nation's veterans, and this bill goes a long way to address them. Rates for post traumatic stress disorder, for example, amongst Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans has been estimated to be higher than 30 percent. Additionally, as we have tragically learned, suicide is on the rise. The Army reports, in fact, rates as high as they were during the Vietnam War. And the rate of homelessness among this cohort is also tragically growing. We must act now to address these issues before it's too late. 
   We know from past wars that some veterans will struggle with substance abuse, homelessness, and PTSD. And we can see the same patterns emerging as a result of the stress of repeated deployments to OEF and OIF. 
   This bill expands and improves the health care services available to veterans fighting substance use disorders and requires that all VA medical centers provide veterans access to the full continuum of care for substance use disorders. 
   I would like to recognize both the leadership of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Michaud, and Ms. Berkley for their strong advocacy for veterans who suffer with substance use disorder and for their contributions to this very important provision in the bill. 
   As a way to honor the memory of Justin Bailey, a brave veteran that we lost to the horrors of war, this bill would ensure that the VA conduct more research about the often tragic relationship between PTSD and substance use disorders. The bill allows  community mental health centers in rural areas to work with the VA to provide peer outreach and support services as well as readjustment and mental health services. 
   We now know that PTSD not only affects the veteran, but also has a profound effect on their family. Thanks to the leadership of Mr. Hare from Illinois, this bill makes necessary changes to the law to allow the VA to provide needed counseling to families of veterans. 
   In addition to addressing the mental health challenges facing our veterans, many also experience homelessness. While the VA continues to be the largest provider of direct services to homeless veterans, we must ensure that it remains postured to assist the growing number of homeless veterans and veterans at risk for homelessness. To this end, the bill increases the authorization for homeless programs to $150 million. 
   It also expands and extends a valuable joint VA and Department of Labor program of referral and counseling services, ensures that the VA domiciliary program is capable of meeting the needs of the growing female population, and provides necessary support to low-income veteran families that have made the transition to permanent housing. I want to thank Mr. Murphy and Ms. Herseth Sandlin for their focus on this issue and ensuring that these provisions are in the bill. 
   Aside from mental health and homelessness, many veterans struggle to cope with chronic and acute pain. This pain lingers long after the physical wounds of war have healed and affects the quality of life of many veterans. Thanks to Mr. Walz of Minnesota's leadership, this bill would require the VA to develop and implement a system-wide policy on pain management.

   Madam Speaker, I want to say to Congressman Buyer, the ranking member, and really all the Members on both the Republican and Democrat side of this committee, we have had some ups and downs in this year, but these two bills that we are doing today are great bills. I think we, and I say ``we'' meaning all of us, have a great deal to be proud of. We are going to touch millions of veterans with these bills, millions, and their families, and we are doing it on behalf of people that we know deserve no less. 
   We have traveled around the country. We have met thousands of veterans in different States. I think both of us get more and more impressed with both the newer veterans and the older veterans and what they have accomplished and how they have carried out their lives. So we are very proud to have worked together to produce these bills.

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, obviously we rise in strong support of S. 3023, as amended, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. Just by the listing of the title of the bill, you see how wide ranging this legislation is. 
   We have, Madam Speaker, 24 million veterans in this country, over 2.5 million of which receive disability compensation benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Upon filing a claim for disability compensation at the VA, our veterans and their dependents face increased waiting times, along with an increasingly adversarial claims processing system. 
   From 2002 up until 2007, the backlog of disability claims rose from 250,000 to nearly 650,000 claims pending. That is an insult to the veterans who have served this Nation. During the same period, the VA consistently missed its performance targets on nearly all compensation and pension claims processing fronts. 
   These problems are not new. General Omar Bradley, who was a Director of the Veterans Administration after World War II, in the mid-50s said in a comprehensive report that ``the dominant problems are the carryover from past decades of a backward-looking pension philosophy and our failure to adjust the existing veterans programs to fundamental changes in our society.'' 
   This quote is pretty striking, because the same thing could be said of the claims processing system 50 years later. 
   After nearly 2 years of oversight hearings, informed by numerous reports examining these issues, the committee, led by our colleague John Hall of New York, who chairs the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, set out to transform this broken and outdated system. He introduced and our House subsequently passed the Veterans Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act of 2008, H.R. 5892, which would comprehensively modernize VA's claim processing system. This legislation is the cornerstone of this Senate bill, S. 3023. 
   Mr. Hall's efforts included contributions from our colleagues from the committee. Joe Donnelly of Indiana introduced the Immediate Benefits for Wounded Warriors Act of 2007, H.R. 4219; Congressman Space of Ohio introduced the Veterans Disability Fairness Act, H.R. 5709; and Congressman Hare of Illinois ensured that mental health was an issue that was captured in language throughout the bill. All of these Members, Madam Speaker, are new Members of our Congress, and they have taken a vigorous and active role in their work, as illustrated in this bill. 
   Congressman Gutierrez from Illinois and Congresswoman Corrine Brown from Florida introduced H.R. 674, which alerted us not to let the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans sunset. And Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter, another new Member from New Hampshire, has led the charge to spare families from VA debt collection. 
   So this bill will arm the VA with a lasting blueprint to transform its  claims processing system using integrated and modern information technology platforms and an updated rating schedule, with tools to improve the accountability, timeliness and quality of adjudicated claims. It will establish an Office of Survivors Assistance, and at last allow survivors to step into the shoes of deceased veterans to pursue pending claims and appeals. 
   Madam Speaker, we will finally tackle the central issues that have led to an unmanageable claims backlog, delays in processing, avoidable errors, inconsistencies in ratings and lack of accountability in a system that amounts to a ``system of injustice'' for our veterans. 
   This bill will help modernize the VA claims processing system and assist it in becoming a 21st century, world-class entity that reflects the selfless and priceless sacrifices of those it serves, our veterans, their families and survivors.     
   I would point out a pilot program that we will start on disability claims that takes as a model--and it may be surprising to say this, Madam Speaker--the IRS, our Internal Revenue Service, which for many years was very dysfunctional, but now, if you file your claim for a tax refund, you will get a check in 3 weeks because they send out the check on receipt of your tax return, but it's subject to audit. 
   So why not take that same process if your claim is documented fully and if you have help from a Certified Veteran Service Officer? There are thousands around the country. We will send out the check upon receipt, subject to audit. I think that's the way to clean up the backlog and to say to our veterans, yes, we understand your needs, and we are going to meet them. 
   In addition, Madam Speaker, I was contacted by veterans who are concerned that the VA does not have enough slots for veterans to participate in its so-called Independent Living Program. That program allows injured veterans to obtain meaningful employment, and it allows them to live independently while they heal from their wounds. So we have introduced a bill to allow 100 Independent Living Program slots to be available. I'm proud that this language was included in legislation that will ensure that the services needed by our veterans are available when they're required. 
   Madam Speaker, when we passed the so-called 21st century GI Bill some months ago, that was a great improvement in the educational benefits for our younger veterans, especially for those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Starting the next school year, they'll be able to draw on those new benefits, but we are trying to model that GI Bill on the GI Bill of 1944, which had so much influence on making America's middle class. 
   Part of that bill of 1944 had a home loan guaranty program. I'm here because of that program. My dad was able, after he came back from the war, to buy a house in New York for $2,000. We were finally members of the middle class. 
   We didn't include that part in that GI Bill, but we include it here. We are going to raise the values for veterans' loans. We are going to raise the value at which a refinance can take place. We are going to reduce the fees and the equity requirements, and will make the VA home loan program, again, relevant to veterans today, especially to those who are experiencing a crisis right now. They will be able to go to the VA and get a good deal on refinancing their home loans, a deal they couldn't have gotten before this passed. So I think this will be, again, a great benefit for thousands of our veterans around the country. 
   We also have a provision in this bill by Representative Ciro Rodriguez, who is a distinguished member of our committee, to update housing construction and design guidelines furnished to contractors. He will talk about that in a few minutes. 
   Again, I want to make special mention of the cooperation of my ranking member, Mr. Buyer of Indiana. What we did in working together was to provide legislation, that I'm sure he will talk about, to give VA assistance to the Paralympics program, which has been so successful in assisting veterans and servicemembers in their rehabilitation efforts. That language is in here. Through this program, we give a sense of self-worth and a sense of confidence to veterans who are severely injured. 
   Mr. Buyer has a special interest in that. In fact, if we're not in session next week, I think he's going to visit part of that program that's being carried out in California. He's going to my district. He doesn't realize what kind of welcome we have ready for him, but we'll leave that to his imagination. It's going to strengthen our commitment to caring for the servicemembers by helping them heal from the wounds of war so they can be active members and have the confidence to do that. 
   We also have language similar to that introduced by Congressman PATRICK MURPHY of Pennsylvania that will extend Servicemembers Civil Relief Act protections to enable servicemembers with deployment orders to more easily terminate or to suspend cell phone contracts without fee or penalty. It sounds like a little thing, but it's big in the lives of young people who have to face deployment. We're trying to tackle not only the big things but also these little irritants that affect our active duty and our veterans. 
   Congressman Boozman from Arkansas worked on legislation that closes the loophole in the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program. We clarify our intent by extending disabled veterans' small business contracting provisions to the maximum extent possible to cover agents purchasing goods and services on behalf of the VA. 
   On the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Chairwoman STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN and her ranking member, Mr. Boozman, introduced a bill, which is also included in this legislation, to authorize the VA's Secretary to advertise in national media outlets to make sure that veterans are informed of their benefits. 
   So you see, Madam Speaker, we have some very big things and some smaller things, but again, in working together, our committee was able to significantly affect the quality of life for our 25 million veterans in this country. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, when Mr. Hall from New York arrived as a new Member last year and got thrown into looking at the VA disability claims system, he resolved that this had to be fixed. Two-years' worth of work is reflected in this bill. A big chunk of the bill comes from Mr. Hall. 
   We are so proud of the work you've been able to do, and we look forward to its helping millions and millions of veterans. Thank you. I would recognize Mr. Hall for as much time as he may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (MEDAL OF HONOR SPECIAL PENSION INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6980) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the amount of the Medal of Honor special pension provided under that title by up to $1,000. 
   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. FILNER. (MEDAL OF HONOR SPECIAL PENSION INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. FILNER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my support of H.R. 6980, a bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the amount of the Medal of Honor special pension provided under that title by up to $1,000. 
   It is with great satisfaction that I stand before you today, to further honor our military heroes who have already received our Nation's highest recognition and praise--those who have been awarded the Medal of Honor. With this bill, we honor those heroes with our financial support, because they were willing to defend our country with their lives. 
   The Medal of Honor is the nation's highest award for bravery and military valor that can be bestowed upon any servicemember in the military. It is presented by the President of the United States in the name of Congress. 
   The Medal of Honor was established by a joint resolution of Congress in 1862 and was first presented during the Civil War. It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself ``..... conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States .....'' Because of its nature, awards of the medal are frequently made posthumously. 
   The Medal of Honor confers special privileges on those who receive it, both by tradition and by law. By tradition, all other soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen--even higher-ranking officers up to the President of the United States--who are not also recipients of the Medal of Honor, must salute the recipient. 
   By law each recipient of the Medal may have their name placed on the Medal of Honor Roll. Each person whose name appears on the Medal of Honor Roll is certified by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as being entitled to receive a special pension. 
   The current rate of that pension is just over $1,100 monthly ..... less than $14,000 annually. I believe, and I think every other American will back me in this, that we have to do better in honoring our heroes. 
   H.R. 6980 will increase the rate of the special pension for recipients of the Medal of Honor by up to $1,000. I believe that we should do more ..... but I recognize that this is the best we can do now! 
   Madam Speaker, yesterday we passed a bill for a one time payment to Filipino Veterans of World War II that I don't believe went far enough. Today, we'll pass this bill in support of our Nation's highest decorated heroes ..... and sadly ..... it too won't go far enough. 
   As we, as a Congress and as a Nation, focus on our veterans, particularly our newest veterans from OEF and OIF, we must also remember and never forget our heroes of previous wars. We owe to them all a debt of gratitude, and certainly to those who earned our Nation's highest honor every financial benefit we can bestow. 
   Today, by passing H.R. 6980, we once again recognize our military heroes, this time with financial support, and we tell them that we will never forget their bravery. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge the support of all my colleagues.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.
