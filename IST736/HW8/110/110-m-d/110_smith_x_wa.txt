<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Washington. (EXTENDING TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I will be yielding to the chairman to ask a question to get a clarification on one point. But, first of all, I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue, and I do want to agree with Representative Brady's comments. 
   I think trade is very, very important. It has a very positive impact on the economy in this country. We need to work to improve these trade agreements. But what we try to do with Trade Adjustment Assistance is try to help displaced workers. 
   I have long been troubled by the fact that it's called Trade Adjustment Assistance. I think it should just be called ``adjustment assistance,'' because regardless of where your job goes, it creates a problem that needs to be filled. In fact, many jobs are lost in this country to advancements in technology. Frequently jobs are lost from one part of this country to another part of the country, and those people who have lost those jobs are no more impacted than if we develop a competitive disadvantage with a country and they start taking over some jobs in an area that we used to occupy. In both instances workers need help and we need a broad adjustment program to do that. 
   I am, however, troubled, as Mr. Levin pointed out, by the regulations that the administration tried to adopt that would pare back the program and, to some degree, limit the ability of displaced workers to get adjustment assistance.  
   As we have heard from all economists, skills are going to be the critical factor from this point forward in having an employable workforce in this country. We have got to give our workforce access to greater training, greater technology, and more repetitive training. Sorry, that's the wrong way to put it. They have to update their skills more often. Gone pretty much are the days when you could simply have a high school education, find a job with a company that was going to be around forever, and you were set. If we are going to have an economy where change is more rapid, we have to help our workers in this country. 
   As the gentleman knows, I am a strong supporter of trade agreements, frequently berated by many in my own party for that, but I don't see that as the piece that is causing the problems for our workers. The piece I see is causing the problem for our workers is we have not made enough changes to reflect the rapid change that is facing them. We don't give them enough opportunities to retrain, update their skills for the changes they have to deal with. We don't have adequate health care protection for them when they lose their job as well. These are things that the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act tries to take care of and that I am concerned that those regulations that the administration tried to adopt would undermine. So I am very grateful to have that language in there. 
   And this is where, if Mr. Levin could just clarify on one point, and I think in our colloquy here we have two questions, but it is really only one. I just want to be clear that the legislation that we are considering today is simply an extension of the existing program, it is not the reauthorization of the program, so that the prohibition contained in the February 2007 continuing resolution on the implementation of the flawed rules that we have referenced remains in effect even if we pass this bill. Is that correct?

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. I want to thank you for that clarification and appreciate your work on this issue. I think it is critical that we pass it so that we can move forward and continue Trade Adjustment Assistance. 
   Equally critical, as you know, Mr. Chairman, I have been working with you and Chairman Rangel and many others on expanding Trade Adjustment Assistance so that more workers can benefit from it. I know right now we are working on a bill with a variety of different ideas. I think it is critical that we do that full-scale reauthorization and that we expand the bill so that it better protects workers, protects more workers, and makes sure that workers in this country can benefit from the new economy so that we don't have to have these constant wars over trade agreements, so that we can focus on taking advantage of the economic opportunities that are there in today's economy by making sure that the workers who are most vulnerable, who need greater skills, have help so that they too can begin to benefit from the economy. 
   I appreciate your work on this issue. I look forward to working with you. I know in the next few weeks we will be introducing a bill and we will be moving forward on a broader reauthorization. 
   I simply urge the body to support this short-term extension in the meantime.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Representative Campbell for bringing this issue to the floor. 
   It has long been my view that the United Nations can be, and in many cases is, a very, very useful organization. It gives the countries of the world a chance to come together in one place and discuss issues that they can work together on but, perhaps as importantly, to discuss their differences. It was set up so that, hopefully, that process would reduce more violent conflict, that they could discuss these issues, figure out a way to work together, and move forward. 
   I also feel that it is a very appropriate role of the United Nations to look throughout the world and see where injustice is being done, identify it, and try to fix it. 
   Unfortunately, too many times that becomes politicized and focused, and in particular it becomes politicized and focused on the nation of Israel. With all of the problems that are going on throughout the world, all of the countries, all the despotic governments out there causing no ends of grief for their people, the one country that the United Nations continues to focus on is a free democracy in the Middle East, Israel. And they continually focus on them to the exclusion, in many cases, of far, far greater problems in other parts of the world. 
   Now, certainly I recognize the United Nations should be involved in the Middle East. There is unquestionably a conflict there between Israel and their neighbors in the Palestinian territories. Resolving that difference and helping the Palestinian people to set up their own country that will protect its people is incredibly important. But, again, unfortunately, the focus of the U.N. seems more to criticize and attack Israel to the exclusion of other problems. 
   So I want to thank Mr. Campbell for bringing this resolution, which very simply asks, I guess, the United Nations to stop doing that, to stop focusing on Israel, and to have a broader focus on the problems of the world and do not unfairly criticize the nation of Israel. It undermines, rather than helps, any effort to resolve the conflicts in the Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1302) to require the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to further the United States foreign policy objective of promoting the reduction of global poverty, the elimination of extreme global poverty, and the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of reducing by one-half the proportion of people worldwide, between 1990 and 2015, who live on less than $1 per day, as amended.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Washington. (GLOBAL POVERTY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of the Global Poverty Act, and want to explain first what the bill does and then why it is so important. It declares the official U.S. policy to promote the reduction of global poverty, the elimination of extreme global poverty, and the achievement of the U.N. Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme poverty  in half by 2015. It requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out this policy. It includes guidelines for what the strategy should include, from aid, trade and debt relief, to working with the international community, businesses and NGOs to ensuring environmental sustainability. 
   It also requires that the President's strategy include specific and measurable goals, efforts to be undertaken, benchmarks and time tables. And, lastly, it requires that the President report back to Congress biannually on the progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy. 
   There are nearly 2.7 billion people in the world who are living on less than $2 a day. There are close to a billion who are living on less than a dollar a day. Arguably, there is no greater problem facing the globe right now than poverty and the vast number of people who suffer from it, the countries and communities who, every day, get up, simply wondering whether or not they and their children are going to live to see the end of that day. It causes instability, disease, and all kinds of problems from one end of the globe to the other. 
   But the other thing that is simply immoral is that there are this many people on that level of despair and on that level of poverty. And we in the United States have the power to at least try to help, and we are, in many, many ways. 
   I actually want to thank the President for the Millennium Challenge accounts, an effort to try to make sure that countries not just get foreign aid but use it wisely; the efforts to fund prevention of AIDS in Africa. The PEPFAR effort that's been going on for a number of years is a significant step forward. 
   We also have a large number of organizations and groups that are trying to combat global poverty. We have the world coming together in many ways as it never has before to try to combat this menace. 
   As mentioned, the U.N. set out their millennial development goals. The G8 set global poverty as its prime purpose a couple years ago. We have groups like the Gates Foundation and Results and Bread for the World and a large number of other organizations that are combating global poverty from every conceivable angle. And they are learning a lot as they do. They are learning what works, what moves forward, what doesn't work, what the best way to spend money is. 
   We are in the position, I believe, to consolidate those resources to get the maximum return on our effort to reduce global poverty. And I feel that the United States of America should be, not just a leader, but the leader in this effort. 
   And we have, as I mentioned, done a lot. But the one thing we haven't done is stated clearly and unequivocally that eliminating global poverty, or at least reducing it, is going to be a foremost goal of our foreign policy; and we have not implemented a comprehensive plan. It's great that there are so many different organizations working at this problem from a variety of different angles; but if we could bring that together, we could get more out of those resources. And I think the United States should coordinate that effort. 
   I want to thank a large number of people for helping make this happen. Certainly Chairman TOM LANTOS has been a tremendous leader on these issues and has been very helpful in this particular piece of legislation, as has the ranking member, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, and the Republicans on the committee. This is a bipartisan effort. I want to thank Representative Bachus, who I believe is going to speak, he and I were the original two sponsors on this bill, stepped up and helped. 
   I think this is something that we can come together on, and I think it is very, very important that the United States takes this leadership role. I believe if we do so we will be able to better combat global poverty, and I also think we will be better able to build alliances throughout the world and let the world know that the United States wants to use its power for the betterment of the entire world, not just ourselves. And we're willing to work with them on this problem that affects so many different countries throughout the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank and again appreciate the efforts of my Republican colleagues and agree with their comments. A comprehensive strategy is what we are looking for here, and that is certainly trade, efforts at economic development, capacity-building to help countries figure out how to better use trade, microcredit. There are a lot of different strategies out there that can be employed. Certainly aid and debt relief are part of it but not the only part. In fact, the better part is when you can figure out how to make the economies work, how to make the governments work in these countries so that they can begin to develop their own economies and grow and lift themselves out of poverty in that manner. That is more sustainable and more long term. I personally believe that aid and debt relief will continue to be a significant part of the strategy for a while, but certainly the goal is also to be as comprehensive as possible and employ economic means to help lift people out of poverty as well. 
   I also think the other exciting thing about all this is the possibility of public-private partnerships, and I do not envision personally that the Federal Government or any federal government will wind up being the sole or even necessarily the leading organization in terms of driving the dollars out. We have a large number of groups, in my own neck of the woods, the Gates Foundation to the tune of over $30 billion, that are pumping money into a variety of different ideas to help alleviate global poverty. Nongovernmental organizations are making an enormous difference, and I would hope that the strategy would reflect that public-private partnership to maximize those resources. 
   And, lastly, I just want to agree with what Representative Bachus said at the close there about how this does impact all of us. Instability leads to all manner of problems in the world, and poverty leads to instability more quickly than anything else. It is in our best interests to try to alleviate that instability and bring greater fairness, justice, and economic opportunities to the world. And I sincerely believe that this bill will have that effect, and I urge all Members of the body to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

We here in the House of Representatives want to express our sympathy and support for all the peoples in those regions that were impacted. We want to thank all those who have responded to the emergency with aid and various other efforts to help them and recognize the efforts of the United States in particular to do that and that we pledge to continue that help in any way we can as they try to recover from these terrible tragedies. 
   We in the U.S. know only too well the impacts of hurricanes and want to be as helpful as we can to our neighbors in helping them get through this very difficult time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   My amendment is very simple and straightforward. It encourages collaboration between Amtrak and local and regional commuter rail agencies on train schedules and routing in shared corridors. There are competing needs for some of these uses, and cooperation between Amtrak and others is critically important to take most advantage of our rail corridors. 
   Across the Nation there are multiple commuter rail transit agencies that run on the same rails as Amtrak. Many of these public transportation services have made substantial investments in the tracks and signal capacity on a rail corridor to enhance commuter rail service. 
   Currently, Amtrak has first right to schedule their services, which can often result in delays to commuter rail passengers and have negative impacts on the on-time performance of the commuter rails. Amtrak must work with commuter rail in a collaborative manner and in coordination with the host railroad to best facilitate an efficient flow of intercity Amtrak commuter rail passengers. 
   In the Puget Sound region in particular, Sound Transit has worked closely with BNSF and made a tremendous investment in the rail corridor throughout the Puget Sound region, investing more than $1 billion of public funding in the freight corridor between Tacoma and Everett, Washington. These investments represent a high price that has been paid by the region to ensure that commuter rail did not impact the freight rail operations that drive our region's economy. These investments benefit light rail, Amtrak, and of course Sound Transit's commuter rail passengers, as well as our freight rail. 
   This amendment does not change Amtrak's priority in setting these, it merely asks that they work cooperatively with the other parties that are interested in using these rail systems to maximize their capacity. There are a number of folks who want to make investments in improving those rail systems, and if Amtrak works cooperatively with them, those investments will work out better for all concerned. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the leadership in both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Armed Services Committee for their efforts to make Afghanistan a top priority and to focus on our challenges there. They've done a fabulous job. 
   I recently returned, during the last break, from a visit to Afghanistan. I am very optimistic about what's going on there but at the same time mindful of the effort that it's going to require in the years ahead to continue to succeed, and I believe this bill reflects an understanding of that required effort. 
   The Afghan people are on our side. They support the presence of the NATO troops to support the Karzai government. They do not want the Taliban to return, and they will fight them and appreciate our help in doing this. 
   I'm also very impressed with the job our military and the military of the NATO alliance is doing there. We have some of the most talented folks in our military there doing a fabulous job of fighting the Taliban. But as we go forward, there are remaining challenges, significant challenges. 
   Number one, we have to maintain the military presence. In fact, I believe we need more troops and further support to train the Afghan army and to fight off the Taliban as they try to resurge  in the south and throughout the country. 
   But overarching all of this is the economic challenge. That is the enormous challenge in Afghanistan. It is a country that has never had the best economy, and it has also faced 30 years of civil war. Their infrastructure is destroyed and needs to be rebuilt. Their ability to govern has also been significantly reduced and needs to be rebuilt. 
   The Karzai government has the support of the people, but the people also want infrastructure. They want electricity, and they want jobs. They want alternatives to the poppies, alternatives to that as a way of making their living, and we have to give them a long-term commitment to show them that we will help. We need that long-term financial commitment that is contained in this bill to get them to believe that their economy will be strong again. We need to reward their faith in the Karzai government, their faith in our ability to defeat the Taliban and to build a better future for Afghanistan; and this bill does that. 
   So, again, I thank the chairman. I want to thank the ranking member as well for putting together this piece of legislation and ask all Members of Congress to understand this is a long-term commitment in Afghanistan.

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a U.S. Army brigade from Fort Lewis, Washington, that has served with distinction in Iraq. 
   On October 11, the last of the roughly 3,800 men and women of the 3rd Brigade-2nd Infantry Division returned home to Fort Lewis after completing their second deployment to Iraq. The Arrowhead Brigade has been a trailblazer for the Army as the first brigade to be outfitted with the Stryker combat vehicles, the first Stryker Brigade to serve in Iraq, and now the first Stryker Brigade to complete two tours in Iraq. 
   During their recent deployment, the Arrowhead Brigade supported operations in Mosul, Baghdad, Baqubah, and other critical areas. On several occasions they were asked to secure downed U.S. aircraft and the sites of numerous suicide attacks. In addition, the Arrowhead Brigade constantly remained prepared to mobilize and deploy anywhere in Iraq for any number of contingencies within 24 hours. 
   In tribute to their brave service, seven members of the brigade were awarded the Silver Star, the United States' third highest award for combat valor. In the course of their deployment, the Arrowhead Brigade lost 48 of their comrades, with another 700 wounded. 
   I want to express my deep condolences to the 3-2 Brigade and the families of those fallen soldiers. Their contribution and sacrifice will not be forgotten. The men and women of the 3-2 Brigade have done everything their country has asked of them and more. We all should have the utmost respect and admiration for their service and sacrifice.

   By June 30 of this month, the last of the, roughly, 4,000 men and women of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division will have returned home to Fort Lewis after completing a 15-month deployment in Iraq. The Dragoon Raiders, as the Brigade is known, deployed in Iraq in April 2007, a month earlier than expected. 
   During their deployment, the 4-2 supported operations in Baghdad, Baghdad's Northern Security Belt, and the Diyala Province. The Brigade cleared 2,216 IEDs from more than 87,000 kilometers of routes, ensuring safe travel for civilians and security forces. Soldiers from the 4-2 also captured more than 1,700 detainees and 220 high-value targets during combat operations. 
   In tribute to their brave service, three members of the Brigade were awarded the Silver Star, the United States' third highest award for combat valor. Their valorous service was not without cost, however. In the course of their deployment, the Dragoon Raiders lost 54 of their comrades, with another 424 wounded.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Washington. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, in this debate tonight, it's almost like we're having two conversations. There's the conversation about the trade agreement and there is the conversation about larger economic issues, from environment to jobs to a whole lot of other issues. 
   On the Peru Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Rangel and the Ways and Means Committee have done a great job of putting together a good agreement. It negotiates a reduction in tariffs and nontariff barriers to help us economically, and they've also added in labor protection, which we never got. I voted personally against CAFTA because they hadn't been included. As Mr. Davis just said, those agreements are exactly what those of us in the Democratic side of the aisle have been asking for for a long time. 
   But the issues that are raised tonight are about the economic challenges in this country, about jobs lost and transitions. And I totally agree with the people who raised those issues, that those are important issues and incredibly difficult challenges for middle-class workers in this country and for the working poor that we have not addressed. 
   Where I disagree with them is the convenient take of simply blaming trade agreements for that. Trade agreements simply reduce tariffs and nontariff barriers so that the cost of doing business goes down. 
   Now, if we have made any mistake on the pro-trade side of the aisle, it's overselling that. It's presenting it as a panacea that will grow the economy and benefit everyone and cause no pain. They can't solve that problem. The trade agreement can't solve all of the challenges that are presented for poor workers throughout the world. It's a step forward. 
   We have lost jobs in this country because of global competition and technology primarily, not because of trade. The rest of the world stepped up and decided to participate in the economy. China, the former Soviet Union, countries that were never there before, now they're there. They're competing and we're losing jobs. 
   But it is a mistake both to blame trade and to not focus on the issues that could actually help: health care, a fairer tax policy, issues I know that the chairman is working on, issues that would actually help workers in this country instead of laying it all at the feet of the Peru Free Trade Agreement, an agreement that simply reduces tariff and nontariff barriers to free up the flow of goods and help grow the economy. 
   It's a good agreement, and we should support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work on this legislation. 
   I strongly support expanding trade adjustment assistance for a very simple reason. Workers in our country need help. 
   We all acknowledge that the economy has changed. And one of the main features of that change is rapid displacement of workers. They have to update their skill. They have to change jobs. It used to be you could get a job for a company that you knew was going to be there and a job that you knew was going to be there, and everybody acknowledges that has changed, primarily because of global competition and because of technology. 
   So this bill asks one very simple question: Do you think the workers of this country need help in this new environment with all of that rapid change, with all of the displacement that we have heard about from both sides of the aisle today? Do the workers in this country need more help to deal with that? Do they need a bridge between jobs, income support? And do they need training to help them be qualified for new jobs that will be available? And do they need health care support since so many people in this country's health care is dependent upon their jobs? 
   The answer to all of those questions is obviously yes. That is what this bill does. It expands the number of people who will have access to that desperately needed help. It gives our workers a chance. 
   We all know that the new economy in globalization is here to stay. We acknowledge that. But what we on this side of the aisle want to do is help our workers deal with that instead of just saying, Good luck. It's changed. You're going to be displaced. We hope it works out for you. Overall, we'll be fine.  
   We focus on those workers who need help, and this bill gives them more help. It expands the service sector workers, and it expands the number of displaced workers in this country who will get that income support, that job training, and that health care that they so desperately need. 
   I strongly urge support for this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Washington. (COMMENDING THE PEOPLE OF WASHINGTON FOR SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT FOR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 790 and to acknowledge the dedication and support provided to Washington State veterans by the Veterans Family Fund and the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   As someone who is privileged to represent thousands of veterans and their families, I believe that we owe the men and women who have served our country an enormous amount of gratitude and respect. 
   People who have never served in uniform frequently ask me how they as individuals can support veterans beyond simply displaying a flag on Veterans' Day. Today, I am proud to say that the Veterans Family Fund, in coordination with the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs, has provided a way for all citizens to directly show their support for our veterans year-round, and provide financial assistance to those veterans and their families who need a bit of extra support. 
   The program is simple, and requires only a modest financial commitment. When taking out a ``Veterans Family Fund'' Certificate of Deposit for at least 6 months, individuals pledge that half of the interest earned by the certificate will be donated to benefit veterans and their families, while the investor receives the other half of the interest, and a tax deduction for their contribution. The contributions are managed and disbursed to veterans and their families who are in need by the Veterans Innovations Program, operated by the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   The Veterans Family Fund is an independent organization founded by local citizens to help all Washington State veterans. I would like to take a moment to specifically acknowledge the members of the Veterans Family Fund Steering Committee, who made this program possible: Jane Jacobsen, Executive Director, Confluence Project; Michael C. Worthy, CEO, Bank of Clark County; Robert Friedenwald, Colonel (retired), U.S. Army; Betsy Henning, Principal, Alling Henning Associates; and John Lee, Director, Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   I encourage other States to look at the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Veterans Family Fund, as a model of creativity and innovation in providing support for our veterans at the local level. I commend their work and ask my colleagues to support the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, since the United States Air Force was established as an independent branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in 1947, it has played a major role in our national defense. Throughout its 60 years of valiant service, from Operation Rolling Thunder over the skies of Southeast Asia, to Operations Northern and Southern Watch in Iraq, the men and women of the United States Air Force and Air National Guard have defended the United States and our allies around the world. 
   Since 1947, the men and women stationed at McChord Air Force Base in Washington state have played a key role in supporting the mission of the Air Force, and I want to acknowledge their outstanding service. 
   ``Team McChord,'' which includes the 62nd Airlift Wing, and its Air Force Reserve components in the 446th Airlift Wing, has flown continuous combat airlift operations every day since October 2001. These operations provide vital airlift and medical evacuation support to our forces as they fight to stop the spread of terrorism and as they respond to other contingencies. In addition to being the home of combat airlift, ``Team McChord'' includes the Western Air Defense Sector, the 22nd Special Tactics Squadron, and the 262nd Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron. Together, day in and day out, these brave men and women actively support vital military operations around the world. 
   Today, we recognize the continued dedication of the United States Air Force. I congratulate them on 60 years of invaluable service to our county.

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment and want to point particular attention to the amendment that was offered by me and Mr. Thornberry on strategic communications. 
   Put simply, this is our effort to convey our message in the battle against violent extremism. And what we have discovered on our subcommittee is there are a lot of different pieces at the DOD and Department of State and elsewhere who are working on strategic communications issues, but none of it is coordinated. So our amendment asks for DOD and the administration to bring together and give us a coordinated plan for how to do strategic communications to make sure that our message, our counter-radicalization message, is coordinated and at its most effective. 
   I think this is an important amendment, and I thank the chairman for including it in the en bloc and urge the support of the body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As Mrs. Drake pointed out, we are honoring the 20th anniversary of the forming of the command on special forces, and I think it is important to remember why Special Operations Command was set up. It was in reaction to the failure of the Desert One rescue attempt of the Iranian hostages, and there were a lot of lessons learned from that and a lot of studies that went into it. 
   Two of the biggest ones were, one, we needed a better joint structure. The military was too divided in its various service components, and they did not work together. We had large numbers of assets that could function a lot better if they could be brought together in a coordinated fashion, and this is something that was embodied in the Goldwater-Nichols changes throughout the services and especially on the Special Ops Command to try to bring those forces together. 
   Secondly, we didn't really have groups that were trained for that type of mission, for the ability to go in and rescue hostages, to do the direct action missions that required very specialized training. So the command was formed to help address those two issues and has been a fabulous success.  
   As Mrs. Drake pointed out, we now have over 53,000 people who are part of Special Operations Command performing some of the most important tasks in our military and performing them very, very well. Our capabilities have been enormously enhanced because of the Special Operations Command. There are many of them stationed throughout the U.S. and throughout the world. I am very proud at Fort Lewis and in McCord to have the first special forces group at Fort Lewis and the 22nd Special Tactics Aviation Command at McCord. And I have also had the opportunity to visit many of these units in various places throughout the country and throughout the world, and they are serving us very, very well. 
   As we move forward, I think the important thing we are trying to develop on the Terrorism Subcommittee on Armed Services is to bring into play another important piece of what the special operations forces do. There is a tendency to think of them as the direct action guys. They find bad guys and take them out. If we have hostages that need to be rescued, they go get them. But there is another very important task that they perform, and this is in the unconventional warfare, indirect action piece. 
   We are now active in well over a dozen countries throughout the world where our special forces folks go into the community, work very closely with local communities to help stop insurgencies before they take root. We are doing this in the Philippines, and we are doing this in Central Africa. And it is having enormous benefits. 
   It is far, far better to get in early, help train the locals in terms of how to protect themselves and then to help them with their local population on the issues that are most important. 
   We had testimony yesterday from a former special operations person who said when they first went into Northern Africa, the best thing they did was they brought a dentist with them. The locals so desperately needed that help; when we gave it to them, they then helped us deal with the insurgency problem. 
   Whether it is bad schools or bad water supply, our special forces people are getting engaged with the local community, understanding the culture and learning the language and becoming helpful. That, I believe, is the future of our battle against al Qaeda and many, many other insurgent movements, is to get the population on our side, hearts and minds before we have to engage in the type of military action that is by definition messy and not always as focused as we would like it to be. Let's get the insurgency stopped before it starts, and that is what our special forces can do and are very well trained to do. 
   To move forward with this, to continue moving forward on the mission, I think we need to do two things: One, we need to grow the force, never sacrificing quality for the sake of quantity, but to grow the force and to set up the training system necessary and the recruitment system necessary. We are going to need more special operations forces in the wars we are now fighting. 
   The second thing is to get that emphasis on indirect action. We will, I believe, need to make some restructuring within the Special Operations Command to get that emphasis on indirect action because for so long the emphasis has primarily been on direct action. 
   So those are issues that we want to work on. I am very pleased to join with Congresswoman Drake in honoring our Special Operations Command on the 20th anniversary of their existence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume just to say one quick thing. 
   The bipartisan agreement on our support for the Special Operations Command and the support for the mission I think is something that would surprise a great many people and something we need to focus on. 
   And I want to thank Mr. Thornberry, Mr. Saxton, Mrs. Drake, Mr. Kline, the subcommittee that is focused on this issue. We are very much in the same place on what we need to do to be ready to combat the threat we face from al Qaeda and other insurgent groups, and I think it speaks very well of the committee, both the subcommittee and the broader committee, that there is such bipartisan agreement on how to approach this fight. I think a lot of times the national focus is on where we disagree as parties when, in fact, there is an enormous amount of agreement on critical pieces of how we need to proceed with this. So I appreciate Mrs. Drake's bringing this resolution to the floor so we can talk about that, and I look forward to working with her and all the members of the committee in a bipartisan fashion to move forward on these issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to work with Representative Drake to mark the 20th anniversary of founding of the Special Operations Command. 
   Congress established SOCOM on April 16, 1987 in response to the failure of the Desert One mission to rescue American hostages in Iran. We learned two main lessons from Desert One. First, we needed a better joint command structure; our military was too divided and did not work well together, due to a lack of interoperable equipment and a lack of familiarity and joint training among the various branches. Second, we lacked forces trained for these kinds of missions. The establishment of SOCOM was meant to address these shortcomings. 
   SOCOM has been a fabulous success. We have roughly 53,000 special operations personnel operating in more than 50 countries around the world, taking direct action to counter terrorists and working with local populations to prevent terrorists from taking root. 
   I am especially proud of the three special operations force components housed in the 9th District of Washington: the Army 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne) and the Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR)--4th Batallion at Fort Lewis and the Air Force 22nd Special Tactics Squadron at McChord Air Force Base. I've also been able to visit several other components of our special operations forces across the country and around the world, and they are doing a fantastic job. 
   Going forward, we need more special operations forces to fight the spread of the totalitarian ideology pushed by al-Qaeda and related groups. Consistent with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, we will seek to grow SOCOM forces by 15 percent. We will not sacrifice quality for quantity, but we must have the capability to train more special operations forces to face complex national security challenges. 
   And, we must ensure proper emphasis on indirect action. Often when people think of special operations, they think of direct action against terrorists. But much of SOCOM's mission involves less dramatic but essential work. Special operations forces are currently working in well over a dozen countries to prevent al-Qaeda and other organizations from taking root. They train locals to defend themselves and help local populations improve their living situations so that they are less susceptible to terrorist recruitment. 
   Getting to know local populations, learning the languages, becoming helpful to them--these steps are vital to preventing insurgencies and terrorist groups from taking hold. We recently heard from a special operations veteran who told us that the most helpful counter-terrorism tool his force brought with them in North Africa was a dentist. The population needed this service so badly that our providing it led to them working with us to root out terrorists in the area. This kind of work to win the hearts ana minds of local populations is essential if we are to defeat the spread of al-Qaeda's message across the globe. That's why we in Congress must ensure that SOCOM is resourced and structured properly to sufficiently emphasize and effectively carry out this critical indirect work. 
   I want to thank the members from both parties on the terrorism subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee for their work to make sure our special operations forces have the tools they need to protect our country. I want to especially thank Ranking Member Mac Thornberry and Representative Thelma Drake for their hard work on this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by echoing the comments of my colleague from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and also thanking him for his outstanding leadership on our subcommittee. It's been great to work in a bipartisan fashion with Mr. Thornberry; with Mr. Saxton, the former chairman; and the other members of the committee. And I will not repeat all that Mr. Thornberry just said because I agree with it completely. The priorities that he laid out of our subcommittee, focusing on supporting the Special Operations Command in their lead in the fight against al Qaeda and terrorism; focusing on science, technology, and all the issues that he raised are exactly what we are trying to confront. I have enjoyed working with him on those issues and look forward to continuing to do so because, as he mentioned, we have certainly made progress but there is a lot more work to do. Our Special Operations Command needs all the support we can give it in its effort to fight al Qaeda, to understand that enemy and then use its forces to the best of its ability to combat it. And I think understanding those issues is enormously important. It has been a huge priority of our subcommittee. 
   I also want to thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Skelton. It is a great honor to have worked with him during my 11 years in Congress and certainly a great honor to work with him as the Chair, and I think he has produced an outstanding bill, in particular the focus on the troops. I have traveled with the chairman before, and I know that this is always at the top of his priority list, how we are taking care of the troops and their families. This bill does that. It protects them, active duty, Guard and Reserve. It makes it a priority to make sure that we are meeting their needs, and I know that is primarily because of his leadership, and I thank him for that. I also thank the other subcommittees who were directly involved in that. 
   Lastly, I want to point out how important it is that this bill also recognizes the fight we are currently engaged in in Iraq and Afghanistan. It goes to the issues that are most important to those troops. Funding the MRAPs, trying to come up with ways to combat IEDs, making sure they have the body armor and the up-armored Humvees they need to confront those threats. It has been a huge priority of this committee, and particularly Mr. Taylor and Mr. Abercrombie, to make sure that we fund our troops that are in the field right now with the priorities that they most need because they are the ones facing the most direct threat right now. 
   I have always been proud to be a member of this committee, and I'm very proud of the bill that we have created. I urge every Member in this body to support it. I think it's an excellent piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, on December 2 and 3, a severe winter storm swept across Oregon and Washington State. Countless first responders came to the aid of those in need and worked tirelessly to restore order in the aftermath of the storm. I strongly support H. Res. 851 in recognition of the dedication, service, and courage shown by these men and women. 
   The winter storm affected dozens of communities and many thousands of people in Washington and Oregon, including my constituents in the Nineth District of Washington. It struck the Pacific Northwest with a ferocity that is rarely seen in the region. The storm brought winds that exceeded 100 miles per hour, saturated the region with 10 inches of rain in a 24-hour period, and led to the loss of human lives. Homes and businesses were flooded, roads and thoroughfares were damaged or swept away, and thousands of citizens were left without electricity, heat, water, transportation, or adequate shelter. 
   Throughout and following the storm, the men and women of local and state police agencies, fire and rescue groups, local and state emergency first-response organizations, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Oregon and Washington National Guard were ready to respond to the extraordinary circumstances. They rescued those trapped by the rising waters, provided aid to those in need of critical assistance, and helped to limit the ill effects of this tragic weather event. 
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I want to call particular attention to the service of the Washington National Guard. Some 400 Washington National Guard Members, 70 vehicles, and 11 teams supported response and recovery operations, conducted house-to-house searches, and provided needed food, water, and other emergency provisions. In cooperation with many other local, State, and Federal first responders, the men and women of the Washington State National Guard performed their duty admirably, and I am very grateful to them. 
   Please join me in honoring the Washington State National Guard and recognizing the many other first responders for their contributions during the winter storm of early December. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 851.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
   First of all, I want to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Ike Skelton, for the fantastic job he has done on this mark. He has done it in a bipartisan fashion. And also, of greatest importance, this mark funds the war that we are fighting. 
   We have troops in the field in harm's way. We fund the priorities that they need right now. And given all of the demands on the Armed Services Committee, that is no easy feat. The chairman and all members of the committee have made that a priority, and I want to thank him for that. 
   I also believe that we have well-funded the broader war on terrorism that my subcommittee has a significant part of, Subcommittee on Terrorism. 
   The fight against al Qaeda and the ideology they espouse and those who would support al Qaeda or that ideology is not just in one place. It is in many places in the world. It is in Africa, Southeast Asia, certainly in the Middle East and elsewhere. To combat that ideology, we need a force that is trained in unconventional warfare, that is trained in asymmetric warfare, and we need the Special Operations Forces who are trained to go into parts of the world, to understand the culture and work with the local communities and stop al Qaeda-like insurgencies before they start. That training is critical. 
   It is much easier to fight that type of battle than to get dragged into a larger war. We have had incredible success in places like the Philippines and Chad and Kenya and elsewhere because our Special Operations Forces understand irregular warfare, get in there and work with the local communities to stop insurgencies before they start. I believe this mark reflects that priority. It is certainly one of the highest priorities for our subcommittee. 
   I want to thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), for his leadership on this issue as well. We have put language, money and report language in the bill that will prioritize irregular warfare, unconventional fights, so that we can defeat al Qaeda globally and understand all of the different challenges that go into that. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) for his outstanding leadership of this committee. It is a privilege and honor to serve with him, and to thank him for this mark and this bill that I think adequately prepares our military to fight the battles we face.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Washington. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I want to start by thanking Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for the work they have done, not just on this bill but during the 12 years that I've been in Congress and even before then. 
   Their leadership on this committee I think should be an inspiration to all of us in the way they approach these very important issues. To begin with, they set a tone of bipartisanship. We worked together in an open process that I think gives us the high quality product  that we wind up with. And that's not to say that we don't disagree, occasionally along party lines, but we do so in a very open, very honest way, in a way that I think addresses the issues and the way that Congress should perform. I want to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for his time as ranking member and time as chairman as well for doing that. 
   I think this year's bill is a particularly good product and representative of that fine work. We have heard many different pieces of it already. I just want to highlight two in the general bill. 
   First of all, the $2 billion in additional money that we put in to deal with readiness, a major challenge right now for our Armed Forces, particularly the Army and the Marines. Our forces are really under a great deal of strain because of their deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maintaining readiness has been a major challenge and concern, and this bill puts that concern up front and funds it in a way that will help us begin to deal with the problem. 
   Also, equally as importantly, it prioritizes our troops by giving them a 3.9 percent pay raise, to recognize the hard work and sacrifice that they perform for us and support them in every way that we possibly can. 
   With that, I want to highlight some of what we've done on our subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional Threats, and Capabilities. We have four main areas that we focus on. 
   The first of those is the Special Operations Command over which we have jurisdiction, and I want to pause at this moment in the general remarks and thank Representative Saxton who, though he is not the ranking member on this committee now, serves on the committee and was the first Chair. As Representative Hunter has pointed out, the special operations forces were a particular concern of Representative Saxton. He has a done a great deal in our efforts to expand that force, meet their needs and expand their capabilities, and more than that, he has been a great Member, not just of this subcommittee but of this committee for his career in Congress. He will be missed, and I very much appreciated working with him. 
   What we have done primarily for special operations forces in the bill this year is fund as many of their unfunded requirements as we possibly can. They have been at an incredibly rapid tempo in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. Continuing to fund their needs is the top priority of our subcommittee. 
   The other area that we focus on is irregular warfare, and there are a number of different pieces to this. But I think it's a critical part of our defense bill because it is emerging as one of the most continuous pieces of the fight, counterinsurgency efforts, counterterrorism efforts, things that were not prior to 9/11 part of our lexicon to the degree that they are now. 
   We take steps to make that a higher priority by raising it to the Assistant Secretary level at the DOD and also by helping to fund human terrain teams. Our subcommittee received excellent testimony about what these human terrain teams are doing to go in and understand the culture in Afghanistan, in Iraq. We actually employ anthropologists and others who are experts in culture so that our forces can know who they're dealing with when they go in. This is a critical element of what we're working on. 
   We also, thirdly, focus on harnessing technological innovation. We fund it, to begin with, $1.69 billion worth of R&D for science and technology, and we also focus on harnessing new technologies as quickly as possible by developing a clearinghouse for that. The procurement process in the DOD can be a lengthy process at times. We want to get these technologies out in the field as quickly as possible when they are most useful. 
   We're also asking the Department to focus on the recruitment of IT professionals, the people with the brains to help us with cyber security and elsewhere. As you might guess, the DOD does not pay as much as these people might be able to earn in the private sector. So we have to aggressively go out there and recruit folks to make sure that we have the top IT professionals within the DOD. Our bill focuses on that as well. 
   Lastly, we focus on improving DOD's homeland defense capabilities, a role of our subcommittee, by funding the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the chemical/biological defense programs and by increasing their funds and making sure that they have what is necessary to protect us here in the homeland, within the DOD, working in cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Again, I want to thank Representative Saxton for his work and also Representative Thornberry, who is the ranking member on this subcommittee. He has been great to work with, very smart, very talented, works in a bipartisan way. All of the issues that I have just listed have been made possible in large part because of his input. I appreciate working with him as well. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman and Ranking Member Hunter for the way they run this committee. It makes me proud to be in Congress every year I have the opportunity to serve with them. 
   Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, the GAO is scheduled this week to decide whether or not to overturn the Air Force decision on awarding the tanker contract to Airbus. We have already heard this morning that the Air Force has discovered that they made numerous mistakes in how they calculated the cost. 
   There is another huge issue. We hope the GAO does the right thing and overturns that decision, but even if they don't, we have to keep in mind that our country has a trade action against Airbus right now for unfairly and illegally subsidizing their products, the very product that the Air Force has decided to buy. 
   If we want to enforce our trade laws against our trading partners to our advantage, it makes no sense whatsoever to reward precisely the illegal, unfair behavior that we are trying to stop them from doing. Giving them this contract does that, and we should overturn it either by the GAO or by Congress if they don't and not reward unfair subsidization by our foreign competitors.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Washington. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, in listening to this debate, I think the biggest problem is the proponents of the stay-the-course plan in Iraq continually and completely equate the battle in Iraq with the battle against al Qaeda and the terrorists who struck us. The two are not the same. In fact, we heard from Ms. Ros-Lehtinen that Iraq is but one of the battlefields that we are fighting against al Qaeda. That is absolutely true. Yet we have 80 percent of our assets in Iraq. Meanwhile, report after report come out that al Qaeda is strengthening themselves in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where we don't have enough resources. 
   Our argument is not for retreat. Our argument is that there is a better way to fight al Qaeda and those who threaten us than to put all of our assets in Iraq while not paying enough attention to where al Qaeda is really strengthening itself. In Iraq, it is primarily a power struggle in which al Qaeda is a player. It is not primarily about al Qaeda's threat against the U.S. In Afghanistan, with the Taliban and al Qaeda, it is a very different story. 
   Our troops, our assets, the lives and the talents of the people of this country are tied down in Iraq fighting what is primarily a civil war instead of better fighting al Qaeda. In fact, our presence, in many ways, has strengthened al Qaeda. Syria would never be an ally of al Qaeda in any sort of real-world scenario, because al Qaeda wants to topple their regime. Yet to defeat us in Iraq, they have come up with an alliance of convenience. 
   There is a better way to fight al Qaeda. We are here today to change course in Iraq because it is a better way to protect this country. Timing isn't the issue. Six months ago, these facts were basically the same as they are today. In September, these facts will be basically the same as they are today. We cannot wait if we are going to have the best possible strategy for defeating al Qaeda, the group that threatens us most, instead of getting bogged down in the civil war and in the tribal differences that are present in Iraq. We want to win, not to quit. This is the better way to do it.

No soldier who dies fighting for his country and his comrades dies in vain, regardless of the politics. I hope we would all understand that. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney).

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I would just argue, first of all, I respect the gentleman from Texas, but I have only been here for an hour and 15 minutes and I have heard countless alternatives from many Democratic speakers. May not like those alternatives, may not think they are the best course, but it is wrong to say that the Democrats have not offered alternative courses of action in Iraq. They have offered a good many. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez). 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues today to add my support to this resolution. 
   This resolution is straightforward and simple: we support our troops and oppose President Bush's plan to send more than 20,000 additional combat troops to Iraq. 
   I support this resolution because we need a new direction in our Iraq policy. This war has been going on for almost my entire service in this House, and during that time, I have heard one misrepresentation after another. 
   This war began on a flawed premise, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and posed an imminent threat to the world. After months of fruitless searches, it became clear that there were no weapons of mass destruction; but 3 years after coming to that conclusion, we are still in Iraq. 
   Then we captured Saddam Hussein and more than 3 years later we are still in Iraq. We were told we needed to be there to fight the terrorists who attacked us, but we all knew that al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan, not in Iraq. 
   Vice President Cheney said the insurgency was in its last throes; and 20 months later, our troops are still in combat in Iraq. 
   We were told we were in Iraq to establish democracy and freedom. Iraq now has a Constitution and an elected government, but over 1 year later we are still in Iraq. 
   It was 3 years, 9 months and 2 weeks ago that President Bush declared mission accomplished, but our troops are still in Iraq. 
   We in this House and the American public have been continuously misled about this war. Enough is enough. If I really believed that sending another 20,000 troops would end the war and bring stability to Iraq, I would support it. It would be worth the sacrifice. But the war in Iraq cannot be solved militarily because it is a political problem. 
   So when the President wants to send even more troops, we really need to take stock of what that means for our country and the lasting impact that it will have. 
   We all know the statistics: 3,124 American troops killed; over 20,000 wounded; and over $379 billion spent. 
   And I have seen the costs beyond the numbers, and I am sure my colleagues have as well. 
   Each visit that I have made to Walter Reed, every wounded veteran that I have met in my district and each condolence letter I write to the widow or the parent of a fallen soldier painfully reminds me of the great sacrifice we are asking from our men and women in uniform and their families. 
   There are also costs that we don't have numbers for, but they are worth considering. How many children will grow up without a parent because of this war? How many veterans' lives will be forever altered because of the injuries they have endured? How are we being perceived throughout the world, and has it made us more vulnerable to terrorism? 
   As we consider the President's decision to send yet more troops and to escalate the costs we are bearing, we need to ask ourselves whether the cost of sending more troops to fulfilled a flawed policy is justified. I don't think it is, and most Americans don't think it is either. 
   As far as I am concerned, this is a moral issue. We are not doing right by our troops and their families to continue sending them into harm's way without a winning strategy. 
   And we are not doing right for America. Our continued presence in Iraq is breeding new recruits for terror groups and eroding the readiness of our own Armed Forces. 
   We are increasingly vulnerable to defending our interests in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, where just yesterday The Washington Post reports that NATO lacks enough troops to fight the Taliban and al Qaeda. 
   It is time to change our tactics and bring an end to our current mission in Iraq. This resolution is not going to do that, but it is a first step in articulating to this President that staying the course is not working and it is not acceptable to the American people. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the resolution.

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I guess the first thing I want to point out, and there are other arguments I want to make, but during Mr. Lewis' comments, and I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from California, he mentioned that, you know, George Washington never retreated. Well, as it happens, I just read a biography of Mr. Washington, and not to go puncturing holes in the midst of our great Nation, he retreated a fair amount, actually. 
   In fact, I don't know where we got this idea that the great leaders of our time only went forward. We have heard about President Kennedy and President Truman. At one time or another, they retreated from a fair number of battles. Now, sometimes that was a wise and tactical maneuver to win the larger war. Sometimes it was a mistake. 
   History judges, but I think it does sort of portray the thinking of the President that the only way is forward, regardless of the details. A little more thought, I think, might help us. I will return to that point at the end of my remarks. 
   But the first thing I want to say, I think this is by and large a very good debate on a very important issue facing our Nation. The only time I become troubled in this debate is when speakers on the other side say that this is just political, and that this resolution is irrelevant. What they are saying is that the opinion of the United States House of Representatives on the most important public policy issue facing our Nation today is irrelevant. The opinion of the people's House doesn't matter. 
   Now, that explains a lot for the last 4 years while the minority party was in the majority, when they did not question this President, when they did not express their opinion in a way that would move us in a more positive direction. 
   I feel very strongly that it is absolutely the responsibility of those of us in Congress who represent people, our constituents, to express our opinion. In a way we are expressing their opinion. That is what we are supposed to be here in the House, the most directly reflective voice of the people of this country. 
   So to say that this is irrelevant is just an absolute attack on the Constitution and the way this country is supposed to be set up. We must express our opinion on the most important issues of the day. 
   Then we come to the next issue, which is, you cannot question the Commander in Chief. He is the guy in charge, he knows more than the rest of us. You cannot question him. It undermines everything. 
   Let me say I express a certain amount of sympathy for the view that we should place faith in the Commander in Chief. That is a good part of the reason why I voted for this resolution 4 years ago. A little more than a year after 9/11, our President was saying to us, To prosecute the broader war on terror I need this authority. And I had my doubts, but, by and large, I want to be supportive of the Commander in Chief, recognizing the power he has. 
   But the question I have for the minority is for how long? How many mistakes does this President have to make before we don't have an obligation, not just a right, but an obligation to express our disapproval and try to get him to move in a different direction? Books have been written, more than I can count, about all of mistakes that this President has made in Iraq; books not written just by opponents of the war, many of them written by proponents, outraged that they took their idea, the President took their idea and made such a hash of it. 
   We have an obligation at some point to stand up and say, enough. Mr. Commander in Chief, I am sorry, but based on 4 years, we do not trust you enough to give you a blank check anymore. We have to express our opinion, and that is what this resolution does. 
   Let me also assure you, we want to win. We, on this side of the aisle, recognize everything that has been said on that side about the threat that al Qaeda and their followers present. We  will fight them anywhere, anytime, because we recognize that threat. 
   In fact, I believe that there is al Qaeda in Iraq, and we should fight them. 
   But what we are talking about specifically today, and Mr. Buyer mentioned the 21,000 troops, that is the aspect of the plan that we focused on, precisely because that is the aspect of the plan that is most wrong, that does the exact wrong thing, sending 21,000 U.S. troops to fight in a civil war that has been better described by some of my colleagues, so I won't go into it any further, that they cannot possibly sort out the bad gays from the good guys is the exact wrong thing to do. 
   Given that feeling, and I have personally thought about this a great deal, I met with the President on a couple of occasions as he outlined this plan. I talked with many soldiers who served, gotten many opinions on this, and have come to the honest conclusion that it is a mistake, that it undermines our ability to win that larger war against al Qaeda, which is the war we are fighting. 
   Given the fact that I feel that way, I would be betraying everything that I said I was going to do when I got elected if I didn't on the Record express that opinion. That is what this resolution does. 
   So I know this hope will go unfulfilled, but I would hope at a minimum that the minority can stop saying that the opinion of this House is irrelevant. If they feel that way, they should all just go home. All right, it matters. You may disagree with the opinion we are expressing. I urge you to vote ``no'' if you feel that way, but I don't feel that way. 
   I feel we need to tell the Commander in Chief that he has led us down one too many blind alleys. We disagree with him. We want him to change course, and that is the will of the people's House, being expressed by us. That is not just our right. It is our duty as Members of Congress.  
   Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly four years since the war in Iraq began--four-and-a-half since President Bush and his team in the White House started the effort to launch our nation on the path to this war. We learned a lot during that time frame, but two things stand out. First, the war effort has failed to achieve the outcome the President hoped for, instead creating problems he clearly felt would not come to pass. Even he admitted that he is dissatisfied with the way the war has gone. Second, at every step along the way, beginning with the way the President got us into the war, right up to the President's latest plan to once again increase the number of U.S. troops in Baghdad, President Bush and his administration made mistake after mistake--failing to an almost incomprehensible level to learn from past errors or to demonstrate even a modest level of competence in prosecuting this war. Countless books from all points on the political spectrum lay out in painful detail all the mistakes this administration made in Iraq. 
   It is way past time for this Congress to stand up and say enough. We disapprove of what President Bush is doing in Iraq. 
   But our friends on the other side of the aisle claim that such a statement is meaningless. This is an astounding assertion. The United States House of Representatives--the elected voice of the people of our Nation--stating clearly and on the record how they feel about the single most important policy issue of our time is meaningless? This opinion, expressed by the minority party, perhaps explains the utter lack of oversight and accountability that they employed when they were in charge--standing by and acting as mere cheerleaders for the President's actions in Iraq as he made mistake after mistake. The other side of the aisle at least has a consistent record of believing that the opinion of Congress, a body our Constitution set up as a coequal branch of government with the Executive, is meaningless. 
   As much as I disagree with this conclusion as to the proper role of Congress in expressing its opinion on the Iraq War, I do understand this initial reluctance to pressure President Bush to change course. In a time of war we all want to stand behind our Commander-in-Chief as a first option, and the powers of the presidency make it difficult for Congress to, in a clear-cut straightforward manner, direct the President in the conduct of war. But the President's record of mistakes in Iraq makes it clear we can no longer cling to this first option, and, difficulties notwithstanding, the cost of continuing down the same path the President has been pursuing in Iraq has reached the point where Congress must at least try to force a change in direction. 
   This effort should logically begin with a clear statement from the House that we disapprove of the way the President is conducting the war in Iraq. That is what this resolution does. With this vote members can no longer hide behind, ``on the one hand, but then again on the other'' statements. We can all mutter about things we don't like in Iraq, but an official on the record vote is required to make that disapproval clear. Do you support the way President Bush is conducting the war in Iraq? Yes or no. 
   And make no mistake about it the President's plan to increase the number of U.S troops in Baghdad represents no change in policy. It is stay the course, more of the same. In the last year we made large increases in the number of our troops in Baghdad twice already. Both times violence went up in the city, and as we have begun the current increase in troops that violence has once again increased. The lesson should be clear at this point--United States military might will not stop or even reduce the violence in that city. 
   Listening to the arguments against this resolution helps to understand why our President insists on making some of the same mistakes over and over again in Iraq. We are told that our fight in Iraq is a clear-cut battle against the same type of al Qaeda-backed extremists who attacked our Nation on 9/11 and that we are defending a worthy Iraqi government against these evil forces. If this were true, I would support whatever increase in troops was necessary to defeat that evil force. 
   But it is not even close to true--it is instead a dangerous attempt to paint a black and white picture on a situation that is far, far more complex. Baghdad is caught in a sectarian civil war. Both Shia and Sunni militias are battling each other as well as United States forces and the Iraqi government. It is a complex web of frequently changing alliances and interests that makes it impossible for our troops to separate good guys from bad guys. This is why our troops cannot stop or even reduce the violence. And the Maliki government we are being asked to support spends as much time acting like they are supporting the Shia side of the civil war as they do acting like they want to bring Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds together to form a stable Iraq. 
   Al Qaeda is in Iraq and we should continue to target them, but that effort will require a far, far smaller U.S. military presence than we have there today. Currently we are expending an enormous amount of resources in Iraq, most of which is going towards putting our forces in the middle of a chaotic civil war where our efforts do not advance and may even retard our fight against al Qaeda. That massive military commitment reduces our ability to pursue al Qaeda in the dozens of other nations where they have influence--most glaringly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   This larger, more important fight is not solely or even primarily military. Diplomacy and other efforts to move disaffected Muslim populations away from joining al Qaeda are a huge part of our battle, and we need to enhance those efforts. But we can't, because we're hamstrung both by a lack of resources--financial and strategic--that are tied down in Iraq, and because our open-ended occupation of Iraq continues to undermine America's standing in the world. 
   Instead of sending more troops to Baghdad the United States policy in Iraq should be to instruct our military leaders there to put together plans to as quickly and responsibly as possible reduce the number of U.S. troops in Iraq. We need our troops to focus on al Qaeda and its supporters, not to be bogged down in a sectarian civil war that is only tangentially related to the larger fight against al Qaeda. 
   The first, critical step in this process of changing our policy in Iraq is this resolution. Congress must make its disapproval of the President's policy in Iraq clear and on the record.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen).

   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Thank you, I just want to add, before reserving the balance of my time, I want to thank Mr. Allen for offering a very specific plan and to once again remind all of you who are watching the debate that to charge the Democrats don't have a plan simply isn't true. We have a large number of them. We are just trying to get the Commander in Chief to start paying attention to them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Washington. First of all, I want to congratulate and thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter. Their dedication to making sure that we get a defense authorization bill done every year is truly admirable and an amazing accomplishment. They understand the importance of making sure that our committee sets the policy and the direction for national security and military policy in this country, and they are determined to get it done. 
   The challenges were great this year, and yet they still got us a bill done on time and a bill that will really, really help the men and women who are fighting for us in our Armed Services and help protect our country. And that is a tribute to their leadership. 
   I also want to thank Ranking Member Thornberry on our subcommittee for his great work. Our subcommittee, as he mentioned, is focused on specifically the war against al Qaeda and violent extremists, with jurisdiction over SOCOM and to handle unconventional threats. 
   I am proud that this bill fully funds SOCOM and their efforts to protect us from terrorism across the globe. This bill also emphasizes science and technology and our need to develop the best, most advanced weapons to protect our military troops everywhere that they are fighting. 
   I think this is an excellent bill, one that was not easy to accomplish, and I'm very proud of what our subcommittee has accomplished as well.
