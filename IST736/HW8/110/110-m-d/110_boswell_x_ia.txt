<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (METHAMPHETAMINE REMEDIATION RESEARCH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 365, and I associate myself with the remarks just made. Well said. It is a scourge to our country. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall of the Science and Technology Committee for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. I also want to thank the Meth Caucus leadership, Messrs. Cannon, Calvert and Larsen, who I have worked with. 
   Meth has wreaked havoc on our communities. Every district in our Nation has in some way felt the impact of what methamphetamine can do to families, the burden it places on local law enforcement and public health, and the toxic effect it has on the environment. In my State of Iowa alone, we had roughly 350 meth lab busts last year. Although this number is significantly down from 1,500 busts in 2004, it still presents a tremendous problem for my State. 
   I personally thank Marvin Van Haaften of Marion County, our recent drug czar, for his great work and leadership in this cause. In order to effectively continue our efforts to eradicate meth from our communities, we need every piece of information available. This legislation will increase the pool of information that local law enforcement and others rely upon. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that this legislation takes the necessary steps to coordinate the development of meth detection equipment with emphasis on field detection equipment. I believe having reliable equipment in the field will not only strengthen meth-related cases, it will increase the safety of our law enforcement officers, enabling them to take necessary steps to protect themselves from the toxic environment caused by the production of methamphetamine. 
   Furthermore, the study commissioned by the legislation exposes the long-term effects of exposure of meth labs on children and first responders. This help is long overdue. I am proud this legislation addresses the issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 365, I strongly urge my colleagues to support and pass this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Chairman, I think we all agree that, first and foremost, safety is the top priority for everyone involved in the mining industry. We, as a Congress, must ensure that legislation is heading in the right direction for the health and safety of American miners. Over the past several years, we have seen bad safety conditions and the devastating effects these conditions can have, not only on communities, but on human life. 
   We also must recognize the fact that not all mining operations are the same.  Repeat. Not all mining operations are the same. So I understand, Mr. Chairman, that you will continue to work with us Members, that you just said a moment ago, to address any concerns the bill raises as it moves through the process. And I want to thank Chairman Miller for his leadership on this issue and his willingness to continue to work and listen to other Members on the issue. He in fact is a true champion of our Nation's workers. 
   Again, I would like to thank him for yielding this time.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Chairman, I've just conferred with the Chair of the subcommittee, and he has asked me to offer it and withdraw it, and we will work on it before we go to conference. So out of my respect for him and the ranking member, of course I will do that. 
   I would just like to say this: In the last 2 years, we have done a little bit more than this for this good cause, and it's something that's helping law enforcement out across the country. And it's not big bucks, it's pretty small. But then again, you've got to work with where you're at. But it does increase law enforcement agencies' access to records on persons who pose a risk to local communities. I can assure you that the law enforcement agencies need this access, as we think about the things that happen to our children and older folks and so on, to be able to access that good information. 
   So with my appreciation, Mr. Chairman, I will ask unanimous consent to withdraw, with looking forward to working on this at a later point.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important moment for our veterans as we think of their service to our country. Of course, we all wouldn't be here, I believe, I think we would agree with that, if it wasn't for our veterans, who have been willing to put it on the line. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Filner has spoken here, this legislation came up after a very tragic thing. Joshua Omvig, returning after an 11-month tour, a good young fellow, a member of the Grundy Center Volunteer Fire Department, the Grundy Center Police Reserves, he was concerned about the safety of others, but because of the situation, he took his life. 
   I can't help but be thoughtful of Ellen, his mother.     
   She would like to have had more training. She knew there was a problem, and so did his dad. She was with Josh when he went out to his pickup truck that day to go to work to try to talk to him, to try to help. And he took his life right in her presence. 
   Well, they could have just kind of backed off in their great grief and sorrow and done nothing, but we reached out to them and they reached back. They want to participate in doing something for others. And so out of that came what is now known as H.R. 327. It is pretty simple: Improve early detection for incidence of suicide among veterans, provide those veterans  with the assistance they need, which was not there for Joshua. 
   This bill also requires the Veterans Administration to develop a comprehensive program to address the rate of suicide among veterans. And it also underscores the importance for further research, peer counseling, family education and involvement, and education for all staff at the Veterans Administration. There is an urgent need for this bill to pass. 
   You have heard the report that Mr. Filner gave us. The statistics are astounding. Stress disorder has jumped like 70 percent. 
   Also, I want to thank our two Iowa Senators, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley, for their support; and I especially want to thank Randy and Ellen Omvig, the mom and dad of Joshua. They have suffered a lot over this, as we all would. But at the same time, they found the courage and strength to want to help others and want to reach out. They want to do anything they can possibly do to prevent this from happening to another individual and another family. 
   It is almost with relief for me, Mr. Speaker, that we are passing this today and moving it on because we know there are hundreds of other veterans out there who need help, and this ought to set that in motion. There is no doubt there is more we can do, but this is a good beginning. With that, I would like to yield back and let other Members speak to this very important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Thank you, Chairman Filner, and all of you who have worked on veterans events this day and these last several months. We appreciate it very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, as veterans we know the sacrifice that our servicemembers pay each day. Whether currently deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, or wherever they might be around the world, serving on active duty or serving in the Army Reserves or on the National Guard, our men and women in uniform sacrifice for our freedom. 
   Oftentimes when we speak of our key military assets we are referring to the carriers and the stealth bombers and the tanks or the fighter planes. Well, while those are all impressive, none are more impressive than our brave men and women in uniform. I think, in fact, I know, they are our greatest military asset. The men and women who serve our Nation are the best educated, trained and equipped fighting force in the world. Because of this, I am proud to stand with my colleague (Mr. Baca) and all the rest of you to encourage communities and schools around the country to recognize the contributions veterans have made to our country and to our history. 
   It is often said, but we will say it again, a grateful Nation will always remember those who sacrifice so much in preserving our freedom. If we are to continue to have the very best of our Nation serve, we must continue to give them assurances that their service will not be forgotten. By granting all veterans who served before them the recognition, care and respect promised, tomorrow's veterans will have the reassurance in knowing their future needs will be addressed. 
   I am very proud to stand here to cosponsor this bill today and encourage the House to pass H. Res. 237. Honor Veterans Day. It's something we have a privilege to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Filner for yielding and what he is doing here for veterans. 
   I have to thank John Carter for his attention to this issue. Vandalism is never acceptable. Never. When I learned about the vandalism that took place at the Vietnam Memorial, I was outraged. Outraged. 
   As a Vietnam veteran, as many of you are in this Chamber, many of our colleagues, for me 20 years plus, I know firsthand, a lot of us do, the sacrifices that servicemembers and their families make. 
   This memorial does more than just honor the brave men and women who gave their lives for this great Nation. It also serves as a reminder to all Americans the price of freedom. 
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial serves as a resting place for our brethren who were unable to come home. And I will bet some of the rest of you, as I, have wondered how come our name wasn't on that wall. We know it could have been. And for somebody to desecrate that is just unacceptable. I hope the park service will be able to find these criminals and swiftly bring them to justice. 
   I would like to give special thanks to all of our troops and all those of them who have given the ultimate sacrifice. We cannot forget them. 
   With the passage of this legislation today, it is one more example of what Congress has done to fulfill our Nation's obligation to servicemembers, their families, and all veterans. 
   I am proud to stand here as a cosponsor of this bill, and I encourage the House to pass H. Res. 680 today.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (OPPOSITION TO INCREASING U.S. TROOP LEVELS IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to increasing U.S. troop strength in Iraq. As one Member of Congress who voted in support of the Iraq resolution in 2002, I recognize the pretext for going to war was based on faulty, misleading intelligence. I can not reverse that vote, but I can no longer acquiesce to a failed and tragic military exercise in Iraq. 
   Two months ago, Generals Casey and Abizaid stated they did not support increasing U.S. troop levels in Iraq. Last month, President Bush maintained that military policy with regard to Iraq would be determined by our military leaders. However, last week President Bush ignored his top military advisors and called for a 20,000-plus increase in U.S. troops to Iraq. 
   I, along with others, have been pressing the administration to level with the American people on the status of the American security forces being trained and ready to defend their nation. If Iraqis are trained and ready as we are told, we should begin a planned phased withdrawal of U.S. forces; if not, the administration should tell us when they will be trained and ready. 
   Sending more troops to Iraq does nothing to enhance the Iraqis' training; it only places more U.S. forces into harm's way to become additional targets for the insurgency. This failed policy must be stopped. 
   We can support our troops in the field and oppose the escalation of U.S. forces. I urge all my colleagues to work in opposition to the President's increase in U.S. forces.

   Mr. Speaker, I support it without reservation, in contrast to my colleague from Iowa, another person who spoke a moment or two ago. I really support this. Farmers across Iowa, across the Midwest, across the country, realize that this is an opportunity for us to be more self-sufficient. 
   I, some 30 years ago, was stationed as a soldier in Portugal when we had the first oil crisis, and I realized that the chaos that took place, that we are in bondage to OPEC. It was really bad then, but now it is even worse. We are up to 65 percent import. 
   Here is something we can grow out of ground this year. It is the thing to do. It is environmentally sound. We grow it out of the ground this year. We can turn around and grow it next year and have a great step forward and be independent in our energy production. 
   I hope that everybody will support this bill. It is a good thing all the way around, not just the farmers, it is good for everybody. Support H.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for the time. I appreciate being part of this discussion today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I couldn't help but be somewhat taken by Mr. Rangel's comments about the lack of urgency and the lack of sacrifice in our country because of what is going on with our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I can say to you, whoever is listening or watching, wherever you are, when I go through my communities, my towns, I sense the same thing. Where is the sense of urgency and where is the sense of sacrifice? 
   I will tell you where it is. When you go to see the troops off, to see their families, to see them, then you know where the sacrifice is. Then you know where the urgency is, to be there when they go back the second or third time, and, as some have said, the fourth. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, a resolution in support of our troops who are serving with distinction in Iraq, and opposing the President's call for escalating the troop levels in Iraq. 
   As a two-tour combat veteran of the Vietnam conflict, as Ike said, as an assault helicopter pilot, I, like many others in this body, know firsthand of the  everyday sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform serving in Iraq. And, I might add, if I could, I know the sacrifices of their spouses and children. Branded on me always will be the reminder of my children when I had to leave, and they wondered if their dad would come back. You can't forget that. And it is happening to our troops repeatedly. More than 3,100 have given the supreme sacrifice. Over 20,000 have been injured, many of them very severely. 
   This resolution recognizes our brave men and women for performing their mission to the best of their ability. All Members of this body, all Members of this body stand foursquare behind their efforts. 
   As one Member of Congress who voted in support of the Iraq war resolution in 2002, I recognize the pretext for going to war was based on faulty, misleading, misinformation. I cannot reverse that vote, but I can no longer acquiesce to a failed and tragic military exercise in Iraq. 
   Two months ago, Generals Casey and Abizaid stated they did not support the increase in U.S. troop levels in Iraq, and recently President Bush maintained that that military policy with regard to Iraq would be determined by our military leaders. However, last month, President Bush ignored his top military advisers and called for a 20,000-plus increase in U.S. troops in Iraq. 
   I and others have been pressing the administration to level with the American people on the status of the Iraqi Security Forces being trained and ready to defend their Nation. If the Iraqis are trained and ready, reportedly over 300,000, as we have been told, it is time to begin now a planned phased withdrawal of U.S. troops. Sending more U.S. troops to Iraq does nothing to enhance the Iraqis' training. It only places more U.S. forces into harm's way to become additional targets of the Iraqi civil war. This failed policy must stop. We can support our troops in the field and oppose this escalation of U.S. forces. 
   The sectarian civil war violence in Iraq is increasing, and U.S. troops are becoming an increasing target of the various tribes and factions. We cannot continue to place ourselves in the middle of this civil war. It is time to insist that the Iraqis resolve their own civil war. We must insist and allow the Iraqis to defend their own Nation. The Bush administration stated that Iraq Security Forces are trained and ready in sufficient numbers to do the job. Again, they stated over 300,000 trained and equipped. 
   Therefore, I believe now is the time to oppose any further escalation of U.S. troop levels and now begin the planned, phased withdrawal of U.S. forces. I regret today's resolution is nonbinding. We need to begin addressing this matter in real substantive legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and to work in unison to bring our troops home. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know what we do best? You know what we do best? I will bet everybody who is paying attention intends to file their income tax April 15. We do best when we are under pressure to get it done. 
   I think it is time to say to Mr. Maliki, you know what? You have got your government in place. You have got your chance for democracy. It has been given to you. We went in there and Saddam is gone. He is history. You have got your chance. It is up to you. Now, you have got your problems, but you have got your government and it is in place. You have your problems, but you have to work them out. We cannot come in there and settle a civil war. And that is exactly what is going on.     
   We were, like you were there and I was with you in the White House, 14 months ago when they said to the President, the Vice President, Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Rice and General Pace, if you have got at that time, 14 months ago, if you have got over 200,000 troops trained, equipped and in field, then what is your plan to bring our troops home? And just like now, silence fell in the room. 
   Now, the claim is over 300,000 trained and equipped in the field and we are not bringing ours home. So we should say to Mr. Maliki, you have got to do it, pick something, whether it is oil fields or pick something and say starting next week or the week after you are responsible for their security because we are going to bring our troops out and bring them home and we are going to take them to Baghdad, put them on airplanes and fly them home. You have got to do it. It is yours to do and we hold you responsible to do it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I will yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment offered by myself and the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) will give applicants from regions that have lost a major source of employment priority for SBIR and STTR funding. The Boswell-Sutton amendment would help to revitalize distressed economies that have lost major employers, such as factories and manufacturing plants. 
   SBIR and STTR funds would help small businesses in these areas create new, high-quality jobs in areas hard hit with the pressures of globalization and current trade policies. This is particularly important to me because I have witnessed the devastating impact of losing a major employer and what it can have on the community. 
   For 113 years, the Maytag Corporation was the largest employer in Newton, Iowa. At its peak, Maytag employed over 3,000 Newton residents at the headquarters and manufacturing plants. In 2006, Maytag was purchased by Whirlpool. On October 25, 2007, the last Maytag washing machine rolled off the line and the Newton plant and the corporate headquarters closed. The loss of so many good-paying, quality jobs had a distressing effect on Newton, and the local economy has yet to recover from this tragedy. 
   Investing in these communities so they are able to create new jobs by attracting companies is essential to many towns in America. I am pleased to report that in Newton, part of the former Maytag facility is in the process of being occupied by a new company that makes components for wind turbines, and the company expects to employ 140 hardworking Iowans. This is a step toward more energy, in response to the gentleman from Alaska. This amendment will help revitalize communities like Newton, and thousands of others across the United States. 
   I would like to thank Congresswoman Sutton for working with me on this important initiative, and I thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and Ranking Member Chabot for their leadership on this bill. Thank you for consideration. I hope you will accept this amendment that I believe is so important for so many communities across our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Thank you, Chairman Filner, and all of you on the Veterans Committee that worked together on this, both sides of the aisle. We are doing the right thing, and we know that. 
   I would associate myself with all the comments that have been made from Chairman Filner and Mr. Miller and all the rest, so I will not try to repeat them. But I might just share a little bit to whoever might be watching about why this bill came to pass. 
   As we all know, a number of veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, particularly Iraq, this phenomena is taking place, perhaps more so than ever before in our history. It is a concerning thing. All wounds are not visible. I think it has been a little hard for us to realize that we have to recognize this, and we are doing it. 
   I just want to share with you some many, many months ago, when I had the occasion to respond to the Omvig family in Grundy Center, Iowa, not too far from Waterloo, and you will be hearing from Mr. Braley shortly, I went and talked to them and realized the suffering they were feeling. This family, this father and this mother, Randy and Ellen, their son came home after 11 months, someone they loved very much, of course as all parents do, and they realized something was wrong, wasn't right. They wanted to do anything they could to help, but the frustration of not knowing what to do, trying to help, not knowing what to do, not having professional help, others reaching out in the community and so on, keeping Joshua as close as they possibly could, and knowing that things were not going well. 
   And then one tragic morning, as he left to go to work, and his mother was right there with him, and walked out to his pick-up truck, rolled up the window, with his mother standing just outside the window, and took his life. It should never have happened. 
   In this day of technology, we can test our young men and women going in and coming out of the services, and the technicians and the experts tell us that they can identify with a test they give that a person is suspect to this situation, the possibility of wanting to commit suicide. They say over 1 out of 100 give it consideration coming back from Iraq.  
   Now, if we have that ability to test, and we do, then it is appropriate that we take these steps that we are taking today to cause and affect our Veterans Administration to follow up and follow through and save every life we possibly can. We can't bring Joshua back, but we can do all we can possibly do to prevent it from happening to others. 
   So I am very appreciative today. I of course rise in strong support of this. And I do this in the name of Joshua, by the name of Randy and Ellen. I know the day I sat with them in a little restaurant in Grundy Center, we talked about what we were trying to shape into this bill. I wasn't sure I should, but then I asked them, I said would you mind if we named this after your son? They kind of looked at each other and talked about it, and they said they would be honored. 
   Now, they are continuing in their grieving, but they are reaching out to others. The calls they are getting to help others to get through this situation is a good thing. They are stepping forward and doing that, and I am very proud of them. So I hope we can get this message to them that we are responding, and the time is now. 
   Please support this bill. Thank you so very much.  
   With more and more veterans returning from tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, many new issues have arisen regarding veterans' mental health care that has not received attention in the past. 
   Some estimates have found that almost 1,000 veterans receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs commit suicide each year and one out of five suicides in the United States is a veteran. We must do better for our veterans and I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction. 
   This legislation grew out of a great tragedy. Almost a year ago I learned of a young man from Grundy Center, IA, Joshua Omvig, who experienced undiagnosed PTDS after returning from an 11-month tour in Iraq. His friends and family, mother and father Ellen and Randy, knew he was having a hard time adjusting to civilian life but did not know how to help him. Help was not available. Then, in December of 2005, Joshua tragically took his life. He was only 22 years old. Over the past year I have learned that Joshua was sadly not a unique case. After I heard Joshua's story I was shocked to find that one in 100 Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans have reported thinking about suicide. 
   We treat their physical wounds; now it is time to also treat their mental ones. All wounds are not visible. 
   I'd like to say a few words about Joshua's parents, Randy and Ellen Omvig. Out of their personal loss they have championed a cause to help all veterans and their family members. I have met with the Omvigs on numerous occasions; most recently I saw them this past Sunday, and I'm so impressed by their commitment to help others--the young men and women who have served our country. They are true heroes. 
   I am proud to stand here in support of this bill and I encourage the House to pass H.R. 327 today and ensure all veterans receive the care they need. Not all wounds inflicted in combat are visible, now is the time to treat them.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, today I come to share with you that Iowa is in a lot of trouble. We have had extensive floods, the worst I have ever seen, in our part of the country, and it is devastating. Since I saw you last, I have spent hours and hours with the United Way, Red Cross, civic leaders, both city, county, State, emergency operations centers in and out, and so on, and it is really tough. 
   We have experienced that before in this Nation. In our Pledge we say ``indivisible,'' and we are. This country will stand behind us, we know that, and we look forward to that possibility. 
   I fly an old airplane, and so I spent Saturday afternoon with one of my staff flying over the various cities, and a lot of them were really tough. When I flew down over Cedar Rapids low level and looked down upon the homes and businesses, at the devastation, the roads out, bridges, et cetera; over Iowa City, the university, with a lot of flooded buildings and so on; and then over to Ottumwa and back up the Des Moines River, it looked like a big lake. A lot of cropland is ruined, over 17 percent, maybe more, and will not produce this year. 
   So we need the help of the country. We need the help of this Congress. And I salute the people of Iowa for coming together. They have come together with determination. I asked one lady in the Emergency Operations Center after telling me all these things, I said, ``How are you doing?'' She said, ``You know, we are like family. We have pulled together. We are going to do this, but we are going to have to have some help.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would hope today our Speaker and leaders will be ready to help Iowa and other States out there who are in dire need of help at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a former colleague, a great American patriot, and a great friend, of Honorable Lane Evans from the State of Illinois, and to voice my support for H.R. 521, designating the Post Office in Rock Island, Illinois, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.'' 
   Lane served his constituents with great distinction in the House for 24 years. During his tenure in this great and honorable body, Lane was a champion of our Nation's veterans. As a veteran myself, having served 20 years in the United States Army, including two tours-of-duty in Vietnam, I feel fortunate that veterans across the Nation had such a strong and stalwart advocate in the United States House of Representatives. His fight to secure assured funding for veterans' health care and better services for our Nation's veterans will always be remembered fondly. 
   Lane also serves as an inspiration for many in our Nation struggling with a debilitating illness. When Lane was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he did not shy away from it. He continued his service to his constituents in this great House. Many can look at Lane as an example that life does not have to end when confronted with great uncertainty. One can persevere, and can continue fighting for what one believes in. 
   I, along with other veterans across our great Nation will never forget the tireless efforts of Lane Evans--a great American patriot, and a tireless advocate for the beliefs he held so dear. 
   I, along with many in this House, wish Lane nothing but the best for the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for the opportunity to share this resolution that I am a co-sponsor of, and I think it is the right thing to do, to honor those who made the sacrifice that they did in the Vietnam War. 
   Some of us in this body have served in that war. I would like to associate myself with those who have previously spoken. We are never wrong to take a moment and remind ourselves of those who gave the supreme sacrifice and laid their lives on the line, as so many did. 
   So it is a reminder to us that freedom is not free. I just had the opportunity a couple of days ago in a large group down in Iowa to ask all the veterans to make themselves known and to ask all those in the audience if would you please turn and thank your veterans. Because of them, we can have that opportunity to gather together on that hillside and share the freedoms that we take for granted so often. 
   So today on this 25th anniversary we are reminded particularly of the Vietnam veterans. Some of us 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 years ago went down and had kind of a picture-taking opportunity with Members in the Congress with Vietnam veterans at the Wall. And for all of us, we had to stop and realize our names could have been there, too. 
   We recognized names of our colleagues and comrades that fell and paid the price because the country asked them to do that. That is happening this very day, of course, in other parts of the world. 
   So I thank you, gentlelady, for the time. I appreciate you bringing this forward. I certainly urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF FORMER FIRST LADY, LADY BIRD JOHNSON -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 553 recognizing the passing of Lady Bird Johnson and her contributions to the United States. 
   Lady Bird Johnson, the wife of the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, passed away last week at the age of 94. We will remember this former First Lady as a woman deeply committed to her husband and his presidency, as well as a calm and elegant figure during a tumultuous time in American history. 
   Lady Bird took an active role during her husband's time in the White House. Before environmentalism was a part of American political life, she lobbied Congress to clean up the landscape of the United States. Through her efforts, the National Highway Beautification Act and the Clean Air Act became law and the Nation's Capital received a much-needed makeover to its landscape. After she left the White House, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center in Austin, Texas, which was later named in her honor. The center continues Lady Bird's efforts to preserve this country's natural landscape and beauty. 
   Lady Bird also influenced many other policies and initiatives during the Johnson administration, including the War on Poverty, Head Start, and the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald Ford in 1977 for her efforts both in and out of the White House. Through her numerous accomplishments, we will continue to remember her as a wife, mother, and passionate and dedicated American. While it is with sadness that I mark the passing of this wonderful individual, I am proud to be able to commemorate her incredible contributions to our nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (CODE TALKERS RECOGNITION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4544, the Code Talker Recognition Act. 
   I am proud to say that this legislation, which I am an original cosponsor, will finally recognize the men who served as code talkers for our great Nation during World War I and World War II. 
   Eight of those men who specifically will be honored today are members of the Meskwaki tribe based in Tama County, Iowa. 
   In January 1941, nearly a year before Pearl Harbor, 27 Meskwaki men, then 16 percent of Iowa's Meskwaki population enlisted in the Army. Of those 27, eight became code talkers: Edward Benson; Dewey Roberts; Frank Sanache; Willard Sanache; Melvin Twin; Judy Wayne Wabaunasee; Mike Wayne Wabaunasee; and Dewey Youngbear. 
   The Meskwaki men trained in Marshalltown and served together in the 168th Infantry, 34th Division. After jungle warfare training in Louisiana and code talker training in Scotland and then in England, they were sent to North Africa. 
   While in North Africa Frank Sanache ventured out far beyond the battalion and using a walkie-talkie directed artillery fire in the desert. He said ``It was the worst place this side of hell.'' 
   The enemy was never able to translate the native Meskwaki language, and the Meskwaki Code Talkers, among other Code Talkers are credited with saving the lives of countless members of the United States Armed Forces and contributing significantly to the victory of our Nation. 
   I am pleased to see that finally this bill will be brought to the House floor--it has taken many years to get to this point and even though many of those who are being honored are no longer with us at least their family members and loved ones have the opportunity to finally see them receive the gratitude and respect of our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. I thank the gentleman for yielding his time on this issue we have just mentioned here. 
   I would first like to thank the Agriculture appropriations committee for their hard work on this legislation. It's a thoughtful piece of legislation, and I do plan to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do need to express my concern and disappointment on an amendment I was planning to offer along with Representatives COSTA, KING, SALAZAR, and RADANOVICH that was not made in order. 
   Even though Representative Spratt's amendment, which replaced section 738 dealing with horse slaughter, was accepted by the Ag appropriations committee and addresses some of the large issues, including transportation and animal health inspection, it fails to address one major issue. With 100,000 horses abandoned each year in the United States, and animal adoption facilities overflowing, how, how are we supposed to deal with these animals? 
   Having spent most of my life involved in animal agriculture, I understand many of the issues firsthand. I have worked with a variety of animals, dairy cows, feeder pigs, to my current cow-calf operation, and we have always had horses on the farm, even today. In fact, I can share with you that on the 4th of July, this past 4th in my hometown of Lamoni, Iowa, I was awarded first place in the horse hitch category, a beautiful horse and buggy. 
   Mr. Spratt's amendment that was accepted by the committee does not address this issue of what to do with the additional 100,000 unwanted horses with nowhere to go and no one to take care of them. The burden will fall to the American taxpayer. Just housing and fitting one horse costs around $1,900 per year. Mr. Spratt's amendment will cost $127 million in just the first year alone for these animals. 
   I want to be very clear: I love horses. I have owned horses my entire life, and they have been some of the most loyal companions over the years. 
   But I do have major concerns to the fact that we are making it illegal for  horses to be slaughtered for human consumption, but not addressing what we are going to do with these horses and how we are going to care for them. We all should have a major concern and do something about it. This problem is not simply going to go away. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   I would again like to reiterate my disappointment over not being allowed to offer my amendment, but I do support the bill.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for yielding me the time. I would also like to thank Mrs. DEGETTE for her leadership on this very important issue. And I rise in support of H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   Today, I want to talk about a young girl who I have the honor of knowing, Karle Borcherding from Ankeny Iowa. In 2005, at the age of 10, Karle was diagnosed with juvenile or Type I diabetes. Over the course of the past year she has had to give herself 4 to 5 shots a day. A burden no 10 year old should have to deal with. Karle and her mother, Darcy, have been leaders on the finding a cure for Type I diabetes across Iowa, the Midwest, and all the way to Washington, DC, with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. 
   Karle is a vibrant young girl who does not let her disease control her life. When asked why Karle wants to find a cure she responds ``Not just so I will be cured and can be a normal kid, but because other kids will be cured too.'' I am hopeful that, for Karle's sake and every child affected by debilitating diseases, we will pass this vital legislation today. 
   Opponents of this legislation will argue that we should focus our attention to adult stem cell research. And while adult stem cell research can be useful, embryonic stem cell research offers hope to cure diseases. Some of the leading scientists in the country have stated that adult stem cells would not be able to find a cure for disease such as ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, or Type I diabetes. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me today and vote on the side of hope and science, and support H.R. 3.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (CONGRATULATING IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY FOR 150 YEARS OF LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 924, celebrating the 150th anniversary of Iowa State University. 
   I want to thank my dear friend, Congressman Loebsack, for his leadership and yielding the time, and I also want to thank Congressman Braley and Congressman Latham for their leadership on this resolution. 
   Iowa State University has made noteworthy contributions to the State of Iowa, our Nation and the world since being established in 1958. Iowa State was the first co-ed land-grant institution providing opportunities for students regardless of gender, race, or social class. Iowa State is home to critical agriculture research, from the development of the hybrid seed corn in the 1920s to important work on the development of ethanol and to the development of modern livestock animal genetics and many more. 
   Iowa State continues to lead the Nation in research into biorenewable fuels and modern agriculture. In 2005 Iowa State's students finished third in the North American Solar Challenge, the world's longest solar car race. Iowa State has excelled in a number of other areas, from development of the electronic digital computer in the 1930s to research into refining reactor-grade uranium. 
   The campus of Iowa State is also noteworthy. With over 600 public works of art, Iowa State was rated one of the 25 most beautiful campuses in ``The Campus as a Work of Art.'' Iowa State has graduated a number of prominent contributors to our Nation, including, as mentioned, George Washington Carver, who went on to serve as the school's first African American faculty member, as well as suffragette Carrie Chapman Catt, who graduated in 1880. 
   In fact, more than half my colleagues in the current Iowa delegation attended Iowa State, including Mr. Loebsack, who is the floor manager of the bill, BRUCE BRALEY, TOM LATHAM, and Senator TOM HARKIN. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the great institution that is Iowa State University and I am confident that Iowa State will continue to have great influence in Iowa and across our Nation. Again, congratulations to Iowa State University for 150 remarkable years. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Reyes for the time and your dedicated leadership and hard work to effect oversight over our Nation's multiple intelligence gathering agencies. 
   In the process of this debate regarding FISA, we have strived to make America safe and exercise and protect the Constitution and Americans' civil liberties. As I have heard Congressman Tierney say at different times, if we had followed FISA, we wouldn't be here today, and I appreciate that very, very much. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, and I don't know, none of us do, whatever reason, this President has repeatedly used executive orders and end-run the provisions, protections of FISA that work for the purposes intended. 
   Several weeks ago, I became concerned that our private telecom companies might be falsely accused and have the effect of putting a chill on their response in the future. I felt a gut confidence that pressure from on high was put on, i.e., we have an emergency, and we, the government, must have your assistance or a terrible event would happen. I think back on my own training in my life, and I know something about those terrible events that could happen, because I put together weapons of mass destruction in my own training, so it kind of haunts you sometimes. 
   So, yes, I, like others, like 20 others, signed a letter of concern. By the way, it was not a Blue Dog letter or a Blue Dog position. It was individuals, some of whom were Blue Dogs. 
   Now, over the course of these past weeks, a credit to Chairman Reyes and Chairman Conyers and our super staff, an acceptable solution has been found that makes FISA, supports FISA, and gives protection to those who assist within the provisions of the law. 
   For example, those who feel their civil rights have been violated can seek justice, and the telecoms who feel they have complied with the law can be defended. A judge would review the classified evidence and decide. This means to me that the Constitution and civil rights are protected, and the telecoms who are asked or pressured to assist in an emergency can know that classified evidence will be seen by the judge. Classified evidence would be seen by a judge and the providers' defense would be taken into account. I believe this to be a solution. 
   So, in closing, I would say this will protect the Constitution and the American people's civil rights, plus I support the bill because it gives the intelligence community the tools it needs and gives the telecom companies the means to defend themselves from unfair lawsuits. The bill provides telecom companies a way to present their defense in district court without the administration using State secrets to block the defense. If a company is simply doing its patriotic duty and following the law, this bill ensures the company will not be punished. 
   I urge everyone who signed the letter with me to support this resolution.

   Mr. BOSWELL. I would like to thank Mr. Davis for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to congratulate an inspirational young woman from my district, Shawn Johnson, the daughter of Doug and Terri Johnson of West Des Moines, Iowa, who recently won the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastic Championship, which took place in Stuttgart, Germany. At the age of 15, Shawn has achieved more and seen more than many high school students dream of. She has done it all while maintaining her status as an honor student alongside her friends at Valley High. 
   Shawn has traveled the world, winning title after title. This past July, she won five medals at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. Winning the 2007 Visa championships in San Jose, California, made her the United States champion in gymnastics. On September 9, Shawn became the world all-around champion, taking home three gold medals at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany. 
   While her shows are exciting and full of grace, one of the most inspiring things about her championship is that Shawn is shaping history. Having joined an elite group of women gymnasts, Shawn is one of only four American women to win the 40-year-old competition. 
   Shawn has impressed many around the globe and has made Iowans incredibly proud. She is reminding us how important hard work and dedication are. In honor of Shawn's accomplishments, Governor Chet Culver declared October 17 Shawn Johnson Day in Iowa, and we are extremely proud to join my fellow Iowans in congratulating Shawn and thanking her for making history in the great State of Iowa. 
   Shawn's positive attitude to achieve has taken her to amazing places. I suspect she's not quite finished. Promising to be ready for the Beijing Olympics, she told a reporter that she would ``put in 100 times more effort and hopefully come back with another gold.'' 
   Again, congratulations Shawn, and good luck at future competitions. You make me proud, you make our congressional district proud, you make your school in west Des Moines proud, you make our State of Iowa proud, and you make our country proud. We wish you continued success. On to the Olympics. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that everyone will support this resolution.

   As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I join with my good friend and colleague, and many others, Representative Braley of Iowa, as we celebrate the great service this unit has given. 
   They are brave people. You have heard the time they served. They returned home with the distinction of being the longest serving Iowa National Guard unit since World War II. I want to personally thank them for their service to our country. The brave men and women who make up the unit are something that we are very proud of, and I feel some relation to them, as others do in the Congress, because of my own past service in another war. So I appreciate it very much. 
   And I am also aware of the sacrifices made by the families. And I think you should know that as the troops were coming up the highway, as they passed under bridges, there were VFW and American Legion and other services and families who were on the bridges with flags walking them home, making them know how much they were appreciated and how much they were missed. Those families play a very important role, which we should all appreciate, in ensuring freedom and liberty. 
   So I want to thank the mothers and fathers and the spouses and the sons and daughters who had and have loved ones serving around the world. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak here tonight, and hope that we can raise up and give recognition and appreciation to all of our men and women who serve our country and do it with distinction. We should be very proud. I am, and I know all of us are

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time. 
   I oppose this point of order. I think that the gentlewoman from California made it very clear that it is appropriate and needed that we do what we're trying to do with H.R. 5351. And I want to support the rule for H.R. 5351, and I would like to thank Congresswoman Matsui for her leadership and Chairman Rangel for their continued work to ensure these vital tax credits are extended. 
   This legislation takes many needed steps to ensure the United States continues to be a major player on the renewable energy stage. This legislation extends the renewable energy production tax credit which Iowa and my district have seen firsthand the benefits of. It creates a cellulosic alcohol production tax credit which will give a 50 cent per gallon credit for cellulosic alcohol produced for use of fuel, a step to get us out of bondage to OPEC, and anybody knows we have got to do this for the salvation of this country. This legislation also extends the biodiesel production tax credit and creates a new credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles, among other things. 
   I'm also pleased to see that components of a bill I introduced, H.R. 5373, the Consumer and Manufacturer Energy Efficient Tax Credit Extension Act, were also included in this legislation. The underlying bill, which goes further than mine, would extend and modify the energy efficient appliance credit for 3 years and extend and modify the energy efficiency tax credits for improvements to existing homes. 
   I'm very pleased to see that the chairman, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), and the House leadership recognize these tax credits are important, not only to the environment but also to the economy. I believe that all consumers want to make more energy-efficient choices, and this legislation will help them do that. It's a win-win situation for the environment and the American consumer's pocketbook.  
   Iowa has been a leader for renewable energy, and I am proud to say in my district we are leading the State with a new biodiesel plant in Newton just last year and a new wind turbine plant, which provides the State with the equipment needed to supply its growing wind energy. 
   I am also excited that we have the opportunity to make America more energy independent, create high-tech ``green'' jobs for a ``green future,'' ensure low-income families have affordable energy costs, and I look forward to continuing to work for a more energy-efficient future. 
   So, again, I thank the gentlewoman for this time. And I would once again reiterate my support for this rule, that we can move on and oppose this point of order.

   Mr. BOSWELL. First, I, too, would like to join with others in our appreciation of Chairman Skelton and Mr. Duncan for their good work, 58 unanimous votes coming out of committee. That says a lot. 
   Madam Chairman, I think it's important for us to realize some things in the future that are going on with our forces that many of us who participated over the years, you and I, have got some concern about, that's readiness. 
   If you haven't talked to your adjutant generals back in your home State, you ought to do that. You ought to have a talk with them, because it's something we ought to address. I know the ranking member and chairman understand this, but we have to do it. You have got a good bill. You have done what we ought to do. 
   We have to think about what happens next. I think we have to realize that there is some disparity about what is going on, even in the Iraq operation, because we have to figure out what we want to do in the future. What do we want as the policy, as the structure, as we think about the added forces that we are going to have to do. 
   We think about deployment. You know, they tell me that about 80 percent of the casualties over there, and probably some of you have more accurate information, are from the infantry. But they are only about 20 percent of the force. 
   You think about that, there's something going on here that's evolved in all of this that we haven't really addressed. We are thinking about the dearth of those who are reenlisting in the very important rank, the backbone of the Army, and I would guess the Marines as well, and that's the E-6. There are more of those that are doing the leadership positions throughout a various variety of things, as well as the O-2s and O-3s.     
   And those are young people, younger people, who have got some amount of service, but they have got to talk to their families about reenlisting and continuing on. They are not staying, and this ought to be a concern. We have got to address that, and we have got to do that in the very, very near future. 
   So we have to sit down and say, what is our structure, what is our policy, before we go ahead and do the things that we have to do.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 429 is a bill to designate the new courthouse in Brooklyn at Cadman Plaza in honor of former Member and New York Governor Hugh Carey. 
   Hugh Carey began his distinguished public career in 1960 when he was elected to the House of Representatives. He served on the former Education and Labor Committee, the Interior Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. During his seven terms, he became the deputy whip and helped pass several pieces of landmark legislation on education and the rights of the disabled. 
   As Governor, Carey signed the historic Willowbrook consent decree, which committed New York to sweeping reforms in the care of the developmentally disabled. He also dealt with Love Canal and pollution of the Hudson River. Along with Senator Kennedy and former Speaker Tip O'Neill, he worked to end violence in Northern Ireland. 
   He is truly a son of New York, a great civic leader and esteemed public servant. For these and other reasons, it is both fitting and proper to honor Hugh Carey with this designation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is quite a privilege today for me to stand here and speak about someone who has been my mentor and that I have admired for many, many years of my life. Neal Smith, and in fact I should say his wife, Bea, have been exemplary in so many ways and have meant so much to the people of Iowa and in fact the people of this Nation. 
   I would recognize that Neal served with distinction and bravery in World War II. He was a bomber pilot and was highly decorated. 
   Those of you here in the Congress that served with Neal know that he was highly regarded, both in Washington and in his home State of Iowa. He was known for his skillful legislating and attention to his congressional district. Having served 36 years in Congress, Neal is the longest serving Iowan to serve in the House of Representatives. Naming the Federal building in Des Moines is an honor he deserves, and the time is correct. 
   As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations subcommittee, Neal spent most of his time outside the spotlight tenaciously defending programs under his jurisdiction against budget assaults. 
   He was rooted in Depression-era Iowa. Neal was a man of liberal instincts, but he was considered fair and an honest broker as a subcommittee chairman and was known to keep debating until an agreement could be reached. He once said, ``I don't try to get confrontational. I try to do whatever I need to do to pass the bill.'' 
   Outside of appropriations, Neal was a champion for tougher meat and poultry inspection laws and introduced and supported legislation that required food labels stating sodium content. Neal was also instrumental in creating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to guard against grain trading abuses and in setting up strict Federal procedures for grain inspection. 
   Back in Iowa, other tributes have been given to his honor. We now have the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge, the Neal Smith Trail, and the Neal and Bea Smith Law School at Drake. It is now only fitting that the Federal building in Des Moines, a building I understand he helped get funded, be named the Neal Smith Federal Building. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this moment and urge passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, I would just share this. That is a very good question, Mr. Graves. It would be either a B-17 or B-29. It was one of the bombers at least. I know that. Neal was the kind of person, as others know from here, he never spoke about it. You had to kind of dig it out to know about that. But he truly was an American hero as well as a very much respected hero in Iowa, and I suspect that a lot of his influence reached over into Missouri.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, a quote from Chief Justice John Marshall was recently used at St. John's Law School, Judge Duberstein's alma mater, to describe Judge Duberstein: ``Once in a while a man mounts the bench with the salt of like, the spice of wisdom, and the sweetness of humor blended in him so subtly and yet so successfully that those who are quite unlearned in the law glimpse some of its beauties.'' This quote so aptly describes Judge Duberstein. 
   Judge Duberstein was a proud product of New York. He attended school in the Bronx, college in Brooklyn, and received his law degree from St. John's University Law School. His high school alma mater is also the alma mater of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
   The words wisdom, fairness, beloved mentor, humor, humility, and humanity are used not only to describe his life but also reflects the principles he brought to his law practice. He was a judge guided by a sense of fairness and perpetual desire for nothing but justice for all who were in his courts. His accomplishments were without bounds. Judge Duberstein practiced bankruptcy law for over six decades, and when he died in his 90s, he was the oldest surviving bankruptcy judge in the country. 
   Designating the courthouse in his honor is a most fitting tribute to the extraordinary life and work of Judge Conrad B. Duberstein. 
   I support H.R. 430 and urge its passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Thank you, MIKE. I appreciate my friend from Arkansas giving me this opportunity. And I want to compliment you for the untiring hours you've spent in trying to tell this Nation, this Congress, and all who will listen that it is time to be fiscally responsible. It has been for some time. 
   And I would like to associate myself with my friend from North Carolina in the comments he just made. Very, very germane to what is going on in our country today. In fact, around the world. And as you can tell, Mr. Ross, I am one of the older folks around here. I don't know if that's something I should be proud of. I guess I'm proud versus the alternative. But oftentimes people say to me, You're going to be all right. Why are you worried about it so much? 
   Well, I am worried about it. Yes, at my age I suppose I'm going to be all right. But you know what? I have children and I have grandchildren and I am very proud of them, and I want them to have the opportunities.     
   In fact, just like you and you and you and anybody else that's paying attention, we all want it better for our children, that's just inherent. And they're not going to have that opportunity if we don't do something about this. And that's what you display right there on that chart. 
   That figure of $9 trillion-plus is staggering, and it's growing; it has been for the last number of years. And we went from the opportunity of being in a surplus to this unbelievable deficit situation. And it really ties our hands as to what we can do as we think about our leadership in the world we know today. 
   This very day I'm quite sure that we've had people from our Treasury Department over in China trying to borrow money so we can continue to run on deficit, and this just won't work. You can't do your business in Arkansas, you can't do it in North Carolina, I can't do it in Iowa, nobody can. 
   There comes a time when you have to face reality. And Mr. Stenholm used to tell us from time to time that if you realize you're in trouble and going into a hole, the first thing you do is quit digging. And there is something to that. Well, we need to do it, and we need to do it badly. 
   So, I am pleased to associate with the Blue Dog Coalition, I have been for some time, and the leadership that Mr. Ross and others, Mr. Boyd and others, have given to trying to make this point come to life in the sense that we've got to do it for our country and for our kids and our grandkids. This is something we must do, and there is just no choice about it. 
   I think there is a lot of hope for us in the world that we're living in today. I have a lot of hope, and I want to keep it that way. At the same time, I'm fully aware from my travels and from my life experience that the world is in a perilous situation. And we won't always be in this leadership position if we don't take a hold and get our arms around this situation. But we've got to do it. 
   And as we well know, the time is now at hand, I think it's already here, that China is a superpower. They are certainly going to be if they're not; I think they probably are. India, the demands they're putting on us. The big trade deficits we've got, we can't sustain those. And you put all this in line with this tremendous debt we have and what we're paying for interest annually, it equates to something like $250 billion a year. It equates to one of our major line items for our department. We can't afford to do that, and we have to face reality. 
   So, I really appreciate the efforts being made by you, Mike, and all of us to try to do something about this, and the fact that the leadership of this Congress has accepted our idea of PAYGO. And it's something we have decided upon and we've got to stick to it. There are going to be a lot of temptations to vary from that. And as we went into the farm bill, for example, it was so hard to do it, but we stuck with it, we worked hard and we came up with a viable solution. We've got to do it in all the things that lay before us. We've got to set the priorities and get those things done. 
   I see the time is about up. So I yield back to you, Mr. Ross, for the closing comment, if you would like. I just want to say I appreciate coming here this evening and sharing some of my concerns for this situation at hand. We have to take it as a real situation. It's here. And if we don't do our job, we're going to leave it on our children and our grandchildren, and we don't want to do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report. 
   Our intelligence professionals are on the front lines of a critically important campaign, a campaign against a determined enemy, an enemy that's ruthless, cunning, and does not abide by the rules. 
   In my past, I served our Nation on the front lines in a different campaign  against another determined enemy. My experience in Vietnam taught me a lot about what our Nation needs to do when it sends its best and brightest off to protect itself from threats abroad. 
   It taught me that a Nation needs to invest in its national security professionals to ensure that its men and women on the front lines have the best and most effective training possible. One of the principles of war is intelligence. You cannot have a successful strategy without knowing your enemy. Absolutely essential, saves lives. 
   I'm proud to say that the conference report does, in fact, invest in our intelligence professionals. 
   It increases spending on language training at the DNI level, Department of National Intelligence, so languages can be leveraged across the intelligence community. Because of bipartisan concerns about language skills, it also requires an annual report on language proficiency. 
   It fully funds our Nation's counterterrorism effort to ensure that our human intelligence officers have what they need to collect against our Nation's most important intelligence targets. 
   It increases training and funding for analysts to ensure that when our intelligence collectors gather important information on the front lines that we have trained and qualified professionals back home that can piece the information together and inform policymakers about the important issues of our time. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to highlight one provision of the conference report that I worked hard to include. It will require significant and critical reporting on the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, once in the 2008 fiscal year and twice in 2009. Last week's National Intelligence Estimate showed us that the intelligence can change significantly over time and that we have to constantly reassess our beliefs. I don't want us to forget about the threats that are a little further down the road while we're focused on today. That's why I've been pushing this provision for 2 years, and I'm glad it's in the conference report.

In September of 2007, Shawn Johnson won the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastic Championship. She is one of four American women to hold this esteemed title. 
   Today, I congratulate Shawn on her most recent win. On Saturday, June 7, Shawn successfully defended her title as the National Champion in women's gymnastics. Next weekend she will compete in Philadelphia for a spot on the elite six-member U.S. Women's Olympic Gymnastic Team. 
   Shawn not only exudes the hard work necessary to achieve her dreams, but also the character of a natural role model. Even with all her gold medals and new-found fame, Shawn continues to compete with humble pride and gratitude. 
   I thank Shawn for all of the wonderful things she has done around the State of Iowa and the Nation. Since winning the world championship, she has used her fame to bring awareness to breast cancer and other cancers that affect women. 
   Once again, Shawn, congratulations on winning the National Championship again, and good luck in Philadelphia.

   As chairman of the Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Subcommittee, working with my ranking member over here, Mr. Hayes, we have got the first-ever livestock title. It offers producers much-needed protections and ensures fairness and transparency within the marketplace. 
   I'm proud of this bipartisan bill. It also has a strong title for the dairy industry. Together we were able to bring producers and processors together on issues that have divided the industry for years. We were able to bring together the National Milk Producers Association and the International Dairy Food Association, with their excellent leadership, to avoid a very controversial issue in the dairy forward pricing program. Also, in the dairy title we ensure our dairy producers have an adequate safety net and our dairy industry continues to thrive. 
   The farm bill will provide a safety net for farmers and increase conservation efforts so that we can protect the land for future generations.

   Mr. BOSWELL. I think all of you have been watching the news the last few days out in the Midwest and Iowa. This is the Iowa delegation here, of course. 
   It's been tough, it's been really rugged, and I think you know that, because you've been watching the news. It's devastating to communities to see what's going on when you have a flood. I know last Saturday, for example, all of us have been in and out of the emergency operating centers, and I flew over the district, flew up to Vinton, Iowa, those of you know. I went close to Waterloo and then down to Belle Plaine, around up to Vinton and then down over Iowa City, Cedar Rapids. It was really tough. 
   When you see a little town where all you see is rooftops, you know that there is a lot of pain there, fields flooded and so on. We are just very appreciative that the people have really bonded together. 
   I will just say this, and I would guess every one of us could bear testimony. For example, I was talking to some of the folks in one of the emergency operations centers, and after he told me all the things that were going on there, losing their power plant, this, that and many things, I said, how are you feeling? 
   They said, you know, we're like family. It's bonded us together, and we're going to conquer this. We hope that we could, of course, have some help. 
   I was reminded of that just yesterday when I was here for a moment of personal privilege, or the 1-minute, as we call it, and was asked to give the Pledge, and so I did. Of course, the part of the pledge that says ``one Nation, under God, indivisible,'' and that word ``indivisible'' all of a sudden meant so much to me, because we are a great country, and we won't have to face this alone. We know that. 
   I wanted to appreciate that to all of you. All the damage to businesses and homes and everything else is tough, and that's all up and down the whole way from Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana or Illinois, Missouri, right on down the river. That whole area is under this. Businesses and homes can be rebuilt, but lives are lost and suffering takes place. Over 20 at this point that we know about. 
   If I could, Madam Chairman, I would like to ask us to take a moment of silence in memory of those that are suffering at this time.

   Madam Chairman, how many times do we have to hear over and over and over from the borrow-and-spend community across the aisle here? I hope that they would remember there are positive things that happened. 
   We brought the livestock community together. They are moving forward. It is good for America. We brought the dairy community together. For perhaps the first time, there is no dairy war going on because they sat down in a compromise. We can't thank them enough. You might remember that. Also, we addressed the issue of mandatory country of origin labeling. We worked out a compromise. We are going to go forward and meet the consumers' wishes on that. 
   As chairman of the Livestock, Dairy and Poultry Subcommittee, I cannot say how pleased I am for those compromises and the overall steps this legislation takes. Is there still room for improvement? Sure, there is. But the Agriculture Committee came together and wrote a farm bill for 50 States that would not only benefit farmers, ranchers and rural America, but benefits everyone. 
   As everyone walks away today at the time when we finish this bill, I would like them to remember one thing: Every man, woman and child has a vested interest in agriculture. By ensuring that our producers have an adequate safety net, we in turn ensure we have the safest, most plentiful and affordable food in the world.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, first I support this bill. It is a good bill, and it protects the Constitution. 
   I would like to speak principally to my colleagues who, like me, are concerned about what the bill does and the fact that it does not address fully the issue of carrier liability. As you know, the administration and telecommunication companies have requested that we provide them with immunity from lawsuits or prosecutions arising out of information and assistance they may have provided to the intelligence community. 
   Now, we don't precisely know what information they have provided. We don't know what they were told by the administration about the legality of what they were doing. I hope and believe those companies acted in good faith with patriotism. They were trying to do their part for national security, and I think they deserve our appreciation. I take seriously their concerns that they might be subject to liability. 
   That being said, I don't believe it should be the responsibility of the telecommunications companies to prove that they provided the information in a legal way if the Federal Government fails to meet the burden of proof that the demand or request for information is brought forth in a legal manner. If that burden of proof is not met, it should be the government that should be held primarily accountable. 
   I believe that eventually we should be able to take care of any company who acted in good faith and cooperated in the name of protecting our Nation.  No one who acted out of good faith with a desire to protect America should be punished. But we must know what brought forth their action, and under what circumstances, and what pressure, if any, they acted. As this process moves forward, I expect to get more information from the administration on their generation of the demands or requests for information. Support the bill.

I have to take note that there is almost a self-righteousness of those that have been in charge for all these years and want to criticize, you have only had the driving of this ship for 4 months. You're doing a good job. Keep your head up and keep going forward and the country will be safer.  
   This bill does a number of things. One thing for sure that we recognize, all of us that have served in this capacity, that the people that go out there and gather intelligence, they put it on the line. The things they do, if the Nation understood the risks they take, the things they will do to try to make us safe, they would be very appreciative.     
   This bill also recognizes something that we have been overlooking now for several years, that there is a need to increase the gathering of information or opportunities for people to learn languages. Around the world, this world we live in, there is much need to have innovative ways to explore new language opportunities. The need is there. This bill will require that, and that is a good step forward at least. 
   It also recognizes the need to take an aggressive approach to the gaps in our knowledge about Korea and Iran and around the world. We know there is a threat there and we are going to have to do more about it. We have tried before; we are trying again. This bill will do it and require the DNI to report back to us on a quarterly basis so we can assess and give oversight and do a better job of recognizing this need.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Before I explain the amendment, I would like to thank Ms. Johnson and Mr. Oberstar for their hard work. We have finally got something out here to work with. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentleman from Florida for working together with us. It is something that our country needed very, very badly, and was overdue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment that is highly important to the State of Iowa constituents and also a number of folks in northern Missouri. As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I would like to especially give my appreciation for this opportunity that is before us today. 
   My amendment is critical to the future availability of quality drinking water for farmers, residents and businesses in southern Iowa and northern Missouri. Rathbun Regional Water Association is the largest rural water system in Iowa and one of the largest in the United States. Rathbun Regional Water Association supplies potable water to 60,000 people in the rural areas of 15 counties and 41 communities in southern Iowa and northern Missouri from the association's water treatment plant at Rathbun Lake. Rathbun Lake is the source of raw water for the treatment plant. 
   Rathbun Rural Water Association has experienced steady growth in the demand for potable water. In response to this demand, Rathbun Rural Water Association doubled the capacity of its treatment plant in 2000 and made improvements to its distribution system. 
   Rathbun Rural Water Association has completed an analysis of future water demand in its service territory. This analysis indicates that Rathbun Regional Water Association must take steps to meet continued growth in demand for potable water. The ability to secure the rights of the remaining drinking water pool in Lake Rathbun, a facility managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is critical to meet demand. 
   There are 15,000 acre-feet of water supply storage in Rathbun Lake. Rathbun Regional Water Association has purchased the rights to 6,680 acre-feet of this water and storage from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is essential that they be able to acquire the rights of the remaining over 8,000 acre-feet of water supply storage in Rathbun Lake in order to satisfy the growing demand for potable water in its service territory. This remaining acre-feet in water would provide access to approximately 2.7 billion gallons of water. 
   The amendment submitted today takes two critical steps to ensure the availability of water for the region. First, it directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to grant Rathbun Rural Water the right of first refusal to contract for any increment of the remaining water supply storage allocation in Rathbun Lake. This language is in accordance with the recommendations in the Rathbun Lake Reallocation Report approved by the chief of engineers on July 22, 1985. 
   Second, it allows Rathbun Regional Water Association to contract for the remaining water supply storage allocation in total, or incrementally as dictated by the demand of the potable water demand in the association's service territory, at such time as the full amount of storage may be purchased. 
   This amendment ensures access to quality water supply for rural residents, small communities and businesses in southern Iowa and northern Missouri. It enables Rathbun Rural Water to better manage the expense of purchasing water storage allocation in a manner that reduces the financial burden on its customers and ensures the vitality of Rathbun Regional Water Association to fulfill its commitment to an extensive rural area. 
   I join with my colleague from Iowa, Congressman Loebsack, in this request, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   One of my specific concerns in FISA reform over the last year has been finding a way to protect reasonable private companies, who assisted government out of patriotism. 
   This bill does that. It doesn't give anyone a free pass, but it allows companies to come before the courts and make their case in order to be protected from lawsuits. 
   That's a good result, and I thank Chairman Reyes for his work in reaching this reasonable bipartisan compromise.

   Mr. BOSWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this opportunity to speak. I rise in support of this legislation. 
   Much has been said these past years about the extent of the U.S. engagement in Iraq. The Iraqi people have made progress. Saddam is gone. They have had elections. We are told they have got over 300,000 Iraqi police and soldiers trained, equipped, and in the field. They are engaged in a civil war, and we cannot be involved in trying to referee that. As well as others in this body, I have been given assurances that they have that many troops. 
   I believe the war in Iraq has had a serious negative effect on the readiness of our brave men and women in uniform who are serving with honor and distinction. Their deployments and, oftentimes, redeployments without adequate time at home to rest and train is affecting our Nation's ability to meet future contingencies. As it stands today, listen up, as it stands today, we do not have, repeat, do not have a single combat-ready brigade ready to be deployed. 
   The United States cannot chart the destiny of the people of Iraq. The Iraqi Government must take responsibility for its own nation, and this legislation puts us on the path to see to that worthy and noble cause.

   I want to thank them for this amendment that he has agreed to withdraw, and to say the following: that the moving renewable industry and its impact on feed cost has been something that the House Agriculture Committee has monitored closely. The Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry even held a hearing on this issue earlier this year. 
   As the United States moves toward energy independence and a stronger renewable fuel base, the cost of production has increased for our producers. This issue affects my district especially, since it is one of the largest and a major ethanol producing area. 
   We must work together, and we will work together, to find the balance between feed and fuel, and ensure that one important industry is not hurt by the other. So I encourage my distinguished colleague to withdraw his amendment, with the understanding that I will work with him in conference or wherever to make sure his concern about the cost of feed and fuel is incorporated in the final version of this bill for dairy producers.

   Some parts of Iowa were hit by windstorms, tornado, and then almost immediately followed with flood. So we were hit pretty hard.

We appreciate it very much, and she was able to say, because of the confidence that I'm sure she has in not only her leadership but in this institution, that we do stand together when it comes to natural disasters, and that's been our history. 
   So I'm very appreciative of this. It will be a great help to homeowners, small businesses, getting levees put back in place, and preparing for whatever Mother Nature may bring us next. 
   I thank you again for the time. I appreciate again your good, hard work.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOSWELL. (TREATMENT OF FARMS WITH LIMITED BASE ACRES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOSWELL. Madam Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. I want to thank my good friend and colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Etheridge) and Mr. Goodlatte and the rest of you for us coming together and correcting this error that's taken place, or this misrepresentation. 
   As the cosponsor of H.R. 6849, I'm extremely pleased the full House has taken action today so that Iowa and the Nation's small working farmers across the Nation will have an opportunity for an adequate safety net. The legislation suspends a provision in the new farm bill which prohibits producers farming 10 acres or less to receive USDA payments. 
   Now hear this. When the farm bill was drafted and during the conference process, it was the intent of Congress to allow farmers to aggregate their base acres, to bring them together. This is evident by the Joint Explanatory Statement of the managers that accompanied the 2008 farm bill which clearly states, ``The managers intend for the department to allow for aggregation of farms for purposes of determining the suspension of payments on farms with 10 base acres or less.'' 
   This needs to be corrected. I ask that everybody that would participate to be sure we make this clear and make sure small farmers will be taken care of. The USDA has misrepresented Congress' intent putting thousands of small producers at risk. 
   I would like to urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
