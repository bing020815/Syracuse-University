<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 6003. I commend Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Members Mica and Shuster for this bill. 
   This bill provides a vision for the future of passenger rail in the U.S. It provides the necessary investments to modernize our antiquated system. 
   Of special significance is section 217 which provides significant resources to Amtrak and to the States to address key chokepoints that slow down travel and commerce and cause unnecessary pollution from stalled trains. Illinois has already dedicated more funding to improve Amtrak's service. So I am pleased that the committee report addresses several critical bottlenecks reported by Amtrak that affect Illinois residents, including the Heritage Corridor line, which links Chicago to Joliet, as well other key routes from Chicago to Carbondale, Detroit, Michigan, and Porter, Indiana. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6003 puts American passenger rail back on track, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and Amtrak to improve and expand passenger rail service in our country. I urge passage of this visionary bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1716, the Green Energy Education Act of 2007. I'd like to thank Mr. McCaul and Mr. Hill for their leadership on this important legislation. 
   This bill authorizes the Department of Energy to contribute funds to the National Science Foundation's successful Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program, known as IGERT. IGERT awards prepare doctoral students by integrating research and education in innovative ways that are tailored to the unique requirement of newly emerging interdisciplinary fields and new career options. 
   Many future green energy technologies, such as thin film solar technologies, will require interdisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers such as those trained under the IGERT program. 
   This bill also authorizes the Department of Energy's high-performance-building technology programs to contribute to the National Science Foundation's ongoing curriculum development activities with the goal of improving the ability of engineers and architects to design and construct high-performance buildings. 
   Innovative technologies, coupled with a whole-buildings approach that optimizes interactions among building systems and components, enable buildings to use considerably less energy, while also helping to meet national goals for sustainable development, environmental protection and energy security. 
   The high-performance, or green, building movement is growing rapidly, but it is still a very small slice of the multibillion dollar building industry; and there's a real gap in university level education and training for the next generation of green building professionals. This bill helps address that gap. 
   In summary, this bill addresses a critical need to provide resources to universities to update their curricula and research efforts in alternative energy and high-performance buildings, and it improves coordination between the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation in achieving this goal. 
   I'm pleased to support H.R. 1716, the Green Energy Education Act of 2007. Again, I want to commend Mr. McCaul and Mr. Hill for this important legislation; and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1716. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is another great effort that we are making, another important step in helping to reduce our energy consumption in this country. It's critical for national security, our economic security and to combat global climate change, and certainly energy efficient buildings, great work is being done in this, and much more work needs to be done. 
   I have seen at the Department of Energy lab the work that is being done on some of this. I think much more needs to be done. This bill will help to provide these opportunities for more students, more people to learn about what it takes to make our buildings more energy efficient. 
   Again, I commend Mr. McCaul and Mr. Hill for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (H-PRIZE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 632, the H-Prize Act of 2007, an innovative bill I introduced, along with Mr. Inglis of South Carolina, and that we passed in this House last year by a vote of 416-6. 
   America faces a great challenge today, finding a new clean energy source that will free us from our dependence on foreign oil and will combat global climate change. Hydrogen has great potential to be this new source and the H-Prize Act will help focus America's technological and entrepreneurial talent on making it happen. 
   Hydrogen-fuel cars already exist. Last year I had the opportunity to drive a hydrogen-fuel car. It didn't drive much differently than a gas-powered car, except for the silence, silence that I am used to somewhat from driving a hybrid. But that was the only real performance difference. There is no performance difference. The only difference I know of is the silence. 
   But there are really currently significant technical and economic barriers that must still be overcome before we can put a hydrogen car in every American garage. Current hydrogen-powered vehicles cost about $1 million. But while several significant technological advances are necessary, they are within reach. 
   Just yesterday, it was reported in the Chicago Tribune that engineers at Purdue University are researching methods of producing hydrogen gas by combining aluminum with another metal, gallium, and adding water. This research could yield ways of overcoming hydrogen storage problems, allowing automobile engines to burn this gas with little modification. 
   While we must continue to invest in traditional grants to fund university research, we in Congress have the responsibility to find creative and new ways to inspire researchers, business leaders and our youth to solve the problems that society faces today. 
   The H-Prize will help expand the possibility of hydrogen research, promoting people not normally involved in Federal research to explore one of the greatest challenges facing us today. 
   Specifically, this legislation would establish competitively awarded cash prizes to spur innovations that advance the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transportation. Every 2 years, four $1 million prizes would be given for advances in the production, storage, distribution and utilization of hydrogen, and one $4 million prize would be awarded for advances in prototype hydrogen vehicles. At the end of 10 years, one grand prize of $10 million would be given for a transformational advance in hydrogen energy technology. 
   In addition to this $10 million grand prize, we are also seeking to raise up to $40 million to add to that grand prize, $40 million in private contributions. 
   When these advances are made, hydrogen can fill critical energy needs even beyond transportation. Hydrogen will also be used to provide heat and generate electricity. The future possibilities of this energy source are enormous. 
   Most importantly, hydrogen will be a clean, domestic energy source. When used for energy, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water, zero emissions, an amazing advance over current energy resources. By utilizing hydrogen, we can improve our national security by lessening our dependence on foreign oil that often comes from unstable countries. 
   Mr. Speaker, America has always been at the forefront of technological breakthroughs. We have responded to great challenges, perhaps most famously, President John F. Kennedy's challenge to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. We have seen that prizes have been an effective way to inspire technological advances. 
   Perhaps most famously the prize won by Lindbergh for his successful nonstop flight across the Atlantic. More recently, the Ansari X-Prize given to the first private team to build and fly a spaceship 100 kilometers above earth. The H-Prize is patterned after this X-Prize. 
   We have seen that challenges and prizes help to spark the imagination of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, who invest blood, sweat, tears and often large sums of money, sums of money even larger than the prizes being given, to achieve a great goal. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill today. Perhaps one day we will look back on the H-Prize as a catalyst to a better, cleaner, more secure America and world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is another great example of what we have been able to do on the Science and Technology Committee by working together in a bipartisan manner. Led by Chairman Gordon, working with Ranking Member Hall, I hope that we can continue this cooperation on other critical issues related to America's future technological competitiveness, energy dependence and global climate change. This is the type of bipartisan work we need to continue to be doing to make progress. 
   I'd also like to thank Mr. Inglis for all the work he has done on this. We worked on this bill last year. We worked together on that, and Mr. Inglis is the one who came forward at that time with the original idea on this. He's worked very well. We have continued to work to make progress, and I'm very hopeful that this year we have worked with the Senate and the administration. We can get this past not just the House but signed into law. Because I think this H-Prize act has really great potential. It has the great potential to solve the great energy challenge we face today. But perhaps it may be most important in spurring the imagination of our youth, our most valuable resource in this country. 
   I remember in the 1970s there was great excitement about alternative energy. There was an environmental movement, and there was the gasoline crisis, and there was great interest in helping clean up the environment, investing in alternative energy. 
   It's something that really got me excited. I was caught up in it when I was in grade school back in the 1970s. I remember I did my eighth grade science  fair project on solar energy. That was back in 1980. We saw, unfortunately, though, that the interest in alternative energy really dropped off after that time. Not only interest, but then Federal funding dropped off.     
   Just in talking to the Science Coalition this morning, they talked about how critical that was when that research funding dropped off. We can't afford to let that happen again. But what did happen with me is it really inspired me, got me interested. I went out and got a degree in mechanical engineering, and although I did not continue down that road, today I bring that background to this House and continue to work on these issues, understanding the importance of this issue and understanding the importance of the Federal Government's really investing in our future and especially in alternative energy. And these challenges are great. We must really confront them. 
   So today maybe this H-Prize Act will inspire another child out there today. He or she may become an engineer or a scientist or an entrepreneur who plays a hand in the next technological breakthrough. So there is great hope with this H-Prize Act. And today, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me by passing this bill, and hopefully in the future we can look back to today and see it as a major change and a major move forward for America and for the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment which would provide $1 million in funding for the Law Enforcement Tribute Act Program. This program provides one-time grants to help State and local governments complete permanent tributes that honor law enforcement and public safety officers who have been killed or seriously injured in the line of duty. 
   There are currently 17,917 names engraved on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC, including 928 from my home State of Illinois. But many communities also want to honor their law enforcement heroes with local memorials or permanent tributes. The Law Enforcement Tribute Act Program provides support to States and localities to help them do this. Without this support, many communities would not be financially able to provide these worthy tributes. 
   The Law Enforcement Tribute Act Program was authorized in fiscal year 2002 at $3 million per year, but no funding has been appropriated since 2003. 
   Last year, this Chamber approved a similar amendment by voice vote when I offered it with Representatives Adam Schiff and Tom Davis. Unfortunately, that amendment, like the appropriations bill it was included in, never became law. Today, we have an opportunity to once again approve funding that will help communities honor all of those local heroes who have given so much to protect us. 
   This amendment has the strong support of law enforcement groups all over the country, including the National Association of Police Organizations. 
   Mr. Chairman, law enforcement and public safety officers dedicate their career and their lives to protecting us. Tributes provide us with a constant reminder of the sacrifices that they have made. The least we can do is help local communities honor these brave men and women. 
   I urge my colleagues today to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 59, supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
   National Engineers Week takes place this year February 18 through February 24. This is not a random week that is chosen; it is chosen because this is the week that we celebrate George Washington's birthday. George Washington is widely recognized as our Nation's first engineer. 
   Engineers have helped make our country great from their service in the American Revolution to developing key modern industries, such as aerospace and energy. I would like to honor and recognize the more than 2 million engineers in the United States and the contributions that they have made to our country. 
   Engineers are at the forefront of human advances because engineers combine imagination and creativity, with math and science training to solve problems. Engineers are not just builders, as they are sometimes envisioned; they are problem solvers. This is one of the first things I was taught when I was a graduate student at Stanford University in the department of engineering economic systems. 
   Engineers in the past have helped build the boats to cross the seas, railroads to take us west, and the Internet to communicate with the world. We need the innovative capability of engineers to confront the problems and challenges before us today. Engineers will help Americans develop energy independence, find solutions to confront global climate change, and make our Nation more secure. 
   I have a unique perspective as only one of a handful of engineers in Congress. Besides my Master's degree from Stanford, I earned a Bachelor's degree  from Northwestern University in mechanical engineering. I have seen that America is falling behind other countries in this discipline. U.S. students continue to score below international averages on math and science tests. It has been reported that in 2004 China graduated more than six times the number of engineers that graduated in the U.S. 
   On a recent tour of Northern Illinois University's college of engineering and engineering technology, I again heard how few Americans are getting engineering degrees, especially graduate degrees. It is great that America has such top universities that we are attracting some of the brightest minds from around the world to come to study here, but we are beginning to lose more and more of these students when they graduate and they go back home. This is harmful to America's future. 
   In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences released a report entitled, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which raised questions about America's future technological competitiveness. This report echoed by the President of the United States in the State of the Union address last year emphasized the need for government to take a number of actions, including addressing the potential for a shortage of engineers. 
   We must act quickly to take up this challenge. We cannot let another year go by and we cannot afford to let our economic future falter, and that future requires continuing technological innovation supplied by our Nation's engineers. 
   National Engineers Week seeks to raise public awareness about engineers' contributions to society and our quality of life. It has inspired future engineers for more than 50 years. Founded by the National Society of Professional Engineers, including more than 100 society, government, and business sponsors and affiliates, including Boeing, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the American Council of Engineering Companies, National Engineers Week draws upon local and regional experts to promote high levels of math, science, and technology literacy. Annually, it reaches thousands of parents, teachers, and students in communities across the country. 
   From national and regional engineering competitions such as the Future City Competition, to events such as Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day, this week helps inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists.     
   If we are going to produce more American engineers, one needed step is to improve STEM education, that is science, technology, engineering and math education. But we must also do more to inspire our children to become interested in engineering. 
   When I was growing up in Chicago, I was fascinated in learning how things work, as most kids are. I remember it was Father Fergus who taught me physics in high school at St. Ignatius, and in that class he took my childhood fascination with how things worked and got me interested in engineering. He spurred me to follow up on that when I went to college. 
   We need events such as National Engineers Week and things that go on within the week to help encourage and inspire more kids to go into engineering. We have to do everything we can to inspire future engineers so that America continues its leadership in this increasingly competitive world. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Inglis) for his involvement also with this National Engineers Week resolution. And I would like to especially thank the engineers that contributed so much to America and to honor them for their commitment to continue working to better our society. 
   I ask my colleagues to support H. Res. 59 in its deserved recognition. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I thank Mr. Inglis, Mr. Gingrey and Mr. Hall for their support on this resolution. As an engineer but also as a former political science professor, I do not want to disparage political science whatsoever. However, it is clear that America does need more engineers, and to do this we have to value engineers and engineering much more in this country. 
   I am very hopeful that this resolution is going to be the first step that this Congress takes to not only honor our current engineers but also inspire more American children to become engineers and to find the solutions to the challenges that we face today. 
   We need to do more. We need to take more steps. We need to improve science, technology, engineering, math, known as STEM education. We need more R&D funding; but today, let us just take this first step and urge my colleagues to take this first step. Vote for H. Res. 59 and honor engineers during National Engineers Week.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day, as America takes a big step forward in combating global climate change and breaking the grip that ``Big Oil'' companies and OPEC have on our Nation. That is why I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007--a bill that will put us on a path to energy independence, while creating millions of new jobs and addressing climate change. 
   America has always been at the forefront of technological breakthroughs. We have responded to great challenges, perhaps most famously President John F. Kennedy's challenge to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. I am confident that this legislation will provide America with the momentum it needs to move our country into a new energy economy. 
   Unfortunately, I am disappointed that the other body was unable to retain the House-passed language to repeal tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. Especially at a time of record high gas prices and record high corporate profits, this excessively prosperous industry should be paying its fair share. This revenue is needed to fund clean, renewable energies like wind, solar, and geothermal, as well as other important advanced technologies like plug-in electric vehicles, which will speed our path to energy independence. I will continue this fight against ``Big Oil'' and work to break the death grip that they have on American consumers. And I will continue to push for billions of dollars in tax incentives to jumpstart our cutting-edge renewable energy industries. 
   I am also not happy with the removal of the Renewable Electricity Standard from the final bill. This provision, which would have required utilities to generate 15 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, would have gone a very long way in reducing America's addiction to fossil fuels. With most States already pursuing renewable electricity portfolios, including an Illinois mandate of 25 percent by 2025, I will work to make sure Congress addresses this issue soon. 
   As vice-chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, I am pleased to have played an important role in not only getting this bill passed, but also in contributing two important provisions. The H-Prize Act of 2007, a bill I introduced with Representative INGLIS of South Carolina, establishes over $50 million in competitively awarded cash prizes to spur innovations that advance the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transportation. While hydrogen-fueled cars already exist, there are significant technical and economic barriers that must still be overcome before we can put a hydrogen car in every American garage. The H-Prize will help expand the possibilities of hydrogen research, promoting people not normally involved in federal research and development to explore one of the greatest challenges facing us today. And when these advances are made, hydrogen can fill critical energy needs beyond transportation. Hydrogen will also be used to provide heat and generate electricity. The future possibilities for this energy source are huge. And most importantly, hydrogen will be a clean, domestic energy source, producing no emissions besides water. 
   I am also very happy about the inclusion of the BRIGHT (Bulb Replacement In Government with High-Efficiency Technology) Energy Savings Act, which I introduced and shepherded through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. This provision requires the federal government--the Nation's largest energy consumer--to use high-efficiency light bulbs in 1,800 civilian office buildings. This change will significantly reduce energy consumption--about 75 percent savings for each of more than 3 million bulbs--saving tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, in addition to saving energy and cutting down on the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this groundbreaking legislation. This is not a perfect bill, and I will work to make sure we revisit this issue, especially the repeal of the taxes on ``Big Oil.'' But this is a great step forward for America and for our environment. I am confident that one day we will look back on this bill as that catalyst that led to a better, cleaner, more secure America and world.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and in support of protecting one of America's most critical natural treasures, the Great Lakes. I thank Chairman Oberstar, Mr. Emanuel, and Mr. Ehlers for their work on this issue in helping to protect the lakes. 
   Through Federal regulations and State and local cooperation, we have made great strides in cleaning up the Great Lakes. Right now we cannot step back. I am deeply troubled by BP's plan to significantly increase their dumping of ammonia and other pollutants into Lake Michigan. All of these pollutants can cause harm to the environment and to public health. Over 40 million people in the Chicago area get their drinking water from Lake Michigan, and it is critical to tourism, recreation and the fishing industry. We should not be doing less to protect the Great Lakes. We should be doing more, such as passing legislation I introduced with Mark Kirk to stop municipalities from dumping waste into the lakes. 
   While it is good to increase our national energy security and to create new jobs, this cannot come at the expense of public health and the quality of our environment. That is why BP must do everything possible to lower pollution emissions into Lake Michigan. BP talks the talk about protecting the environment. It is time for BP to walk the walk and protect the lake. The step forward today is to pass this resolution and send BP this message.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Private First Class Omar E. Torres, a courageous young soldier who died in Iraq on August 22. 
   Omar Torres grew up on Chicago's southwest side and played football at De La Salle High School. After graduating in 2005, Torres received a full ride scholarship to attend The Ohio State University. 
   During his freshman year at OSU, Torres followed his strong desire to serve his country and joined the U.S. Army Reserves. This decision led to his activation during his sophomore year, and in May of 2007, Torres was deployed to Iraq as part of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. 
   Although his mission was hazardous, Private Torres bravely and honorably  carried out his duties. Sadly on August 22, PFC Torres was killed by an IED while patrolling Baghdad. He was only 20 years old. 
   Aside from his military service to our Nation, Omar Torres was interested in politics and had a strong desire to work for positive change in our country. While attending his wake last month, I was moved by the large number of lives PFC Torres had touched. 
   Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning the loss of Private First Class Omar E. Torres. We will never forget his sacrifice and are forever indebted to him, as well as to all our soldiers. Our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies are with the Torres family and friends in this difficult time.

   Phillip Brodnick was born in Mokena, Illinois, and lived in Burbank until he was 8. He then moved to Frankfurt, Illinois and graduated in 2000 from Lincoln-Way High School. After graduation, Brodnick's desire to serve his country led him to enlist in the Army, and he soon served a 2-year tour of duty in Kosovo before being discharged in 2002. 
   However, the country's need and Brodnick's desire to serve led him to re-enlist in the Army in 2005. 
   In August of 2006, Brodnick was deployed to Iraq as part of the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division based out of Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. His excellent service, leadership and ability were soon recognized, leading to a recent promotion to the rank of corporal. 
   Although initially scheduled to return home in June, Corporal Brodnick dutifully accepted a 4-month tour extension in Iraq. Tragically, on August 22, Corporal Brodnick and 13 other soldiers were killed when the Black Hawk helicopter they were on crashed. He was only 25 years old. 
   Aside from his military service to our Nation, Corporal Brodnick is remembered as patriotic and as a great friend and also as an animal lover who always looked out for his family. He aspired to one day follow in his father's footsteps and become a police officer. 
   While attending his wake last week, I was moved by the large number of lives that Corporal Brodnick had touched in his 25 short years. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning the loss of Corporal Phillip J. Brodnick. We will never forget his sacrifice and are forever indebted to him, as well as all of our soldiers who have died for making the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (REAUTHORIZING THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM ENERGY CONSERVATION AND TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 1988 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1126, legislation reauthorizing the Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988, also known as the Metals Initiative. 
   Today, the steel industry and other metals industry, including aluminum and copper, are important parts of our national economy; and they must remain innovative in order to stay competitive in the increasingly global economy. It is vital to ensure that these industries are fully prepared to confront the challenges they face. This bill will help develop the innovative tools needed to grow valuable American jobs and businesses, and to protect the environment, by tapping into good old-fashioned American ingenuity. 
   Originally passed by the 100th Congress, the Metals Initiative authorizes Federal cost-sharing of research whose goals are threefold: first, enhancing energy efficiency; second, increasing the competitiveness of American industries; and, third, improving the environment through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
   More specifically, this legislation promotes collaborative, public-private cost-shared research between American industry, the Department of Energy, and institutions of higher education. The bill would reauthorize the Metals Initiative at $12 million per year for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012 to fund advanced metals research. 
   The success of the American steel industry has a special personal significance to me. My father-in-law was a steelworker at Bethlehem Steel in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, until he lost his job when his plant closed due to foreign competition. This bill will help prevent further loss of good American jobs like his by using American innovation to increase the competitiveness of our domestic industry. 
   While American industries have significantly modernized, the pace of technology and the competition from overseas is relentless. Reauthorization of this bill is essential to grow American jobs, keep the customers of metal industries strong, and ensure that we have a domestic supply of the materials we need for our national defense. 
   The results of this program speak for themselves. Since its inception, the Metals Initiative has delivered numerous technologies to the factory floor, resulting in incredible environmental and energy savings while increasing the competitive position of the steel industry and the domestic manufacturing sector. 
   In the Chicago area, schools such as my alma mater Northwestern University have participated in this program, as well as companies such as IPSCO. Because of the advances made in steel production, partially through the industry's partnership with DOE, the steel industry as a whole used 28 percent less energy per ton in 2004 than it did in 1990. 
   In addition, this research has produced several successful and important technological breakthroughs, including the development of advanced high-strength steels and ultra-lightweight steel automobile bodies, meaning lighter, safer and more energy-efficient cars. 
   Recently, these advanced technologies were applied to a new, lightweight military vehicle, yielding performance improvements including 25 percent weight savings and 50 percent fuel efficiency improvements. Through this partnership program, the U.S. Army now has a next generation tactical vehicle that is agile and responsive. These advances, applied to the civilian versions of the vehicle, add a substantial further positive impact to our Nation's economy. 
   It is also important to note that the Federal funds in this program are given to the schools to conduct the research. Companies are not the recipients of funds, and they must provide a share of the cost of the research. But the American company that provides that match has the first opportunity to take advantage of the research findings and improve their manufacturing operations, benefiting American workers. 
   H.R. 1126 is simply a great example of how public-private partnership can benefit American workers and taxpayers, while saving energy, improving the environment, and accelerating the development and implementation of modern technology. 
   All Americans can benefit from commonsense programs such as this one, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1126. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, this bill represents a great example of what we can be doing and should be doing in this country. We have legislation here that takes advantage of our great American universities and all of the knowledge, wisdom that is there, the research ability of these institutions, and puts that together with American industry to come up with ways that we can both save American jobs, grow American jobs, and help to protect the environment. 
   As Representative Hall said, a dollar in this program saves a barrel of oil. It is a great opportunity and a great example of what we should be doing more of here in this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 917, supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
   Founded by the National Society of Professional Engineers and including more than 100 society, government and business sponsors and affiliates, including Boeing and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, National Engineers Week draws upon local and regional experts to recognize the contributions of engineers and to promote careers in engineering. 
   From national and regional engineering competitions, such as the Future City Competition, to events such as Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day, this week is intended to inspire the next generation of American engineers and scientists. 
   National Engineers Week takes place next week, just as it does every year, to commemorate the birthday of George Washington, one of our Nation's greatest engineers. Engineers have helped make our country great, from the American Revolution to the development of key modern industries, such as the aerospace industry, as well as various alternative industries. Engineers are at the forefront of human advances because engineers combine creativity with math and science training to solve problems. Engineers are not just builders, as they are sometimes envisioned, they are problem solvers. This is one of the first things I was taught when I was a graduate student at Stanford University in the Department of Engineering-Economic Systems. Engineering is problem solving. 
   I have a unique perspective in Congress as one of fewer than 10 engineers currently serving. Besides my master's degree from Stanford, I earned a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in mechanical engineering. It is of great concern that America has fallen behind other countries in producing engineers. When I have toured engineering schools, whether it's been at Northwestern University, Stanford University, Northern Illinois University or the Illinois Institute of Technology, I have heard again and again how few Americans are getting engineering degrees, especially graduate degrees in engineering. It is great that America has such top universities that we are attracting some of the brightest minds from around the world to study here, but we are losing more and more of those students when they graduate and go back home. 
   Engineers in the past helped us build boats across the seas, railroads to take us west, and the Internet to communicate across the world. Today, we need the innovative capability of engineers more than ever to confront the new challenges before us. 
   A few years ago, the National Academy of Sciences report entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' raised serious questions about America's future technological competitiveness. This report called for the Federal Government to take a number of actions, including addressing the potential for a shortage of good engineers. I am proud that Chairman Gordon and the Science and Technology Committee on which I serve as vice chairman answered the report's call and took action to bolster America's competitiveness. Last summer, Congress passed and the President signed into law the America COMPETES Act. This groundbreaking law invests more in education, especially in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math, and increases investment in critical research and development. 
   America COMPETES has created new awards for outstanding early-career researchers and new graduate research assistantships in technological areas of national need. These investments will greatly benefit our Nation's engineers, helping America stay at the forefront of innovation and increasing our national, economic and environmental security. Indeed, America's engineers are a critical component in developing and employing the innovative technologies necessary to carry out many of the provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act, the landmark energy law passed at the end of last year. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Inglis) for his work on this resolution, as well as the 45 other cosponsors. And I would especially like to thank the engineers who have contributed so much to America, especially the 2 million engineers in America today. 
   I ask my colleagues to support H. Res. 917. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for his work on this resolution. And as a fellow engineer, I could not agree more that we could use a few more engineers here in this body. 
   I just wanted to say, I mentioned earlier that I have an engineering background, and it really does give a unique perspective. But I think one of the  most important things about National Engineers Week is the inspiration that we are looking to provide. 
   I remember when I was a kid growing up in Chicago, I was always fascinated by the way things work, especially mechanical things. I remember with my high school calculus and physics teachers, Father Thul and Father Fergus, they were the ones who really helped mold this childhood fascination into an interest in engineering. And I have seen a lot of the work that is done in National Engineers Week to try to provide this inspiration for students who are out there today. 
   I think this is very critical, as we face so many problems going into the future with energy, that we try and take care of global warming and so many other issues that we face. We need to have more engineers in this country to help us solve these problems. National Engineers Week is a great place to help provide inspiration so we have more engineers. And this resolution provides some more inspiration out there, hopefully, for some students who are watching this, listening to this, reading this later on, that we do need more engineers. I want to encourage that. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote in support of H. Res. 917.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1834, the National Ocean Exploration and National Undersea Research Program Act. 
   I would like to first thank our colleague, Representative Saxton from the Natural Resources Committee, for his leadership on important ocean and Great Lakes issues. This is a good bill that will expand our knowledge of the ocean and provide information about the vast resources of the seas. 
   The coastal areas of our Nation support a wide variety of significant activities, but in many respects the oceans remain a mystery, with many areas unexplored. Marine scientists tell us that we haven't come close to tapping the resources available to us from the oceans. I hope that my colleagues today from both sides of the aisle will agree that we should steer research dollars to those fact-finding projects so that humanity might one day reap the benefits of our oceanic resources. 
   This bill provides the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, with the authorities and direction to support a vigorous ocean exploration program. The bill authorizes two programs to be carried out by NOAA. The Ocean Exploration Program will explore and survey the ocean and assess ocean and costal resources. The National Undersea Research Program will operate through a network of regional undersea research centers. Both of those programs have strong education and outreach programs. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1834 is a good bill. It is a product of a bipartisan effort to promote expanded appreciation  and knowledge of the oceans. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 521, the Lane Evans Post Office Bill. By naming this Post Office after our distinguished former colleague, we pay tribute to Lane Evans and recognize his long, distinguished career of public service. 
   Prior to being elected to the House of Representatives in 1983, Lane Evans served in the Marine Corps at the time of the Vietnam War. His experience in the military and his firsthand knowledge of veterans' issues led Lane to become a leading advocate for veterans during his time in Congress. On issues such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, homelessness among veterans, and the aftereffects of exposure to Agent Orange, Lane Evans consistently took the lead in crafting real policy solutions. Lane's leadership on veterans' issues was formally recognized in 1995, when he was named Ranking Member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. 
   In addition, Lane always dutifully served his constituents and the state of Illinois. He was a strong advocate for working Americans and was one of the first to see the need for renewable forms of energy such as ethanol. 
   With Lane Evans' decision to not seek reelection last year, Congress, Illinois, and the nation lost a great public servant. Now, by naming a Post Office after our former colleague, we can say thanks to Lane, and lift up his impressive legacy of service as an example for others to follow.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Chairman, I want to commend Chairman Olver, Ranking Member Knollenberg and Chairman Obey for their hard work in crafting this bill. 
   One thing I want to specifically focus on here is the provision of $35 million for the Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Program. This was authorized under the SAFETEA-LU transportation bill, but has not been funded up until now. 
   Under this program grants would be provided to a wide range of rail projects throughout the Nation that would fill various critical needs, including safety improvements, congestion mitigation, quiet zone creation, and the facilitation of local economic development. 
   For far too long our Nation's rail infrastructure has gone without adequate investment, and the needs continue to mount. By funding this program, we are taking an important step toward modernizing our Nation's antiquated rail system and helping communities who are dependent on rail lines. Any community with a rail line in it knows the good and the not so good with having that line there. This bill will help them to do more with the good that these rail lines can provide for communities. 
   I would also like to thank Ms. Matsui, my colleague from California, for her work in moving this provision forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I'd first like to thank Chairman Gordon for all his work on this bill and also Ranking Member Hall. 
   As vice chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, as an engineer, as a former professor, and just as an American who's concerned about our future, I stand today in strong support of H.R. 2272. 
   Today, America faces an enormous challenge. Two years ago, the National Academies warned us of a gathering storm that threatened our Nation in the 21st century. Their report told us that without immediate action the U.S. could lose its competitive technological edge in the world, meaning a dimmed future for our Nation. This bill will give us the jolt that we need to keep America in the lead, increasing our support for American researchers, scientists, engineers, educators and, most importantly, students, all of whom will turn their ideas into innovative new technologies which will advance our economy and ensure a brighter future for our Nation. 
   Dr. EHLERS very eloquently talked about how important investment is and what a great investment this bill is. As a former educator and researcher, I understand the immense value of investing in our future but especially in our children's education. 
   This bill provides $150 million for K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education, ensuring that American children won't be left behind as the world moves forward with new technology. These critical investments will create and equip thousands of new teachers and give current teachers the skills they need in order to be effective teachers of science and math. 
   The Competitiveness Act also creates an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, which will invest in high-risk, high-reward R&D to help us overcome the technological barriers in the development of new energy technologies. These revolutionary new technologies will play a major role in securing our national energy security and protecting our environment. 
   And, finally, increasing NSF funding is a great advance and investment, and I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Colorado for yielding me time, although today I rise in opposition to H.R. 3. 
   Mr. Speaker, no one likes to see another human suffer or struggle. This bill intends to provide hope. I can personally appreciate hope because I have juvenile diabetes. I take at least four shots a day and draw blood at least five times a day. But the bigger struggle is steering myself through the shoals of high and low blood sugar levels, and the very serious long-term and short-term consequences of both of those. 
   I want a cure for diabetes and for other diseases that are far more devastating, but I don't believe this bill is the way to get there. 
   I sit on the Science Committee because I believe a key to our better future is scientific research, especially in medicine. Last year I helped introduce and get signed into law the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act that provides for the collecting and researching of human cord blood stem cells. 
   This week it was reported that a hospital in my district, Hope Children's Hospital, cured a girl suffering from leukemia using cord blood stem cells. 
   This year we need to pass the Alternative Pleuripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act that recognizes that there are many forms of stem cells that offer great promise. Very recently, we were shown great promise that amniotic stem cells are pleuripotent, and this feature gives them the same advantage as sought in embryonic stem cells. But amniotic cells avoid not only the ethical pitfalls of embryonic cells; they also have been shown to be much better because they do not tend to produce tumors as embryonic stem cells do. 
   This is all in addition to adult stem cells that are being used today in clinical trials and clinical practice to treat 72 diseases. 
   Yes, I desperately want to be cured of diabetes, and I want to see the suffering end for so many other people; but science continues to demonstrate we don't have to choose between advancing medical techniques and contentious life issues. 
   So, today, I urge my colleagues to reconsider this bill and defeat it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, as a past NSF grant recipient, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1867, the National Science Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2007. I want to thank Chairman Gordon, Chairman Baird and Dr. Ehlers for their work in bringing this strong bill to the floor today. 
   Today, we stand at the cusp of numerous technological breakthroughs that will completely revolutionize our way of life; from hydrogen and other advanced fuels technologies that will free us from our addiction to oil, to nanotechnology that has the potential to impact virtually every sector of our economy. 
   Much of this research has been made possible by grants from NSF, and by passing this bill we are continuing our support of American researchers, scientists, engineers, educators and students who will ensure that these breakthroughs continue and that America continues to lead the world technologically and economically. 
   I would like to point out that consideration of this legislation comes on the heels of last week's passage of the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds and Sowing the Seeds legislation. Both of these bills were introduced in response to the recommendations of the Rising Above the Gathering Storm report, which was commissioned by Congress to help the U.S. compete, prosper and be secure in the global community of the 21st century. 
   This legislation we are considering today, which puts us on a path to double NSF funding over 10 years, will further build our commitment to competitiveness, being led in the House by Chairman Gordon. 
   The NSF has a broad mission of supporting science and engineering and funding basic research across many disciplines. Basic research is very necessary, yet oftentimes, because it does not directly, only indirectly lead to advances, does not receive private funding. The NSF does this. 
   This legislation also specifically calls on the director of NSF to give special consideration to research proposals having high importance for future national economic competitiveness. This is critically needed. 
   One example is nanotechnology, a very promising field of research that has the potential to revolutionize our society from defense to health care to energy to environmental cleanup. This will help. 
   The bill also gives special consideration to partnerships between academics, industrial scientists and businesses. I have spoken to a lot of professors and administrators at universities who say this is a major problem in our country of taking research and getting it to the market, and this will help to do this. 
   Mr. Chairman, earlier today I had the opportunity to meet with five American scientists who each just recently won a Nobel Prize. They all emphasize that continued support of the NSF is crucial to America's future success, just as it is critical to their successes. 
   So, as a proud cosponsor of this bill, I urge the House to heed the advice of those on the cutting edge of science and take another step in bolstering American competitiveness by passing H.R. 1867.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Matsui amendment. As Members of Congress, we all understand just how critical communications skills are, whether we are trying to influence our colleagues during debate such as tonight, or trying to explain a vote to our constituents.     
   If you cannot communicate effectively, the value of ideas can be lost and all of your work may be lost. The same is true for our Nation's scientists as they attempt to convey their work to colleagues and especially to nonscientific audience. 
   This afternoon, when I had the opportunity to speak with five recent American Nobel laureate scientists, I was very impressed by their ability to explain their work. I may even say I was surprised. Why? Because, unfortunately, scientists are not always the most gifted speakers, and this is not a skill that we regularly find taught in graduate schools. Dr. Ehlers was obviously doing a much better job when he was a professor, but this is not something that I have found as a professor that is taught very often. And I speak from experience both as a professor and as an engineer, and perhaps some may say I personally provide evidence supporting this generalization. 
   So the Matsui amendment addresses this problem by helping to provide communication training to our Nation's young scientists. If scientists can help better explain their research, it will help us as policymakers as they come to explain and we could choose the best path to move forward, especially in the Science Committee. And perhaps business leaders will be better able to turn some academic research into a good marketable product if they can understand what this research can do. 
   Finally, I believe that the ability of our scientists to more effectively communicate scientific information will inspire more children to pursue a career in science. No one is inspired by something that they don't know because they are unable to understand it. 
   I thank Congresswoman Matsui for offering this amendment, and I urge my colleagues for joining me in supporting it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (ARMENIAN GENOCIDE -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address one of the darkest events of the 20th century, an event that we must not let be forgotten. 
   During the First World War and in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, one of the worst atrocities in human history occurred. Even among the chaos and violence of World War I, this atrocity stood out, horrifying foreign witnesses, and prompting Theodore Roosevelt to call it, ``the greatest crime of the war.'' This crime against humanity was the Armenian genocide. 
   Although large-scale violence against Armenians had previously occurred, the events from 1915 to 1918 were truly unprecedented. During this period, approximately 1.5 million Armenians were systematically killed by the Ottoman Government, while the surviving Armenians were left without homes, jobs, possessions, and, most importantly, their loved ones. 
   Yet, despite overwhelming evidence that the Ottoman Government actively sought to destroy the Armenian population, this genocide, the first of the 20th century, has been overlooked by the United States. This is simply wrong. Because, to end genocide, we must stand up to it whenever and wherever it occurs. If we do not, we only embolden those who would commit genocide elsewhere. 
   In 1939, while explaining his plan to destroy the Polish population, Adolph Hitler stated, ``Who, after all, today speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' And many of my Polish brothers and sisters died. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we have the opportunity to speak of the annihilation of the Armenians. We can finally characterize the systematic murder of 1.5 million Ottoman Armenians as genocide, and rightfully condemn those atrocious killings that occurred 90 years ago. The prevention of future genocides may depend on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this very important legislation reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage. 
   I also rise to commend Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as well as Chairman Costello and Ranking Member Petri of the Subcommittee on Aviation for their excellent leadership on this bill and for their continued dedicated service on transportation issues. 
   This bill contains a number of critical provisions that will improve our nation's transportation system. In particular, this legislation will go a long way towards modernizing and improving our nation's air traffic control capabilities by providing $13 billion to accelerate the implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation system. Through modernization and increased use of technology, this system will enable our air traffic control system to meet two to three times the amount of current demand, allowing us to keep pace with the ever-increasing number of flights. This technology will also allow us to more accurately track flights, preventing collisions in our increasingly congested skies. In addition, the FAA will be given the resources to make necessary improvements and replacements of facilities and equipment, ensuring the highest degree of air traffic support. 
   I would also like to thank the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the full Committee and Subcommittee for including report language on the potential application of Qualification Based Selection for Passenger Facility Charge funded airport projects. Qualification Based Selection is a process that works well with Airport Improvement Program funded projects and some other federally-funded transportation projects. It has been a process that has saved time and saved money in other transportation projects. Consequently, taking a closer and more comprehensive look to see how it could be effectively implemented with PFC-funded projects seems to be a logical step. 
   This reauthorization also takes some important steps towards protecting flight crews and passengers. For example, OSHA requirements are finally extended to aircraft crewmembers under this bill, helping to ensure their on-the-job safety. This legislation also directs the FAA to conduct a study on pilot fatigue, and based on the findings of that study, update their regulations regarding flight time limitations and rest requirements for pilots. Furthermore, airlines and airports will be required to have contingency plans in place to take care of passengers affected by long delays, including providing food, water and medical care. This provision is a welcome relief to all of us who have ever experienced long and painful flight delays. 
   Furthermore, this reauthorization includes $570 million to increase the number of aviation safety inspectors by more than one-third. These inspectors develop, administer, and enforce safety requirements for all aircraft being developed and flying today. Increasing the number of these inspectors will help ensure that our skies are as safe as possible. 
   I am also pleased that this reauthorization includes a number of provisions that will improve our environment. It directs the FAA to work to develop lower energy, emissions and noise engine and airframe technology. This type of technology will help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, improve our air quality, and combat climate change. This bill also contains measures to improve the environments of airport lands, including addressing water and air quality issues, and reduce aircraft idling time to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. 
   In addition to these environmental provisions, I would also like to thank Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica of the full Committee and Chairman Costello and Ranking Member Petri of the Aviation Subcommittee for working with me to include two provisions increasing R&D for environmental improvements related to aircraft fuel. 
   Currently, general aviation piston aircraft operate on 100 Octane leaded aviation gasoline, or avgas, which contains four times the amount of lead found in the already-banned leaded automotive fuel and is extremely toxic. Unfortunately, no economical alternative currently exists. Environmental and health concerns over this leaded gasoline will only continue to grow as use of these planes increases. 
   In order to address this issue, I worked to include in this bill a provision to continue and enhance R&D for alternative aviation fuels. This provision, which authorizes $750,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2010, will help to expedite the development, testing, and approval of an economical, unleaded alternative aircraft fuel. 
   Also included in this reauthorization is a provision I authored for a new FAA Center of Excellence focused on alternative jet fuel research. FAA Air Transportation Centers of Excellence provide research on important transportation issues through partnerships between the FAA, universities, industry and state and local government. In conducting transportation research, Centers of Excellence also prepare a new generation of trained professionals ready to meet our nation's transportation needs. 
   And in the coming years, perhaps no transportation need will be greater than the need for alternative energies. Increasing demand for fossil fuels and continued volatility in many energy supplying nations means that the price of fossil fuels will continue to go up. And, increased emissions from the use of fossil fuels further endanger our global environment. 
   Jet fuel in particular illustrates the dangers of our current reliance on fossil fuels. Many airlines in this country, already fighting bankruptcy, are particularly vulnerable to higher fuel prices and increased volatility in the energy market. And while jet emissions still constitute only 3% of global emissions, that share is growing rapidly as the number of flights worldwide continues to increase. 
   Consequently, it is apparent that developing alternative jet fuels is imperative for our Nation's airlines and our environment. Recognizing this need, and witnessing the valuable R&D that FAA Centers of Excellence have provided in other areas such as Airliner Cabin Environment, Noise and Emissions, and Airport Technology, I authored a provision included in this reauthorization which will create an FAA Center of Excellence dedicated to alternative jet fuel research. This Center of Excellence's research will improve the long-term health of our domestic aviation economy and our global environment. 
   The benefits of this Center of Excellence and all the improvements in safety, efficiency, labor protections and environment provided by  this reauthorization are particularly important to my hometown of Chicago. Chicago is the transportation hub of the Nation and transportation is--metaphorically and literally--what keeps our region moving. Chicago Midway Airport, which is in my District, and nearby O'Hare International Airport, are two of the busiest and largest airports in the Nation. And while thousands of people pass through these airports every day, they are the local airports for my constituents and the surrounding communities. Consequently, any national improvements in our aviation system will be acutely felt by those of us who live under the busy skies of northeastern Illinois. I believe this reauthorization is a good beginning in improving not only the flying experience of my constituents, but also in reducing the amount of aviation emissions and noise that they encounter on a daily basis. 
   And importantly for my District, this FAA reauthorization provides necessary funding to make our runways safer. This issue is important to the many people in Chicagoland who still clearly remember the tragic accident in 2005 when an aircraft skidded off the runway at Midway Airport and into a passing car, killing a young boy. To address some of the concerns raised by these types of accidents, this legislation provides $42 million over four years for runway incursion reduction programs and $74 million over four years for runway status light acquisition and installation. These runway improvements will not only help to protect flight crews and aircraft passengers, but also the people such as those in my district who live and work alongside our Nation's airports. 
   In conclusion, this FAA reauthorization contains important efficiency, safety and environmental provisions that will benefit the Nation and Chicagoland in particular, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for placing this amendment en bloc. It is a bipartisan amendment that I offered along with Mr. Inglis, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Kirk. 
   This amendment simply requires the Department of Defense, where feasible, to begin using high-efficiency light bulbs whenever a light bulb is installed. Currently, compact fluorescent light bulbs, known as CFLs, are the most energy efficient. CFLs use about 75 percent less energy than standard bulbs, last 8 to 10 times longer and can save over $74 over the lifetime of a single bulb. 
   When you consider that the DOD has over 240,000 buildings in the U.S. alone, it is clear that this requirement is a practical way to make significant progress in lowering energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting energy independence while at the same time saving millions of taxpayer dollars. 
   At a time when we struggle with a new energy plan, this is a rare win-win-win opportunity, and I ask for your support.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (HUGE VICTORY FOR AMERICAN SECURITY, AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN TAXPAYERS -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, yesterday we witnessed a huge victory for American security, American workers and American taxpayers. 
   The GAO found what many of us suspected all along about the Air Force tanker decision. A flawed process unfairly disadvantaged the American-made Boeing tanker. The Boeing aircraft met or exceeded all of the Air Force criteria. An independent study found that it would create at least twice as many American jobs including, 3,300 in Illinois. 
   Other studies showed the Boeing aircraft to be 25 percent more fuel efficient than the Airbus, resulting in a savings of nearly $30 billion and over 2 billion gallons of fuel. On top of all this, I believe that we should not be exporting our national security. 
   So today I urge my colleagues to join me in urging the Air Force to listen to the GAO, reopen the process and select the best tanker for America.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 362, a bill that is critically important for America's future. 
   I thank Chairman Gordon for his hard work on this issue of science education and for making H.R. 362 a priority in this Congress. I also thank Representative Hall, ranking member of the committee, for his work on this bill and for his continuing work in a bipartisan manner in this committee to get things done that we need done for America. 
   Numerous studies have shown that our students are falling behind the international curve on math and science. When I was a college professor, I certainly saw far too many students coming to college unprepared. 
   Today, we see that America is at a crossroads. The path that we choose will dictate our standing in the world for decades to come. If we continue business as usual, we jeopardize America's competitiveness and the prosperity that we have all come to enjoy. 
   Instead, we must do all that we can to make sure that Americans are prepared by a world-class math and science education. America's high standard of living depends on this. 
   That is why H.R. 362 is a vital part of an American innovation agenda that will help to guarantee a continued prosperity in America's future. Right now, many school districts throughout the country are finding it increasingly difficult to find good math and science teachers. 
   Lyons Township High School Superintendent Dennis Kelly has spoken to me recently about the difficulties that they are having finding these teachers, and I hear this all across my district and all across the country. This bill targets this problem and offers viable solutions to recruiting new teachers, as well as developing and supporting current ones. 
   H.R. 362 will expand the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation allowing more universities to be able to host programs for recruiting students into teaching. This is a vital part of our educational system, connecting universities with K-12 education. This will ensure that our children have an abundance of qualified, well-equipped math and science teachers who will prepare them for their future. 
   I have a special understanding of the impact that teachers have on children's lives, especially when it comes to inspiring students in math and science. In addition to being a former college professor, I am only one of the handful of Members of Congress with a degree in engineering. In addition, my wife has a degree in math, and we often talk about the teachers who have inspired us. 
   I will always remember my high school physics teacher, Father Fergus, who inspired me to pursue a degree in engineering, and I also will always remember Father Thul who really inspired me in mathematics. 
   It is vital that we pass this bill and continue to produce these teachers that continue to inspire our children and make our future more secure.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 916, honoring the tremendous contributions that Catholic schools have made to our Nation. 
   Since 1974, Catholic Schools Week has celebrated the important role that these institutions play in America and their excellent reputation for providing a strong academic and moral education, as well as teaching community responsibility and outreach. 
   I am proud to sponsor this resolution again. And I would like to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) for once again working with me on this resolution. 
   This year's theme of Catholic Schools Week is ``Catholic Schools Light the Way.'' This theme focuses on the leadership that Catholic schools provide to our Nation, producing graduates who light the way for a brighter future for all Americans and for humankind. The theme also highlights the spiritual foundation of Catholic schools by reminding students that they are called to ``light the way'' for others. 
   Nationally, about 2.3 million young people are enrolled in nearly 8,000 Catholic schools. These schools have more than 160,000 full-time professional staff, boasting a student/teacher ratio of 15:1. On average Catholic school students surpass other students in math, science, and reading in the three grade levels tested by the NAEP test. The graduation rate for Catholic high school students is 99 percent, and 97 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to college or technical schools. These are amazing statistics in America today. 
   Catholic schools are also highly effective in educating minority students and disadvantaged youth. The percentage of minority students in Catholic schools has more than doubled in the past 30 years, today representing more than one-quarter of all those enrolled. And almost one in seven students in Catholic schools is not Catholic. The success of Catholic schools does not depend on selectivity. On average Catholic schools accept nine out of every 10 students who apply. 
   In addition to learning reading, writing, and arithmetic, students also learn responsibility and how to become persons of character and integrity. Community service is a priority in Catholic schools; 94 percent of schools have a service program, with the average student completing 79 hours of service. 
   I was born, raised, and I live in Chicago Archdiocese, which has one of the most successful school systems in the country. Today more than 106,000 students attend 276 schools. In my district alone, there are five Catholic high schools and 34 grammar schools, including one of the best in my home parish of St. John of the Cross in Western Springs. 
   My wife and I are each products of 12 years of Catholic education. My wife in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at St. Patrick's Grade School and Bishop McCourt High School; and myself at St. Symphorosa Grammar School and St. Ignatius College Prep. Like so many others, I understand how important Catholic schools are in providing a spiritual, moral, and intellectual foundation. My 12 years of Catholic education provided me with the knowledge, discipline, desire to serve, and a love of learning that enabled me to go on to earn my Ph.D. and become a teacher before I was elected to Congress. 
   As we recognize Catholic Schools Week, we must pay special tribute to the dedicated teachers and administrators who sacrifice so much, usually getting paid much less than they could to dedicate their lives to teaching at Catholic schools. I have fond memories of my teachers, who taught me not only the value of a good education but also the values of faith and service. Although I began in Catholic schools 35 years ago, I still can fondly remember my teachers at St. Sym's, from Sister Mildred in the first grade to Sister Xavier in the eighth grade. And I still fondly remember Sister Diane, my coach on the Student Congress Team in high school. Millions of Americans have similar memories of sisters, priests, and lay teachers who gave their hearts and souls and made such a big difference in the lives of their students. 
   Mr. Speaker, Catholic schools have made a big difference in my life and in the lives of countless others. As an important complement to public schools and other private institutions, Catholic schools contribute a great deal to America. And let us not forget that every student who is taught in a Catholic school saves taxpayers money because they are not part of the local public school system.  
   America's Catholic schools deserve our praise and our support. And to share our praise and support, I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.

   Mr. Chairman, Mr. Inglis and I introduced the Bulb Replacement in Government with High-Efficiency Technology (BRIGHT) Energy Savings Act earlier this year, a bipartisan bill that garnered over 80 bipartisan cosponsors. Last week, it was incorporated into a comprehensive climate change and energy bill that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported. 
   This amendment is a great step towards this goal of cutting down on the energy used by the Federal Government, cutting down on the emission of global climate-changing gases and saving taxpayers money. 
   So, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for accepting this amendment. This amendment has been included on every appropriations bill so far that has been brought to the floor, and I hope we can continue this. It is very rare that you can meet all of these goals at once while saving taxpayer dollars.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding and for all his tireless efforts on behalf of rail safety. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act. As the chairman says, I represent part of Chicago, which is the rail hub of the Nation. I understand just how important railroad traffic is, railroads are to this country, both passenger and freight. In all transportation, safety is key. 
   This bill makes crucial improvements in safety for rail employees, passengers and all Americans who live, work, travel along rail lines. I would like to commend Chairman Oberstar, Subcommittee Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Shuster, and Ranking Member Mica for their work on this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, among the other important improvements that come in this bill, H.R. 2095 works to strengthen the integrity of our Nation's rail system, encourages the implementation of new technologies, such as positive train control systems, known as PTC. I am especially pleased that, at my request, the committee included language in the bill that provides Federal funding to expedite PTC installation. PTC systems can drastically reduce collisions, derailments and other accidents, while at the same time improving efficiency. It's clearly a much-needed advance. 
   I also want to speak right now in strong support of the Napolitano amendment, which broadly ensures Mexican trains entering the U.S. continue to receive proper brake, mechanical and hazardous material inspections by highly skilled American personnel. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is essential for continued safety of our railways. I urge adoption of the Napolitano amendment and passage of the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 51 honoring National Catholic Schools Week and the tremendous contributions that Catholic schools make to our country. Since 1974, Catholic Schools Week has celebrated the important role that these institutions play in America and their excellent reputation for providing a strong academic and moral education, as well as teaching community responsibility and outreach. 
   I am proud to sponsor this resolution as my first resolution of this new Congress, and I would also like to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) for his work on this resolution. Unfortunately Mr. Fossella today has been unable to make it. He is stuck in New York today. But he would like to be here also to speak of his support for this resolution on Catholic Schools Week. 
   This year's theme of Catholic Schools Week is ``Catholic Schools: The Good News in Education.'' This theme has multiple meanings for Catholic schools. At the center of Catholic education is the ``Good News'' or Gospel of Jesus and salvation. Jesus taught love and service. And the history of Catholic schools reveals an ongoing emphasis on the Gospel values of reaching out and serving others. 
   But the ``good news'' in Catholic education is also the news of success in shaping the lives of so many young men and women. Nationally about 2.4 million young people are enrolled in nearly 8,000 Catholic schools. These schools have more than 160,000 full-time professional staff, boasting a student/teacher ratio of 15:1. On average, Catholic school students surpass other students in math, science and reading in the three grade levels of the NAPT test. The graduation rate for all Catholic high school students is 95 percent, and 83 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to college. These are amazing statistics in America today. 
   Catholic schools are also highly effective in educating minority students and disadvantaged youth. The percentage of minority students in Catholic schools has more than doubled in the  past 30 years, today representing more than one-quarter of all those enrolled. And almost one in seven students in Catholic schools is not Catholic. The success of Catholic schools does not just come from selectivity. On average, Catholic schools accept about nine out of every 10 students who apply. 
   One of the reasons for the ``good news'' of Catholic schools is that in addition to learning reading, writing and arithmetic, students also learn responsibility and how to become persons of character and integrity. 
   Community service is a priority in Catholic schools; 94 percent of schools have a service program, with the average student completing 79 hours of service. 
   I was born, raised and lived in the Chicago Archdiocese, which has one of the most successful school systems in the country. Today more than 106,000 students attend 276 schools. In my district alone there are five Catholic high schools and 34 grammar schools, including one of the best in my home parish of St. John of the Cross. 
   The success of students in archdiocesan schools is phenomenal, with the high schools having an amazing graduation rate of over 99 percent, and 95 percent of graduates from Catholic schools go on to college. This is certainly a record to be proud of. 
   My wife and I are each products of 12 years of Catholic education. My wife in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at St. Patrick's Grade School and Bishop McCourt High School; myself in Chicago at St. Symphorosa Grammar School and St. Ignatius College Prep. Like so many others, I understand how important Catholic schools are in providing a spiritual, moral and intellectual foundation. My 12 years of Catholic education provide me with the knowledge, discipline, desire to serve, and a love of learning that enabled me to go on to earn my Ph.D. and become a teacher before I was elected to Congress. 
   As we recognize Catholic Schools Week, we must pay special tribute to the dedicated teachers and administrators who sacrifice so much, usually getting paid much less than they could to dedicate their lives to teaching at Catholic schools. I have fond memories of my teachers, who taught me not only the value of a good education, but also the values of faith and service. Although it was 35 years ago that I started school, I can still fondly remember all my teachers, from first grade, Sister Mildred; second grade, Miss Ivers; and on and on. And I will never forget Sister Diane, my coach on the Student Congress in high school. And to this day, when I speak to a crowd, I always remember her sitting there nodding her approval as I gave my speeches, as I was a nervous young kid in high school. Millions of other Americans have similar memories of teachers who gave their heart and soul and made such a big difference in the lives of their students. 
   Mr. Speaker, as an important complement to public schools and other private institutions, Catholic schools contribute a great deal to America. They have made a big difference in my life and in the lives of countless others. As Father William Davis, Interim Secretary for the Conference of U.S. Catholic Bishops, said, ``High achievement rates, high retention rates, high moral values, and high student and parent satisfaction are the distinctive marks of a Catholic school. That's the good news and we want to share it.'' 
   For this good news, America's Catholic schools deserve our praise and our support, and to share our praise and support, I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (TRADE AND LABOR -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding to me and also for all the hard work that he has done in his short career in Congress but in many years before that for America's workers. 
   I rise today with serious concerns about the trade policy of our country. This is a concern shared by tens of millions of Americans who have concerns every day about keeping their jobs or they have lost their jobs and being unable to find another job where they could possibly earn as much money as we see the trade policy of this country destroying so many good American jobs. 
   This trade policy has contributed to a record high, soaring trade deficit. There is wage depression and loss of quality, high-paying jobs. With the Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea trade agreements pending congressional approval, we must take action now to correct the mistakes of previous trade agreements and ensure  that any new trade agreements benefit all Americans, be enforceable, and be enforced. 
   It is clear that our previous trade agreements have not benefited everybody. For evidence of this, look no further than North American Free Trade agreement and the damaging record that it has provided us. Since NAFTA was signed into law, the U.S. has seen enormous amounts of production shift to Mexico and Canada, while real wages for U.S. workers have fallen. 
   My district, which includes parts of Chicago and its suburbs and the larger Great Lakes region, has been particularly hard hit by job losses. This has been the case especially in manufacturing. Between 1995 and 2005, the United States lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs. More than one-third of this job loss occurred in the seven Great Lakes States, with Chicagoland losing over 100,000 manufacturing jobs. 
   Losses in manufacturing jobs are important. I know there are some people who say a job is a job. It doesn't matter. If you lose these jobs, you will get other jobs. 
   Well, first of all, manufacturing jobs are special. America must be able to make products, first for our national security, but these manufacturing jobs are high-paying jobs, and they are jobs that add so much value and create other jobs in this country. They offer high wages, good benefits, and they offer jobs to many Americans who do not have college degrees. When our manufacturing jobs leave to cheaper labor markets, weaker labor standards, lax environmental protections and to countries practicing unfair trade practices, workers are left behind. 
   In my district, I hear constantly from manufacturers who are talking about their struggles to compete largely today against China, China's manipulated currency, which is largely undervalued. All the work that these manufacturers are doing to try to keep jobs in the United States, unfortunately, we see so many of these jobs going and so many of these plants closing. 
   What happens to these workers? Many of them go looking for other jobs. They find jobs in the service sector. Ninety-eight percent of the net new jobs in 1990s were in the service sector. Unfortunately, compensation in the service industry is only 81 percent of the manufacturing sector's average; and then the influx of these displaced workers just drives down these wages even more. 
   Yet still we always hear from those in favor of these flawed trade deals that trade creates more jobs than it displaces. Unfortunately, the facts show this is not the case. In fact, in the first 10 years after NAFTA, the displacement in production from the United States to Mexico and Canada directly led to a net loss of 879,000 U.S. jobs. My State, Illinois, lost a net total of 47,000 jobs. Mr. Hare knows very well, he has seen it in his district, how hard these losses have hit, as I have seen them in my district. This has decreased our average earnings, our quality of life and our ability to provide for our families. 
   The fact that our government negotiated trade agreements that yielded these kinds of results is, at best, embarrassing. We must ensure that these mistakes 
   are not repeated in future trade deals. 
   This year congressional leaders on trade have been negotiating with the administration to improve the pending trade deals with Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea. On May 10, an agreement was announced that would incorporate some environmental and labor protections into the pending trade agreements with Panama and Peru. While this is certainly a start, these negotiations must not be viewed as complete. There is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of NAFTA, CAFTA, and all our other failed trade deals. I hope in the coming weeks and months that Congress can address these past failures and make trade work for everyone. 
   And in this, also, we must, we must, include addressing currency manipulation, especially by China. Lack of enforcement of intellectual property, which is, again, another problem that hits Americans very hard, unfair subsidies that are given by some countries to some of their industries and dumping that is done, all of these greatly hurt the United States, and we must make sure that all this is included anytime that we are dealing with trade. The livelihood of so many Americans, millions and millions of Americans and their families, depend on it. 
   We are working together with my colleagues here to make sure that we create good trade deals for America and Americans. The purpose of American trade policy should be to create good jobs for Americans. The bottom line should not just be profits. The bottom line has to be the lives and the work of millions of Americans, and we must make sure that we stand up strong every day for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. LIPINSKI. (NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 5940, legislation reauthorizing the National Nanotechnology Initiative known as the NNI. I want to congratulate Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall for their hard work in crafting this legislation. I also want to acknowledge all the members of the Science and Technology Committee on both sides of the aisle for their contributions to this bill and for helping to move it expeditiously and unanimously through the committee. 
   Nanotechnology, or the science and technology of building devices from single atoms and molecules, soon will impact nearly every sector of our economy. In just 6 years, the global market for nanoscale materials and products is expected to reach $2.6 trillion and to be incorporated into 15 percent of global manufacturing output. I firmly believe that nanotech represents one of the most important, if not the most important, technological keys to improving our Nation's future economic growth and improving our way of life, from medical applications, to green nanoenergy, to nanoelectronics, which will be critical as we reach the limits of current materials. 
   The NNI has been effective in supporting productive, cooperative research efforts across a wide spectrum of disciplines. The initiative has established a network of state-of-the-art national facilities that are conducting groundbreaking work in nanoscale research and development. These centers have helped the U.S. maintain a strong presence in the development and expansion of nanotechnology, which has been vital to economic development and essential to the creation of innovative jobs, leading to a stronger and more competitive America. The committee stated in the bill's report language the need to expand the current centers that we have as necessary to meet future research needs. 
   I am proud that my home State of Illinois is one of the leaders in nanotechnology research. Illinois boasts two national labs. It is home to numerous cutting-edge businesses and some of the Nation's preeminent research universities, such as my alma mater, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois, which are conducting groundbreaking work in this field. 
   To keep the U.S. ahead of other nations, who are now making substantial investments in nanotech, this reauthorization makes three significant adjustments, as mentioned by the chairman. 
   First, it strengthens the planning and implementation of research on the environmental, health and safety aspects of nanotech. Not only is public safety paramount in its own right, but public confidence in these new technologies is also necessary for the success of nanotech industries. 
   Second, this bill requires the NNI to place increased emphasis on technology transfer; that is, moving basic research results out of the lab and into commercial products, materials and devices. From my own experiences in Illinois with our national labs and research universities, I understand that technology transfer is not simple, but it is critical to ensuring that R&D investments serve the public. 
   Third, H.R. 5940 creates a new nanotechnology education program to attract secondary school students to science and technology studies to help prepare the nanotech workforce of the future. As a former teacher, I understand the importance of education in promoting not only the success of individual Americans, but also promoting the success of American innovation such as nanotechnology. 
   Mr. Speaker, as nanotechnology moves from a multibillion to a multitrillion-dollar industry, there is great promise in store, but it is critical that we do all we can to ensure that America leads the way in nanotech innovation. H.R. 5940 will keep the U.S. in a position to drive the development of nanotechnology and go a long way towards ensuring that America reaps the benefits of our research investment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 5940.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution that we are right now talking about on the floor, and I want to commend my colleague from Texas for introducing this legislation. My constituents certainly understand that we need to both look at problems that are facing us right now, today, and also we need to plan for the future or else we wind up in situations like we're facing today. 
   As vice chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee, as well as a former college professor and engineer and husband of a credentialed actuary, I became aware of the need to invest in STEM education for young Americans. Providing high-quality jobs for hardworking Americans must be our top priority. In order to accomplish that, we must be proactive. 
   The necessary first step is an improved STEM education in schools because an educated workforce is the foundation for economic strength. For generations, science and engineering have been the base of America's economic growth. We were leaders in the industrial revolution, and we initiated the Internet age. Today, these fields continue to have great potential for growing our economy and employing more Americans. 
   Between 1983 and 2004, the percentage of the U.S. workforce in science and engineering occupations almost doubled. Ground-breaking discoveries in innovative technologies are continually creating new industries and opportunities. Nanotechnology, which we just discussed in the reauthorization of the NNI, is just one of the many exciting industries that are revolutionizing the international economy.  
   However, if we are not careful, America will be left behind in future technological revolutions. This fact was highlighted nationally when the National Academy of Sciences released its ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report which emphasized the need for the government to improve science, technology, engineering, and math for STEM education. In the 110th Congress, we confronted this challenge head on by enacting the America COMPETES Act. But additional measures to improve our global standing are still needed. 
   The resolution before us today will assist the United States in dedicating its resources to the STEM field and in promoting science education policy by educating a broad pool of Americans in these critically important fields. These areas are vital to America's economic competitiveness, and this resolution will help to ensure a vital future for next generation of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have challenges ahead of us, but the American people have always succeeded in conquering their greatest challenges. With this resolution, we will get that and ensure that all American students receive the skills and knowledge required for success in the 21st century workforce. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution to plan for the future and plan for a brighter future for America. This resolution helps us to do that.

   The current sugar program has cost American workers tens of thousands of jobs, and it's cost American families $1.9 billion per year, according to the GAO. It will cost taxpayers $1.3 billion over the next 10 years, according to CBO. Unfortunately, a provision of this bill threatens more harm. 
   While I support this bill overall, we need this amendment, which prevents an increase in price supports for sugar, if and only if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that these changes contribute to a loss of jobs in the food and beverage manufacturing. The least we can do is ensure that changes in the sugar program do not kill good American manufacturing jobs. It's done harm in the Chicago area and across the Nation. We do not want to see more harm done.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution and in support of a new policy in Iraq. Up until this point, the Bush administration's Iraq policy over the last 3 1/2 years appears to be one of America's worst foreign policy blunders. More than 3,100 of our brave men and women in uniform have been killed and more than 24,000 have been wounded, many very seriously, and hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent and in some cases wasted. This has resulted from the tactical mistakes, errors in judgment and other major missteps by the Bush administration. 
   It is painfully clear that a change in strategy in Iraq is needed now. We need a plan for bringing stability to Iraq and bringing our troops home. Unfortunately, the President's plan to add over 20,000 additional troops does not provide this, and, therefore, I must support this resolution. 
   I see three main flaws in the President's plan. 
   First, the administration has not provided convincing evidence that this surge will succeed after many similar plans have failed. After almost 4 years in Iraq, the American people are asking, why should we have faith in this plan and place more troops in harm's way? 
   Second, by failing to provide clear benchmarks for success or a time frame by which we can expect the surge to yield positive results, the President's plan appears to commit our country to a ``stay the course'' strategy with no clear end in sight. Aid should be tied to a deadline for progress by the Iraqi Government. 
   Third, and most importantly, the President continues to place too much emphasis on a military solution, when it is clear that force alone will not solve this crisis. Solutions must support broad international engagement to promote stability and reconstruction in Iraq and must address political, economic and religious issues. 
   Because of the need for such a plan, earlier this year I laid out a set of recommendations, and this week I introduced H.Res. 152 based on these. My proposal consists of three core recommendations. 
   First, encourage achievement of important goals and national reconciliation, security and governance by arranging a peace conference for Iraq's ethnic and religious factions, similar to the conference that led to the Dayton Accords. One venue for this would be El Salvador, which has shown a strong commitment to stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq and has gone through its own recent history of a bloody civil war and ensuing reconciliation. 
   But wherever and however it is done, the political, economic and religious issues must be addressed if peace and security are to be established in Iraq. And it is essential that more pressure be put on the Iraqi Government and all interested parties in Iraq to find and accept real solutions so the American forces can begin withdrawal. 
   The second recommendation is to seek international cooperation to develop solutions for Iraq. This should include calling an international conference that will work on putting together a peacekeeping force and setting up an international reconstruction program. 
   Iraq's strategic position in the volatile Middle East, its potential to become a terrorist safe haven, its large supply of oil and the great potential for a humanitarian catastrophe make security in Iraq a critical international issue. It is time for America to engage the nations of the world to encourage them to address this international crisis. 
   The final recommendation is to require the administration to give Congress detailed reports on the situation in Iraq so that we can make informed decisions regarding funding for reconstruction and deciding when American forces can be redeployed. This new Congress has been vigorously conducting oversight after 3 1/2 years of congressional neglect, but we must have the full cooperation of the administration. 
   If the recommendations laid out in my resolution are followed, I believe American troops can begin redeployment in 2007, leaving a secure, stable Iraq. 
   As the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, ``The search for genuine justice and peace in Iraq requires moral urgency, substantive dialogue and new direction.'' Unfortunately, the President does not give us this. That is why his plan is discouraging to many Americans who are weary of this war. 
   But no one is wearier than our troops and their families. This past weekend I spoke to a soldier who spent 13 months in Iraq and will likely be returning. He told me that it is important to make sure that we let our troops know that they have our complete support. We cannot let anything in this debate be construed otherwise. If this surge occurs even after we pass this resolution, we must continue to support our troops and pray for them every day, so that by God's grace they can succeed in their mission.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chairman, this amendment says that none of the funds made available in this bill may be used to purchase light bulbs for operation in the United States unless the light bulbs have the ``Energy Star'' or the ``Federal Energy Management Program'' designation. What this means is that light bulbs purchased will have to be high-efficiency light bulbs. 
   Right now, the most common high-efficiency bulbs are the compact fluorescent light bulb, known as a CFL. CFLs use approximately 75 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs to provide the same amount of light. They also last approximately eight to ten times longer. Replacing an ordinary bulb with a comparable CFL saves up to $74 in energy costs over the bulb's lifetime. 
   Today, Americans are rightly concerned about the impact of foreign energy dependence on our national security and the effect of global climate change on the future of our planet. This amendment helps us address both of these issues, while at the same time saving millions of taxpayer dollars.

   Mr. LIPINSKI. Reclaiming my time, I would like to thank the chairman for accepting this. This is part of what we are working on. 
   I introduced a bill to require all GSA buildings to use high-efficiency bulbs. Mr. Inglis and I introduced this earlier this year. It is included in a comprehensive climate change bill which was reported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee yesterday. I am very hopeful we can get this done through that piece of legislation for all GSA buildings, but this amendment here is a good start. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
