<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, July 28, 2005, the Republican Congress, the Republican Senate, President Bush, had an energy policy that they voted on 3 years ago. 
   At that time the minority leader said it will lower prices, it will lower dependency on foreign oil. President Bush, when he signed the Republican energy plan, said it would lower prices, lower America's dependency on foreign oil and lead to a great economic boom when we look back at it. 
   Well, in 3 short years, gas has gone from about $2.29 a gallon to a little over $4. By any measurement, dependence on foreign oil, the cost of energy, by any measurement or economic activity, it has been an absolute failure.     
   They got their way. They wrote the bill they wanted. July 28, 2005, on this floor, they passed their energy bill, and they promised you what it was going to do, and you now see the results. 
   Now, there is enough blame to go around from all sides. Not everybody has been perfect. We have missed many an opportunity here to deal with energy, Democratic and Republican alike. 
   But what is interesting now is their new line. The Republican line, as it relates to energy policy, is we are for everything. Except for you are for everything except when you can be for something. 
   When it came to voting for fuel efficiency standards, raising them for the first time in 30 years, 163 Republicans voted ``no.'' You weren't for all of the above then. 
   When it came to renewable electricity standards, 159 Republicans voted ``no.'' You weren't for all of the above then. 
   When it came to alternative technologies, solar, wind, geothermal, other technologies, the DRILL Act, opening up Alaska, you voted ``no'' then. You weren't for all of the above then.

   Mr. EMANUEL. The Republicans support all of the above, except they don't have any problem voting ``no'' when it counts. 
   Today we have a bill on the floor that takes immediate action in helping us reduce prices. It is not a long-term policy. Reducing and increasing fuel efficiency standards for cars is a long-term policy. Making sure that the oil companies who are getting subsidies from taxpayers drill on the 80 million acres that are open for drilling, and not stockpiling permits when we could be stockpiling energy sources here in the United States, that is an energy policy for the future. 
   I say vote ``yes'' and vote for a new strategy that has worked time and again in the past.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GETTING SQUEEZED -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported that the richest 1 percent are doing better than ever under President Bush. According to the Wall Street Journal, the income of the richest 1 percent, people who earn above $1 million, are at a 19-year high. At the same time, their average income tax rate is at an 18-year low. And if they're doing so well, simple question, how are the other 99 percent doing? 
   Median household income has dropped $1,200 under George Bush and the Republican Congress. Household expenses are up $4,600. College costs have doubled. Health care costs have doubled. Gas prices have more than doubled, and yet median income has  dropped by $1,200. These are sobering statistics. The middle class is simply getting squeezed in this country. 
   After 7 1/2 years of the administration policies, it's not a surprise 99 percent are getting hurt and the top 1 percent are doing better than ever. And now John McCain is offering an economic plan to cut taxes to this top 1 percent by $127,000. 
   It is time for a new direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my chairman. 
   While other speakers have noted some of the shortcomings and their reluctant support, I enthusiastically support this legislation. Unlike the 2001-2003 tax cuts, in 2001, 36 percent of the tax benefit went to folks earning more than $200,000 a year. In the 2003 tax cut, 67 percent of the tax rebates and tax refunds and tax cuts went to those earning over $200,000 a year. In this stimulus package, zero. The lion's share of the tax rebate goes to people earning between $40,000 and $80,000 a year. 
   I enthusiastically support the middle class of this country, and we are doing it in this bill. Thirty-seven million Americans who were left out of the 2001 and 2003 tax cut will get close to $28 billion of this tax cut. I enthusiastically support that type of economic prosperity. 
   Like my colleague on the other side from Michigan, once we right this economy hopefully with this stimulus package and interest rate cuts, we need to deal with long-term issues. On those issues, how did we get here? In the last 7 years, our debt went from $5.7 trillion to $9.2 trillion. President Bush inherited 3 years in a row of surplus, to 6 years in a row of deficit spending. Health care costs went from $6,000 for a family of four to doubling to $12,000 for a family of four. College costs increased by over $2,000 a year for a middle-class family. Energy costs went from $1.39 a gallon to $3.07 a gallon. 
   So I look enthusiastically to debating long-term future economic challenges the middle class have been feeling. The reason this is so important is because we are reversing and beginning to reverse the economic policies leading, and have been the leading causes, to middle-class squeeze: rising energy costs; rising health care costs; rising home values that shut out the middle class; depleting savings rates in this country; and a median household income that has shrunk by $1,000 in the last 6 years, while in 2000, over the last 6 years leading into 2000, median income rose by $6,000. 
   So in the long-term debate about this country, we have got to come to the rescue of middle-class families, and this stimulus package begins to do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. I would like to thank the chairman as well as the ranking member for this legislation, but particularly I want to thank my colleague from Illinois, BOBBY RUSH, the subcommittee chairman who worked on this legislation who is back today from his illness. As my colleague JAN SCHAKOWSKY said, it is a special warmness to all of us to have you back. 
   This legislation puts consumer safety back in the Consumer Product Safety Commission. You have heard from a number of speakers prior to me--and there is no reason to go through it--all the new powers and capabilities of this commission. And while we have talked about last year the 231 recalls of 45 million toys, Fisher-Price alone recalled 1 million toys, 1 million cribs were recalled, we should not lose sight also that we had a commissioner who was not doing her job. 
   When all of this was breaking out in the news, the commissioner, the head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, was taking trips paid for by the very industry they were responsible for regulating. When this broke and all of the recalls were occurring, the commissioner who not only was taking these trips said, ``I don't need any more staff for this. I don't need any more money for this,'' and yet the American people knew at that time we had a commissioner who was head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission who was not on the job doing the police work that she was responsible for doing. 
   So the good news is not only do we have new laws, not only will we empower this commission in a new way, after November, we're going to have a new commissioner with a new agency and a new mission and new resources to do exactly what they're supposed to be doing. 
   So today, for all of us who wanted to see this legislation, who read with horror the stories that came out about what was happening to toys, to cribs, and how parents and their children were being put at risk and their government wasn't doing their job, I am proud of this bipartisan accomplishment. I'm most proud of the work that our colleagues did together putting aside their differences.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, in less than 12 months this Congress will do what previous Congresses have failed to do for 32 years. Today, after 32 years of failure, we can take America's energy policy in a new direction. And that failure was through Democratic Congresses and Republican Congresses alike. 
   Today this House has the opportunity to pass modern energy legislation that will accomplish a hat trick. It will make our vehicles more fuel efficient, help limit our dependence on foreign oil, and protect our environment, all in one act. 
   The new fuel efficiency standards will save the American family up to $1,000 a year for gas at the pump. 
   More importantly, this bill offers us an opportunity to look to the future and prepare for it. Make change an ally, rather than an adversary. 
   Each and every one of us knows, Democrat and Republican alike, that our Nation consumes too much energy. We know that we are dangerously dependent on an unstable region of the world and we know that this isn't news to anybody here, and we have recognized these facts for years. But when faced with this problem, we, as a country, have turned our back on that problem, hoping it will go away. This legislation allows us to face those challenges head on and prepare for America's future. 
   Mr. Speaker, the problem will not go a way, and today we have a chance to confront it when faced with the facts and vote to make our Nation more secure, reduce oil consumption, and finally plan for a more energy-independent future. 
   We can bury our heads in the sand and hope the problem disappears, or we can take action today and prepare for the future and make the challenges of America's future an opportunity for industry, for new jobs, for new businesses and, most importantly, for foreign policy and national security policy that is less dependent on an unstable part of the world. 
   I am proud that today we are taking action that for 32 years past Congresses failed to meet and challenge. By finally having the fuel efficiency standards that are modern and look to the future, America is taking a step that's important for its security. We will do in 12 months what has failed to have been done for 32 years.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Thank you very much for the time. 
   Three years ago this summer, President Bush signed into law in 2005, in August--July 28, we passed it here in the House--an energy bill which the President said at that time, ``I'm confident that one day the Americans will look back on this bill as a vital step towards a more secure and prosperous Nation that is less dependent on foreign sources of energy.'' 
   At that time, gas was $2.29 a gallon. By any measurement, that legislation has failed. Today, it's $4.11 a gallon, and our dependence on foreign oil is greater now than it was then. 
   What has happened here is we have provided the oil and gas companies $15 billion in subsidies of taxpayer money to drill. They're not drilling on the 68 million acres. We have provided them 68 million acres on the Lower 48 to drill. They are not drilling. 
   So we have a simple thing: use-it-or-lose-it. Get drilling. We agree that supply is part of it. We also agree that efficiency is part of it.

   Mr. EMANUEL. There are three parts to this: supply, efficiency, and alternatives. 
   When we increased the fuel efficiency of cars, we moved on one of those pieces. Here, we're moving on supply. We're asking you to join us to make sure that we have adequate supplies out there. There are 68 million acres to be drilled, and as the majority leader said earlier, it's ironic on the day that we have the bill on the floor, finally we're going to have 2 million acres opened up in Alaska. 
   This requires that there's an annual offering of more property up to be drilling. It does not have to only occur when the Congress puts a bill on the floor to threaten an administration that you finally move more supply to market. 
   This is a comprehensive approach to solving the energy crisis that the country faces.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, today's Washington Post details more allegations of political influence in the recent firing of eight U.S. attorneys. Yesterday, in a press conference, a New Mexico U.S. Attorney, David Iglesias, asserted that he was fired for purely political reasons. The reason? Mr. Iglesias says that prior to November elections, two elected officials, Federal elected officials, asked him to speed up the probes of local politicians. He did the right thing, refused; and now he is fired. 
   We know that the White House officials intervened and replaced seasoned prosecutors with individuals short on experience but long on political ties. I thought that is what FEMA was for. 
   Yet Attorney General Gonzalez said he would never ever dismiss attorneys for political reasons. So this administration either originally hired incompetent U.S. Attorneys in the first place or hired competent U.S. Attorneys, but incompetently fired them. Which is it? 
   Many Americans believe these U.S. Attorneys are not being fired because they failed to go after public corruption, but because they did and were successful. 
   This Congress will not sit idly by. Madam Speaker, this Congress passed the most sweeping ethics changes since Watergate. We're cleaning up our mess. It's time the Justice Department did the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Six years, $3 trillion in new debt. The largest accumulation of debt in the shortest period of time in American history. That is the legacy. And the one thing you can say about George Bush and this economy is we will be forever in your debt. That is the one thing that is clear. 
   Now, folks, I am glad that you have the sentiment to be for this, but you had the inability to do it. We are going to do something you talked about, but we actually are going to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. We are going to put this fiscal house in order. 
   And you did get handed a surplus prior to total Republican control. You got handed a surplus. It wasn't illusory. Nobody could not find it. We knew exactly where it was. And you spent it. You did something no American President and no Congress had ever tried in American history. Three wars, three tax cuts, $3 trillion in new debt. I don't know what your fixation is about that. You have got a fixation for the number three. I have no idea why. But that is what you did. You had a war in Iraq, a war on terror, a war in Afghanistan. You tried three major tax cuts, and you got $3 trillion in new debt. And on day number two, the Democrats have said enough is enough with running up the debt and the deficit of this country. We are going to begin to take steps to put our fiscal house in order. 
   And let's start with number one, and that is earmark reform. When the Republican Congress took over in 1995, throughout the entire Federal budget, 1,400 earmarks. At the end of the Republican Congress, there were 13,997 earmarks. Now, I know your kids know the explosion on those numbers from 1,400 to nearly 14,000 earmarks. And we are going to use the disinfectant of sunlight. And everybody is going to know everything they need to know about these earmarks. 
   Now let me use one quote over the years when we were dealing with earmarks. A famous lobbyist called earmarks ``an ATM for lobbyists.'' Well, folks, that is part of ethics and lobbying reform, and we are going to change that. It is not going to be an ATM machine for the special interests anymore because this Congress, that gavel, is going to open up the people's House, not the auction house. And that is what has happened here over the years. 
   Number two, pay-as-you-go rules. I worked for an administration that had pay-as-you-go rules. It created discipline not just for Republicans, not just for Democrats. For the government. For the American people's money. And we created a surplus through hard work and discipline. These two steps, pay-as-you-go rules, no new spending without the revenue to pay for them; and earmark reform, will actually change our fiscal house and also the attitude in which we deal with things, and there won't be this insidious relationship between lobbyists and the American people's money. We will do what we need to do. And step one is lobbying and ethics reform, to change how Washington does the people's business; and step two is to put their government's fiscal house in order. That is what we are doing, and I know in your heart of hearts because I know you as individuals, and I see a number of Members here who are nodding their heads ``yes,'' you would like to be for this, but you just can't seem to find that little green button. So this is a chance to vote for it. 
   Remember all the rhetoric and all the speeches you gave on earmark reform, fiscal discipline. You believe what is going on here is the right thing to do. You know it is the right thing to do. But because of party loyalties, you won't do that. That is exactly what we applauded yesterday was to put partisanship aside and join us in the act of patriotism. I know you would like to vote ``yes.'' In your heart of hearts you would like to vote ``yes.'' And I am proud that we are doing what you have only talked about because we will not just talk the talk. We will walk the walk.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, some things are more important than politics. Lifesaving research that has the potential to cure diseases and end suffering for millions of Americans ought to be one of them. 
   But for President Bush, certain things aren't above politics. The President formed his opinion on stem cell research and now he has America ensnarled in his political straitjacket. 
   The American people see stem cell research as a cure to illnesses that plague their family and family members. 
   So today, as the President vetoes legislation that is backed by 72 percent of the American people, he will attempt to fool the American public and soothe his conscience with a symbolic gesture that is empty of medical value. 
   The American people will not be fooled. They know that the President has failed to lead and, instead, made a decision that is a crushing blow to millions of Americans suffering from diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and ALS. 
   Sixty years ago, when America was plagued with polio, this Nation and its political leaders rose to the challenge and took on the medical challenge of their time. Thank goodness we are not facing that challenge now, and we had leaders then who put medical science ahead of political stance.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Last week the President asked for $200 billion more for the war in Iraq. In the same week, the White House said that the bipartisan plan to give 10 million children health care included ``excessive spending'' and threatened to veto it. 
   I agree we have excessive spending. In Iraq. For 41 days of the war in Iraq, 10 million U.S. children would get health care; 41 days of the war in Iraq, where we have been at war for over 4 1/2 years. 
   Make no mistakes, this debate is not about spending. It is about priorities. So it is no surprise that the President finds himself increasingly isolated from Republicans here on Capitol Hill, in the Senate, in the House, and Republicans in the State capitals around America. 
   This President is isolated from where the American people are. They would like to see 10 million children get their health care. 
   Just listen to what Republicans have been saying. Senate Republican ORRIN HATCH: ``We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President's had some pretty bad advice.''  
   Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY, another Republican, said that the bipartisan plan ``breaks the legislative impasse and should have strong support from both Democrats and Republicans.'' 
   From minimum wage, to lobbying reform, to veterans health care, to college education, we have passed bipartisan solutions to problems facing America. That is what this bill does. 
   Thank you for the Republican support for this Democrat initiative. It is right for America's children. It is time to put them first, 10 million kids.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, what I find most intriguing about this discussion is that those who are unemployed, to get this benefit, paid for this insurance policy. This is their money. When times were good, they put money away to unemployment insurance. And when times are bad, they get their insurance premiums back, known as unemployment benefits. It is as simple as that. This is their money, those who are unemployed. 
   Second, as my colleagues on the other side have forced through and agreed to spend $48 billion of U.S. taxpayer money to rebuild Iraq--their roads, their bridges, their schools, their hospitals--but when it comes to Americans, to give them their unemployment insurance, there isn't any money in the system; you're breaking the bank; you can't afford it.  
   To those who want to advocate spending 13 years, 10 years, a decade, as long as it takes in Iraq, I find it ironic they find 13 weeks of additional unemployment insurance to help a family get through a bump economically as too much and too long. 
   Mr. Speaker, 8 years is too long for George Bush's economic policies. It's right to give these people the economic security they've earned and put away.

   This is about our eighth war funding supplemental, emergency spending for the war. But what's intriguing about this one is that, in every other war supplemental, we've asked the American taxpayers to give the Iraqis approximately $50 billion to rebuild their country, schools, hospitals, roads, electricity, all so Iraq can rebuild after the war. And this is the first supplemental that we've asked to rebuild America. These kids lives, approximately the same amount of money. 
   Over the last eight funding bills for the war, we've dedicated approximately $50 billion of American money to rebuild Iraq's schools and roads. We're asking approximately a little over $50 billion to help these kids, our GIs, to rebuild their lives, to get the education that they've earned, to start on a new life for them and their family, whether they be Guard, Reserve or active duty. 
   So there has been no conscience, no problem when it came to Iraq's roads. They got the money. There was no problem when it came to Iraqi schools and hospitals. We said that was our moral obligation, to help Iraq get back on their feet. 
   What moral obligation do we have to our own GIs to get back on their feet?     
   Where is the decency to these kids who we've sent, not once, not twice, some of them three times who signed up to be Guard or Reserve and then we've implemented a stop-loss program that totally changed the contracts?

   At the height of 1949, the original GI Bill of Rights for World War II was 1 percent of our GDP. This is far less. And look how well that paid off for this country. Everybody knows somebody who went to school on that GI Bill. We are doing right by those kids who are doing right by us. 
   You have compared this war with the equivalent of what we've done in World War II. Well, let's make it the equivalent by giving these kids a GI Bill. They've earned it every day doing something that not one of us have done in this context. 
   And yes, we've asked those who are the most well-off in this country, people we all know, to pay a little so these kids can go to college and pursue their dream that they made possible for us because of their sacrifice. And I know a lot of those people, and they're willing to pay a little more to make sure that these kids have an opportunity for the American Dream.

The president of a major environmental group with close ties to this administration pleaded guilty to obstructing a congressional investigation and agreed to provide assistance in the ongoing Jack Abramoff scandal investigation.

But our work is not done. We must continue to hold those in this institution accountable for their conduct, and reform doesn't stop at this end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The American people deserve better from their public servants. 
   This Congress passed legislation to assure that the public trust is not lost at the expense of private interests. We are shining a bright light on the goings on at the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of the Interior, the Veterans Administration and the Student Loan Administration. With the power to hold hearings and ask questions that demand answers, this Congress is holding the administration and their officials accountable for their conduct and their oversight of the public trust.

   Mr. EMANUEL. I would like to thank my colleague from Colorado. It is interesting she said that. I would like to speak slightly out of order from my prepared text. 
   The last time we debated stem cell research back in November of 2006, exactly that time there was another discovery about human amniotic fluid basically giving us the fact that we don't need stem cell research. 
   Past that, and you go back to the period of time in 2005 when we voted on this, the South Korean example was discovered exactly that same day we had that vote. 
   I used to, growing up, I used to say paranoid people have enemies, too. It is ironic that every time we vote on this legislation, all of a sudden there is a major scientific discovery that basically says you don't have to do stem cell research. The truth is, you don't base your research on one report in a medical journal. You provide leadership. 
   If you go back to the 1950s, we had a polio epidemic in this country that was killing thousands of people, leaving people terminally paralyzed. With funding from Washington, we found a cure for polio. Politics did not lead the way, medical research led the way, and America led its leadership there. That type of leadership needs to be provided for illnesses of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and other work where we should allow the scientific research and the promise of stem cell research to move forward, rather than allow politics to dictate what we do here. 
   This is one of those promising areas where, regardless of philosophy or ideology, rather, or party affiliation, when you look at diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, it affects every family, every community, individuals across this country. There is a promise here, a right way to do it. We can provide the leadership here for our medical research, define illnesses and cures to disease that not only affect our budget, our country, but our capacity to lead in the scientific field in this area.

   Just before Mr. Nussle and President Bush took charge of America's books, we had a $236 billion surplus, the largest in U.S. history 3 years running. Under President Bush's watch and Jim Nussle's, in 5 short years we had a $318 billion annual deficit and $300 trillion in new debt owed to the Chinese and other foreign countries. 
   We have heard a lot from this President and the GOP Members about the importance of fiscal responsibility. We Democrats couldn't agree more. Unfortunately, when it comes to George Bush and the Republican Congress, we will forever be in their debt. 
   Mr. Nussle once said, can we continue to fund our war efforts on this type of ad hoc basis? I believe most of us would agree that we cannot and should not. We continue to give President Bush a blank check costing us nearly $1 trillion on credit card funding for this war. 
   Mr. Nussle and President Bush came to change Washington, and Washington changed them. Nominating Mr. Nussle tells Americans a lot of what they can expect from a Republican administration.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and my colleagues Mr. Holt from New Jersey, Mr. Becerra from California, Mr. Honda from California and Mr. Ellison from Minnesota in joining me in sponsoring this legislation and bringing it to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I remember when we had this legislation in the full committee by Chairman Conyers. About a week earlier than that, I had taken my 10-year-old down to Selma for the anniversary of the March over the bridge. It was his birthday gift, and we went on that march with John Lewis. And through the museums we walked through, my son and I were reminded of how the State was used to intimidate voters from exercising their right to vote. America reached out and widened the circle of democracy by ensuring that those who wanted to exercise their right to vote had a chance to vote. 
   That week, when I came back from Selma, we were in the full committee marking up this legislation. What had happened, and I noted then in the committee and others had noted, and it was not unique, was that the baton of intimidation had been transferred from the State to parties. They intimidated voters using leaflets to falsify voting places, days of voting and what information was required to vote. Phone calls had been used, all types of information, to basically dissuade Americans from exercising their right to vote. Through the 1950s, 1940s, 1930s, et cetera, that was the voice of our State governments and apparatus, to intimidate voters. 
   That insane act of intimidation, in communities across America and neighborhoods, now that baton had been passed to State parties, who were doing the same thing, suppressing people's right to exercise their right to vote. 
   Three years ago in this hall in the President's State of the Union, he recognized a young woman from Iraq who voted. She held up her purple finger. Colleagues, on the Republican side of the aisle, they also marked their finger purple, recognizing the importance of voting. Iraq and the people of Iraq, Sunni, Shia and Kurd, had taken that step of courage and voted. She came here in the State of the Union in this hall, the hall of democracy that people around the world look at, and said, you protected our right to vote. 
   This legislation is intended to ensure that individuals do not receive phone calls lying and deceiving about where they vote; they do not receive leaflets telling them they need other information than they properly need to vote; and, most importantly, that the location of where they are voting had been changed, when it never had been changed, all in an attempt to suppress the voting by individuals across communities and to depress the turnout of people who wanted to vote on Election Day. 
   The chairman of the committee noted other things we have to do, like a paper trail for voting to ensure the integrity on election day. 
   This legislation ensures that if you try to use acts of intimidation to deprive people of the right to vote, the United States Government, with the full force of its laws, will say there is a higher penalty and you will pay a price for that act of deception. 
   I commend Members on both sides of the aisle for bringing up this legislation. It is bipartisan in nature and in its finest sense it speaks to the voice of democracy. Whatever our policy differences on other subjects, we ensure that when people want to vote, they have a right to vote, and that the agencies of both our parties and our government don't try to intimidate people from exercising that right, but encourage them to vote. 
   That is what the Act here is. I am proud that this legislation not only receives bipartisan support, but wide support across both parties, because it speaks to what is so appropriately the American way and what is right about voting. 
   Mr. Speaker, nothing is more American than voting and nothing could be more un-American than deceiving one from taking the right to vote. 
   I want to thank the chairman for bringing this legislation to the floor today.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DONATION REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Connecticut and colleagues from California and Missouri and my other colleagues for their leadership on this legislation. 
   It is an important part of this legislation, like the other legislation we are doing on whistleblowers and protection for whistleblowers, as well as the no-bid contracts. 
   If you look at the Presidential library and the other two pieces of legislation, they all have a common meaning, to ensure that the public trust is protected from being bent for the private interest. 
   What we mean here is that, in making sure in the period of time in which  a President of the United States is raising money for their library, that at no time will their actions, or public actions, be influenced by those who are willing to support their library. In the same way that we are trying to make sure later this week when we vote on the no-bid contracts, that in no way should those contracts be renewed automatically for those who have gotten their business, no-bid contracts, and somehow had the influence to get that legislation, and the whistleblower legislation, all attempted to protect the public trust. 
   President Bush plans on raising about $500 million for his Presidential library. President Clinton's library has cost about $165 million, and President Bush's, the 41st President, library cost approximately $80 million, slightly more than that, and there are no questions asked about where the money comes from. 
   We do not know who is raising these funds, who is donating them, and if the donors are looking for any other favors in return. This process is overdue for sunlight, and we are reforming that practice here today. 
   I am proud to have worked with Congressman Waxman, Congressman Clay, Congressman Platts, and Congressman Duncan in drafting this bill, which would require the disclosure of any contribution of $200 and above for a Presidential library. This information will be available online so that every American can see who is sending money to the Oval Office. 
   Mr. Speaker, change is good. Last November, the American people voted for change and that is exactly what we are doing this week and this year. We are changing the way business is done in Washington and restoring integrity to government. 
   In the first weeks, when we were here, we initiated change on banning gifts, banning meals by lobbyists, making sure earmarks had reform, and this is part of that step-by-step process. You will not change the ways of Washington overnight, but you must have a dedicated step-by-step process to bring reform to the way business is done in Washington. This is an important step, as will be the whistleblower protection we take on today and vote on, and the no-bid contracts for those who are trying to enact contracting reform in the areas of Iraq, Katrina and other places. 
   As you just saw last week, the taxpayers are getting back only 40 cents on the dollar for the trailers they built for the protection of hurricane victims because we did not use it. We have got to reform the way Washington does work, and this is an important piece of legislation in doing that as part of our overall process. 
   I thank all my colleagues for their work on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. I thank my colleague from Miami. I can think of no other city if Chicago didn't have it than Miami. And also my colleague from New Jersey. 
   You know, both of you have mentioned something about Chicago's  physical beauty. The reason we are so proud, those of us from Chicago, of hosting the Olympics is not only our physical beauty, but I think you will see the character of our people in this greater part of Chicago, not just the city, but the suburbs, the entire metropolitan community, come together and host this Olympics and be the representation for the United States as we go forward in 2009 and try to win for Chicago and the greater Chicago area the ability to host these Olympics. 
   We do have a physically beautiful city. Its architecture is world renowned; its lakefront is known to everybody. In fact, Chicago is known as the third coast between both the Pacific on the west side and the Atlantic on the east side. It is known as the third coast in America, sitting on Lake Michigan and part of the Great Lakes. It has a great physical beauty, but its strength comes from the character of the people. And I cannot think of anything better for city that hosts, any time you go to one of its public schools we have across the city 50 some odd languages being spoken, Chinese being spoken in the school, Arabic being taught in the school. 
   Different languages from all over the world. People come to Chicago. It is the quintessential American city. There is no better place for us to have as our standard bearer for the United States than Chicago for 2016 to host the Olympics. And it is my hope, and great hope, that it would become the city and be the nominee in 2016 in the selection by the Olympic Committee. 
   You know, Carl Sandburg, the great poet, once said about Chicago, ``Stormy, husky, brawling. We are the city of big shoulders.'' That is Chicago. 
   We have a great mayor, who is a great mayor of a great city with great people. And you can see it in the pride that everybody felt that we were selected by our colleagues from around the country to be the city to host the 2016 Olympics. Our sports teams, known as the Chicago Cubs, Bulls, Bears, the White Sox, Blackhawks, and the Sky and the Fire, our soccer teams. And I hope, as we go to 2009, that we do have and will receive from the international community the nod to represent the Olympics and show to the rest of the world what all of us know in Chicago and all of those who come to our city know, that we are a great city, with a great mayor, with a great people that will do right by the world in hosting the Olympics. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for letting me offer this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, today this Congress, the 110th Congress, faces an historic vote, a vote to truly change the direction of the Iraqi conflict. 
   Let us review the cost America has borne in 4 years: 3,200 lives have been lost, 25,000 of our citizens have been injured, and nearly a half a trillion dollars have been spent, and America's reputation around the world has been sullied. 
   And under the President's leadership, his Iraqi policy comes down to something very simple: more troops, more money, more time, more of the same. That is it. 
   Now, there is a lot of rhetoric going around. We fund our troops. You fund the troops. There is one fundamental difference: We require the Iraqis to bear responsibility for Iraq, and you provide them and the President another blank check for another year. And that is the fundamental difference, whether you will bring accountability and responsibility to the Iraqis to stand up for Iraq. 
   Now, some bemoan and say we are micromanaging. I would say to you, you rubber-stamped 4 years of mismanagement. Not enough troops, not a plan for the occupation and elimination of the Iraqi Army has brought us in from in search of WMD to policing a sectarian civil war. 
   And when you talk, as the President said on January 10, that he wants the Iraqis to meet his benchmarks, but you don't have any benchmarks or any accountability for Iraq, I can only say one thing, as we say in Chicago, ``You're all hat and no cattle.'' 
   It is time, after 4 years and an unbelievable cost across America, borne mostly by our troops and their families and our military, that we ask the Iraqis to do for Iraq what they have asked us to do for them for 4 years, and that is to be accountable for their own future. 
   And I am proud that we have finally done something. We will fund the troops, and we will also demand that Iraq stand up for Iraq's future and stop leaning on America alone. 
   And we have done something that is so important that has been missing in this policy, and that is not only a new direction, but fundamentally bringing the responsibility and accountability to the Iraqis, which is why many in the Armed Forces are happy we are forcing Iraqis to do for Iraq's future what they have asked us to do, which is stop policing their civil war, but demand accountability, bring a new direction to this, because after 4 years, more troops, more money, more time is only rubber-stamping more of the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. As our soldiers continue to defend our country's freedom overseas, it is imperative that we at home continue to recognize their sacrifice by providing them with the support and services that they have earned. 
   H.R. 327 is named after an Iraq veteran Joshua Omvig, a 22-year-old Army Reservist who served honorably in Iraq, but returned home unable to cope with his memories of the war. Only months after his return from Iraq, he committed suicide. 
   The story of Joshua Omvig is not an isolated occurrence. In 2004, a study conducted by the New England Study of Medicine concluded that over 15 percent of veterans returning from a year in Iraq met screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Today, our soldiers are serving much longer than a single year and are returning from combat with severe psychological trauma. 
   H.R. 327 implements a comprehensive program that takes into consideration the special needs of veterans who are at high risk of depression and experience high rates of suicide. By directing and training the staff of Veterans Affairs in the proper screening, monitoring, and tracking of veterans, this legislation will lead to earlier diagnosis for those who may be prone to suicide. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a responsibility to support our Nation's veterans. I stand in strong support of H.R. 327, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. There has been a lot of news on Iraq and the differing strategy between Congress and the President. Let's be clear about where the differences lie. 
   The administration wants more time after 4 long years in Iraq; Democrats say it's time for a conclusion to the open-ended commitment. The administration wants 25,000 more troops for Iraq; Democrats are calling for the troops to be fully trained and equipped. The administration wants more money; Democrats are demanding Iraqis be held accountable for Iraq's future. 
   The administration policy has us policing a civil war; Democrats want to focus on al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The administration has failed our veterans on the health care they earned; Democrats are for making sure that the veterans get the health care they deserve. 
   As Yogi Berra once said, ``When you come to a fork in the road, take it.'' Madam Speaker, the President wants and is asking for more of the same; Democrats are calling for a new direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, when the Vice President met with the senior executives of big oil companies, and we wanted to know what they discussed when it came to energy policy for the country, the Vice President exerted executive privilege and said those meetings were private. 
   Now when we want to know what he is doing as it relates to America's national security in the lead-up to the war in Iraq and after the fact, the Vice President has declared he is a member of the legislative branch, the legislative branch. 
   Every 10-year-old who is studying social studies in the United States knows that the Vice President is in the executive branch. So we have decided that if the Vice President is no longer a member of the executive branch, therefore, we will no longer fund the executive branch of his office, and he can live off the funding for the Senate presidency. 
   We will follow the logic of this ludicrous argument that the Vice President of the United States is in the legislative branch, no longer in the executive branch. The Vice President is acting like he is unaccountable and above the law. 
   In fact, there is a real consequence to his decisions. His decision to avoid the historical record as it relates to America's national security has consequences. For too long he has accounted like he is above the law and not accountable, and it's time we bring him back to earth.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, let's review the score. Big Oil, one; taxpayers, zero. But today we are about to even the score. 
   When he took office, President Bush said this country was in need of a comprehensive energy policy. He was right, and unfortunately we are still waiting. 
   We are still waiting because rather than a solution we got a $14 billion taxpayer handout to oil and gas companies. Taxpayers were forced to pay twice, once at the pump and then again on April 15. At the same time, the five big oil companies made record profits of $97 billion in 2006, and the taxpayers were asked to subsidize their industry. 
   Where are gas prices today? Almost double where they were when George Bush took office. Today, as we complete our first 100 hours, it is the beginning of clean energy and the end of dirty politics. 
   Just last week, my colleagues on the other side were saying that we were subsidizing; that the private sector was working in the prescription drug area, and today they argue in favor of a $14 billion taxpayer handout for big oil companies. I am proud the inconsistency doesn't seem to get in the way of a good argument. 
   I think this serves a fitting end to our first 100 hours agenda and the 6 in '06. Two weeks ago, we began the 100 hours by enacting the most comprehensive ethics reform since the Watergate era, and we end the culture of corruption where the special interests had a free rein in determining national policy. Nowhere was that corruption of the system more apparent than the handouts to the energy companies. 
   Mr. Speaker, for the past 4 years, I have come to this podium and said that that gavel was supposed to open up the people's House, not the auction house. Today, I proudly can say that we have given the people a voice, stood up to the special interests, and fought for hardworking families. The score is tied, and we are just getting warmed up.

   H. Con. Res. 5 will establish Hire a Veteran Week, and encourages the President to issue a proclamation supporting those goals. Our Nation's veterans must be given the opportunities they deserve to make a successful transition to civilian life, and build a successful future for themselves and their families. 
   There are now more than 25 million living veterans in the United States. These dedicated men and women are among our Nation's greatest citizens. Many of our Nation's leading figures in both the private and public sectors are military veterans. 
   Military service provides valuable training in a variety of specialized fields, and helps build leadership, problem solving and management skills. Military veterans have also proven their dedication to the service of their Nation and their communities, and are eager for the opportunity to continue serving the public good in whichever field they enter after leaving the military. The opportunities we provide veterans today will benefit our Nation for many years to come. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in thanking our Nation's veterans for their service and supporting H. Con.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 90, recognizing the accomplishments of two outstanding head coaches in the NFL, Lovie Smith of the Chicago Bears and Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts. On February 4th, 2007 these two men will not only lead their teams to the field to play in the largest sporting event in America, Super Bowl XLI, they will also become the first African-American head coaches to ever bring a team to the NFL title game. 
   This past season, both Coach Smith and Coach Dungy experienced tremendous successes, leading their teams to 13-3 and 12-4 seasons respectively, and winning divisional and conference crowns for the cities of Chicago and Indianapolis. But throughout their tenure as coaches in the NFL, these two men have consistently represented the pinnacle of class and humility, providing exemplary role models for their players, families, and any child in America. 
   Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy are not just competitors, they are also friends and colleagues. Smith served as Linebackers Coach for Dungy during their time together in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers franchise. 
   During this time, Mr. Dungy served as a mentor and friend for Mr. Smith, engendering the calm and professional manner for which both coaches are highly regarded. 
   As a lifelong Chicagoan and a Bears fan, I am especially proud of Lovie Smith and the Chicago Bears, and I wish them the best of luck in Super Bowl XLI. This Sunday marks the first Chicago appearance in the Super Bowl in over 20 years, and we are all looking forward to a great game. Regardless of the outcome, the milestone that Coach Smith and Coach Dungy have reached makes Super Bowl XLI even more special. For the first time, an African-American head coach will hoist the Lombardi Trophy over his head as NFL Champion, and we can all be proud of both of the two men poised to earn that honor. 
   Madam Speaker, I again extend my congratulations to Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy on their outstanding seasons and for their breakthrough at the highest level of coaching. I wish them both the best of luck in all of their endeavors, though I certainly wish Coach Smith a bit more luck this particular Sunday. Go Bears.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, July 28, 2005. The House of Representatives, one month from now will be the 3-year anniversary of the House Republican Congress passing their energy bill. The minority leader, who was just here, said at that time when gas was $2.29 a gallon, ``It will ultimately lead to lower energy prices for the consumer and will spur our economy.'' 
   President Bush when it was signed: ``I am confident that one day Americans will look back on this bill as a vital step toward a more secure and more prosperous Nation that is less dependent on foreign sources of energy.'' 
   We have had 3 years of your energy policy, 3 years where you promised lower prices and a spur to the economy. By any standard of the imagination, it is a failure. Not because you want it to be. You thought it was the right policy. But it was a failure. 
   We have today a policy, because we do not believe this is an either-or choice, between more drilling or more conservation. We think it takes both. That is why we passed the standards, which you did not after 12 years in control, to increase the fuel efficiency standards for our cars. The first time in 30 years that was done. You all voted against that in your leadership. 
   Second, when it comes to drilling, we do believe as it relates to the oil and gas companies who are having record profits, use it or lose it. We gave you 68 million acres of public land. I have 3 children, 11, 9 and 8. My middle one, she loves chocolate, really loves chocolate. But we have a rule in the house: You don't get your desert until you finish everything on your plate. And to the oil and gas companies that want those leases in other areas, you don't get those leases until you finish what is on your plate.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, from the beginning, the Bush administration has offered a litany of reasons to justify their decision to fire the U.S. Attorneys. Unfortunately, the answers they provided have never even held up for 48 hours. 
   First, the Bush administration said the attorneys were fired because of performance-related issues. Yet we find out these attorneys have exemplary records. The Deputy Attorney General did not even review the file of one of the fired U.S. Attorneys. 
   Then the administration said it was an internal staffing issue and pointed the finger at Harriet Miers. And now other top White House officials not only knew about it from the beginning, but were behind the firings. 
   Yesterday the White House said that they will talk to Congress, but they will not take the oath and swear to tell the whole truth. 
   The White House says they have nothing to hide, but they are only willing to speak behind closed doors, not under oath. Our goal is to finally get to the truth, but not to create a confrontation. 
   The scandal at the Justice Department has gone on long enough. Careers have been destroyed, and legitimate public corruption cases have been derailed. It is time for accountability. It is time for the truth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Chairman, more than 40 years ago, this House stood up in the name of America and did the right thing and passed sweeping civil rights legislation to protect men and women of all races from discrimination. By widening the circle of freedom to include those who stood outside its embrace, America strengthened the character of its democracy. 
   And that is exactly what we are doing today with this vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has had a profound impact on our Nation. But the work to create a more just, equal Nation that began decades ago is unfinished. This morning, in 30 States across this country, millions of gay and lesbian Americans went to work knowing full well that they could be fired simply because of their sexual orientation. Their job performance would have nothing to do with their being fired. In too many places simply being gay can cost you your job. 
   We should all be able to agree that this type of discrimination is inconsistent with American values. But for too many gay and lesbian Americans, it is a reality. This Congress has a duty to make this form of discrimination a thing of the past. We should be gratified by the fact that many American employers already do the right thing and protect the rights of their workers. Many Fortune 500 companies take these type of policies. For those who say the private sector should be a guiding light for government, well, here is your chance to prove it. 
   Some employers have failed to protect their workers, though, so this Congress has been left with the duty to make sure our values are represented in our laws. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act offers basic protections that everyone enjoys and takes for granted, except gays and lesbians, and this law allows it to be true for them. But more importantly, this bill is yet another important step forward in ensuring that justice and genuine equality for every American is the law of the land. 
   Today, I hope my colleagues will join us to pass this critical legislation and continue this country's long-running commitment to eliminate discrimination in all its forms.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank both the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, also Congressman Levin, as well as the minority leader, Congressman McCrery, for their leadership on this issue. 
   This bill picks up exactly where the last trade agreement with Singapore and Jordan was, where we were putting a human face on globalization; that is, having labor environmental standards inside those trade agreements. The last 6 years we walked away from that bipartisan agreement. This restores that bipartisan agreement and again returns America to where, when it comes to opening markets around the world to American products, we stand together for that opportunity. 
   But make no mistake about it. While that is one piece of an overall economic strategy, this is a good piece, it's an important piece, opening markets to American-made products. 
   But, in addition to this, we must have an economic strategy that deals with people's retirement insecurities, their health care insecurities as it relates to their costs and opportunities, as well as educational opportunities for their children. If you don't have that as part of this strategy, we only have one piece of that economic strategy. This is an important piece, and it continues, I think, the responsibility we have to open markets across the world to American-made products. 
   But we must finish our effort on dealing with globalization as it relates to the opportunity, not just the opportunities abroad, but the challenges here at home to make sure people and more and more Americans have an opportunity to be winners in this globalization rather than see globalization as a threat to their own economic security. 
   So, although I do support this, and I support this aggressively because this is a good deal, it returns us to the bipartisanship, and most importantly, in my view, this begins to once again put a human face on globalization and allows the American employees and workers who are struggling every day to see this as globalization, not as a threat to their economic security, but as an opportunity. If we do that, globalization and more people will be winners.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, Republicans and Democrats throughout the Nation agree no child in our Nation should go without health care. In States across the country, Democratic and Republican Governors have supported strengthening the Children's Health Insurance Program. In the Senate, Republicans have come forward and said they support the Democratic plan to give millions of children health care. 
   Now the only question is whether our Republican colleagues here in the House will join our effort to give 10 million children the care they need and deserve. Remember, this is the same guarantee our own children have. The kids of Congress men and women get the health care they need and the health care they deserve. The question is are we going to provide that for our constituents' children? 
   The Children's Health Insurance Program has broad bipartisan political support, and we are on the brink of providing 10 million children that quality care. That is millions of children who will be able to see a doctor they deserve when they are sick. And it is millions of children and their families who aren't interested in our political battles or political posturing that won't heal a sick child or give them comfort when they are ill.  
   Republican Senators have stepped forward. Now the children across America and their parents are waiting on this Congress to act. And the question is, will this Congress give our constituents' children the same health care that their own children have?

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE DUMPING OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE INTO THE GREAT LAKES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota, who has been a leader on the Great Lakes issue, and also my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, because this issue is not a Democratic or a Republican issue; it is an issue between right and wrong. 
   British Petroleum, who is now seeking to expand their refinery capacity in Indiana, has run advertising campaigns all over the country that they are ``beyond petroleum.'' If they are allowed to dump more ammonia and mercury and other metals into the Great Lakes, BP's ``beyond petroleum'' will become standard for ``big polluter.'' 
   I say that not just as a way to embarrass them, although I hope it accomplishes that goal. They have the capacity to live up to what they are advertising; that they are a company that is sensitive to the environment. 
   Thirty-seven million Americans now get their daily drinking water from the Great Lakes. It is the largest body of fresh water in North America. It contains 20 percent of the world's freshwater supply. It is the economic heart of the Midwest. 
   As my colleague Mr. Oberstar noted, the fire at the Cuyahoga River and on Lake Erie galvanized the country. When I was growing up, prior to that bill, we used to run past the dead fish, dive into Lake Michigan, and swim 30 or 40 feet past all the dead fish to pop up. The Clean Water Act improved dramatically the environmental standard of Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, Lake Superior, Lake Ontario and all the Great Lakes. The question here is, are we going to move forward, or are we going to go back? 
   What is ironic about all of this is that this issue isn't about technology. They can do the refining to clean up and make sure that we don't dump ammonia and mercury and other environmental hazards into the lake. The question here is not technology or money. They are spending $3.8 billion to expand this facility, which is a good thing to do, because it will help on the energy supply. 
   The question is they said they don't have the land mass to deal with it. They have 2.6 square miles there. If you look on the Google map, you can see the size of what they have. It is 1,600 acres. They have the land capacity to do this. 
   Now, I compliment British Petroleum on one other issue. They brought Democrats and Republicans together on a single issue. They are a uniter, not a divider. Usually we are divided here on other issues, so I want to compliment BP for having brought Democrats and Republicans together in a unique act of bipartisanship realizing that Lake Michigan and other Great Lakes deserve our support. 
   We have made great progress. The question before us is whether BP will live not only up to their advertising, but what this Congress has committed to do, and every Congress has committed to do for the last 30 years, is that when it comes to our lakes, our drinking waters, whether we are going to go forward or backward. 
   I would hope that BP would take this notion that what they are seeing today on the floor is the beginning of a pressure, and that they realize that the decision they make, they can do the right thing. I think every one of us knows that if they made a decision to expand their refinery with the environmental qualities, every one of us would put a resolution on the floor the next day praising them for that decision. 
   So they have the choice: We will join them and say that they are right. They are a company that literally puts their money where their mouth is. Are they ``beyond petroleum,'' or will they be the company known as the ``big polluter''? They have a choice. 
   I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for having this resolution on the floor and taking the leadership and the time to commit to this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, there's a sad irony on this decision by British Petroleum, and that is, 10 years ago, 1997, when I was working in the White House, we had made a decision and Geolyse standards were negotiated at that point, coming on line just about now. It took all of the States, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, to set standards, as also the other States supported the Great Lakes, about polluting and what was allowed and permissible to pollute on the lakes and what wasn't. And those Geolyse standards that brought everybody together 10 years ago and started this movement to protect our Great Lakes in a way that we had not seen since the Clean Water Act, that negotiation and the product of that negotiation was just coming on line right now. 
   And just at that moment, we have this decision by British Petroleum, which is the most significant dumping in Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes and Lake Michigan since basically we started the Clean Water Act and reversing the trend of using the lake as nothing but a dumping ground. 
   Now, if this can happen in Lake Michigan, it can happen in other Great Lakes, which is why other Members of other delegations have stepped forward, and I want to repeat, all that British Petroleum has to do here is they have the technology to actually take a different course here. It's about the size of a land mass that they have to acquire, and if you look again at Google Map, they have plenty of land, 1,600 acres, to do what's right. 
   So many decisions we face on the environment are about jobs and the environment. You can both double the size of the refinery, create those 80 jobs, and also preserve our national commitment to the clean water of Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes. It's not an either/or choice. 
   And what's so sad about the rush here is that this is a decision that could easily be won, that's a victory for British Petroleum, doubling the size of their refinery, but not doubling the size of the ammonia that's dumped into Lake Michigan and not increasing the amount of both mercury and other metals that are going to be untreated, dumped into Lake Michigan, and then we're all going to be asked to increase the money to clean up what they could have done in the beginning. 
   They're spending $3.8 billion. For a fraction, they could actually not only increase the refinery, but increase the capacity to treat these chemicals, and then we're all going to be asked to increase the money to clean up Lake Michigan with something that never should have happened and hasn't happened for 10 years.     
   Now, this unusual unity here is because all of us have constituents that don't regard this as a party issue, a partisan issue; they regard it as a commitment. We have had a tremendous increase in the consciousness of folks about the importance of Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes to the environment. 
   If this was the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, there would be no question. Lake Michigan, Ontario, Superior, Erie and all the Great Lakes are the Midwest's national parks. They stand as the largest body of fresh water in North America. Twenty percent of the world's entire fresh water is right there. 
   It is America's third coast. We would never consider doing this to any other national treasure. BP should not consider it here. They can double the size of the refinery, which is a good thing; they can increase employment by 80 jobs, a good thing; and they can be true to their advertising, ``Beyond Petroleum,'' and being the most green energy company if they decide to take the right actions. We'll help them if they want to do that. 
   But to act intransigent, like they have, is wrong. We are going to be meeting with the North American executive this afternoon. I know the Illinois delegation is. We are going to meet with them to let them know that they have a choice here to live up to their word. 
   I want to again thank all of my colleagues for stepping forward and giving a voice to their constituents who are outraged across the area with the decision by British Petroleum to do something no other company has decided to do in the last 10 years and reverse the standards and the progress we have made on the environmental quality of our Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, in the past week, we negotiated what the financial markets needed and what the public market wanted, taxpayer protections. This is only the first step. 
   While we address the balance sheets of banks, the next step must now address the checkbooks for middle class families and the struggles that they face. The middle class today is working harder, earning less, and paying more. In the last 7 years, median household income has dropped by $1,200, and costs for energy, health care, as well as college education, have gone up $4,800. 
   The middle class is hurting and squeezing. The second economic program must put their needs at the heart of what we do, because today it is important to have universal access to savings, universal access to higher education, a middle class tax cut. 
   If you work, you have health care. We must build an energy policy that makes this a hybrid economy, an agenda that puts the middle class at the heart of its economic strategy. Unlike the last 7 years, we will make sure that what we are doing today is successful in the future, because we must strengthen the economy while we save and deal with the financial markets crisis on this short-term basis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. I thank my friend from California for the time. 
   When I worked in the White House in 1996, we took two important steps on dealing with mental health parity. The first was signing the mental health parity legislation in 1996. That was referred to earlier. The second was also signing the executive order that ensured that government workers, Members of Congress and their staff, as well as other government workers, also had mental health parity in their health care. Some would think we are a little crazy for being in this job, but now we have got health care coverage for it. 
   The fact of what this legislation does is provide for the taxpayers in America and make sure that they have the same access to the same type of health care that we have. It's that simple. When we did the first bill, the same people that were opposed to this bill, the insurance companies, said it would ruin the health care system. It didn't happen. The same insurance companies that are in the Federal employee system said they couldn't do what the executive order told them they had to do. They did it. 
   Every time you try to make a little more reform to have a little more coverage, the insurance companies tell you that you can't do it. We accomplished it, and we accomplished it by doing right by the American people. 
   The prior speaker mentioned that everybody is for covering mental health coverage, or for having mental health coverage, except for when it comes to covering mental health coverage. You can't be for it and then against it. Everybody was for an increase in the minimum wage, except for when you wanted to vote for it, they weren't voting for it. Everybody thought it was a good idea to increase Pell Grants, except for when it came to vote to increase Pell Grants. 
   Well, here we are going to do this. You can't just say you're for mental health parity and then vote against it. This is the legislation. It builds on what we did in 1996 and 1999, and brings the type of reforms that are necessary. This is an illness, and these illnesses affect everybody's families, everybody's families, and it makes sure that there is one set of rules to the road when it comes to health care coverage. 
   I appreciate the time, and it's time that we have this type of legislation on the floor.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Defense Secretary Gates requested 43 billion more dollars for the war in Iraq, 43 billion more dollars to support the President's plan for more of the same. We have spent $400 billion in 4 years on the war in Iraq. 
   For 41 days of the cost of the war, 10 million children would get health care. For 1 month for the cost of the war, 7 1/2 million children would get health care. For 1 week of the cost of the war, 2 1/2 million children would get health care. 
   While billions have gone unaccounted for in Iraq, and the administration has shown no willingness to do what is necessary to crack down on the waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq, the President calls health care for American children excessive spending.  
   The President is asking for an open-ended, open-wallet commitment to Iraq; and yet he's told America's children, you're on your own. 
   I want you to think about this: there have been three vetoes in President Bush's 7 years; one to redeploy from Iraq, one to permit stem cell research, and one to give 10 million children health care; and it says it all about the President and his priorities.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month the President said, ``If Congress fails to pass a bill that I can sign by mid-April, the Army will be forced to consider cutting back on equipment, equipment repair and quality of life initiatives for our Guard and Reserve forces.'' 
   Today, though, the Pentagon reports it has enough money to pay for the war in Iraq through June. So despite the doomsday reports from the White House, our military leaders are confident we have sufficient funding while we debate a new direction for the war in Iraq. 
   Then the President said that the timeline for redeployment that was part of our funding would undermine our troops and send the wrong signal to the enemy. Yesterday, Secretary Gates said our debate here in Congress has had a positive impact by ``communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not the time for scoring political points or posturing and positioning. The President should know that after 4 years of chaos and bloodshed, the American people sent Democrats to Washington to bring a new direction to our Iraq policy. 
   Today, thousands of American troops find themselves in the middle of someone else's civil war, backing an Iraqi government that has yet to stand up for itself. 
   Democrats are calling for a new direction in Iraq.

   Mr. EMANUEL. About a week ago, this Congress passed the most comprehensive update of the GI Bill of Rights for both Active Duty, Guard and Reserve soldiers. We follow up that legislation with what we are doing today to also update our laws as relates to active duty soldiers and their families. 
   The fact is, as my colleague from the Philadelphia area said, this war is different. We have noted the difference. We need to adjust our policy and our legislation and our laws to the fact that this war has gone on longer than anybody predicted, cost more in lives, treasure, and reputation than any war in America's past. 
   So today we take another small step to change our laws to reflect this different kind of war to make sure those soldiers and their families are represented in the laws we pass today. Now many will talk about some of the benefits, and they should. I want to talk about one particular provision that I put in here with my colleague from Indiana, who you will hear from later, Congressman Ellsworth, about how we pay for this, because it doesn't add one penny to the deficit. 
   It closes down a tax loophole used by KBR, a company, that it set up offshore in the Cayman Islands a subsidiary, and it never paid Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, unemployment insurance taxes to 10,000 workers. Never paid any of those taxes on any of those employees. This legislation shuts that down. 
   Those employees were over there. And what happened? This company gave contaminated water to our soldiers, who ended up, many of them, in the hospital getting health care by the basic facilities we have over in Iraq. Our soldiers got contaminated water, our taxpayers got ripped off because they had to cover for another company what they didn't pay in their fair share, and a company was set up offshore to do all of that.

   Mr. EMANUEL. It's ironic that it took 4 years to close this offshore loophole. But we are shutting it down and paying for all these other benefits to ensure that this company and other companies like it who set up in the Cayman Islands do not go around the law of the United States to come in under budget, knowing the fact they never paid their fair share of taxes. 
   It's a small step. It also is an indication we need to start changing the law because there is over 12,000 companies in the Cayman Islands alone set up over there, avoiding their fair share of taxes while the American taxpayers have to pay their portion. 
   So I am pleased that we are doing this, giving the benefits to the GIs and their families, but, most importantly, closing down an egregious loophole to do that.

   Established by the Brady bill in 1994, NICS is the main point of contact for firearms dealers to determine if an individual is ineligible to purchase a gun. Current law prohibits criminals, drug addicts, those adjudicated as mentally ill, domestic abusers and others from being able to purchase fire arms. The NICS Improvement Act will improve this system by requiring States to update the system with their own lists of individuals who are no longer qualified to buy guns under the 1968 Gun Control Act. 
   The recent tragedy at Virginia Tech has shown that the data used to conduct background checks clearly needs to be improved. Seung Hui Cho had been adjudicated mentally ill and should not have been able to purchase a weapon, but NICS did not have that information on file, enabling him to pass an instant background check before purchasing his weapons. 
   No one who is prohibited by law from buying a gun should be able to skirt the law thanks to outdated data. The NICS Improvement Act will require the transmittal of Federal and State records to NICS, as well as create incentives for the States to keep the information accurate and up to date. 
   During my time in the White House, I was proud to be a part of passing the Brady bill  and I know my friends Jim and Sarah Brady are as proud as I am that we are taking action to improve this system to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. 
   Mr. Speaker, nothing can bring back the victims of the tragedy at Virginia Tech, and my heart goes out to the families of those who were lost this past April. We need to learn from this tragedy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in doing just that by passing the NICS Improvement Act today.

   An overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats in Congress disagree with the President on this issue. But the President is content to continue to stand between 10 million children and their health care. The President's refusal to move forward could have serious consequences for middle-class families. 
   The New York Times reported today that 21 States will run out of money for children's health care this year if the spending for the SCHIP program continues only at current levels. The parents of these children earn a paycheck, not a welfare check. Millions of children and their parents are counting on this President and Republicans in Congress to offer more than an emergency room as health care. 
   The same children who are counting on the President to act will celebrate Halloween this evening and President Bush won't miss out on the fun. At 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, President Bush is having what he calls an SCHIP Halloween. It's all trick, no treat. He's preventing health care coverage for millions of kids.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. There have been a number of important lessons learned in this last year. One, you cannot have a strong economy on a foundation of a weakened middle class. For the last 7 years, the middle class has seen median household incomes decline by $1,200 and costs go up by $4,800. They are working harder, making less, and paying more to maintain their standard of living. 
   And, second, that this problem is not an earthquake, it's not a natural disaster. It's a manmade disaster, and one in which a philosophy of unregulation created that type of damage. You can come to the conclusion that capitalism is too important to be left to capitalists alone, that the banks that are surviving are the ones that are regulated. The unregulated are the ones that are going under. 
   People have figured out this problem. The financial industry created things that they don't, themselves, know what the value are. People were buying homes that were being flipped as if they were pancakes. And the regulators that were supposed to be policing this were asleep at the switch; and they're angry at all three, and they have every right to be. 
   The substance of this legislation has been improved because last Saturday the Treasury Department sent a bill to calm the markets down. And what Congress did in the remaining 7 days is put in there protections for the taxpayers. It had nothing to start with as it related to the taxpayers. The last 7 days was to make sure that the public markets were as protected as the financial markets were calmed. And we have made dramatic improvements in this legislation. 
   But make no doubts about it: While this may try to avert the recession in the financial sector, our job is not done until we avert the recession on Main Street, that we once again get a growth in jobs, we once again get a growth in median household incomes.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   The minority leader brought up two essential points which were basically, at that point, why we were here at a quarter to 1 in the morning. The first point dealt with the issues of fiscal responsibility and spending, and the second issue dealt with earmarks and the procedure or transparency and the questions that the minority had. 
   On the first issue of fiscal responsibility, he said that they were tired of the amount of spending that was going on and how basically flagrant spending had happened under Democrats. 
   After 6 years and $4 trillion of new debt run by a Republican President and Republican Congress and Republican Senate, I do appreciate your conversion on the road to Damascus as it relates to fiscal responsibility and spending. And I do believe that after we've seen the highest increase in the Nation's debt in the shortest period of time under a Republican Congress and a Republican President, adding $4 trillion to the Nation's debt, that you have decided enough is enough when it comes to a piece of legislation on homeland security, 5 years after the strike on 9/11. I think it's ironic that it's on this bill that you have decided the spending issue you want to debate. 
   Now, the minority leader did offer, and he has said as recently as a couple weeks ago, when we have certain debates on the war in Iraq, protecting America, to always be conscious that people from around the world are watching this debate. So I do believe as it relates to homeland security, as we try to protect our borders, as we try to protect our ports, and as we try to protect our cargo, I'm sure the terrorists around the world are quaking in their boots on the motions to rise. You've given them nothing but fear as that issue emerges. That is your right.

   What does this bill actually do? And it's ironic that it's the Republican Congress that basically has enacted, for lack of a better term, a filibuster in name that prevents us from considering 3,000 new border agents. 
   It's ironic that it is the Republicans in the minority who have dealt with, for the first time we're dealing with adding funding for nuclear material detection, you're preventing that to be voted on. 
   It's the Republican minority who is dealing with, as it relates to our port security, adding 100 percent new equipment and radiation detection to deal with radiation coming into the port which we know from all the intelligence is an attempt by those who are trying to hurt and harm America, and there's also an increase in our cargo protection. 
   We've increased funding for our police and fire equipment and fire departments; grants to study and make sure urban areas know how to deal with an emergency; transit grants in case terrorists try to strike our areas in major urban areas; fire grants; communications equipment for police and firefighters; port security funding; explosive detection system; air cargo explosive screening; customs and border agents, adding, as I said, 3,000 new agents for the border, 250 additional customs agents; law enforcement efforts for customs officers; fence requirements all for our border, all this to make sure that our borders, our cargo system, and our ports are secured. 
   Anytime you want to have that discussion, as long as you want to have that discussion, we are ready to have that discussion of what it takes to secure America, but after 5 years of the strike on America, I find it somewhat poetic that this would be the bill that on procedural grounds you would decide to bring the Congress to a halt. 
   And I do appreciate since there are no earmarks in this legislation, you seem to be making an argument about earmarks on this issue that fully funds our efforts to secure America. 
   To the minority leader's second point on earmarks, the question is, and it's a legitimate question for us to debate, have we lived up to our rhetoric?

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, like my colleagues, I too, rise in support of the full funding for the 100,000 community police officers. It has been a linchpin to a very successful anti-crime strategy. 
   In the 1990s, we pursued a single strategy of putting more cops on the beat and getting gangs, guns and drugs off the street. It led to the longest and largest decline of violent crime in American history. 
   After the elimination of the COPS program, community police officers, we saw a steady increase in violent crime. Cops doing community policing, an old strategy, door by door, knowing their neighbors, knowing their community, led to a dramatic drop in violent crime. Reducing those 100,000 extra police on the streets led to an increase in violent crime. 
   Democrats came here to change Washington, to bring a new direction to our policy. Seeing an increase in violent crime in America, we went back to a basic fundamental strategy that has proven year after year to be successful, adding 100,000 cops, doing community policing, knowing their neighbors, knowing the kids that go to school, knowing where the problems are, hitting the problems before they start, leading to the most successful anti-violent crime strategy in American history.

   After that program's success of adding 120,000 community police officers to the streets across this country, when it was ended in 2002 we saw violent crime in America begin to inch up again. Community police officers walking the beat, knowing the neighborhood and knowing their community is the linchpin of a successful anti-crime strategy.     
   I am so proud that we have a bill here representing, again, going back to a very basic approach of community policing by putting more cops on the beat, which is the success to reducing violent crime in America. We saw that rise again because this COPS Program ended. Every sheriff, police chief and mayor has asked for this program to be renewed, and I am proud we have done that to successfully once again get back to helping our communities reduce crime. In Chicago, we added 1,800 cops and we saw crime reduced in our neighborhood.

   We're offering a new direction. You are offering the status quo. There is no doubt about it. Because you have given us, and nobody has really quite said thank you enough to your $4 trillion of new debt, and you need to be appreciated for it. Because, as I've always said, if there is one thing you can say about George Bush and the Republicans when it comes to the economy, we will forever be in your debt. And that is the one thing that is absolutely clear about your stewardship with this economy. 
   Four trillion dollars, the largest accumulation of debt in the shortest period of time in American history. Don't look at your shoes when I'm saying it now, because you know that is your legacy. 
   Now, what are the priorities and the differences? 
   In Medicaid and Medicare, let's just take a look at health care, number one economic issue for the American people. You cut $250 billion for Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats double the size of the children's health care program in this country. Two choices: Status quo, a new direction. 
   You cut $5 billion from college assistance for people who are trying to achieve the American dream. We expand college assistance by $3.5 billion. 
   You have made a decision to make cuts in other areas like agriculture. We make sure that our farmers have a future where their children can inherit the farm and have a future in rural America. 
   The choices are clear. We have a balanced budget that is balanced with our priorities. You maintain an economic strategy that adds to the Nation's debt as you have in past years. 
   Every year of our budget, the deficit declines. Every year under our budget, 5 years in a row, the budget deficit declines until it reaches balance and eventually a surplus. Every year. You achieve your goals by cutting $250 billion from health care assistance, Medicare and Medicaid.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, last year, we promised to break the link between lobbyists and legislators here in Washington and to fundamentally change the culture of corruption that has become accepted practice here. This new law is on the doorstep of becoming law. 
   Today, we will pass this bill that fixes an institutional problem with an institutional solution. Our bill mandates unprecedented disclosure of lobbying activities and turns the spotlight on special interests who have grown too comfortable with their special access. 
   Most importantly, our legislation levels the playing field between the special interests and the voters. When the gavel comes down on the Speaker's podium, it is intended to open the people's House, not the auction house. 
   The American people, and not paid lobbyists on behalf of the special interests, should have access to their government 365 days a year. Election day should not just be a formality. 
   Now the Senate must do its work and pass this legislation. Americans have waited long enough for this Congress to pass real lobbying reform. It is time to turn this bill into law and give the American people a government as good as its people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3232, the Travel Promotion Act of 2007. I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts, Congressman Delahunt, for his hard work on this bill, which would create American jobs, help boost our economy, and improve our image abroad through international goodwill. 
   The Travel Promotion Act would create a nonprofit entity funded by private companies to promote tourism in the United States, an industry which is vital to our economy and helps improve America's image abroad. For example, last year, Chicago alone welcomed an additional 1.15 million overseas visitors, an increase of 8 percent from 2006. Illinois saw tourism revenue from international visitors rise 15.6 percent to $1.98 billion in 2007. 
   In addition to tourism being a key component of the American economy, the best way to improve our standing abroad is for people from other countries to come meet Americans and see our cities and sights. 
   To that end, the Travel Promotion Act can aid in our efforts to bring the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games to Chicago. Encouraging the world to visit Chicago for the Olympics would help showcase us as one of America's greatest cities, helping to build support for the 2016 Games in Chicago. Chicago was the 9th most popular U.S. city for overseas visitors last year, and the more people that visit our city and meet Chicagoans, the more goodwill we will build for our bid for Chicago to be the host city in 2016. 
   Madam Speaker, millions of Americans came away with a new understanding of China thanks to the Beijing Games this past summer. The Travel Promotion Act can help promote America to people all over the world, and as more people come to Chicago, I am confident that they will know what we know--Chicago is a first class city ready to host the world in 2016.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, for 30 years, since the first oil shock of 1973, we've been facing an energy crisis in the United States. And let's be honest and level with the American people, both parties have missed opportunities to deal with it. And the American people hold all of us accountable. 
   So I'm proud that this Congress, in its first time in less than a year, increased the fuel efficiency standards for cars, something that's been kicked around, talked about for 30 years. This Congress in its short, first year took action.  
   And I'm proud that our Republican colleagues who claim to be for the all-of-the-above energy policy can vote for the most comprehensive energy policy and legislation in 20 years, what we have here today. 
   Now, listen. You can be for drilling offshore. And this bill provides 300 additional acres of drilling. But that is not a cure to our energy independence. It is not just drilling offshore, but it's also what we do onshore in our laboratories, our universities with our innovation and our technology for our energy independence. 
   This bill provides that we invest in our renewable energy technologies and ends big subsidies for big oil companies. We require utility companies to use wind, solar and biomass to generate more electricity. 
   What I'm most proud about is also what it does in the area of natural gas, which those who are in the industry see as revolutionary for their industry. Natural gas is 100 percent U.S. supply, 33 percent cleaner and 40 percent cheaper. And it provides the infrastructure to make sure that our auto industry can start to convert and start to use natural gas, something Europe has been doing and the United States has been lagging. And here's an energy source that today is available. Just in the State of Utah, drivers can pay $0.83 per gallon if they fill up with natural gas.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (ALAN GREENSPAN AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, in Alan Greenspan's recently released memoir, President Bush and the Republicans in Congress come in for some sharp criticism. 
   Reuters said of the book, ``Mr. Greenspan sharply criticizes President Bush's administration and Republican congressional leaders in his memoir for putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies.'' 
   The New York Times said of Mr. Greenspan's book described, ``The Bush administration is so captive to its own political operation that it paid little attention to the fiscal discipline for the Nation.'' 
   Increasing America's debt by $3 trillion, the same fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s, the pay-as-you-go rules, led to a $5 trillion surplus when President Bush took office and has led to a $3 trillion debt increase under President Bush and the Republicans. 
   The fiscal discipline that we had in the 1990s is exactly what the Democrats have put in place in this new Congress, hoping to put in place the fiscal type of discipline and the budgetary discipline that would lead us again to surpluses and balancing America's book. 
   And Mr. Greenspan could not have said it better, when people have taken the time to put their political interests ahead of America's long-term economic interests.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (``GREENSPAN'' -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, the former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has recently released his memoir for the years of his time in public service. And it comes as a surprise to many that President Bush and the Republicans in Congress do not fair particularly well. 
   Reuters said the Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan, in his book, ``sharply criticizes the President, President Bush's administration and Republican congressional leaders for putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies.'' The New York Times said of Mr. Greenspan's book: ``The Bush administration was so captive to its own political operation that it paid little attention to fiscal discipline.'' 
   And the irony here is that when President Bush took office and the Republicans had control of the House and the Senate, they were left with $5 trillion in surplus. And in a short period of time, they've added $3 trillion to the Nation's debt; $3 trillion, the fastest accumulation of debt and greatest amount of debt in the shortest period of time in American history. 
   Now, this is what he goes on to say about this administration, which I find almost intriguing, and also about the Republicans. He looked forward, he says, to working with this administration because at least he worked, as he said, with some of the best and brightest of this administration. And he shared memorable experiences with Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, among others. And on a personal basis, that is how it worked. But on policy matters, I was soon to see my old friends veer off in unexpected directions. 
   He was disappointed, he says, from the start. Mr. Greenspan notes that ``little value was placed on rigorous economic policy debate or weighing the long-term consequences.'' He says that in George W. Bush's White House, the political operation was far more dominant. 
   Now, I will mention, since it's only fair, that he is quite complimentary of what President Clinton and the Democrats did in the 1990s of basically a pay-as-you-go process, weighing long-term economic consequences to their decisions, and always putting America's long-term economic consequences before political considerations. And he praises what was then the fiscal discipline that was adopted in the 1990s that led to unprecedented economic growth. 
   Now, Mr. Greenspan does not put all the burden of the $3 trillion of debt on President Bush. He puts that burden also on the Republicans in Congress for what they did in conjunction with this President. And, again, let me read from his book. Greenspan says that ``for many of the Republican Party leaders, altering the electoral process to create permanent Republican-led government became a major goal. House Speaker Hastert and House Majority Leader Tom Delay seemed readily inclined to loosen the Federal purse strings any time it might help add a few more seats to the Republican majority.'' 
   Alan Greenspan notes that the Republicans led an earmark explosion and says Congress was too busy feeding at the trough. In the end, Mr. Greenspan says again, ``The Republican Congress lost their way. They swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither.'' Mr. Greenspan praises the pay-as-you-go spending rules and the fiscal disciplines of the 1990s that resulted in the surplus I just mentioned.  
   That is exactly what this new Congress has done is adopt the pay-as-you-go rules, the fiscal discipline that put us on a path to again putting our fiscal house in order and in balance with our priorities as we go. 
   But Mr. Greenspan's book, I don't think any time soon will be on the best seller list or talked about in Republican clubs or Republican book circles, lays bare what a number of us have been saying about this administration and the Republican Congress, that they, or as John McCain quotes, ``spend like a bunch of drunken sailors.'' And they have now left America stranded with mountains of debt. 
   The one thing that we can say about President Bush and the Republican Congress when it comes to the economy and the fiscal mess that they've left is that we will forever be in their debt. That is one thing that you can always say. But I find it most intriguing that Greenspan, who is a life-long Republican and served and worked with President Reagan, President Bush, President Clinton, President Bush, and President Ford, saw that this administration and this Republican Congress and cohorts, when they worked together for 6 years, left this country in a worse fiscal shape than the one they inherited. And all of us will be judged in our public life for the country we inherited and the country we left behind. And what we got left behind is nothing but a fiscal mess that those of us who have taken the tough votes and the tough decisions put America's long-term economic interests at the center of our economic policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Chairman, I was listening to my friend from Arizona, which is a State with a desert that has both Lake Powell and Lake Havasu that have been built with Federal money so they can have water. Talk about Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes, the largest body of freshwater in all of America, in fact, 90 percent of the freshwater in the United States, 20 percent of the world's freshwater. Thirty-seven million Americans get their daily drinking water from Lake Michigan and other Great Lakes. 
   The Shedd Aquarium, as you noted, has more visitors, 2 million people, in fact, people from Arizona come to see the Shedd Aquarium. More people visit that aquarium than any other aquarium for the last 10 years. 
   This program actually has bipartisan support, as you probably know, in the Commerce, State, and Justice bill. My good friend from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), a Republican, got resources to help the Shedd Aquarium. 
   The reason we are doing this, and you may not have known this and obviously those of us in the Great Lakes States care greatly about it, but BP, British Petroleum, the other day has gotten a waiver now to dump more untreated ammonia in the Great Lakes. It is our greatest national treasure like Yellowstone Park, like the Grand Canyon and others. The freshwater that surrounds Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio is a great national treasure. It provides, as I said, 37 million Americans with their daily drinking water. And the Shedd Aquarium educates other people to the importance of the Great Lakes. 
   And I always noted the State of Arizona actually had a plan on the books, and I think got an earmark for this once, how to build a pipeline from the Great Lakes to provide water to Arizona. You have got a desert; we have got the Great Lakes. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), who has been a supporter of the Shedd Aquarium.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1677, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007. Too often, middle-class taxpayers find themselves confused and frustrated by the complexity of the tax code. Over 60 percent of taxpayers now use a paid preparer to file their tax return, costing them hundreds or thousands of dollars that they could have used for college, health care, or retirement. 
   This legislation provides overdue relief for taxpayers that will protect them from fraud, require the IRS to do a better job of communicating which tax credits a taxpayer can qualify for, and hold tax cheats accountable for their actions. Today is Tax Day, and this legislation sends a message to taxpayers that help is on the way. 
   Hearings held by Chairman JOHN LEWIS provided ample evidence that taxpayers are too often exposed to identify theft or unaware of potential benefits. The Taxpayer Protection Act will require the IRS to notify taxpayers involved in tax fraud investigations that there may have been an unauthorized use of their identities, will provide filers with a longer period of time to seek restitution from the IRS for a wrongful penalty, punish predatory lenders, and require the IRS to promote the Earned Income Tax Credit so that more Americans can take care of a tax benefit they have earned but have not been notified. 
   Madam Speaker, Tax Day can be a difficult day for many Americans. Let us do our part to make common-sense reforms that put the government back on the side of the average taxpayer. 
   I thank Mr. RANGEL, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1677, the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday the President will issue an interim report on the Iraqi government's success or failure meeting the benchmarks. But prior to taking a look at that report, we have another set of benchmarks to look at; that is, the benchmarks for President Bush's administration and what they've done on the Iraqi policy. 
   When the war began, The White House said that Americans would be greeted as liberators. That's not happening. 
   Next we were told oil revenues would finance the reconstruction of the Iraqi society. Not happening. 
   Then we were told that the insurgency was in its last throes. Not happening. 
   Then we were told that we were planting a democracy in the heart of the Mideast. Not happening. 
   At every turn, the administration's benchmarks for the Iraqi strategy have failed to meet their own measure of success. And the American people have been asked to pay for this failure. 
   Two years ago, we were spending $5 billion a month in Iraq. It is now reported that we're up to $10 billion a month in resources, not counting the amount of lives we lose on a monthly basis. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've waited long enough. The President's strategy of more troops, more time, more money and more of the same has run its course. It's time for a new direction.

   In Illinois, tuition last year went up, increases of 14.5 percent, the fourth largest increase of any State in America. Today when a kid graduates from college, they graduate with an average of $15,000 of debt. So on the front page they get a diploma, and on the back side, they get their first credit card bill. That is the wrong choice for America. 
   You could not write the American decade if you didn't look at the GI bill and making a high school education universal in America. Those are the two most significant economic acts of the last 100 years. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle noted two examples. One, they are worried about the deficit. After $4 trillion of new debt, I appreciate your conversion to concern about increasing the deficit, but there is no deficit spending here. 
   Second, and most importantly, they talk about the importance of the Pell Grants. This is after, in fact, the President's budget cut Pell Grants one year $1 billion, and froze it for the last 3 years. We are doing the right investment. Not one of us would be in this institution if it wasn't for two things: the love of our parents and the access to a higher education. We are providing Americans something different from the last 6 years. Rather than slamming the door shut on their access to a college education, we are opening the doors and making the American Dream possible. I compliment our leadership for bringing this bill and opening the doors of America's future with a good college education bill.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report for H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act. Since 1965, Head Start has provided 22 million American children with the education and health and social services to lead productive lives. It is the most successful school readiness program in the Nation and has always enjoyed bipartisan support. 
   Today, we are continuing this tradition by passing strong bipartisan legislation to reauthorize this vital program. In fact, this legislation marks the first time in almost a decade that Congress has reauthorized Head Start. 
   The Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act will invest in America's future by providing children and their teachers with the resources they need to take advantage of the opportunities that the Head Start program has offered America's youth for over 40 years. 
   In addition to providing additional resources for increasing teachers' salaries and State Advisory Councils, this reauthorization will expand the reach of both Head Start and Early Head Start by providing greater funding and flexibility. The increases in funding will enable tens of thousands more children to have access to the program. H.R. 1429 will also improve Head Start by providing the Secretary of Health and Human Services and local teams  with tools to hold teachers and programs accountable and requires the implementation of best practices for family service workers. Head Start has served America's children well since 1965, and this legislation will expand the reach and ability of this program to positively impact lives across the country. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller for his dedication to Head Start and to education in general. Head Start is an investment in America's future. Thanks to Head Start, we can give our children the best start possible so they can lead productive lives and grow up to be outstanding citizens. I am proud to support these efforts to continue the legacy of Head Start, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1429.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, the issue of mental health parity doesn't always grab the biggest headlines, but the hard work that Democrats and Republicans have done to pass this landmark legislation will not go unnoticed. 
   For too long, millions of Americans with treatable mental illnesses have gone without care. Some in the business community and the insurance industry said mental health parity simply costs too much, declined to provide that type of coverage, and patients and their workers and their families suffered. 
   As those that know, when one individual in the family has an illness, a mental illness, the whole family is affected. That wrong ends today with this legislation. It ends because Democrats and Republicans, under the leadership of Patrick Kennedy, Ted Kennedy and Jim Ramstad, came together to back this landmark legislation, and never gave up. 
   It ends because even once-skeptical insurance companies and the business community across the country, know that mental health parity is cost effective, and helps ensure that American workers and their families remain healthy and productive. And it is a tremendous victory for the millions of Americans who will finally have access to this type of care. 
   This issue might not always be on the front page of the newspaper, but millions of Americans will finally get care they need and they will remember the work of those of us who do this. 
   I'd also like to add a note that while I was campaigning for Congress, I wrote an op-ed on this issue because I had worked in a White House that through executive order, President Clinton signed, as you remember, legislation, Jim, that insured that Federal workers had this and set a model for Federal employees. Not one op-ed I had got more comment from people at the subway stops, at the grocery stores, people who wanted to usually talk about something else until you began that discussion, never really began this discussion, but it touched people of all walks of life, whether it was at the grocery store, on the way to work or on their front doorstep. They told you about what was going on in their family. 
   Again, it's not the biggest headline; it's not the greatest. It's an important piece of legislation to give people peace of mind that they don't have to hide given the illnesses of depression and other types of substance abuse that they are facing, they now have an insurance policy that allows them and, again I want to say, their family to get protection, because one sick member of a family, with this type of illness, the entire family is affected.

They will finally know that their sick child who is facing depression can get that care and it doesn't affect the whole family. And they know they got the type of care and they don't have to face a financial decision and being a good parent decision. 
   We're doing something that allows people to go on with their lives. I want to thank Jim and Patrick and Ted Kennedy for never giving in. When all of us wanted to say, you know, it's just not the right time, it's too hard, the insurance industry doesn't like it. You never gave in. You never gave up.

   As a member of the 110th Congress, I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3195, the ADA Amendments Act and to continue the fight to ensure equal rights for all disabled citizens. This vital legislation amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to restore the original intent of the ADA by clarifying that anyone with impairment, regardless of his or her successful use of treatments to manage the impairment, has the right to seek reasonable accommodation in their place of work. 
   The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 amends the definition of disability so that those who were originally intended to be protected from discrimination are covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act. This prevents courts from considering the use of treatment, or other accommodations, when deciding whether an individual qualifies for protection under the ADA and focuses on whether individuals can demonstrate that they were treated less favorably on the basis of disability. 
   I am proud of the continuing work that is being done for Americans with Disabilities and of the strong support that Chicagoans have shown for this issue. On July 26, the eighteenth anniversary of its passage, the Americans with Disabilities Act is being commemorated by Chicago's fifth annual Disability Pride Parade. This display of support demonstrates that Chicagoans recognize that passage of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, will allow Americans with disabilities to enjoy the freedom and equality that they are guaranteed by the Constitution.

   This is not a Democratic issue. This is not a Republican issue. This is an issue that all Americans overwhelmingly support. We owe it to them to stand up and support this research that is groundbreaking in the area of health. 
   As I listen to the debate, I hear the moral objections of those who oppose, and I acknowledge them. And at the same time, for those who support this, I hear their moral, which I view, come from this from both a public health position as well as a moral position about the responsibility where you can find cures, to lead that way. And I don't see a way of resolving the divide of two moral positions held firmly in conviction. 
   Sometimes I think of this, half in jest, that the only way to get around this issue is that those who have moral objections to this, that when we find the cures going forward on stem cells, you waive your right to the cure to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes. I say that not seriously. 
   But the only way to get past this is in some way allow the research to go, and those that don't agree with it, whatever cures emanate from it, they would waive their right to it. And I don't say that in any seriousness, but I do not see how you resolve those two morally held beliefs on conviction. 
   I would hope those who object and do it in good conscience understand why those of us who support this, which is why 10 States around the country have approved it, let alone other countries, all the possibility that emerges here to be unlocked to deal with major diseases that not only affect the individual but those families; the potential on Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes, and all the other type of money that goes to deal with those at one level, here we can come up finally with a cure. And we know one of the things that is affecting our research is the fact that we do not deal with cures, but only with managing the ailments. 
   I am pleased that we have this opportunity to vote on this today.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RELATING TO THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and colleagues for this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, my father is from Israel, and every summer I spent a good portion of my childhood in Israel, 2 days after the 1967 war, every summer for 5 years, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1973, every summer going to Israel. I remember that moment, since the bulk of my childhood was spent there. 
   The Six Day War was obviously not only an amazing military accomplishment, a lot of people think today in retrospect that it is a pyrrhic victory, that things would have been so much easier for Israel had that victory not occurred; that David became Goliath. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of myths that I would like to address to the chairman, and also to the leader on the Republican side. 
   One is it was not such a peaceful time pre the 1967 war. There were a lot of attacks on Israel because of indefensible boundaries. In fact, the peace with Jordan and Egypt could not have happened if it weren't for the 1967 war. There was no possibility, given the pan-Arabism that existed under Nasser, for any peace to have happened. 
   In fact, one has to look at the 1967 war, that it created possibilities, as did the 1973 war, for peace to occur, and every nation that has decided to make peace with Israel, Egypt and Jordan, has had peace. 
   The war in 1967, because of the changes to the boundaries to the south, to the immediate east and to the north, redefined Israel's security. Once those nations came to terms with Israel's status, which is what the 1967 war accomplished, they accomplished and received peace, and land-for-peace has been at the premise of America's foreign policy, Israel's foreign policy, and was possible because of the outcome and the results strategically on the ground and in the environment because of 1967. 
   People remember the military accomplishment which was unique and stands out in the 20th century, but it also created an environment that allowed peace to happen, at least with the two countries that have chosen the road of peace with Israel. 
   I would like to pick up on my colleague from California and her comments about the next 40 years. The next 40 years needs to be a period of time where America, and this may be a little bit of a criticism here, we were always and always will be the indispensable leader in that region. The moment we walk away from that role the parties lose interest in discussing among themselves. 
   I would hope that immediately the President would again, and I echo what my colleague from California said, nominate somebody to be a Middle East envoy, to again create a dialogue between the Israelis and Palestinians, to find what the Jordanians and Egyptians have found with the Israelis, peace, based on the premise of land for peace. 
   But everybody should not only look at the military peace of the 1967 war, but it created an opportunity that today two countries that prior to that had fought in the 1967 war against Israel now recognize Israel and have economic, cultural and other types of trade, and that is only due to what happened in 1967. 
   To those who think 1967 was a pyrrhic victory, wasted, we wouldn't have in fact the Israeli-Jordanian agreement  or the Israeli-Egyptian agreement if it weren't for the victories that happened there. There were also other things that happened to Israel. 
   One does hope though that as we look forward to trying to find resolution and look at the region as a whole, everybody has always described that Israel and the Arab conflict was at the heart of the Mideast. That is not at the heart. It is a problem. It needs to be resolved. 
   But the larger problem of the greater Gulf area is not one of the Israeli-Palestinian problem, although it is a significant problem; it is the radical philosophy that is dominating the young in the Arab world that we need to help resolve, because it is leading and feeding part of the terrorism, and that is the larger conflict. The Palestinian-Israeli problem is a problem, but it is not at the heart of the conflict in that region. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment our two leaders today, the chairman and the leader on the Republican side, for this resolution, for recognizing an historic moment that in fact without which we would not see the peace between Israel and Jordan and Israel and Egypt.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, once again, the world has seen another outbreak of Palestinian violence in the Gaza Strip. At least 14 people were killed and 70 were wounded the other day in Gaza City, bringing the total to at least 63 people having been killed. 
   Fatah and Hamas are tearing the Palestinian area of the Gaza Strip apart in what they call a political rivalry, and the Palestinian people are paying a price for Palestinian violence. Governments from around the world and the Arab world have said nothing about this violence, while Palestinians kill each other. 
   I just want you to think for a second, if this was a result of Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, would the international silence and the silence of the Arab world be this deafening? Does anyone really believe that if this level of violence existed between Israel and Palestinians that the U.N. would not be called into an emergency session to condemn Israel for the violence? 
   Those same countries that normally attack Israel, I would hope you now find your moral voice and your moral conscience with the attack and senseless violence that is leaving the Palestinian people so hopeless.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (TIME FOR NEW DIRECTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, during the President's weekly radio address, he accused the Democrats of spending 68 days pushing legislation that would undercut our troops. 
   During his tour of the Middle East yesterday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, ``The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is limited.'' He goes on to say, it has a positive impact ``communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment.'' 
   So who's right? Either the Secretary of the Defense, who is calling for the Iraqis to take ownership of their country, or the President, who is playing politics here at home? The Congress has provided the President the one thing he has refused to develop after 4 years of war: a policy to get the Iraqis off the sidelines and onto the field. 
   So after years of chaos and bloodshed, when the administration asks for more troops and more time and more of the same, we are calling for accountability of the Iraqis and a responsible redeployment of U.S. troops. Our troops are bearing all of the responsibility for the President's policy, and the Iraqis have no accountability. 
   Secretary Gates, thank you for your honest assessment of what it takes to bring a new direction to Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I offer a simple amendment that bars the executive branch from being used to fund the office that does not exist in the executive branch, the Office of the Vice President. 
   Last week, we all received a tutorial in U.S. Government history from the Vice President's office. Apparently his office is not an entity within the executive branch. 
   There have been 46 Vice Presidents in U.S. history, and not one of them knew this or ever claimed this position. Perhaps the Vice President thought he occupied an undisclosed fourth branch of government. 
   His claim flies in the face of the Constitution and was offered in an attempt to avoid following the rules governing the treatment of classified information and documents. This claim was particularly ironic this week, given the four-part series the Washington Post ran about the Vice President's role in this administration. And rather than claim that he wasn't part of the executive branch, it sounds like, from reading those stories, he is the executive branch. 
   Yesterday, the Vice President was forced to admit what even an eighth grade student knew, there is no ``Cheney branch'' of government. 
   While the Vice President's excuses may change, his desire to ignore the rule remains just as strong as ever. The Vice President is unwilling to risk that the documents detailing the flawed intelligence and faulty assumptions that led us into the war in Iraq. He has been held unaccountable for 6 years, and now he wants to be unaccountable in the historical record. 
   Whatever his reasons, this penchant for secrecy is not new. Shortly taking office, the Vice President, in meeting with oil and gas executives and not wanting to turn over that information, claimed he was part of the executive branch. 
   After the Vice President excluded himself from the executive branch, my amendment follows up on the Vice President's assertion and restricts the executive branch funding for the Vice President's office. It leaves intact his Senate presidency office. It delivers two messages. If the Vice President is not in the executive branch, then there is no executive branch office to fund. And perhaps more importantly, it underscores that the Vice President is not above the law and cannot ignore the rules. The law should follow him, whatever branch of government he chooses to hang his hat in. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have a duty to ensure that no individual in our government, no matter how powerful, is allowed to ignore the rules. And when the Vice President is avoiding accountability, it is the Congress' responsibility to demand that accountability. 
   The Vice President must know that no matter what branch of government he may consider himself part of on any given day or week, he is not above the law. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, I want to make two closing points really quickly to my colleague from Ohio, if I can: one is I don't come to this amendment lightly. The Vice President's unprecedented act of declaring that he was not in the executive branch is the reason I submitted this. 
   To the second point, you had said, we may have a Vice President. Having worked in the executive branch, Vice President Cheney is the Vice President of all of us. He is not yours. He is all of ours. That is why all of us were outraged by the position that he took that he was not part of the executive branch so he can avoid accountability. He is the Vice President of all of us. We ask him to abide by the law, to understand that when there is a rule in place that he is accountable and responsible to that, both for the historical purposes and when it relates to national security matters. That is why all of us were outraged when he made the decision to keep his meetings with oil executives secret. 
   At every step of the way, he has chosen secrecy over sunshine; obstruction over accountability. We would ask seriously that the Vice President operate with that seriousness. 
   We didn't come to this lightly. He took an unprecedented step. It is not one we would have done gingerly, messing with his office. But I want to remind everyone here, the reason we are speaking up is because he is our Vice President. We would like him to act accordingly, in the office that he has and the responsibilities that come with the office.

   Second, you do believe if he is in the Vice President's office, he should observe all the laws and regulations that come with that as it relates to the responsibility of that office.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, in 2002 when I ran for Congress, I met Dolores Sweeney. She works full time in an insurance company, but for years she and her three children did not have health insurance until SCHIP. Her children are enrolled in the health care program. 
   She did right by her family. She worked full-time, had three children. She's trying to be both a good worker and a good parent, and SCHIP allowed her to do both of those and do them well. 
   I just talked to her the other day. She has a 19-year-old now and a 14-year-old and a 12-year-old. This bill did right by her because her children are three success stories out of the 6 million who did right. 
   So we stare at the 11 million children and ask, whose parents work full-time, that are too wealthy for Medicaid, yet cannot afford private insurance, are we just going to throw up our hands to them? Dolores Sweeney and the other parents, they will get the same health insurance that we ourselves will get and our children get. And the question before us will be, are we better than these 11 million children? 
   You know, DICK CHENEY gets a checkup every other day. Don't America's kids deserve a visit to the doctor, I ask you. 
   And also I just want to say something to my colleagues who now say they're for SCHIP. I was there when President Clinton proposed it. Speaker Gingrich was against it. You were against it before you became for it. I appreciate your conversion, but you originally were opposed to it. 
   When President Clinton said that, you said you opposed it. Then you said only pediatric care. Then you agreed to pediatric care, and then eye and dental visits which is what President Clinton proposed, and I do appreciate that you're for it.

   You said then it was an entitlement program. Now you have Governors, Senators of both parties, who are for this. The American Medical Association is for this. Pediatric care is for this. AARP is for this.

   Today, her three children are enrolled in SCHIP. Those kids, today, have health care because we did right, where, between private sector not providing health care and Medicaid, a woman who worked full time did right by her children, got healthcare for her kids, and her 19-year-old today is going to college and doing the right choices. 
   The question we have before us, as my colleague from South Carolina just asked, are we going to provide our constituents with the healthcare that our own children and Members of Congress get, that taxpayers pay for? That is the question that is going to be before us today: Are we going to do right by the Dolores Sweeneys of the world in the same way that our constituents do right by us, as Members of Congress, and for our own children? These are people who have worked full time, at no fault of their own, whose children don't have health care. And we will provide those children, 11 million children, the health care that their parents cannot provide.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague from South Carolina for his leadership and, most importantly, his leadership because the Democrats promised in November that we're going to bring a new direction and new priorities to Washington. 
   We've accomplished in 6 months what my colleagues have failed to do in 6 years and that is produce a budget that produces a surplus. 
   Let me say what a surplus is since you've had such a recognition of not being able to produce one. Surpluses are the fact when the government puts its fiscal house in order and matches up its needs with the American people and produces a surplus, because your financial legacy is $4 trillion of new debt. 
   When it comes to economic policy, the one thing that can be said about the Republicans' fiscal mess is that we will forever be in your debt. That is the one thing that's for sure. $4 trillion in 6-years, the largest increase in the Nation's debt in the shortest period of time is your legacy, and I don't think you've quite gotten the recognition for what you've done to America, left it nothing but red ink. 
   This budget is not only in balance, but it's in balance with our values, our values that ensures that 8 million children who do not have health care but parents work full-time, they will get health care; in balance with our values to make sure that we're not subsidizing the financial industry by making sure that middle class parents have the financial resources to send their kids to college; making sure that when it comes to our veterans that in fact we are rewarding our veterans who have fought for this country and say the proper recognition for their service to America, that they get taken care of. And every step of the way, this budget is not only in balance fiscally but is in balance with our values. 
   The entire legacy in 6 years of the Republican stewardship was one of $400 trillion of debt left for the Americans to clean up that mess, and we have produced in 6 months a budget that's balanced, and at the end of the process also creates a surplus. 
   There are different and stark choices. President Kennedy once said, To govern is to choose. We've made the choices to make sure that middle class families get a tax cut, kids get health care, veterans get the respect and the resources that they need to move on with their life, and our families who know that an education and a college education in an era like this where you earn what you learn, that a middle class family does not need a second mortgage or a third job to send their kids to college. 
   I commend my colleagues for this new direction budget, a budget that is in balance and is also in balance with our values.

You could not. And as we talk, all our colleagues always say, as we battle on the issues on the war in Iraq, Islamic fascism, the whole world will watch what we say here in Congress. 
   People will watch this vote and understand, most importantly, whether America remains true to its principles on freedom or not. People will watch this vote. And I would hope my colleagues will remember, as we do this today, that every time America widens the circle of democracy to protect more of its citizens who sit in the shadows, it is true to its principles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, you know, last year, I watched the worst budget failure since the 1995 government shutdown led by the Republican Congress. You only passed two appropriations bills, you got no budget resolution passed to get your work done, and then you are sitting here complaining after we are trying to clean up the mess you left behind. 
   We have a phrase for that in Chicago. It is called chutzpah. You cannot do that. You cannot sit here and come to the floor and complain about what has happened here. Because you handed off nothing but lemons and we are trying to make lemonade out of the lemons that you handed off here. 
   I compliment us for doing exactly what we said we were going to do. There are no earmarks, there is no pay rise, and there are no gimmicks. It is a new day in Washington from the failures of what happened in the past, and we are very clear that this will be a new day from the type of politics that ran here, and there will be none of that until we pass an increase in the minimum wage. We have done right by what we said. 
   I compliment, as the Republican speaker beforehand, my colleague, said, from Florida, this is a budget that veterans can be proud of, the education of our children, our health care needs and our law enforcement needs, that directly help people. While college costs have gone up close to 35 percent since 2003, we have held Pell Grants frozen. They are now going up $260. 5.3 million more students will get the assistance they need. 
   Increases for veterans, $3.6 billion to provide health care for 325,000 veterans. 
   In the area of the National Institutes of Health Care, 500 research projects will be funded that would not have been funded. This is direct help to the American people.     
   And in the law enforcement area, 31,000 positions, including 12,000 FBI agents and 2,500 intelligence analysts will be verified, doubling the number of intelligence analysts since 9/11 at the FBI. This is exactly the type of investments we need to do. So from top to bottom, investing in the education, health care, research and law enforcement areas that have been sorrily missed in past budgets, this continuing resolution makes the investments and turns around what were the dire consequences in those areas. 
   And in addition to that, it makes clear that this is a new day in Washington. We will have no earmarks, no pay raise and no gimmicks. And we are actually turning the page over so we can go forward with the type of budget and the type of appropriations that will continue to put our fiscal house in order, invest in the education and health care and energy and environmental security of this country. This turns the page on a past that was broken and that was failed. And I am proud that we have done that. And I am sure there will be some colleagues, like in the past, that will point to things. But we are pointing in a new direction and turning the page on a broken and failed past and towards a future that, in fact, puts America's priorities and its fiscal house in order.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, when I was growing up near Lake Michigan in Chicago, we used to have dead fish on top of the water for the first 30 feet. You had to run through the sand, past all of the dead fish, jump in the water, hold your breath, and go about 30 feet past the dead fish. Then Congress at that time passed the Clean Water Act. After 30-plus years, there is no doubt when you look at all of the Great Lakes, like Lake Michigan in Chicago, the Clean Water Act has been a tremendous success in the Great Lakes region. Kids today swim all across the different lakes because of what this Congress and a President had done in the past. 
   This act is important. It has been stated here on the floor, over 30 million Americans get their daily drinking water from Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Superior, and Lake Huron. It is the largest body of fresh water in North America and represents a quarter of the world's fresh water. The water here for the future of America will be like the energy debates we are having today, and the Great Lakes and all of the States that border them are the equivalent of our Yellowstone Park, our Grand Canyon. This is our national treasure and we have treated it over the years sometimes like a pond that can just be dumped in. 
   This act is a small step, but the right step. It is a bipartisan step to protect for a little over 30 million Americans their daily drinking water, to give the States and cities that border this area water and a sense of investment in their future. 
   Brookings Institute last year did a study. They showed that for every dollar we invest, we get $2 back of economic activity here in the Great Lakes. 
   This is the right thing to do. But we need to do the next step, the biggest step, build on the Clean Water Act of 30-plus years ago with a great American waterway.

   For 41 days for the cost of the war, 10 million American children would get their health care. For 1 month for the cost of the war, 7 1/2 million American children would get their health care. And for 1 week for the cost of this war, 2 1/2 million would get their health care. 
   The President is asking for an open-ended, open-wallet commitment to Iraq, and the American children get an empty stocking. 
   Meanwhile, under the President's own plan, 1 million American children would lose their health care, according to the experts. Nearly 1 million children would create a very long line in America's emergency rooms. The emergency rooms are President Bush's answer to America's health care crisis. 
   Seventy-two percent of Americans support our reauthorization of the children's health care bill. The President and 15 Republicans stand in the way of 10 million children receiving the health care that we receive here as Members of Congress. 
   There have been three vetoes in President Bush's term: one to end the war, one to permit stem cell research, and now one to allow 10 million children to get their health care. That says it all about President Bush.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, President Kennedy once said, To govern is to choose. $700 billion for the war in Iraq but no health care for America's children. $50 billion in subsidies for big oil companies, but no to health care for America's children. $8 billion in no-bid contracts and lost in waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq, but no to America's children. Billions of dollars for schools and roads and clinics in Iraq, but no to health care for America's children. 
   Today, the President told millions of children and their families that they're on the bottom of his priority list. 
   Now, I used to work in the White House. I know it can be quite isolating. I just never knew it was this isolating. When 45 Republican House Members, 18 Republican Senate Members, Governors who are Republicans, Democrats come together, build this type of consensus, it's time for the President to see what the American people see, that this is the right health care. 
   You have the same health care for you and your families that we are trying to provide for these 10 million children whose parents work full-time. 
   Delores Sweeney in my district works in an insurance company, has three children, and she's trying to get the health care for her children that she cannot get in the private insurance place. 
   This is right for Delores Sweeney. It's right for your kids. Let's make it right for America. Vote ``yes.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, in 1993, when professional baseball owners were deciding how to rehabilitate the reputation of baseball after the players' strike, they debated whether to enact a wild-card rule to allow the second place team into the playoffs. Only one owner at the time voted against this, Texas Rangers general partner, George Bush.  
   When the rule passed 27-1, at the time the President said, ``I made my arguments and went down in flames. History will prove me right.'' 
   Since then, nearly a third of the World Series Champions have been wild-card teams, including the 2004 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox. The rule helped save baseball, as history has shown. 
   And just like his baseball predictions, President Bush sings a very similar tune about Iraq. He says, as recently as yesterday, ``History will prove whether I'm right, and I think I'll be right.'' 
   Really? Five years today since his speech on ``Mission Accomplished.'' And let's take stock. More than 4,000 lives have been lost, tens of thousands of American men and women have been injured, we've spent over 475 billion taxpayer dollars in Iraq, with the price tag continually going up. 
   History will judge whether, once again, George Bush's record and America's reputation will go down in flames. At this rate, he's 0 for 2.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, the American people are being asked to pay twice, once at the pump, and once on tax day, in supporting big oil companies. There are record prices at the pump, and now we have record taxpayer subsidies for the big oil companies. As my mother used to say, Such a deal. 
   ExxonMobil reported earning $40 billion in 2007, the largest corporate profit in American history. At the same time, oil prices topped $100 a barrel for the first time in history, and the New York Times reported this morning that by spring a gallon of gas could cost $4 per gallon. Now I don't think there's anything wrong with record profits. That's not unseemly, in my view. What's unseemly is if the Congress continues to give companies that are making record profits $14 billion in taxpayer subsidies. That is what's unseemly. Not the profits. They make whatever they need to make. I just want to know when the free market principles are going to take over here. At what point do the oil companies, without taxpayer subsidies, go out and enjoy the benefits of a free market? At what point do we stop treating taxpayers as dumb money? That's what I don't understand. I got it when oil was at $15 or $25, energy companies needed help. At $100 a barrel? You've got to enjoy the free market at some point here. 
   Now here is the problem: We have wedded the country and the taxpayers to a 20th-century energy source rather than investing in 21st-century sources, whether that's wind, solar or thermal. We've got to stop asking the taxpayers to subsidize the past and start asking them to invest in the future. That's exactly what the chairman's legislation does. And it's time that we start to do that. 
   This would be a hat trick for the United States. Usually there's just winners and losers. If we did this and got this to the President's desk and he had the courage to finally give up on his addiction to Big Oil, we would actually have something that's good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for our foreign policy and our security interests. That is what we're trying to do with this legislation. It is a total hat trick. 
   Like what we did with the student loans, we stopped subsidizing the big banks and started helping middle-class families. Like we suggested on health care with the HMOs, stop subsidizing the HMOs and start helping the consumers. This legislation begins to end the taxpayer subsidies to Big Oil, and invests in our future by making sure we have energy independence with wind, solar and thermal.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, when the House tried to reauthorize the children's health care bill, the President of the United States called SCHIP ``a welfare benefit'' for ``middle-class households.'' 
   Maybe there is some confusion at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Our bill provides health care for 10 million children whose parents work every day but can't afford to buy health care. They earn a paycheck, not a welfare check. They are parents like Dolores Sweeney. 
   Dolores lives in my district. She works for an insurance company that doesn't provide health care. She has three children, and they would like to buy private health care for their children but can't afford it. Her children were on SCHIP, and without the SCHIP program, they would have gone without health care. 
   Our bill does right by the Sweeney children and 10 million other children from working families. But the President says it's too expensive and calls it welfare for the middle class. At the same time, the President is eager to spend $680 billion in Iraq. We have spent $400 billion in 4 years in the war in Iraq, and for 40 days for the cost of the war, 10 million children in America will get health care for a year. 
   So the President can call the children's health insurance ``excessive spending'' and he can call SCHIP ``welfare,'' but for Dolores Sweeney, it is peace of mind.

   Mr. EMANUEL. When I was campaigning, I met a firefighter, Pat Kehoe, who told me about the night before he and his wife were trying to fill out the form for their only child to go to college. He talked about it was 108 questions, how complicated it was. 
   So I went and personally checked it. Go to page 8 and complete the columns on the left of worksheets A, B, and C. Enter the student, and spouse, totals in questions 44, 45, and 46 respectively. 
   Worksheet B, first of 12 items: Payments to tax-deferred pension and savings plans, including, but not limited to, amounts reported on the W-2 form in boxes 12a through 12d, codes D, E, F, G, H, and S. 
   If you can fill this out, forget college; go to graduate school. This is the most complicated form out there, for kids just trying to go to college. 
   This new legislation is going to take that 108 questions, those eight pages, take it down to two pages, 44 questions, and take it from bureaucratize language down to consumer-friendly language. 
   It's high time that parents who were trying to make sure that their kids had a shot at the American Dream don't have the government stepping in the way and preventing that. 
   I want to thank the chairman.

   And I thank the chairman for his work, as well as the ranking member, for making sure that families across America who are trying to send their kids to college no longer have to jump through hoops every year filling out a form that was more friendly to the bureaucracy than it was to their family and their children.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (``SMOKING MEMO'' -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, in a memo sent to the White House, the Justice Department laid out a plan to replace seven U.S. Attorneys who were cracking down on public corruption. This ``smoking memo'' seems to confirm that this administration targeted U.S. Attorneys involved in ongoing public corruption cases. 
   Today, as we learn more about the Attorney General's failure of leadership, many are eager to debate the future of Attorney General Gonzales and whether he will remain in office. But as we examine how these U.S. Attorneys were fired, we must not lose sight of the real story. What is happening to these ongoing public corruption investigations, from southern California to Nevada to Arizona to New Mexico? 
   The fired U.S. Attorneys were aggressively investigating public corruption cases and they were fired ostensibly for job performance, which in this White House means you're guilty of doing your job. I don't suppose any of these U.S. Attorneys will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom award. 
   The question some of us want to know is where are these public corruption cases today? As Washington debates whether Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General, survives by the weekend, some of us want to know whether we can bring back to life these public corruption investigations in these five jurisdictions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, the President and the Republican leadership in Congress never miss an opportunity to not miss an opportunity. There was a bipartisan consensus for 10 million children to have health care, and because the President didn't agree with it, he vetoed it. 
   Now, some people here say that we could have this vote now. We can have this vote in January. 
   The truth is the real vote will be in November of 2008. Some of us disagreed with the President of the United States on stem cell research. There was an election, and now we have a new Senator from Missouri, we have a new Congressman from Arizona, all because of that issue. 
   And the real vote, and people don't want to talk about it, say it's political, that's what a democracy is about. And there will be a vote about this, and the American people will vote on this. And those Members of Congress that are happy about denying 10 million children health care will get a chance and an opportunity to explain that vote. Those of us who think it's important will get that. 
   My own view, I wouldn't want to mix politics with policy, if there's going to be a few less Members who vote against 10 million children because the American people will make a judgment about that. And we shouldn't deny that. 
   And so I give you credit. You never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. So, remember, some have talked about for 40 days in Iraq you could fund 10 million children's health care. Forty days in Iraq. 
   President Kennedy once said, ``To govern is to choose.'' Well, you've made your choice. We've made our choice. And the American people in November are going to make their choice.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Okay. I come from a family. I believe politics is a good thing, because we have differences, and you work them out on election day and the American people make a decision, except for when you do special redistricting. But usually you let it out on election day. And I believe in that. I don't have a problem with that. 
   It's not about scoring points. There's differences. You don't support this. And I won't go through this. I was in the room when we negotiated this in 1997. When President Clinton proposed this, the Republican leadership at the time, and he said there will be no balanced budget without a children's health insurance program that had eye, dental and pediatric. The Republican leadership said at that point it was welfare. President Clinton said there will be no balanced budget agreement without this. Finally, you guys offered pediatric care but no eye and dental. And then the deal we cut was the SCHIP we have today. And the very flexibility that you oppose that our Governors are exploring was what you demanded back in 1997. But the original children health proposal wasn't a bipartisan agreement. It was President Clinton saying there will be no balanced budget agreement without 6 million children getting their health care. I believe that politics is a good thing, and that's what it proved.

   Mr. EMANUEL. First of all, it wasn't part of welfare reform. Welfare reform had a 1-year transitional for Medicaid. It wasn't part of that, which is a point you made. 
   Second is, SCHIP was so successful, while the rest of the population actually had an increase in uninsured, the only group in America for the last 7 years that had actually a decrease in the uninsured was children until last year. This is a product of answering the shortcomings between Medicaid and private insurance.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, to my two former speakers on the Republican side, one who described the Republican stewardship as ``terrible,'' the one thing you can say after 6 years of Republican rule with President Bush is that we will forever be in your debt. 
   You are right. $3.8 trillion in new debt under your stewardship, and so we are always going to be in your debt. And I just can't you thank you enough on behalf of the American people, because the reason you would use the adjective ``terrible'' to describe your record is for the fiscal mess you left. And when you describe $9.8 trillion in debt, don't act like, ``look mom, no hands.'' You had something to do with it, 6 years of your control. 
   This budget is a beginning, because what is a budget? It is a blueprint for the future. And, yes, we will make it. President Kennedy once said, ``to govern is to choose.'' We are making choices here. We are preserving middle class tax cuts and beginning to put our fiscal house in order and investing in education, health care and technology to start to grow the economy back. That works for middle class families. 
   Under your stewardship, middle class household income shrunk by $1,100. Costs for education, health care and energy went up. This is about turning the country around and changing the direction of this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, we gather today to consider a question that is profoundly simple: Do we support the President's plan to further escalate America's involvement in Iraq, or not? After 4 long, painful years in which we have seen so many young lives lost, are we now willing to put even more of our brave heroes in harm's way, or will we acknowledge that the current course is failing, that doubling down on the status quo while hoping for a better result would be foolish. 
   There are those who oppose this resolution because they say it would hurt the troops' morale. Hurt morale? Our leaders promised them they would be greeted as liberators. Instead, we have put them smack in the middle of a shooing gallery, policing someone else's civil war, backing an Iraqi government that refuses to stand up for itself. 
   We have sent our soldiers back time and again. We have sent many of them without the life-saving equipment and armor they needed, and now they say this resolution would hurt troop morale? To suggest that more of the same just won't do. 
   They have done their duty with courage and discipline. Now it is time for Congress to do its duty. They deserve not to be sacrificed in the furtherance of a policy that failed for the last 4 years. 
   From the beginning, this war has been a saga of miscalculations, mistakes and misjudgments for which America will pay in many ways for years to come. Let us not compound those bad judgments by ratifying another. 
   The President assures us that this escalation of war is the most promising path to a more peaceful Iraq. For the  past 5 years we have accepted the President's assurances on Iraq, only to learn that the facts on the ground belied his aggressive assertions and rosy rhetoric. We accepted his assurances about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and Saddam's links to al Qaeda. We authorized a war on that basis, only to learn that much of what we were told simply wasn't true. 
   Against stern warnings, we accepted his assurances and those of the Vice President that a post-Saddam Iraq would welcome our presence and overcome deeply engrained sectarian differences. It simply wasn't true. We accepted their assurances when they told us General Shinseki was mistaken when he said we needed far more troops to stabilize Iraq than the administration planned, and that the cost of this war would be minimal. It simply wasn't true. We accepted their assurances when they told us the insurgency was in its last throes. It simply wasn't true. 
   Each of the last three troop surges has been countered with a surge in violence. It is for that reason that a bipartisan group of House Members and the American public oppose the forth troop increase. More troops doing more of the same is not a policy, it is not a strategy, it is not a tactic, it is the status quo plus. 
   The time is past for accepting this administration's assurances at face value. The human cost of its repeated assurances is too great. 
   Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago I asked permission to establish a temporary memorial to the fallen in Iraq in Statuary Hall. The leadership at that time refused, so I began posting the pictures of the young soldiers we have lost outside my office. I have watched as that grim line of photos has grown past my doorway to fill the corridor. More than 3,000 dead, more than 20,000 wounded. When I walk by those photos, I see the purpose, I see the pride, and I see the promise in their young faces. They were sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers who will never see their kids grow up. 
   I ask you, how long must this grim line of photographs grow before we acknowledge that this policy is not working? How many corridors must these memorials fill before we we say, not on my watch? How many more lives must we lose? How many more hearts must be broken? 
   It is time for this Congress to tell President Bush that his assurances are not enough. This escalation does not mean stability in Iraq, it will mean more loss and more photographs in the corridor. 
   I urge you to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, to pick up on my colleague's comments about fairness, one of the provisions in this legislation deals with closing the loophole for KBR, a former Halliburton subsidiary, that used the Cayman Islands to avoid paying taxes. And that is, it was discovered that in fact KBR, they're a company that was doing its operations in Iraq, was not paying and consciously set up a company in the Cayman Islands, just a post office box, set up a company to avoid paying Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, which is how they became the low bid. 
   It is the company, by the way, I'm sure you remember this, that served contaminated water to our troops, costing the taxpayers more money to take care of the health of those troops. 
   They set up an operation in the Cayman Islands, and in fact, their post office was Post Office Box 847, One Capital Place, 4th Floor, Shedden Road, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, KY1-1103. And the reason they were the low bidder? They didn't pay their fair share. 
   And the truth is the American people care about two things when it comes to American taxes: Simplicity of the code and fairness. And this is an example of the unfairness of our code. 
   In fact, if you look at the Ugland House in the Cayman Islands, one building houses 12,000 companies who have established post office boxes or ZIP codes or modems there, and the only purpose they're there for is to avoid paying their fair share of their taxes. And one of the pieces of this legislation is, in fact, to shut down the operation so companies cannot get contracts doing government work here in the United States, paid for by the taxpayers, whose sole purpose is to avoid paying their fair share. 
   The company acknowledges that the reason they set up the Cayman Islands was so they didn't pay Social Security, they didn't pay unemployment, they didn't pay Medicare.

KBR was a company set up in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of avoiding paying their fair share of taxes, and it is right here on April 15, when Americans are facing bigger tax bills, higher costs for health care, higher costs for education, higher costs for gasoline, that in fact those companies that are servicing in Iraq pay their fair share and not use the tax code to avoid their responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, according to our military leaders, the status quo is not working in Iraq. Major General Batiste said, ``The administration got it terribly wrong and I applaud Congress for stepping up.'' Lieutenant General Odom said our bill ``gives the President a chance to pull back from a disastrous course, reorient U.S. strategy to achieve regional stability, and win help from many other countries, the only way peace will eventually be achieved.'' 
   Our military has done everything the President and the Congress and American people have asked it. The President asked our men and women in uniform to invade a country, and they did. The President asked them to go to war against a nation's army, and they did. The President asked them to seize a capital, and they did. The President asked the men and women in uniform to depose a dictator, and they did. The President asked the men and women in uniform to capture that dictator, and they did. 
   Given all these military achievements by our Armed Forces, why do we have today the worst national security crisis in over a generation? There is not now, nor has there ever been, a political plan that matches the military leadership that we have seen from our Armed Forces. But this administration has offered no real plan for success, and our troops have been asked to back the Iraqi Government that has yet to stand up for itself. The entire plan over the last 4 years offered by the President and the Republican Congress has been more troops, more time, more money, and more of the same, even though we know that the challenges we face today require more than the status quo. The President's policy has come down to the status quo plus. 
   Secretary of Defense Gates had it right: ``Any solution in Iraq is not purely military but also political.'' 
   Our plan holds the Iraqi people accountable for their own nation. It requires the Iraqi people to meet the benchmarks for success, the same benchmarks that the President outlined on January 10 before he turned against his own benchmarks. We will give our troops and commanders the resources and freedom to do their job. But we will do the one thing that a Republican Congress has refused to do over the years: demand accountability from the Iraqis. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and to support this legislation.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk to you for a second about Specialist Sean Walsh. Sean served for two tours of duty in Iraq in the 933rd Military Police Company in the 16th Airborne Brigade of the United States Army. He protected main supply routes. He and his unit were inundated with sniper fire and IEDs. 
   Today, Sean Walsh is a plumber in the City of Chicago. He wants to go to college. Sean cannot afford to go to college. His dream is to become an engineer. 
   This GI Bill, this GI Bill is for Sean Walsh and his unit, so Sean Walsh can do for Sean Walsh what Sean Walsh did for Iraq. He gave them a chance. He gave them a chance to build a better country. That is what we said when we sent Sean there. And now it is time America invests in Sean Walsh. We have spent $50 billion of U.S. taxpayer money rebuilding roads and bridges and streets and schools in Iraq, and this is about $50 billion to rebuild Sean Walsh and his unit. 
   The American people are the most generous people in the world, but they will not continue to be generous if you foreclose their future. I think this is what we owe Sean Walsh, because we asked him to do something, not once, but twice. 
   Sean wants to be an engineer, and I am for Sean being an engineer. I want to make sure Sean can get to college, and this is going to invest in his future. He earned it the old-fashioned way; he gave something for his country. And when America was asked to help rebuild Iraq, we did it. It is time we do that for Sean. 
   In addition, one of the things I am most proud about in this legislation is that from now on, in all the rebuilding of Iraq, the Iraqis must put in 50 percent of the dollars.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, this morning, The Washington Post reports that States across this country are forced to start preparing to cut hundreds of thousands of children off of children's health care because Republicans in this House and President Bush have put children's health care on the bottom of their priority list. Unfortunately, we've seen this movie before. When States faced shortfalls and health care for children was threatened earlier this year, States were forced to take steps that would have denied hundreds of thousands of children health care. And once again, the administration failed to lead, and only Democratic efforts to fund the State children's health care in the supplemental appropriations saved us from that catastrophe. 
   From day one, the administration has adopted a policy of benign neglect when it comes to children's health care. In fact, the President's current plan would cut 1 million children from health care. 
   Now Republicans in this House have a chance to change that policy. On Thursday, Republicans can join Democrats and Republicans and give 10 million children the care that they need for the future. In fact, I always find it amazing that Republicans will give $480 million to the war in Iraq, no questions asked, but when it comes to 10 million kids' health care, they have a lot of questions. 
   The choice is simple, 10 million children in States across the country are counting on the House Republicans to make the right choice for their future.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 725, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. This landmark legislation established the basic structure for our national commitment to restoring and maintaining the environmental integrity of our Nation's waters. 
   When the Cuyahoga River caught fire and Lake Erie was declared ``dead'', Congress finally took action and passed the Clean Water Act, which is now the cornerstone of surface water quality protection in the United States. The statute employs a variety of regulatory and nonregulatory tools to sharply reduce direct pollutant discharges into waterways, finance municipal wastewater treatment facilities, and manage polluted runoff. These tools are employed to achieve the broader goal of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. 
   Even as the population of the United States has increased by close to 50 percent, the Clean Water Act has enabled our waterways to show dramatic improvement in water quality. In 1972, only one-third of the country's waters met water quality goals--today two-thirds do. 
   And for those of us who live in the Great Lakes region, the success of the Clean Water Act is even more personal and poignant. As a kid, my brothers and I used to have to hold our breath to swim past the dead fish in Lake Michigan before we could pop up and play in the cleaner water. Today, my children are able to enjoy a much cleaner Lake Michigan. 
   This success deserves our praise, but at the same time, we must recognize that there is still much work to be done. We have the opportunity to recommit ourselves to the goals and objectives of the Clean Water Act by dedicating ourselves to working toward a sustainable, long-term solution to the Nation's decaying water infrastructure. Recent events involving BP and U.S. Steel looking to expand the pollutants they discharge into Lake Michigan heighten concern for those of us who are committed to protecting and restoring the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes provide drinking water and recreation for over 30 million people, and they are the economic engine that drives the Midwest. The Clean Water Act has helped preserve this national treasure, but we have more work to do to restore it and invest in the environmental and economic health of the Great Lakes region. 
   Mr. Speaker, clean water is not a partisan issue. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fight to clean up our Lakes, and I will continue to do so. The Clean Water Act has been a fundamental tool in the protection of our Nation's environment, and I hope my colleagues will join me in commemorating this important legislation and its accomplishments by supporting H. Res. 725.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. The prior speaker said you can't have a plan for 1 year. What he didn't mention is that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress hadn't had a plan for 7 years, and look where it's gotten us. 
   The fact is a lot of people want to talk about you have to have a balanced approach. That's true. You do have to have some drilling. There are 9,300 permits owned by the oil companies here in the United States for drilling that they do not use. Close to 72 percent. They don't use. They are not drilling. Could alleviate today. They are waiting for the price to increase before they drill. Those permits have been issued. So that is part of a plan. 
   What we are talking about today is seizing future energy sources, be that wind, solar, biomass. In fact, today, the  Wall Street Journal, lead story, the Pentagon knows and it is launching, according to the headline, an alternative fuels strategy. The Pentagon knows that. Corporate America is investing in alternative energy sources. They know that. The American consumer knows you have got to have a different strategy than the one that depends only on oil. The only people that don't know that you need to have a diverse energy policy is the White House and sometimes I believe some of the Republican Members of Congress here. 
   We need an energy policy so it begins to invest in 21st century energy sources, like wind and solar, and stop subsidizing 20th century energy sources, which is only oil. This gives us an agenda, a strategy to look to the future, build new technologies, new industries that will employ hundreds of thousands of people, and invest and give America its energy independence. 
   Second, it does not cost the American taxpayer. This is a paid-for piece of legislation by closing offshore deferrals where a lot of people hide their income in offshore deferrals. In fact, Congressman McCrery and Senator Grassley both acknowledge it is a decent way to pay for something. Whether they agree for this, they do agree it's a legitimate pay-for. 
   Third, there's a lot of talk about middle class and the suffering in the middle class. This legislation provides property tax relief for middle class families. 
   Remember that this is the first step toward energy independence and making sure that we build on the progress we have made, such as CAFE standards for cars.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, this isn't the cure-all for everything, but it is a step in the right direction, and we should take note. 
   It cracks down on fraud in Medicare which is one of the ways we make payments to doctors and seniors. It ensures that we don't overpay health insurance companies for the care you get for less money. It begins us on a process to make sure that we have an e-prescribe system. And most importantly, what this does is preserve the doctor and senior patient relationship. This is the right step to do. 
   Not only are we taking this step in helping Medicare and preserving the relationship between doctors and patients, it builds on the progress we have made by restoring $14 billion to veterans' health care. 
   Also, just the other day we reversed six of the President's rules and regulations as it relates to Medicaid. Unfortunately, we haven't taken that step as it relates to 10 million children and their health care program. 
   But this Congress, from Medicare to Medicaid to our veterans, has begun to take the steps that are necessary, that are important to health care reform, to ensure that people have access to the doctors that they need and the system that we have that once again preserves the relationship between doctors and patients. 
   So on a host of fronts, whether you want to crack down on fraud, whether we want to make sure that we are not overpaying insurance companies, whether we want to make sure we are preserving the relationship between doctors and their patients, this is the right step in the right direction, and I am proud that it is done in a bipartisan fashion, once again putting the American people first.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, picking up on what my colleague from Connecticut said, which is nobody says this is a panacea, but all experience shows, both the Harvard study and the Department of Energy study, shows that about 20 percent, which would be about $25 a barrel drop in price, would occur because of this. 
   There is plenty of blame to go around. Nobody is suggesting this is going to resolve the energy crisis. It is a short-term alleviation of high prices that would, in fact, allow us to take the steps that we have not taken for 20 years. 
   And also in the last 5 or 6 years, when the Vice President derided conservation, you acknowledged on the floor the importance of conservation. It was dismissed as part of our arsenal in our energy policy. When those of us who talked about investing in new alternative energy, wind, solar, thermal, it was also dismissed, and continues to not only be dismissed, but vetoed. That, too, is unilateral disarmament by the United States. 
   So you are right. There is plenty of blame to go around. But there are plenty of solutions to also be picked up. Conservation was denied as a national policy. And we have paid the price as a country. Alternative energy was denied and denied for years and issued veto threats by the President of the United States. And we pay the price because of that policy. 
   This is a short-term solution, $25, which means a lot to Americans, a barrel, but it gives us the breathing space to do what we need to do and take care of America's energy independence. 
   Now no one is going to claim that in 2005 when you all did pass your energy bill, let me quote your minority leader, ``the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a balanced, bipartisan bill that will lower energy prices to consumers and spur our economy.'' Nobody is claiming that. This gives a short-term alleviation to allow us to tackle a problem that has been festering for 25 years and denying what all of us should have done in Washington, invest in long-term, alternative energy and technologies that will give America its leg of independence, as well as adopt an energy policy of conservation, it would also save.

   Mr. EMANUEL. That is the strategy we are talking about. This is the right thing to do. It has been proven that when we have instrumented this tool, that is to stop purchasing from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, that in fact there will be immediate reduction in the prices at the pump and also a barrel of energy. That is the right thing to do. 
   But let there be no mistake. In every step of the way for the last 6 years, the President of the United States has either issued veto threats or leaned on  only one side of the policy, and that policy was dig, dig, dig. In fact, there are 9,300 licenses to drill here in the United States that the energy companies are not using.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 793, the Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. S. 793 is the Senate companion to H.R. 1418, a bill that I cosponsored to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and improve our efforts to combat and treat traumatic brain injury, TBI, at the Federal and State levels. As a member of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, this issue is near and dear to my heart, and I am proud that we are debating this important legislation today. 
   Of troops wounded in Iraq 62 percent have sustained TBI, compared to a rate closer to 20 percent in previous conflicts. Overall in the U.S., there are about 1.5 million civilian cases of traumatic brain injury each year. I have worked hard to make researching and fighting TBI a priority and, in particular, the relationship between TBI and epilepsy. 
   Traumatic brain injury, TBI, causes epilepsy in up to 30 percent of civilians and 50 percent of military head injuries, greatly exacerbating chronic neurological disability. TBI is particularly problematic for soldiers currently serving or recently returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   In 1996, members of Congress passed the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, which amended the Public Health Service Act to increase resources available to research on traumatic brain injury. Today, we have the opportunity to reauthorize and amend this act to include a broader spectrum of traumatic brain injury programs, especially those at the State level. 
   An expansion and improvement of our traumatic brain injury programs will serve those in  this country who suffer from the condition, while providing opportunities for research and development of programs to better prevent and detect traumatic brain injuries. 
   Madam Speaker, traumatic brain injuries affect families across America, and we must continue to invest in programs to prevent, detect, and treat these injuries. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the President submitted his budget to the United States Congress and to the country. And in that budget, the President made clear a number of priorities that I think are in direct opposition to the wishes and aspirations of the American people. 
   Most egregious, in my view, is that the President leaves in place a tax increase on the middle-class families of this country. Today, about three million Americans are affected by the alternative minimum tax, meant to tax only the superwealthy. This year alone, it will reach 23 million middle-class families across the country. And the only way the President accomplishes any of his goals is to leave in place a tax that was never intended by the Congress or the President to affect middle-class families. 
   The Democrats make a pledge to, in fact, deal with the alternative minimum tax this year so middle-class families do not have a tax increase either this year, next year or the following year. It has been consistently. 
   But this is only one of the egregious misplaced priorities in the President's budget. The other highlights, in addition to increasing taxes on the middle class, it cuts health care for seniors $100 billion over 5 years, $300 billion over 10 years. 
   While we are dealing with the temperatures outside that are near freezing in my home area of Chicago, below zero, it cuts home energy assistance to our seniors by 18 percent. 
   It eliminates the COPS program for community policing, which has supported 120,000 police officers throughout the country. 
   It goes forward in the President's desire to privatize Social Security. 
   It cuts health care benefits for our returning veterans, forcing them to pay up to $750 a year to enter the health care for veterans, one of the best health care systems in the country. And I don't think that is a welcome-home mat that our veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan deserve. 
   It also has cuts to education. It underfunds Leave No Child Behind by $15 billion.  
   It cuts housing assistance for affordable housing. Returning again, in relationship to our veterans, it cuts the funding for research into brain trauma research, which is so significant. One of the greatest injuries for our veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan have been the brain injuries that they have incurred there. And the first time ever we have gotten funding inside the Pentagon for that area, it makes a cut. 
   And then it doesn't deal with what we call earmarks here, as the President continues his earmarks in his budget. Across the board, from Social Security privatization to health care cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, to also not cutting children from their health care, to raising taxes on the middle class, in time and place, from health care to taxes to supporting our law enforcement community, this budget makes the wrong priorities. 
   It is time to have a new direction and a change here in the priorities in Washington. In addition to all that, while we have families not being able to get to their homes in the area of Louisiana and Mississippi and the Gulf Coast, the President asked for an additional $245 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. In every turn that we can, we have to right this ship that is wrong. 
   Most importantly, in the area the President's budget has relied on tax increases on middle class families, cuts Medicare and Medicaid, asked for $245 billion in increased funding for Iraq and Afghanistan, cuts children from their health care, cuts heating assistance from our elderly, also cuts benefits for veterans. Those are not the priorities of the American people.     
   Every President in the history of the country in a time of war has thought about how to invest in America. Abraham Lincoln, in the height of the Civil War, had the land-grant colleges. Roosevelt, in the height of the final 2 years of World War II, developed the GI Bill of Rights. During the height of the Cold War, Eisenhower saw the interstate system as a way to invest in America. Kennedy, a man on the moon when we were facing down the Soviet Union. 
   At every critical juncture when America was at war, a President thought about how to invest in America to turn this country's efforts overseas here at home to make this a stronger and better country. 
   This is the first Presidential budget that in time of war, rather than looking for increases here on how to make America stronger, it looks for cuts in America. It looks for the areas of education, health care, veterans, and law enforcement to sacrifice, while we increase our investments in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   If you look at the history of every time there has been a period of America's engagement around the world militarily, every President has looked to invest here at home to make America stronger. This is the first budget that leaves America weaker in a time of military engagement.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California. Two weeks ago, President Bush came to my district to highlight Horace Greeley School. It is a Blue Ribbon School and is recognized for Leave No Child Behind for its accomplishment in teaching children and raising their standards. 
   I went to that event with the President, because as he said, making sure you had qualified teachers in that school was important. I would also like to say that you need qualified nurse technicians. While you want to test kids for math, we believe you also must test them for measles. While you must worry about the principal, we also want to worry about the pediatrician. And you must have a comprehensive approach to those children, from their pediatrician to the principal, from testing for measles to testing for math and from a teacher to a technician. 
   One-third of the children at Horace Greeley, slightly more, are children enrolled in SCHIP. Now, those children do well because we raised their standards. They also do well because they have good health care, and we did right by them. Their parents work. Predominately, 50 percent of the school are Hispanics. The rest is mixed. About a quarter are Caucasian. 
   The President of the United States picked a school in the inner city of Chicago, because of the about 200 schools across the country that are Blue Ribbon Schools, those kids met the standards. Their teachers met the standards. But we did it in a comprehensive fashion. We made sure that they had qualified teachers. We are making sure that they have qualified technicians. We made sure they have a qualified principal. They also must have a qualified pediatrician. And that is what made those kids and our future brighter. 
   I was proud that the President came to my district and recognized a school  in a tough area doing right by kids. And the question is, will this floor do right by those children? And I am not sure. No, we won't have the votes to override the President's veto. And I told him then, ``You want to reauthorize No Child Left Behind because it raised the standard. We want to also reauthorize the SCHIP program.'' 
   Last November, the American people said they want a change in Washington to set the right priorities, and one of those things was to work together across party lines. We did that here. Unfortunately, one thing didn't change, and that is enough Republicans that want to rubber-stamp policies that I believe are misdirected. Investing in 10 million children for the cost of 41 days in the war in Iraq will give those children more than just a blue ribbon; it will give them a chance at the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleague from California for his leadership on this legislation. We will pass this legislation, and now the President's agreed to sign the most aggressive college student aid package since the GI bill 60 years ago. In an era where you earn what you learn, this bill will ensure that more Americans have access to a college education. 
   Today, the average student graduating from college graduates with $19,000 of debt. So, on graduation day, you get a diploma on one side and you get a $19,000 bill on the other side. This legislation will ensure that more and more Americans have the access to a college education. Not one of us would be here if it wasn't for the fact that we had had access to a college education and the ability to make something of ourselves. 
   This will ensure that middle-class families and their children do not suffer under the burden of the cost of rising costs of a college education. 
   I remember when I was running for office and I met a family in Chicago, Illinois. He was a police officer for 11 years. His wife was a teacher in a parochial school. They had two kids in high school, and they looked at me on their doorstep, and they had to make a decision: a third job among them, a second mortgage on their home, or burdening their children with $19,000 of additional debt. 
   This legislation ensures they are both good parents and their children have access to a great college education. 
   And I again want to compliment the leadership from my colleague Congressman Miller for producing this legislation in such a speedy time.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, the previous days have offered a series of reports on conditions in Iraq. These reports have been consistent: Iraq remains dangerous, unstable, and political progress is virtually nonexistent. 
   It wasn't supposed to be this way. The President's escalation was supposed to give the Iraqi Government and the ethnic groups the room they needed to make political progress. That progress simply has not happened. 
   So now, after 4 1/2 years, billions of dollars, thousands of lives, and countless new slogans, the Bush administration is just giving us the status quo. Instead of a new strategy for Iraq, the Bush administration is cherry-picking the data to support the political objectives and preparing a report that will offer yet another defense of the President's strategy. 
   We don't need a report that wins a Nobel Prize for creative statistics or the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Americans are demanding the facts, an end to this open-ended commitment, a surge on the political and diplomatic front. In short, the American people want a new direction in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Right before our break, we passed and sent to the President comprehensive innovation legislation that allowed America to maintain its lead in the area of technology and investment in the R&D of this country. With this legislation, the patent reform, we are taking the second step in assuring that America, American companies and America's innovation, maintains its leadership in the world and the companies that are producing the jobs and well-paying manufacturing jobs here in this country. 
   I have only a small assortment of letters from the CEO and managements of these companies: Mr. Chambers from Cisco, Safra Catz from Oracle, the president and chief financial officer, the CEOs from Palm and the Micron company, and other companies. 
   Just to read the sense of what they are saying: ``As a company with several thousand patents, Cisco believes deeply in strong protection for intellectual property. Unfortunately, as you found during the hearing process, there are clear signs the current patent system is not functioning properly.'' 
   This is from Mr. Chambers, the chairman and CEO of Cisco: These reforms you are debating today, this legislation will allow us to continue to innovate and help maintain our Nation's position as the world's technology leader. 
   This is essential legislation for American companies, America's innovation, and its ability to produce jobs for the future. Major CEOs from major companies that have maintained and also built America's leadership in the high-tech field all support this legislation, in addition to leaders of every major consumer group. So it is both good for consumers and good for business and good for the companies that are producing the jobs here in this country. 
   I would like to submit into the Record these letters from just an assortment of the companies that support this legislation because of what we are doing to maintain America's leadership in the production of new jobs, new technology, and new companies here in the country, formation of new capital, venture capital funding, et cetera. This, though, is the most important step to ensure that when people invent things and design patents that they have the notion and the integrity that those patents and their ideas are going to be protected. 
   Today we are taking a major step, forward as the CEOs have said in their own letters, in maintaining America's leadership in the production of not only new companies but the most innovative jobs and high-paying jobs that are the future of this country. I want to commend the leadership for producing this legislation and having it on the floor today for a vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. A lot of people have mentioned that in fact this extension will cover the children that presently are in the program. That is half true and half not true. Kids who are on the program will be covered. But if you live in 14 States in the United States, because of the President's executive order, if you live in California, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, or Washington, kids in those States will actually come off the rolls in August because of the President's executive order. And in those States, the Governors will have to begin to develop plans to notify those kids and their parents because of the President's executive order. 
   So not all kids who are on the program will actually stay on the program. And that is just a consequence, after passing two bills to give 10 million children health care, two bills with 45 Republicans and 220 plus Democrats here in the House, and 18 Republicans in the Senate and every Democrat in the Senate, we were unable, which is unique around here, but we were unable to get the President to sign this legislation. And so what we couldn't resolve, the American people will resolve in November. 
   President Kennedy once said, to govern is to choose. We have made our choice, the President and some on your side made your choice, and in November the American people will make their choice. And that is how differences get resolved here. I think we should understand that. 
   And so, as the President has said, a lot of children will have universal health care in this country because we have an emergency room in hospitals. A lot of kids will end up in emergency rooms that didn't need to go to emergency rooms. 
   We did right in a bipartisan fashion to get a bill. In my own view, this will be the first thing that the new Democratic President will get done. We don't need March 9. It will get done within  the first month. It will be a major accomplishment for a Democratic Congress, a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic President.     
   Starting this August in those 14 States, kids and their parents that did have health care will be notified they will no longer get health care. Now, there is a consequence to that, because August 2008 is 2 months before the election. And I don't think that is a problem. As a matter of fact, we can't protect the American people from the consequences of the President's decision, and a number of Republicans stand by him. We did right. There was a bipartisan bill to resolve a major problem to give 10 million children health care. We didn't accomplish it. We will be back and we will get it done because the American people deserve and the kids deserve the same health care that their Members of Congress and their kids get. This is what that would have done.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, in 7 years, the President has been awfully reluctant to use his veto pen. But when it comes to important health care legislation, this President hasn't hesitated to say ``no'' to the American people. 
   Stem cell research, which could cure diseases and save millions of lives, the American people support it. The President vetoed it. 
   Children's health insurance provides health care to children from working middle-class families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but can't afford private insurance. The American people support it. This President vetoed it. 
   In my district, Dolores Sweeney works for an insurance company, has three children, and is trying to get private health care for her children, but cannot get it in the private insurance marketplace. Her employer does not provide health care. Her children are on SCHIP. This bill is right for Dolores Sweeney and the 10 million children that get health care through it. The President vetoed it. 
   Even Republican Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY said about the President and SCHIP, He simply doesn't understand the bill and he is wrong. 
   The only health care legislation this President supported was a prescription  drug bill which gave billions of dollars away to the special interests. It is time for the President to stand with the American people and support our children.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, for years the Republican Congress sat idly by while we spent billions of dollars in Iraq and lost thousands of lives, no questions asked. 
   Now Republicans are starting to get nervous with the lack of results. On Monday, Senator Lugar said President Bush's plan to escalate the war in Iraq has very limited prospects for success and called on President Bush to begin to reduce U.S. forces. It's exactly what Democrats have been saying all along. 
   From day one, the new Democratic Congress said that once we have accountability, benchmarks and reporting requirements, we begin to see the beginning of the end. I can now say that the end is in sight. Instead of rubber stamping a failed Iraq policy, Democrats demanded that Republicans and the country measure the progress or the lack thereof of the President's plan for more troops, more money, more time and more of the same. 
   Starting in July, we will put the administration of the Republicans to the test, a new direction in Iraq, or more of the same of the present course, vote after vote. 
   We said last May that we would begin to see the beginning of the end. Just this week, we begin to see that light at the end of the tunnel on this failed policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, this week, or just today, rather, it was found out, we discovered and it was reported, that the United States is running a $176 billion deficit in February alone. Earlier this week, we also found out that the Iraqis have a surplus of over $50 billion. 
   We also know that the American taxpayers have paid for 20 Iraqi hospitals to be refurbished and 80 health clinics to have been built and 60 more planned. And the Republican budget, in the area of health care, cuts $370 billion from Medicare and Medicaid. 
   The Iraqis, due to the American taxpayers, will get 6,700 schools rehabbed. The Republican budget eliminates the Pell Grant increases that Congress proposed this year. 
   We're also increasing our funding and training of the Iraqi teachers. The Republicans plan to reduce the military retirement and health care benefits by $1.3 billion. And while Iraq is running a surplus and not spending their resources on improving their country, the entire deficit over the entire period of time that the Republican budget has is a little over $700 billion. 
   President Kennedy once said, ``To govern is to choose,'' and my friends on the other side have made some choices. While the Iraqis run a surplus, they've made sure that America runs a deficit. While Iraq and American taxpayers are asked to make sure that we rebuild schools and hospitals in Iraq, here in the United States their budget cuts those very investments. 
   In fact, the Democratic budget turns this ship around of inheriting $3.8 trillion in new debt that has accumulated over the last 6 years and ensures that we invest in American schools, in American hospitals, in American health clinics, and in American teachers. And it ensures, also, that we have a middle class tax cut. So, it makes sure that, while we are doing what we are supposed to do in Iraq, we don't do  it at the expense of what we need to do here at home. We have invested in Iraq, and our budget ensures that we invest in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, a number of folks have mentioned on the other side, brought up stories about talking about the Speaker and what Democrats claim. 
   In 2005, when the Republican Congress passed the President's energy bill, let me tell you what some folks said. The minority leader at that time says, ``This will lower energy prices for consumers.'' The minority whip, Mr. Blunt, said, ``Vote for lower gas prices and increase energy independence for America.'' This is what was offered and was sold when you did your energy bill. That's what you claimed. 
   My colleague from Illinois, Congressman Shimkus, says, ``I do believe that it will help us become more independent of foreign oil, will expand our use of renewable fuels, and will make our electricity production and transmission more reliable. All of which will help slow price increases.'' 
   That hasn't been accomplished by any stretch of the imagination. When you passed it at that point, gasoline was at $59 a barrel. Today, as you know, it's 124 bucks a barrel. So it hasn't accomplished any of that goal. This is all what you claimed in your marketing at that point when you had an energy bill on the floor in 2005 because you only had one strategy. You didn't want to do anything about conservation. You didn't want to do anything about renewable energy sources and investment in future technologies. And you didn't want to do anything, as my colleague from West Virginia told you, that there were over 9,800 permits out there, force American companies to start drilling in those permits rather than holding those permits here in the United States where we have some of the energy. There's plenty of that to go around. 
   What we've done is put a budget together that breaks with the past. It offers a change in the sense it puts our budget in balance. It invests in education over what the President does. It invests in energy technologies for the future, and also, it ensures that the middle class gets a tax cut. This is a budget that's not only in balance but is in balance with our values and our priorities here. 
   Now, you all have come up with a unique slogan, change you deserve. That's what you've marketed. All you've offered is more of the same, more of the same of $3 trillion of debt, the largest increase in debt in the shortest period of time in American history. That's the change America deserves? 
   You've offered 10 million children without health care to go walking. Is that change you can deserve? 
   You've offered an energy policy that has continued to rely on just drilling without looking at conservation, without looking at future technology. Is that change you can deserve? 
   The American people deserve better, and they're offered here in a budget that is in balance with our priorities, balance with our economic goals. We put resources towards our education,  towards energy technology and towards, in fact, making sure the middle class get a tax cut. 
   In 2005, when you controlled the House, the Senate and the White House, you put together an energy bill that led America to where it is today. I think the American people deserve a change.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, let me just say to the simplification of the student loan form--actually, it happened to be my first bill--which is to take the 106 questions, 8 pages long, down to commonsense English, cut it in half, and the good news is that, in fact, the Higher Ed Reauthorization Act will then, in short order--I have all the confidence in Chairman Miller--be on the floor this month to pass. 
   This, like that act, is a second step that we take to make sure that we put a protective wall around the student loan market. 
   What we see today in the mortgage industry, what we see today happening in other parts of the marketplace, should not happen to those students and those families who are trying to send their kids to college. 
   We live in an era where you earn what you learn. A college education is a ticket to the middle class life and to greater economic security and greater economic opportunity. What has happened in the subprime market and what has happened in our marketplace in the financial sector should not migrate into the student loan industry. 
   This legislation ensures that it will not. It has two messages, one to parents and students, that says in this  time of uncertainty, know that your government is there to ensure that you get a student loan coming up this fall. 
   It's also a message to the executive branch: Do not wait for a crisis. Do not act like you do not have this authority. You have this authority. The Congress, in a bipartisan vote, will make sure you know in no uncertain terms to have the authority to prevent any chaos, any disruption to the student loan marketplace. 
   This legislation, like the reauthorization of the higher ed bill, will build on the facts that we have extended this year and increase Pell Grants for the first time, pass the largest increase of student loans since the GI Bill in 1944. This Congressman knows that when middle class families look at their kids, look at the cost of college that has gone up by $7,500, knows that kids today, when they graduate, graduate with an average debt burden of $18,000 when they get their diploma. 
   This Congress makes sure that middle class families don't fall farther behind making sure their kids have a better and more opportunistic future than they had. A college education is the key to that future, and I am proud that we are taking this action speedily before there is any crisis in the student loan industry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. I'd like to thank the chairman, and I use that with my kids at the breakfast table. You can talk not to exceed 3 minutes. But thank you very much for that time. 
   When the new Congress came in session, this Congress, the 110th, we banned gifts by lobbyists. We banned meals paid for by lobbyists. We changed the rules of the reports on earmarks where Members were doing things that benefited themselves at taxpayers' expense. 
   Today we're considering the most comprehensive legislation on lobbying disclosure since the Watergate era, the most comprehensive legislation, because over the last 12 years, people saw a buildup in this people's House that gave them no confidence that their business was being done, but, in fact, the work of the special interests were done. 
   When that gavel on the Speaker's table comes down, it's intended to open the people's House, not the auction  house, and the American people lost confidence in this institution. The playing field was tilted to the special interests. 
   This legislation, time and again, alters fundamentally the law as it relates to the abuses that we saw over the last 12 years. 
   Now, I compliment my colleagues because in 1994 when they ran for Congress, they came to change Washington. They passed a lobbying bill, but after 12 years in power, rather than change Washington, Washington changed them. They became comfortable with power. They became comfortable and cozy with the special interests, and the American people said, enough. 
   It beared on us and the responsibility of Democrats to change the culture here, to break that link between lobbyists and legislation.     
   What happened at the end of the last 12 years was the special interest voices were heard at the expense of the American people. 
   So whether it's in banning the K Street Project that rewarded companies and institutions that hired the majority party's friends, whether it became gifts, trips and the reporting of those trips, whether it became when Members were negotiating their future employment and doing the work here on the floor of their future employer even before they left, every element of that reform needed to be changed. This bill, under this chairman, does it. 
   That will set the laws. Now it's the conduct of the Member to also understand there is a new day, there is change in the way you do things here in Washington. 
   About 6 years ago, the Congress altered, through passing campaign finance reform, the relationship between a contributor and a candidate. This alters the relationship between a lobbyist and the legislation. 
   Going forward, it would require a constant vigil, the attempt now is to ensure that at no point did those who represent the special interests have a capacity and an interest and an access that far outweighs the American people. That is the attempt of this legislation. 
   Whether it's the provision that relates to Jack Abramoff, the provisions that relate to the K Street Project, the provisions that relate to rangers or pioneers, that they don't have an ability to do things for Members or individuals that far exceed what the people who vote on election day for that Member and that their interests are heard. 
   We have to always come back and make sure that it is rules of the road to Washington don't tilt in favor of the special interests. This is a beginning, and it builds on what we did by banning on day one the gifts and meals by lobbyists, brings transparency to earmarks, and it brings transparency to the entire process as it relates to lobbyists' influence on legislators. 
   I commend our colleague and our chairman for his leadership on this legislation.

   Madam Chairman, as Ronald Reagan once said, facts are a stubborn thing. Let's take the section on required  recusal for Members and staff in negotiation for jobs. This bill has a closure on that, and it brings disclosure on that. The bill brought up before the Republican Congress last time just sits by on that. 
   Bans the K Street Project: This legislation only, in the last time, it said nothing on that. It was silent, except it was against the House rules. 
   Disclosure of lobbyist contributions to charities, conferences, or similar events Members have interests in: This bill has it. Last year, it did not. 
   The Harry and Louise disclosures, so interest groups could hide behind phony names and advertise against Members: This bill has it. Last year's did not. 
   Public database of Members' travel and financial disclosures: This bill has it. Last year's didn't. 
   Increased penalties: This bill has it. Didn't last. 
   Spousal lobbying, restrictions on their spouses: This bill has it; did not before. 
   Disclosure of lobbyist bundling will be considered in separate legislation. The goal is on comparison of the legislation. This is an improvement. 
   Second, to my good friend from California, I am glad you passed legislation last time. The Senate has now passed this. We're going to go to conference on this bill and actually get it done. 
   Number two, and, most importantly, I don't want to go forward looking back. My goal is to get this done, because as I said before, this is an institutional problem that requires an institutional solution, and that's what we have provided here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to health care reform, my colleagues on the other side say the most important priority is the relationship between a patient and a doctor. Why isn't that true for seniors? 
   Today, our Republican friends are once again confronted with a simple choice: Stand with seniors and their physicians, or stand with the big insurance companies and tax cheats. 
   Seniors on Medicare are at risk of losing access to the doctor they know and trust. We have a plan to ensure that doesn't happen, and strengthen Medicare while doing it. Our plan stops overpayments to big insurance companies. We tell providers that owe billions in taxes that they cannot continue to cheat the taxpayers and go unpunished. 
   I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose this bill. Under their plan, seniors would go without care, tax cheats go unpunished, and insurance companies go to the bank. That is a tough argument to make here in Congress, and it is an even tougher argument to make to the American people. 
   I hope my Republican colleagues reconsider and lend their support to this legislation, which continues the relationship between seniors and their physician of choice.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding. 
   The other day there was a story in the newspaper about dead farmers who were still collecting benefits up to about $1 billion. This amendment would cut down on that type of fraud and bring real accountability to the system. 
   I am from Chicago. In Chicago we kind of appreciate the ability of dead people to do spectacular things, but this would even bring an alderman to blush. A billion dollars to dead farmers still getting government benefits. I think a Chicago alderman would be jealous of this type of benefit. 
   So after that report, a number of us put in an amendment to bring the type of accountability to the Department of Agriculture for the type of benefits that are applied and should only be applied to farmers who are farming, obviously, their farm and working, but not to dead farmers and to people who should not be receiving what they estimate is close to $1 billion. 
   So I want to thank the chairman for allowing me to offer this to track down the fraudulent payments that have gone on in the Department of Agriculture and eliminate the type of waste, fraud, and abuse that exist.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to thank my colleague from Indiana who takes seriously his public service and his time and his trips to Iraq. 
   As you comment on the installment plan we have, I don't mean to do this, but we've tried the ``blank check approach.'' You may not like this installment plan, but we have tried for 4 years an approach of being a blank check. No oversight, no accountability, no questions asked. And that has resulted here. 
   Our men and women, and I know this is true for everybody here, we have great respect for what they have done. We asked our Armed Forces to seize a country. We asked our Armed Forces to take down an enemy's army. We asked our Armed Forces to seize the capital. We asked our Armed Forces to capture a dictator. They've done all of that. They have been unbelievably successful. 
   So tell me why we've got the problems we have in Iraq. It is because there has never been a political strategy associated with the success of the Armed Forces' military effort. And General Petraeus is right: you can't solve this militarily. You can only solve this with a political solution. 
   So here we are, our Armed Forces are up to 160,000 troops. We have over $600 billion that has been appropriated for this. We have lost 3,300 lives and 25,000 wounded fellow citizens. So the need for a political solution, and the Iraqi answer? We're taking the summer off. Going fishing. 
   This bill says, no way. You have got to be accountable for your country and get off the sidelines and get onto the playing field and taking ownership of your country's future. If the men and women in our Armed Forces are supposed to give the Iraqis the political space to come together, we do not do that by taking the summer off and not finding common ground. 
   We have plenty of differences here, but we have common ground here. It is the Iraqis that need to find the common ground, not us. We have the right approach. We have asked our folks to do everything. 
   Just a month ago we celebrated the 4-year anniversary of ``mission accomplished.'' We know there is a lot to be done in Iraq, and what we are trying to do is provide our troops the resources they need, the equipment they need, the training they need, and when they come home, the veterans, the health care they need, and, most importantly, the policy that has been absent. The reason we never lost a single soldier in our efforts in Bosnia and in the Balkans is because the policy that a President implements is as important to the protection of those soldiers as the Kevlar vests they wear. 
   What has been missing from this policy and what has been missing from this endeavor is a policy that is equal to the endeavor of our Armed Forces. We have a policy that has been reduced to one simple thing, more troops, more money, more time, more of the same, and you cannot continue a status quo-plus policy. 
   It is time for a new direction, and I am proud that we have offered a new direction to our Iraqi policy.

   What we have not heard is the simple truth. We know many of the fired U.S. Attorneys were pursuing public corruption cases. Contrary to the administration's earlier assertion, we know the decision to fire these prosecutors reached the highest levels of government in the administration and involved Members of Congress and Republican Party officials. So this administration either originally hired incompetent U.S. Attorneys in the first place, or hired competent attorneys but incompetently fired them. 
   Which is it? Are the public corruption cases that implicate Members of their own party off limits in the Bush Justice Department? Is this blind justice? Democrats have been asking these questions for months and for months, and we have been consistently told other stories. Now the time for misdirection is over. Today we will demand and seek the truth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1945, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). As the Democratic Majority begins our second 100 days, we are continuing to move America forward, and WRDA does just that. 
   This bill will help commerce by improving navigation on waterways and making it easier to bring products to market. This bill will invest in our future by modernizing the locks and dams on the Mississippi River and elsewhere. This bill will protect the Great Lakes by finally making the Asian Carp barrier permanent. This bill invests in rural and urban America alike by renewing our commitment to protecting the environment and the economy. 
   The Water Resources Development Act is a good bill that has been written in a bipartisan process to address the needs of the whole country, but there are two parts of the bill in particular that I am especially proud are included. 
   The locks on the Mississippi River and Illinois Waterways are in need of repair, and WRDA finally addresses the long overdue need for lock modernization. Navigation in the upper Mississippi supports more than 400,000 jobs and 90,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs, and passage of WRDA will create more jobs in the region. Every year, shipping in the upper Mississippi River adds up to about $1.2 billion to our economy. Modernizing the locks will go a long way to ensuring the livelihoods of the men and women that rely on these waterways. 
   Another project in WRDA that is critical to the Great Lakes and important to all of Chicago is the Asian Carp barrier. As the residents of the Fifth Congressional District know, invasive species pose a severe threat to Lake Michigan, capable of billions of dollars in economic losses and inestimable environmental damage. 
   The Asian Carp in particular has affected Great Lakes fisheries, and I have been working with my Great Lakes colleagues in making sure that this barrier is funded and operational to protect the Great Lakes from Asian Carp. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Water Resources Development Act is a hat trick--it's good for the environment, it's good for the economy, and it's good for America's future. I want to thank Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Mica for all of their good work, and I am glad that we are getting this bill done. I yield back the balance of my time.

   The Republican Congress and President Bush ran up $4 trillion of new debt in the shortest period of time in American history. All the while, economic insecurity is at an all-time high for the middle class, incomes are stagnating, and homes are losing their value. Since 2000, the cost of health insurance has risen 80 percent, college costs up 44 percent, prices at the pump up 89 percent. 
   Democrats promised to bring tax fairness to the Tax Code, and we promised to help every American secure the pillars of a middle-class life, raising a family, buying a home, paying for college, and saving for retirement. Today we have a chance to make good on our promises. 
   This bill protects 23 million families from the AMT, gives 30 million homeowners the ability to deduct property taxes, helps 12 million children with a larger tax credit, and provides 4.5 million families help to pay for rising college costs, all without adding a penny to President Bush's $9 trillion debt.

   Now, I believe the sincerity that my colleagues support this, and I believe the sincerity of what they said in their letter, which is why we answered every one of those questions, both the sincerity in supporting it, and the sincerity of those remarks. At some point, you have to understand that you can take yes for an answer, and that is, we have provided that answer. 
   Second is, Dolores Sweeney lives in my district. She works for an insurance company. Dolores Sweeney has three kids. Her insurance company does not provide her or her kids health care. She does right by her kids; she earns a paycheck, not a welfare check. If her kids got sick, she would go to Medicaid and go to welfare, but she's doing right by her children because she's working and teaching them right from wrong. Her kids are in SCHIP. And without this program, her kids will live one illness away from Medicaid. Medicaid is for them, for the poor. SCHIP is for parents who work full time earning a paycheck, not a welfare check. They're doing right by their children. 
   Now, I believe in the sincerity of your position, which is why we answered that in the last two weeks. This vote is to say whether 10 million children will get the health care they deserve, whose parents work full-time. These are parents who are doing right. 
   Now, the President at one time referred to SCHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, as excessive spending; yet this week he submitted a request for $200 billion more for Iraq. These kids are our future. Iraq is stealing our future from America.

   At the Interior Department, Johnnie Burton let Big Oil drill at taxpayers' expense and got away with it until Congress stepped in, costing the taxpayers billions of dollars. 
   At the Education Department, Terri Shaw is stepping down after several scandals were uncovered in the student loan industry. On her watch, lenders and Education Department officials undermined the student loan program, which millions of students and middle-class families count on to go to college with and achieve their American Dream. 
   Every day we see another headline and another story. Congress does its oversight job, and another Bush administration official at the center of the storm is eventually forced to step down. 
   The White House has had an approach of letting the industry govern itself. They cut out the middleman. They are the government industry lobbyists. From our energy and production to our college loans, nothing is out of bounds. And Americans sent a clear message last November. They are tired of corruption. They want a change and an end to business as usual here in Washington. Democrats got the message, and we're restoring accountability to the American people's government.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, not one of us would be here if it wasn't for the ability to afford a college education, and although we are talking about cleaning up a mess, it is quite clear we should also remember what is happening here. For a long time, there was no oversight or  any accountability in administration, and people from industry were actually in the responsibility, and their response was to govern and oversee industry they came from. So what did they do? They cut out the middleman. There is no need for a lobbyist, because the industry is the government in this case. 
   What is most ironic in this situation on the student loan situation is industry was getting taxpayer subsidies to run a business in which the very students that were also dependent on their parents were also paying the bill. They were paying on the front end and on the back end. And it was a total rip-off of the American taxpayers. And it is on a subject, college education, that is so essential, because we know, today, in the new economy, you earn what you learn. 
   What we are taking is people's ability to achieve the American Dream, which is so essential, a college education, that ticket to the American Dream. And rather than see what was an honorable profession, something important that could be done with good business practices, it has turned into a scandal that has affected both the schools and the administrators of those schools, public officials responsible for it, and the lenders in that industry. It was affecting everybody. 
   Now, I hope, and from conversations with the chairman, we can rest assured this is just the first step in changing the rules of the game so industry and those in the lending industry understand and those in the regulatory side of it that there is a new way we are going to do business. And there is a new code of conduct for both the public officials and those in the lending industry, because we must fundamentally remember, a college education is a ticket to the American Dream, in a society and economy where you earn what you learn. 
   I do want to recognize the Attorney General of New York for leading this effort, for Congress in a bipartisan fashion stepping up to the plate and taking the first step with this sunshine act. 
   But we are not done in cleaning up the mess as it relates to the college loan industry. This is only the first step to doing that, to cleaning up this mess, because it relates to other areas. We saw it today when the individual responsible for the oil and gas leasing and royalty payment industry because of congressional oversight is now stepping down because it is clear taxpayers were not given their fair shake. 
   We are doing the right job, and I commend both parties in the committee for holding these oversight hearings and producing this legislation and hope that we continue, as we did in the Six in '06, we voted, first of all, to cut the interest rates on student loans; we take this sunshine act, we come back with the higher education bill. We come with the FASA reform. We constantly make sure that we are reforming higher education and the access to higher education, so we serve the people who are doing right, working hard, paying taxes and raising their kids with the right sense of values to do right. This is an industry that needs a whole top-to-bottom cleaning and washing. 
   Thank you for your leadership, Mr. Chairman.  
   Mr. Speaker, for the past 6 years, the public has had to watch as scandal after scandal fell on deaf Republican ears. 
   How times have changed. 
   Today, Democrats are demanding accountability and ending business as usual. 
   We've put the spotlight on the rampant corruption in the Bush administration and the scandals that used to be shoved under the rug are now being exposed. 
   And the new Democratic Congress is getting results for the American people. 
   The latest corruption scandal involves lenders, schools and public officials and has undermined a vital student loan program that millions of students depend on. 
   On Monday the New York Times reported that over 4 years ago a researcher at the Education Department tried to warn his supervisors that student lending companies were improperly collecting hundreds of millions in overpayments. 
   Big companies were getting millions from the very taxpayers who were getting the bill on the other side. So what did the Bush administration do? 
   Nothing. 
   Top officials at the Department of Education's Student Aid Office made millions when they sold stock they held in lending companies. 
   What did the Department do when confronted with this obvious conflict of interest? 
   Nothing. 
   It wasn't until the media and this Congress began in oversight demanding accountability that these officials were put on leave. And yesterday, the head of Federal Student Aid abruptly announced her resignation. 
   Additionally, the Attorney General of New York uncovered a number of improper relationships between lenders and schools, where colleges received payments in exchange for steering loan volume to particular lenders. 
   It is time to clean up this mess and bring transparency to the system. 
   The legislation before us will do just that and help ensure this sort of scandal never occurs again. 
   Madam Speaker, students and families have been the victims of corporate greed, bribery and corruption in the Bush administration. 
   Now, it's time to put an end to these scandals and pass real reform. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Chairman, the FAFSA form that students and their parents have to fill out every year for student aid is over 100 questions, over eight pages long. If a company is applying for an export/import loan from the government, it's 13 questions, one page long. But a kid is going to college and his parents have to fill out over 100 questions. 
   Let me read you some of the questions. Go to page 8 and complete the columns on the left of worksheets A, B and C. Enter the student totals in questions 44, 45 and 46, respectively. Worksheet B, first of 12 items; payments to tax deferred pension and savings paid directly or withheld from earnings, included, but not limited to, amounts reported on the W-2 form in boxes 12-A through 2D, codes, D, E, F, G, H and S. If you can fill that out, skip college, go to graduate school. 
   Now, thankfully for the chairman, we have now put in here to streamline this and create an easy form so this is not one of the leading causes of divorce in America, the College Aid Plan. And if a company can get lawyers and accountants to fill out a one-page form and get a big loan for $200 million from the government, taxpayer subsidies, kids trying to go to college and achieve the American Dream should have something as easy as a big company has. And, thankfully, this legislation would accomplish that. 
   When I ran for office, I used to, and I still do, visit fire stations. And Pat Kehoe, who is a captain in the Chicago Fire Department, was the one that turned me on to the notion of what he and his wife have to do every year to try to get student aid so their kid can go to the University of Illinois. And every year they have to fill out a form like this. 
   The goal here is for government to finally catch up and get to where the private sector has been, which is creating easy forms, things that they can do online and get rid of all the bureaucracy and all the paperwork. 
   Earlier this year, we passed the largest increase in college aid since the GI Bill. This legislation will build on that reform so we finally make sure that college aid, in the period and the era of where you earn where you learn, is accessible to middle-class families and their dreams that they have for their children.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, this morning the President noted with a report that we were at the starting line; 3,600 American lives, $485 billion spent, $10 billion a month, 5 years into the war. If that is the starting line, then I ask you, what is the cost to get to the finish line? If the President describes today that we are at the starting line, I ask you, what is the cost to get to the finish line after all those lives? 
   That would not be the words I would choose to tell the American families who've lost their loved ones. That would not be the words I would choose to tell the people who've put up close to a half a trillion dollars that we are at the starting line after 5 years, and our reputation sullied around the world. 
   Our American men and women in uniform have done brilliantly. Everything we have asked them to do, they have done. They have defeated an army. They have seized a nation, deposed a dictator, taken a castle. There is not one thing we've asked our men and women in uniform and their leadership to do. The only thing they've asked is that their civilian leadership do what they have done, and they were let down. They have won the war, and this administration has failed in the occupation. 
   Now, President Kennedy once said, ``to govern is to choose; choices are between bad and worse.'' And my colleagues on the other side are not all wrong. They fear that if we leave precipitously, there could be real violence, worse than we're seeing; not totally wrong. 
   Those of us have said, after 4 or 5 years of more money, more troops, more time and more of the same, at a certain point, you have to understand that there are costs to that because today we see in the report that, in fact, al Qaeda is reconfiguring and stronger than ever. There are costs to staying, and there are costs to leaving. 
   So what are the choices we all have to make? They are choices between bad and worse. There are those who want to stay and fight the war in Iraq, and there are those of us who want to fight al Qaeda. This is a road to fighting al Qaeda. 
   There are those who want to police a civil war between Sunnis and Shia, and those of us who believe in fighting the war on terror. That is the choice. Neither is easy. There are consequences to both, but all of us recognize that. 
   But after 5 years, 3,600 American lives, $485 billion, you have to ask yourself, are we getting stronger, or are we diminishing our reputation and our power? 
   As our military's stretched, as we see al Qaeda reconfiguring and stronger than ever before, that is the choice before us. And I do agree; it's not a free choice. But staying blindly, without ever having asked a question, only more money, more time, more troops and more of the same with no other clear policy has consequences to America. 
   In that sense, as we measure the Iraqi progress, as the President noted today, there are also ways to measure our progress. 
   We were told the insurgency was in its last throes. Not happening. We were told, at another point, they were placing democracy is the Mideast. Not happening. We were told that we were going to find WMD, weapons of mass destruction. Not happening. At every point that this administration has put a benchmark down for itself, it is not happening. 
   There are consequences to moving just down this path that has been traveled. Too costly. It is time for a new direction for America and Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. EMANUEL. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, this is, as the tax rebate earlier this year, a bipartisan effort to help stabilize the mortgage industry and homeownership. What started as a small crisis in the sub-prime market has now spread to other credit markets and other areas. 
   This is the right thing to do, and literally, the whole world is watching whether we will get this done and stand up for our obligations. This is essential for the mortgage industry, as I said, and also for homeownership in America. 
   In addition to those efforts, this legislation provides up to a $1,000 tax deduction for those who have a standard deduction for property taxes, something we've never done before, and is a landmark as it relates to property tax relief for homeowners, mainly senior citizens. 
   And finally, why I think this legislation is so important, as somebody who worked in affordable housing, in the area of affordable housing, both in Chicago and in prior times in the executive branch, this extends the low-income affordable housing tax credit for States, as well as makes it a wealthier tax credit, which is so important for first time homeowners. 
   This legislation, which could have been done earlier but others didn't want to do it earlier, comes at a critical time to sending messages around the world literally about America's willingness to step forward and meet its obligations to important institutions like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and make sure that America's mortgage industry but, most importantly, its homeownership continues on a steady course and a steady footing. 
   I think this is the right legislation and at an essential time, and I compliment those on a bipartisan effort for accomplishing what is essential for America's economy, at this time, I think a critical juncture as those around the world in the credit markets are watching to see if we will stand by our obligation, and in addition to that, achieves other objectives, property tax relief, as well as affordable housing relief, and make sure that we continue to grow and making accessible affordable housing initiatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. I would like to thank my colleague for lending the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are having a conversation here about trade and globalization and about how to make sure that, in fact, globalization is a win-win strategy for the American people. And we were talking about Colombia, but what we really are talking about is the effects of globalization on the American economy. 
   And in fact today, if you take a look at The Washington Post Business page, there's a new survey out showing the middle class feeling worse in this period of time than ever before, more squeezed by rising costs. Energy is up nearly 2 bucks a gallon since 2001. Nearly $2 up. Health care costs have doubled. College costs are up 64 percent, and yet the median household income in this country shrunk $1,100. The middle class are feeling squeezed. 
   Globalization can be a good thing. Trade can be a good thing. But if you don't have an agenda to make sure Americans win in that globalization, you're going to get a squeeze on the middle class where they resist the attempts to open up markets to American-made products. 
   What we need here, and what we are seeking here, is a new deal for the new economy for the American workers. And that means when health care costs are up like that, we make sure there's health care security to the American people, which is why it was wrong to veto a children's health care bill for America's children to give 10 million children's parents who work full-time health care. 
   It is why it is wrong that when we have an extension of the hope and lifetime college credit so Americans can get to community colleges, can get the chances for their kids to go to college, it is wrong to allow that tax credit to end. 
   It is why we are trying to make sure that, in fact, American people have a retirement security and a universal 401(k) so those who work full time, 75 million Americans, who do not have a savings plan outside of Social Security have in fact a 401(k) like the rest of us. It's an agenda to make sure there is an economic security plan.

   Mr. EMANUEL. No conversation about trade is ever about trade. It's about the standard of living of the middle class of this country. 
   Globalization could be a good thing if you have an agenda, and just trade alone is not an agenda to make sure that the middle class of this country, that built this country since World War II are strengthened to compete and win in this globalized economy. 
   And what we are ensuring today is that we have in fact a trade deal that is not seen as a cost to the American people but seen as an opportunity to succeed in that world, and we today are making sure that there is a win-win strategy to that globalization.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EMANUEL. I would like to thank my colleague from New York and also my colleague from Indiana. 
   Mr. Chairman, you know, it's interesting to have that discussion about what is a haircut. At this very time this would lead, if I am not mistaken, this actual amendment would lead to about a $150 million cut to assistance in Israel. At no time is there a more precarious moment in Israel's history since the founding of the State of Israel, since you have now a war in Lebanon that is affecting the security of the State of Israel. You have the Gaza strip, which has been turned over to Hamas, an enemy of the United States. There is no time that is a more precarious moment in Israel's security. 
   You have what's going on in Lebanon on its northern side. You have what's going on in Iraq, Jordan, dealing with over 1 million Iraqi refugees; Gaza being taken over by Hamas, which is committed to Israel's destruction. 
   And what do our Republican colleagues recommend? A cut in assistance to the only democracy in the Middle East that is facing its most serious threat on its northern border, its southern border and, in fact, what's going on to its near eastern border. This is a precarious moment in Israel security. 
   I do believe there can be cuts. I find every time we want to cut assistance to big oil companies, you guys can't find the will. But when it comes to cutting assistance to Israel, you find the will to do that. When it comes to cutting assistance, when it realizes with our military commitment to our allies  around the world, you know what, since everybody wants to make a quote, talk is cheap. Talk is cheap when it comes to standing next to your allies. We must put our resources to the only democracy in the Middle East. 
   This would directly affect Israel. It would directly affect Egypt. It would directly affect the countries we rely on as the bulwark against the spread of terrorism in the Middle East. 
   I would hope you understand. I see the politics. I know a little bit about politics. I see the politics in a simple half-percent cut. It happens to be politics at the expense of our allies who are on the front line in the fight against terrorism. 
   I would think better of you, of what you have always said rhetorically on the floor about your commitment to democracies in the Mideast.

   Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, 3,188 servicemen and -women have died serving in Iraq, and 371 have given their lives fighting in Afghanistan. 
   We owe these brave individuals and their families a debt of gratitude that can never fully be repaid. It is our responsibility to honor the ultimate sacrifice that our men and women in uniform have made while serving their country. 
   We often invoke their sacrifices in general, but seldom take the time to thank them individually. 
   Last year I led a bipartisan group of Members of Congress in recognizing the individual members of our Armed Forces that have made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan by reading the names and rank of each servicemember who had fallen in the line of duty so that they never will be forgotten and they will always be remembered in the Congressional Record. 
   So far we have read just over 2,400 names on the floor of the people's House. Tonight and on future nights we will continue to complete this tribute with the names of our most recent fallen fellow Americans. 
   If I can, in the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt: ``Each of these heroes stands in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live and grow and increase in its blessings.'' 
   God bless and keep each of the brave Americans whose memory we honor tonight:
