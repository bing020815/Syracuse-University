<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill for two reasons. 
   First, because it would provide for a quick increase in the supply of petroleum in our consumer market and so could reduce the likelihood of further short-term increases in the price of gasoline and other refined products. 
   And, second, because it will do this in a way that is both cost-effective and protective of our national-security interests. 
   Under the bill, the Energy Department, DOE, within 30 days would begin selling light grade oil now stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. At least 20 million barrels would be offered for sale within 30 days after sales begin, and sales would continue for 6 months or until 70 million barrels have been sold, whichever comes first. 
   But the draw-down would not be permanent because the bill would require the Energy Department to acquire, through purchase, using money from the sales, or exchange, heavy grade petroleum for storage in the strategic reserve, to replace the light-grade petroleum that would be sold. 
   Right now, slightly more than 700 million barrels of oil are stored in the strategic reserve--so the amount to be sold under the bill would be only about 10 percent of the amount on hand. 
   And, importantly, the bill specifies that the amount of oil stored in the strategic reserve could not drop below 90 percent of the amount stored when the bill is enacted. The most recent data I have seen indicate that the reserve is currently filled nearly to capacity, so the bill will not cause a significant reduction in the amount stored. 
   Also, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, says that it would be a good idea to increase the extent to which we store heavy oil in the reserve. In testimony earlier this year, Frank Rusco, GAO's acting director for natural resources and environment, said that ``to decrease the cost of filling the reserve and improve its efficiency ..... DOE should include at least 10 percent heavy crude oils in the SPR ..... Having heavy crude oil in the SPR would also make the SPR more compatible with many U.S. refineries, helping these refineries run more efficiently in the event that a supply disruption triggers use of the SPR.'' 
   So, this bill not only is compatible with the national-security purposes of the SPR, it can actually assist in achieving them. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, while I think this bill deserves support, I also think we should recognize that it is not a ``silver bullet'' for the factors that have led to the current high price of oil and products such as gasoline that are made from oil. 
   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, CRS, it is not easy to predict exactly how adding 70 million barrels of easily refined oil from the strategic reserve would affect the market. 
   CRS's most recent report does point out that ``prices might decline after additional refined product entered the market,'' but the same report also notes that oil from the strategic reserve (SPR) ``is not sold at below-market prices. Bids on SPR oil are accepted only if the bids are deemed fair to the U.S. government. If the announcement itself that the SPR is going to be tapped does not prompt or contribute to a softening of prices, there may be limited interest on the part of the oil industry in bidding on SPR supply.'' 
   This underlines the need for a more comprehensive approach to energy issues that combines short-term steps with other changes that will take effect in a longer time frame. 
   For example, I think we should reduce the tariff--that is, the tax--on imported ethanol, so that it will again be a safeguard against subsidizing foreign blenders rather than a trade barrier against imports of this fuel that can add to our supplies and thus further reduce the pressure on prices. I have introduced a bill (H.R. 6234, the Imported Ethanol Facilitation Act) that would do just that. 
   In addition, I am open to increasing the extent to which Federal lands on the outer continental shelf can be subject to exploration for and development of energy resources, and I support adding a stronger due-diligence requirement to promote more rapid exploration and development on existing leases on those lands and onshore as well. 
   We also need to continue to work to reduce the potential for artificial increases in prices through improper speculation or other market-distorting activities. 
   And we need to keep pushing for continued aggressive development of alternative sources of energy--especially renewable sources--to reduce our dependence on petroleum as well as for greater efficiencies in the way we use energy, so that we can do more with the same or reduced amounts. 
   In other words, this bill is not all that is required for a better energy policy. But I think it does have the potential to assist consumers in the short run, without harming the national-security purposes served by maintaining our strategic petroleum reserve. So, I will vote for it and encourage all our colleagues to do so as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill because we must act to reduce the risk of a potentially deep recession, provide a measure of assistance to people most at risk from the economy's troubles, and encourage job-creating investments by the private sector. But we must recognize that the bill's scope is limited and it isn't a full response to the economy's problems. 
   Ironically, the bill's limited scope reflects its best feature--the fact that it was developed through a bipartisan process producing a broadly-supported compromise among the leadership on both sides of the aisle and the Administration. 
   Like most compromises, it has shortcomings. For example, I think Congress should recognize growing unemployment by providing extended unemployment-insurance coverage--and doing so now would reduce the chance that action later will be too late to be fully effective. 
   Still, as it comes before the House, this is a good bill that is undeniably timely, appropriately targeted, and--because it is temporary--will not add excessively to the budget deficit. 
   It provides for payments--technically treated as refundable tax credits--of up to $600 for an individual and up to $1,200 for a married couple, plus $300 per child. It is estimated that some 117 million families will receive these payments, including 35 million working families--including more than 19 million with children--that would not have qualified under the original Administration proposal. Nearly $40 billion in payments, which will phase out for people with incomes of $75,000 for a single person and $150,000 for a married couple, will go to families making less than $50,000. The Treasury Department estimates a total of about $1.7 billion will go to 1,900,000 Colorado households that will receive an average of $895 each. 
   In addition, the bill will temporarily double the amount of new investments in plants and equipment that small businesses can write off their taxes and increase the number of businesses eligible for this tax treatment. This will provide an incentive with the potential to reduce job losses and spur additional employment. 
   As we all know, the housing market is one of the most troubled parts of the economy. The bill addresses that issue by providing a 1-year increase in Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's conforming loan limits--from $417,000 to $729,750--as well as a permanent increase in the Federal Housing Administration's loan limit, from $367,000 up to a maximum of $729,750. It also includes provisions intended to help people facing foreclosure to refinance their loans and get housing counseling that may help them avoid that outcome. 
   If the House was operating under a procedure that allowed amendments to be proposed, the bill might be improved. For example, I would have liked to address the problem of consumer credit card debt by changing some of the predatory practices of credit card companies--even if only on a temporary basis--because as other interest rates are being cut, I wonder if credit card companies will extend a reduced interest rate to consumers who are feeling the effects of high interest rates those companies are imposing. 
   But the choice before us today is a simple one--whether the bill should be approved or rejected. On that, I think the choice is clear and the bill should be passed.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will reluctantly support this short extension of current law dealing with electronic surveillance related to efforts to counter the threat of terrorism. 
   My support is reluctant because I did not vote for the current law, which I think does not properly balance the need to counteract that threat with protection of Americans' rights and liberties. But today I will support a brief extension of that law--scheduled to expire in two days' time--for several reasons. 
   First, I do think the basic law in this area--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA--needs to be updated to respond to changes in technology, which was the purpose of the current, temporary law. 
   Last August, I voted for a bill (H.R. 3356) to provide such an update. Unfortunately, while that bill was supported by a majority of the House, it did not receive the two-thirds vote required by the procedure under which it was considered, and so was not adopted. Its defeat resulted from the opposition of the Bush Administration--supported by all but 3 of our Republican colleagues--which was demanding instead that the House approve a different version. Regrettably, that tactic succeeded and the result was passage of the current law, which I did not support. 
   Then, last November, I again voted for a bill to update FISA, H.R. 3773, the ``Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective'' (or RESTORE) Act. 
   That bill is not perfect, but as I said then I did not insist on perfection because I thought the House should act to correct the shortcomings of the temporary law enacted last  year and because in my opinion the RESTORE Act would give the Administration the authority it says it needs to conduct surveillance on terrorist targets while restoring many of the protections that the temporary law has reduced. 
   The House passed the RESTORE Act on November 15th, and we have been waiting for the Senate to act. President Bush has criticized the House-passed bill because it does not grant retroactive immunity from lawsuits for telecommunications companies that assisted in the Administration's secret surveillance program without being compelled to do so by a warrant. As I said in November, I think it might be appropriate to consider that, but not until the Bush Administration has responded to bipartisan requests for information about the past activities of these companies under the program. I have not been ready to grant immunity for the companies' past activities while we don't know what those activities were. 
   Recently, the Administration has finally relented and is allowing appropriate review of documents on this subject. But that review is not yet complete--and so the second reason I support this legislation is to allow the review to continue before Congress is required again to act on this subject. This would not be necessary if the Administration had not been so resistant to the idea of properly informing Congress and providing the relevant information, but now it is needed. 
   Finally, because the Senate has been slow to act, I think the current law should be extended briefly to provide a reasonable opportunity for any differences between the House-passed bill and whatever the Senate may approve to be resolved through careful and thorough discussion rather than in the kind of exaggerated haste that too often leads to unsatisfactory results. 
   Therefore, despite what I think are the very real flaws of the current, temporary law, I will support this measure to extend it for an additional 30 days.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3087, a bill that I voted for--along with 54 of my colleagues--when the Armed Services Committee considered it in July. 
   As amended in committee, H.R. 3087 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive redeployment strategy for U.S. troops in Iraq and requires that the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff brief the House and Senate Defense Committees on its contents within 60 days, and every 90 days thereafter. 
   This legislation underscores the importance of contingency planning--something I called for earlier this year when I introduced H.R. 1183, the Iraq Contingency Planning Act. It also underscores the importance of requiring the Defense Department to share its planning with Congress. The sharing can be done in a classified way, but Congress needs to be informed about these plans if we are to be prepared to respond to what these plans may call for. 
   We remember that in 2003, President Bush launched a war in Iraq without a plan for what would come after initial military sucess. We all know where that has led us, and so as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I want assurances that this administration is thinking about and planning for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq--whether it happens tomorrow or next month or next year. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation isn't intended to solve the larger problem of Iraq. To do that, we need a policy aimed at escalating diplomatic and political efforts and lightening the U.S. footprint in Iraq. But although there is widespread support for redeploying our troops, there is not yet sufficient support in Congress to override a Presidential veto on any major change in our Iraq policy. 
   That's another reason this bill is important. So long as we lack a sufficient majority to override his veto, we Democrats can't force the President to change course without Republican support. Only Democrats and Republicans working together can find the path out of Iraq. This bill is a small step forward in building that bipartisan support, so I will vote for it again today, while I continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on further steps we can take to change our broader Iraq policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this urgently needed legislation. 
   Three months ago, the House passed an excellent energy bill that combined provisions developed by several different Committees designed to start putting our country on a path toward energy independence, increased national security and economic growth, and addressing global warming. 
   The Senate has also passed its version of energy legislation, and the measure now before the House would make revisions to that version, returning the bill to the Senate for further action. 
   By passing it, we can move toward greater energy independence--which means greater national security--in ways that will lower energy costs, help our economy, and reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. 
   The measure includes a few things not part of the bill the House passed earlier, including the first revision in decades of the fuel-consumption standards for automobiles and trucks and provisions dealing with the Secure Rural Schools and Payments-in-Lieu-of-Taxes, PILT program. 
   I support those additions. Both are good for the nation, and the Secure Rural Schools and PILT provisions are of particular importance for Colorado because so many of our counties include large Federal land areas and therefore will benefit directly from that part of the bill. In 2006, Colorado counties received more than $6 million in Secure Rural Schools payments, while PILT payments to our counties totaled an additional $17.3 million. 
   However, the authorization for Secure Rural Schools has expired and Congress has rarely appropriated all funds authorized for PILT--which is why I have introduced legislation, H.R. 790 to make full funding for PILT automatic without a need for annual appropriations. So, this part of the legislation is good news for Colorado because it will mean our counties will know what they will receive to help pay for law enforcement and other vital services. 
   I am particularly pleased that the measure before us retains the provision of the House bill--added by adoption of an amendment I offered along with Representatives TOM UDALL and TODD PLATTS--to establish a Renewable Electricity Standard, RES. This provision will require utilities acquire 15 percent of electricity production from renewable resources by 2020. The House's adoption of that amendment represented a great success by those of use working for positive change that will benefit rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security. 
   I am also pleased that the legislation includes a provision on carbon capture and storage based upon a bill that I authored. Coal and other fossil fuels have been and will continue to be an important energy source for our country, but coal-burning power plants are also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The carbon capture and storage research, development, and demonstration program authorized in this bill will help us tackle this challenge while keeping our economy healthy and strong. It will authorize the Department of Energy to conduct demonstration projects for both carbon dioxide capture and carbon dioxide injection and storage. Not only will this research program help us develop this technology and make it more economical, it will also help us understand the implications of storing large amounts of carbon dioxide underground. 
   But some of the provisions we passed earlier are not part of this measure. I regret their omission, and if it had been up to me, they would not have been dropped. 
   Those omissions include the majority of provisions in the earlier bill that originated in the Natural Resources Committee, including ones that I proposed regarding oil shale development, the protection of surface owners in ``split estate'' situations, and the safeguarding of our water supplies from potential adverse effects of energy development. And the measure now before us also omits the important provision to require that drilling on the top of the Roan Plateau be done in a way that will reduce adverse effects on other resources and values of that area, which is so important to Western Slope communities and Colorado's hunters and anglers. 
   I am also disappointed that the measure does not include my provision to reorient and expand the U.S. Global Change Research Program, USGCRP, so that it will provide more user-driven research and information. The USGCRP coordinates all Federal climate change research and has contributed much to our understanding of climate change since its creation in 1990--but we now need to expand our knowledge and tailor the information to the needs of national, regional and local decision makers confronted with management and mitigation challenges. This bipartisan provision would have done that. 
   I strongly supported all those provisions, and I intend to continue working to win their enactment either on their own or as part of some other measure.  
   But while dropping those provisions means the measure now is weaker in some respects that the one the House passed earlier, it has been strengthened in an important respect by the addition of the fuel-economy provisions, which will result in increasing the efficiency of all vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. And other parts of the legislation will provide long-term incentives to boost production of electricity from renewable sources, including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, river currents, ocean tides, landfill gas, and trash combustion resources, as well as to expand production of homegrown fuels such as cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. 
   The bill will encourage manufacturers to build more efficient appliances, help working families afford fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid vehicles, and help businesses create energy-efficient workplaces. It will encourage deployment of renewable energy by enabling electric cooperatives and public power providers to use new clean renewable energy bonds to help finance facilities to generate electricity from renewable resources. And it will help states leverage tax credit bonds to implement low-interest loan programs and grant programs to help working families purchase energy-efficient appliances, make energy-efficient home improvements, or install solar panels, small wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps. 
   Further, the bill will create an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train Americans for good ``green'' jobs--such as in solar panel manufacturing and green building construction--that will be created by new renewable-energy and energy-efficiency initiatives. This will provide training opportunities to our veterans, to those displaced by national energy and environmental policy and economic globalization, to individuals seeking pathways out of poverty, to young people at risk and to workers already in the energy field who need to update their skills. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said, this legislation is much needed and long overdue. While I regret the omission of several very important parts of the version the House passed earlier this year, what remains and what has been added combine to make a measure that deserves to pass here and in the Senate and that President Bush should sign into law. I urge its approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill. 
   The bill is similar to one I voted for last month that dealt with Federal lands that have been leased for energy exploration and development under the Mineral Leasing Act but where such activities have not yet occurred. 
   As I noted last month, the debate over this legislation has included statements--by some supporters and some opponents alike--that exaggerates the likely effect of enactment. For example, I believe it would be better to avoid the ``use it or lose it'' rhetoric that over-simplifies the issue and fails to reflect the reality that oil and gas exploration is a complicated commercial and scientific enterprise involving efforts that do not easily fit within strict regulatory timelines. 
   But while that part of the bill may not be as far-reaching as some have claimed, I think it is a reasonable response to current conditions and should be passed. In essence, it would bar the current holders of federal mineral leases--whether for onshore or offshore areas--from obtaining additional leases unless they are able to show that they are ``diligently developing'' the leases they already hold. The Secretary of the Interior would be responsible for spelling out in regulations exactly what would be needed to show such ``due diligence.'' 
   Current Interior Department regulations include provisions addressing due diligence requirements, so this is not a new concept. But I think giving it greater emphasis is appropriate in view of the continuing importance of oil even as we work to increase the availability and use of alternative energy sources. More useful in terms of energy policy, this bill will reinforce the provisions of current law that aim to prevent hoarding of leases. And providing an incentive for relinquishment of some leases may increase the opportunity for others to explore for and produce oil or gas from those lands. 
   This approach is similar to that taken when Congress amended the coal-leasing laws by passing the Coal Leasing Act Amendments of 1976 over President Ford's veto. That 1976 legislation provided for a due-diligence requirement as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the laws governing leasing and development of federally-owned coal resources--a provision that some analysts have said had the most immediate practical effect of any of the legislation's various provisions. As a result, for several decades the holders of federal coal leases have been required by law to diligently develop their leases, which has aided in the orderly and efficient development of the nation's coal. I think a similar reinforcement of existing law for leasing of other federal energy resources makes sense. 
   I have a similar reaction to the other provisions of the bill--they certainly are not all that needs to be done to improve our energy policies, but they can make at least a modest contribution in the right direction. 
   These provisions include a requirement for the Department of the Interior to offer at least one lease sale annually in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. This is an area of well-established potential that was initially made available for leasing in the Clinton Administration, and with regard to which the current Administration just today announced that 2.6 million acres would be offered at lease sales in the near future. Dictating a leasing timetable in legislation is unusual, but the potentially beneficial effects on prices from tapping the reserves in this part of Alaska are undeniable. 
   In addition, the bill would reinstate a ban on the export of Alaskan oil that was previously a matter of federal law. Oil is a globally-traded commodity, so the effect of this will be limited, but it may, to some extent, reduce reliance on exports. 
   The bill calls on the President to facilitate the completion of oil pipelines into the National Petroleum Reserve and to facilitate the construction of a Alaska natural gas pipeline to the continental United States to move the product to market. These are only exhortations, but I see no objection to their inclusion in the legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I do not think this bill is a comprehensive solution toward solving our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. Nor does it come close to addressing all that we must do on energy policy. 
   We need to do more. 
   We can look for ways to increase exploration in offshore areas--for example, in 2006 I proposed opening up part of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to within 100 miles of the Florida coast, rather than leave the 125-mile buffer that was finally enacted, and I think that additional acreage should be made available. We should adjust the tax on imported ethanol, and I have introduced to reduce an artificial trade barrier that discourages imports of that fuel. We need to aggressively pursue development of alternative energy sources, including solar and wind power, and we should move aggressively to support research in carbon sequestration for clean coal development, and review policies that inhibit a more proactive effort with nuclear power. And we also need to work even harder to increase energy efficiency, so that we get a greater payoff from all energy sources. 
   In short, we need a comprehensive and balanced energy policy. This bill by itself is at best a small part of that prescription--but, modest as it is, it does deserve approval and I will vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill. It can help working people, and it will send a strong message that we need a National Labor Relations Board committed to fairness in the workplace. 
   But as I said 2 years ago, I have serious reservations about lessening the role of the secret ballot in union elections. Workers should not be intimidated by pressure from either business or labor in making decisions about organizing a union. 
   However, it is clear that the NLRB has clearly failed to protect workers from intimidation and union-busting. That is why I support this bill even though it is far from perfect. 
   And while I support the rule because it allows the House to consider some meaningful amendments, I am disappointed that others were not included. For example, I thought we ought to have made changes to make the procedure for decertifying unions like those for establishing unions. We should also have considered setting deadlines for NLRB decisions. 
   I would hope those amendments, and others, maybe even a sunset clause, will be considered in the Senate not only because they could improve this legislation but because open debate on amendments might help reduce the divisions and polarization about this bill. 
   But the House should pass the bill, imperfect though it is, so the Senate can continue the process of reforming our labor laws to better protect workers' rights while also working towards balance, fairness, and objectivity in the way that the NLRB must do its job.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Chairman, when I agreed to cosponsor this important legislation two years ago I made clear in a floor statement that I had serious reservations about weakening the secret ballot in union organizing elections. I believe American workers ought to make decisions about organizing unions in a way that is free from intimidation by labor or employers. 
   It is because the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has largely failed in their responsibilities to protect the rights of American workers to organize that we even have to consider this legislation. 
   Despite my reservations, therefore, I am persuaded that we ought to pass this imperfect bill so that the Senate may take up reforms in the labor-business relationship that will protect the rights of workers to organize, and at the same time preserve balance, fairness and objectivity in the way the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) conducts elections.  
   Before I get to the merits of this legislation, however, I want to register my disappointment that more amendments were not allowed for our consideration. The majority may not be well served by an open process that allows for deeper debate and the consideration of amendments, but our country would be better served. And on legislation with such far-reaching consequences for the balance between business and labor, I believe we are ill-served by not debating and considering more amendments. 
   There are other improvements to this bill that we should have considered, and that I hope will be considered in the Senate. For example, I hope the Senate will consider amendments that address decertification procedures and deadlines for the NLRB to reach decisions. And I am hopeful the Senate will consider carefully whether this legislation should apply equally to small businesses. Perhaps the Senate will also consider the wisdom of a sunset provision for this legislation so that we can revisit it later--in order to determine whether it will have the desired effect for workers and for our economy. 
   As I said in 2004, I am reluctant to endorse changes in current law that could be seen as preventing workers to make decisions in private about union representation. 
   I agree with those who say a secret ballot process is preferable in most cases, and think that the burden of proof is on those who say that an alternative should be used. 
   However, I have been and remain disturbed by reports of employers using heavy handed techniques to discourage workers from organizing in the first place and intimidating and even illegally firing workers who decide to join. 
   But there is a real possibility that the NLRB won't do that--which is the primary reason I support this bill. 
   I am disturbed--I think we should all be disturbed--by the serious questions that have been raised about whether the NLRB is doing its job. And I am worried that recent NLRB decisions tilt too far toward allowing employers to intimidate union organizers. 
   For example, the NLRB has decided that as workers are considering whether to form a union, an employer may explicitly ``inform'' them that workers in two other facilities lost their jobs after they decided to organize. 
   I understand that in the case in question the regional NLRB director ruled this ``clearly implied'' the union was responsible for the firings and insinuated the same would happen to others who chose a union. In other words, the NLRB official closest to the case saw this as an example of an illegal threat of retaliation. 
   But in a 2-1 party line vote--with two appointees by the current Administration in the majority--the NLRB overruled the regional director's decision and claimed the memo ``did not exceed the bounds of permissible campaign statements.'' 
   I think that decision shows just how far the playing field has been tilted away from a fair balance between employers and employees who want to bargain collectively. 
   And the purpose of this legislation is to move back toward a fairer balance. 
   Consider what the law says about ending--not establishing, but ending--union representation. Under the National Labor Relations Act, if 50% or more of the employees in a bargaining unit sign a petition that they no longer want to be represented by their union, the employer can withdraw recognition without an election. 
   And if just 30% of the employees in a bargaining unit sign a Decertification Petition, the NLRB will conduct a secret ballot election on the question of ending union representation. Not a majority--just 30% 
   In other words, the current law makes it harder for workers to get a union than to get rid of one--and, as I just said, current policies of the NLRB add to the burden of people who want to have a union. I don't think that's balanced. Why should it be harder for workers to get a union into their workplace than it is for them to get the union out? 
   This bill would not completely change that. But it would say that just as signatures of a majority of workers can end union representation, a majority of signatures could start it. And I think that is reasonable and equitable. 
   Also, the bill would correct some of the problems with the current NLRB by changing parts of the law under which it operates. 
   Current law says the NLRB must go into federal court and ask for an injunction against a union if the NLRB thinks there is reasonable cause to believe that the union has violated the law's prohibition of secondary boycotts. Under the bill the NLRB would have to take the same action to enforce the law that protects workers against pressure to reject a union as it does to enforce the law's limits on what a union can do to put pressure on employers. I think that is fair. 
   And the bill also increases the amount a worker could collect if he or she has been unlawfully discharged or discriminated against during an organizing campaign or first contract drive and by providing for civil fines of up to $20,000 per violation against employers found to have willfully or repeatedly violated the law. Again, I think these are improvements over the current law. 
   Finally, I think some of the attacks on this bill have been exaggerated. For example, some have said it is intended to deprive workers of their right to an election. But under current law, elections are not always required--if a majority of workers sign cards saying they want to have a union, their employer can agree, and then the union is established without any election. So what the bill does is to deprive employers of the option of insisting on an election any time a majority of the workers have signaled that they want a union. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill is not perfect, and in some ways I think it might have been better to take a different approach to the problem, with even greater emphasis on changing the law governing the operations of the NLRB rather than the card-check process. But I think it can, and should be improved before final passage by the Congress, and should go forward to the Senate for further and, hopefully more deliberate, consideration.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this urgently needed legislation. 
   The latest statistics, show that the national unemployment rate has risen from 5 percent to 5.5 percent, the biggest increase in a single month in over 20 years, and now is at the highest level in nearly four years. 
   The economy has been slowing and has been losing jobs for at least five months. In May the number of people looking for work reached 8.5 million--and nearly one in five has been unemployed for more than 26 weeks. 
   Colorado has not been as hard hit as some other States, but we are not immune. For example, Denver will be affected by United Airlines' discontinuing its low-fare ``Ted'' carrier as well by layoffs by other airlines and companies in other sectors. 
   And, in the Nation as a whole the number of long-term unemployed Americans is higher now than when Congress last extended unemployment benefits in 2002. 
   This legislation will respond to that problem by immediately providing up to 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits in every state to workers exhausting the 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits. In addition, another 13 weeks of extended benefits will be available in States with unemployment rates of six percent or higher. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this will help some 3.8 million Americans. 
   And by helping them, we help the country--because extending unemployment compensation benefits is one of the most cost-effective and fast-acting ways to stimulate the economy. In fact, an estimate by an independent expert--the chief economist of Moody's Economy.com--indicates that each dollar of unemployment benefits generates $1.64 in new economic demand, while the existing federal unemployment trust funds have more than enough reserves to cover the cost. 
   Mr. Speaker, in my opinion this legislation deserves prompt approval. In fact, I think it should have been passed yesterday--and would have been if just 3 more of our Republican colleagues had voted for it then, when we considered it under a procedure that required a two-thirds majority for passage. 
   But even a day late, we still have an opportunity to do the right thing, so I urge its approval by the House.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, earlier this year, I introduced the NASA Authorization Act of 2008, a bill to reauthorize the programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the fiscal year 2009. Today, I rise to urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass this bill and send it on to the Senate. 
   The bill passed the Committee on Science and Technology and the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics with unanimous support, as our chairman pointed out. It represents a strong, bipartisan effort to ensure our continued leadership in space and aeronautics and to ensure that NASA's programs contribute to our science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education efforts, to our Nation's Innovation Agenda, and to practical benefits for our citizens. 
   I, too, want to thank Science and Technology Committee Chairman BART GORDON, Ranking Member RALPH HALL, and my fellow ranking member on the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, TOM FEENEY from Florida, for being original cosponsors, as well as providing thoughtful input into this bill. 
   I would also like to thank the excellent staff on both the majority and minority side for their outstanding work on this bill. On my staff, my dedicated and tireless staff member, Wendy Adams, Richard Obermann, Pam Whitney, Allen Li, and Devin Bryant, as well as John Piazza have all been instrumental in moving this bill forward. 
   I want to particularly point out the great contribution--I think the chairman would agree with me--of Dick Obermann. We benefit in the committee, the Nation benefits and this House of Representatives benefits from Dick's insights, his knowledge, and the relationships he's built. Anyone in the NASA orbit knows Dick Obermann's many, many contributions. So I want to particularly point out his great contributions to the committee and to NASA. 
   On the minority side, I want to thank Ed Feddeman, Ken Monroe, and Lee Arnold as well. They have been very helpful in the work on this piece of legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, the bill sets fiscally responsible policies and provisions for a balanced set of science, aeronautics, and human spaceflight programs. 
   The baseline funding level authorized for NASA in fiscal year 2009, $19.21 billion, represents simply an inflation increase of about 2.8 percent over the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, legislation that the President signed into law. 
   I don't want to go into great detail about the many provisions of the bill but will include my longer statement for the Record. 
   Madam Chairman, 2008 represents the 50th anniversary of the birth of the U.S. space program and the establishment of NASA. NASA has accomplished a great deal in both space and aeronautical R&D over these past five decades, and we can all take pride in what has been accomplished. However, we cannot become complacent. 
   The testimony and constructive input of countless hearings, witnesses, and outside experts and organizations that led to H.R. 6063 conveyed a consistent message: that NASA has not been given the funding it needs to successfully carry out all of the important tasks that the Nation has asked of it. If we fail to adequately invest in NASA now, it is unlikely that we will see a comparable record of accomplishment over the next five decades, at a great opportunity cost to the Nation. 
   I am gratified by the support that H.R. 6063 has garnered to date, including the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Aerospace Industries Association, the Association of American Universities, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, and the University Space Research Association. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 6063 to ensure that our Nation remains the leader in space and aeronautics programs.  
   Madam Chairman, on May 15, 2008 I introduced the ``NASA Authorization Act of 2008,'' H.R. 6063, a bill to reauthorize the programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for Fiscal Year 2009. 
   Today I rise to urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass this bill and send it on to the Senate. 
   This bill passed the Committee on Science and Technology and the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics with unanimous support. 
   It represents a strong bipartisan effort to ensure our leadership in space and aeronautics and to ensure that NASA's programs contribute to our science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education efforts, to the Nation's innovation agenda, and to practical benefits for our citizens. 
   I would like to thank Science and Technology Committee Chairman Bart Gordon, Ranking Minority Member Ralph Hall, and Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Ranking Minority Member Tom Feeney for being original cosponsors of this bill. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill sets fiscally-responsible policies and provisions for a balanced set of science, aeronautics, and human spaceflight programs. 
   The baseline funding level authorized for NASA in FY 2009--$19.21 billion-- represents simply an inflationary increase of about 2.8 percent over the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, legislation that the President signed into law. 
   H.R. 6063 also reflects the conviction that NASA is as much a contributor to the nation's innovation agenda as any of the other agencies included in the America COMPETES Act that was enacted into law last year. 
   Thus, includes provisions and funding directed at supporting opportunities for hands-on training of the next generation of scientists and engineers. 
   In addition to the baseline authorization, H.R. 6063 contains a directed funding augmentation intended to help accelerate the date when the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and Ares Crew Launch Vehicle can attain operational status. 
   A series of policy failures over a number of years have brought us to the point where we will have an unavoidable gap in the United States' ability to get its astronauts into space independently. 
   Providing the additional funding in FY 2009 can help narrow the gap while also putting in place the space transportation system that will help us carry out exciting and important exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit in the decades to come. 
   Madam Chairman, NASA's programs are strongly relevant to addressing the nation's needs. 
   In short, a properly balanced and focused NASA portfolio can pay large dividends to our society as well as to our standing in the world, and maximizing the value of the NASA portfolio to the nation is one of the main goals of the NASA Authorization Act of 2008. 
   To that end, H.R. 6063 establishes a role for NASA in leading a cooperative international effort on Earth observations research and applications, especially with respect to climate change-one of the major challenges facing our generation. 
   In addition, the bill includes a series of provisions to ensure that NASA's aeronautics program gets the resources it needs to remain one of the most relevant activities of the agency--one that impacts our quality of life, public safety, the vitality of the economy, and our national security. 
   H.R. 6063 also includes provisions to ensure that the International Space Station--a unique orbiting R&D facility that represents a significant investment of resources by both American citizens and those of a host of other nations--will be utilized in as productive a manner as possible. 
   The ISS is also a compelling example of the value of undertaking a cooperative approach to space exploration. To that end, H.R. 6063 makes clear that any human exploration initiative to return to the Moon and venture to other destinations in the solar system should be undertaken as a cooperative international undertaking under strong U.S. leadership. 
   Madam Chairman, 2008 marks the 50th anniversary of the birth of the U.S. space program and the establishment of NASA. 
   NASA has accomplished a great deal in both space and aeronautical R&D over those past five decades, and we can all take pride in what has been accomplished. However, we cannot become complacent. 
   The testimony and constructive input of countless hearing witnesses, outside experts,  and organizations that led to H.R. 6063 conveyed a consistent message: that NASA has not been given the funding it needs to successfully carry out all of the important tasks that the nation has asked of it. 
   If we fail to invest adequately in NASA now, it is unlikely that we will see a comparable record of accomplishment over the next five decades--at a great opportunity cost to the nation. 
   I am gratified by the support that H.R. 6063 has garnered to date, including the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Aerospace Industries Association, the American Astronautical Society the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Meteorological Society, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Association of American Universities, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Information Technology Association of America, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers-USA, the National Business Aviation Association, the National Space Society, the Personal Spaceflight Federation, the Planetary Society, the Universities Space Research Association, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 
   I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives support H.R. 6063 to ensure that our Nation remains the leader in space and aeronautics programs.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of the manager's amendment. We have all worked together to fashion a constructive amendment. And I believe it includes a number of useful provisions that enhance the bill. Chairman Gordon already described them. So I am not going to restate them. But I want to note in particular that the workforce provisions included in the amendment have been under consideration for some time. We wanted to make sure however that we had the concurrence of all the stakeholders before we added any of these provisions. That has been done. The provisions will strengthen and protect the NASA workforce. I would ask the Members to support this amendment. It is a good amendment. It deserves the support of the body.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the gentleman from Oregon for yielding and thank him for his leadership on the committee. 
   I rise in support of this amendment on scientific integrity and openness at NASA. I want to commend the gentleman from Oregon for his action that we stay vigilant on this matter. 
   A few years ago, concerns were raised about political interference in the discussion of scientific research and results by NASA scientists. These concerns about scientific openness were and are serious, and we need to ensure that all measures are in place to prevent such interference. 
   It is true that the NASA Administrator, Dr. Griffin, took swift action in response to the reports of political interference and NASA revised the agency policy on the release of information of news and media, and I want to commend Dr. Griffin on his clear commitment to scientific openness. That said, we need to continue, Madam Chairman, our oversight on scientific integrity to ensure that Americans continue to have confidence in the important scientific research results that NASA provides to all of us and to our Nation. 
   So I again want to thank the gentleman from Oregon for his initiative, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Chairman, I am pleased to support this amendment. 
   This amendment is similar to the Boren amendment offered to the defense authorization package recently. That amendment passed with a voice vote on the floor. 
   This amendment as well seeks to clarify requirements of section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to allow NASA to procure conventional fuels that contain incidental amounts of unconventional fuels. 
   Section 526, Madam Chairman, is important because it establishes a positive benchmark for future alternative fuels, that their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions be less than or equal to those emissions from conventional fuels. 
   The amendment clarifies section 526 while retaining the standard it sets for greenhouse gas emissions. 
   I want to thank the Member from Texas for bringing this important amendment and urge all Members to support the amendment.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Chairman, I strongly support this amendment. 
   Tornadoes cause an average of 54 fatalities and 1,500 injuries in the United States each year. Just last month in my home State of Colorado, tornadoes devastated the town of Windsor in Colorado destroying more than 100 homes and causing one death. Predicting tornado intensity and location is critical to protecting lives and property, and we must do all we can to improve our knowledge in this important area. 
   I'm proud to say that the research at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in my district, the Second District in Colorado, contributes to this better understanding and improved forecasts of tornadoes. This amendment will further involve NASA scientists and data in this important process. 
   I would urge Members to support this amendment just like the chairman did.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL YEAR -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in support of House Concurrent Resolution 76, honoring the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year, IGY. 
   This resolution marks the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year, IGY, honors its contributions to space research, and looks forward to future accomplishments. 
   I am pleased that several of my colleagues from the Science and Technology Committee have joined me as cosponsors and would like to thank Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Ranking Member CALVERT, Chairman GORDON, and Research and Science Education Subcommittee Chairman BAIRD for their support for this measure. 
   I would especially like to thank the Chairman for his leadership in getting this bill on the floor today. 
   The International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-1958 was an international collaboration to coordinate observations and measurements of the solid Earth, oceans, the atmosphere, and the near-Earth space environment on a global scale. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, 67 nations and thousands of scientists came together to make the IGY a resounding success. 
   A particularly significant aspect of the IGY was that it extended science into space through the launch of artificial satellites--signifying the dawn of the Space Age. Explorer I, the first successful U.S. satellite launch, made possible an important scientific result of the IGY--the discovery of belts of trapped, charged particles in the Earth's upper atmosphere, which are now known as the VanAllen radiation belts. 
   Equally importantly, the IGY has been a shining example of the benefits of international cooperation in scientific endeavors. The coordination of global interdisciplinary observations by researchers from multiple nations during a time of geopolitical tensions continues to be an inspiration and a model for those who recognize the significant contributions that can be achieved when nations come together in the peaceful pursuit of scientific knowledge. 
   Indeed, scientists around the world continue to build on the impressive research legacy left to them by their IGY predecessors 50 years ago. As a current example, I support the International Polar Year (IPY) and the IPY research efforts that are planned to take place over the next 2 years, efforts that will encompass a wide range of research topics--for example, on studies of environmental change in the Arctic and marine life in the Arctic Ocean. 
   I introduced an IGY resolution in the 108th Congress, which passed the House, to mark the then-upcoming IGY and to encourage the celebration of its 50th anniversary throughout the country and across the globe. This year's IGY concurrent resolution both honors the great scientific work that was done during the IGY, as well as works to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers. We will be looking to those young men and women to continue to advance our knowledge, strengthen our nation's economy, and improve our quality of life. That is why H. Con. Res. 76 encourages the public, and in particular our young people, to participate in celebrations planned for the IGY anniversary year and to seek to build on the scientific legacy of the IGY by striving to achieve challenging new goals in space science and Earth science. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 76 and honor the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year. The IGY set a high standard of achievement. I am confident that by means of future research in Earth science and space science, including that of the IPY, we can achieve equally meaningful advances over the next 50 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' H.R. 976 does not end health care inequality, but it will provide continued coverage for children not covered by Medicare but whose parents cannot afford to buy insurance and whose employers do not provide it. 
   These children--currently 6 million of them--are now eligible for coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)--but that program is set to expire at the end of this month. If Congress does not act, these six million will no longer have access to quality, affordable health insurance. This bill responds to that urgent need. 
   This legislation would assure continued coverage for those now enrolled and would provide coverage for an additional four million children who currently qualify, but who are not yet enrolled under CHIP. 
   I believe that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and this act is a step in the right direction toward that goal. So, I will support it although I wish it went further. 
   Despite claims by some, this bill does not change the basic nature of the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains current eligibility requirements for CHIP. The majority of uninsured children are currently eligible for coverage--but better outreach and adequate funding are needed to identify and enroll them. This bill gives states the tools and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program. 
   Earlier this year, I vote for the ``CHAMP'' bill to extend CHIP. The House of Representatives passed that bill, and I had hoped the Senate would follow suit. It would have increased funding for the CHIP program to $50 million, instead of the lesser amount provided by this bill. The CHAMP bill would have also addressed major health care issues, first by protecting traditional Medicare and second by addressing the catastrophic 10 percent payment cuts to physicians who serve Medicare patients. 
   However, the bill before us represents a compromise between the House and the Senate and deserves support today. It will pay for continued CHIP coverage by raising the federal tax by $0.61 per pack of cigarettes and similar amounts on other tobacco products. According to the American Cancer Society, this means that youth smoking will be reduced by seven percent while overall smoking will be reduced by four percent, with the potential that 900,000 lives will be saved. 
   H.R. 976 has the support of the American Medical Association, American Association of Retired Persons, Catholic Health Association, Healthcare Leadership Council, National Association of Children's Hospitals, American Nurses Association, US Conference of Mayors, NAACP, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and United Way of America. 
   I am proud to vote for this bill that seeks to protect those that are most vulnerable in our society by increasing health insurance coverage for low-income children. I hope that we have the opportunity to take up the other important Medicare issues addressed in the CHAMP bill soon.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for these amendments today. Taken together, they provide necessary funding for our troops, set the stage for a responsible strategy of phased disengagement in Iraq, and address domestic needs and global concerns. 
   The war funding will pay for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq for the rest of this year and half of 2009. I support this because it will make it possible to provide the equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other supplies needed by our brave men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who have shown such extraordinary skill, determination and endurance in answering their call to service. 
   I opposed the Bush Administration's rush to war in Iraq, and voted against the resolution that authorized the president to send our armed forces into that country on the theory that this was necessary in order to deprive the Saddam Hussein regime of weapons of mass destruction. So, I understand why some of my constituents who also opposed the war want Congress to reject this funding measure. 
   And I could not agree more that the record of the current Administration demonstrates an enormous failure of leadership and that we desperately need new leadership that will bring to a close our open-ended military engagement in Iraq and will refocus on the very urgent tasks of reducing the terrorist threats in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   But I am convinced that denying our men and women in uniform the resources they need to do their jobs is not the right way to bring about the change we need--especially because President Bush has shown he is prepared to veto funding for the troops rather than agree to change course. 
   Achieving the needed change in course is the point of the second amendment--the policy amendment--being considered today. It includes a range of provisions, including one that requires redeployment of our troops in Iraq to begin within 30 days and that states as a goal the completion of this withdrawal within 18 months. 
   As I've said before, I don't think there is a sustainable role for large numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq. While this provision sends the right message--that our troops cannot remain in Iraq indefinitely--regrettably, it does not send it in the best way, because it will be supported almost exclusively by Democrats, and the president has already promised to veto any legislation that he says could tie his hands on Iraq. 
   What we need is consensus here at home on a path forward in Iraq. I still think the best way to achieve that consensus would be to focus on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. Those recommendations would be accomplished by legislation I introduced last year, which would support a course of escalating economic development, empowerment of local government, the provision of basic services, a `surge' in regional and international diplomatic efforts, and lightening the American footprint in Iraq. 
   Today's policy amendment does not include the specific provisions from my Iraq Study Group bill, but it does include other important provisions--prohibiting military units that are not determined to be ``mission capable'' from deploying; prohibiting deployment of U.S. forces that have not spent sufficient time at their home stations between tours of duty; prohibiting permanent bases in Iraq; requiring that reconstruction assistance to Iraq be provided in the form of a dollar-for-dollar match with the Iraqis; and cracking down on contractors engaged in fraud and profiteering, among other provisions. 
   These are things I think should be established policy, and I support them without hesitation. 
   Finally, the domestic and international assistance amendment provides increases for international food aid; rejects seven of the Administration's Medicaid regulations that will increase the cost of healthcare; extends unemployment benefits; provides increases in funding for the Bureau of Prisons; and provides enhanced education benefits for veterans, among other provisions. 
   I support these provisions because I think they are good for the country as a whole. 
   Some are especially important for Colorado--for example, we have a direct interest  in the funding increase staffing at federal prisons because our state has several such facilities and because recent events, including a riot that led to fatal shooting of inmates, have shown the need to increase those staffing levels. 
   And particularly important for America and the future of our society is the provision to improve veterans' education benefits to more closely resemble the GI Bill of Rights that made it possible for so many World War II veterans to go to college. The GI Bill of Rights helped make possible the postwar growth of the middle class that was one of the greatest achievements of the Greatest Generation. Some have complained about the cost of providing similar benefits to those who are serving today. But to put those costs--estimated at $52 billion over the next 10 years--into perspective, we should remember that so far our spending for military activities in Afghanistan and Iraq have exceeded $800 billion. 
   However, I do have some reservations about the way the amendment proposes to finance these benefits. To offset the cost, the amendment would impose a surtax of a half a percentage point on incomes of about $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for couples. It is estimated that this would increase federal revenues by some $54 billion over 10 years, while the educational benefits are estimated to cost $52 billion over that period. So the amount of the tax increase is not excessive, and it is appropriate to target it in a way to apply to those best able to afford it. But I think there is validity to the concern that some small businesses--those whose profits are not covered by corporate taxes but are claimed as the personal income of their owners--could be disproportionately affected. I think this aspect can and should be reviewed as the legislative process continues, to see if appropriate adjustments should be made. 
   Mr. Speaker, I voted against war in Iraq because, as I said then, the Bush Administration was rushing to war without necessary international support or a clear plan to prevent the chaos that would follow after Saddam Hussein was overthrown. I was concerned a prolonged conflict would devolve into civil war. Since U.S. troops entered Iraq more than 5 years ago, we have lost thousands of our brave servicemen and women, seen tens of thousands more wounded, and spent half a trillion dollars in taxpayer money. 
   Yet the President's mission is no clearer, he has still offered no exit strategy, our enemies in Afghanistan have regained their strength, and our armed forces have been stretched to the breaking point. 
   Only Democrats and Republicans working together can find the path out of Iraq. I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on further steps we can take to change our broader Iraq policy. But today, I will support these amendments providing funding for our troops in the field, assistance for Americans suffering through the current economic downturn and people around the world suffering from spiraling food costs, and important policy measures to take care of our troops and remind Iraq's government that U.S. troops will not remain in Iraq indefinitely.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, as a proud cosponsor of this bill--and of similar legislation since shortly after I was first elected to Congress--I strongly support its approval by the House. 
   The bill amends the Presidential Records Act of 1978 to establish a clear and equitable process enabling incumbent and former Presidents to review records prior to their public release under the act and determine whether to assert constitutional privilege claims against release of the records. 
   Importantly, it would revoke an Executive order issued by President George W. Bush in 2001 that overturned rules set by President Ronald Reagan. By that order, President Bush has sought to give himself and Vice President CHENEY--as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents--broad authority to withhold Presidential records or delay their release indefinitely. I do not think that order should be allowed to stand. 
   The Presidential Records Act was enacted in 1978 after the Watergate scandal and the subsequent resignation of President Nixon. It makes clear that Presidential records belong to the American people, not to the President, and required the Archivist of the United States--who was given custody of the records--to make the records available to the public as rapidly and completely as possible consistent with the provisions of the law. 
   The act first applied to the records of former President Ronald Reagan. In 1989, he issued an Executive order requiring the Archivist to give the incumbent and former Presidents 30 days notice before releasing Presidential records, with the records to be released after that unless the incumbent or former President claimed executive privilege, or unless the incumbent President instructed the Archivist to extend the period indefinitely. If the incumbent President decided to invoke executive privilege, the Archivist would withhold the records unless directed to release them by a final court order. If the incumbent President decided not to support a former President's claim of privilege, the Archivist would decide whether or not to honor the claim. 
   Before he left office, President Reagan used his authority under the act to restrict access to some of his records for 12 years, a period that expired in January 2001. 
   In February 2001, the Archivist provided the required 30-day notice of his intent to release about 68,000 pages of former President Reagan's records. In March, June, and August of 2001, the counsel to President Bush instructed the Archivist to extend the time for claiming executive privilege. And then, in November 2001, President Bush issued a new Executive order extending the review period for former Presidents to 90 days and allowing a former President to extend it indefinitely. In addition, that order allows an 
   unlimited review period for the current President and requires the Archives to honor the assertions of executive privilege made by either the incumbent or a former President--even if an incumbent President disagrees with the former President's claim. And, while the Reagan order said records were to be released on a schedule unless action occurred, the Bush Executive order says records will be released only after actions by the former and current Presidents have occurred--so, secrecy, not disclosure, is the rule. Also, the Bush Executive order allows designees of a former President to assert privilege claims after that President's death and authorizes former vice Presidents to assert executive privilege claims over their records. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we think what difference the release of the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon tapes has made in our understanding of the decision-making on Vietnam we can see how much could be lost if representatives of the Reagan, Clinton, and current Bush administrations in the future can hold back any and all documents related to Iran-contra, the first gulf war, the way the Clinton administration responded to intelligence about a potential Al Qaeda attack, or the current administration's decisions about Iraq. 
   It is understandable that every President and his or her heirs wants to put the best possible face on his administration, but an edited and airbrushed version of history is not something that will serve our long-term national interest. 
   H.R. 1255 would nullify Executive Order 13233 and establish procedures to ensure the timely release of Presidential records. 
   It requires the Archivist to give advance notice to former and incumbent Presidents before records are released so they can review the records and decide whether to claim privilege and provides for withholding of material for which the incumbent President claims privilege. The bill also clarifies that the incumbent and former Presidents must make privilege claims personally and that a right to claim executive privilege cannot be bequeathed to assistants, relatives, or descendants. And the bill eliminates executive privilege claims for vice Presidents, restoring the long-standing doctrine that the right to executive privilege over Presidential records is held only by Presidents. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a fair, balanced, and essential bill. I strongly urge its approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, which will increase the transparency and accountability of the Federal Government by making a number of long-overdue revisions to the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. 
   The bill will reemphasize that disclosure is to be the rule, secrecy the exception. It will help people seeking documents to get timely responses, and improve transparency in agency compliance. It will reduce the need for people seeking documents to go to court, and provide accountability for agency decisions on whether to release requested information. 
   Mr. Speaker, the enactment of FOIA in 1966 was a watershed. It established as fundamental policy the principle that information within the government's control should be available and established a presumptive right for the public to obtain identifiable, existing records of Federal agencies. Anyone can use FOIA to request access to Government information. Requesters do not have to show a need or reason for seeking information, and the burden of proof for withholding requested material rests with the department or agency that seeks to deny the request. Agencies may deny access only to records, or portions of records, that fall within certain specific categories. 
   FOIA has been used effectively by journalists, public interest organizations, corporations, and individuals to access Government information. But the process could be better--because of delays and backlogs, requesters often have found it hard to learn about the status of their requests, and a recent Supreme Court decision has hampered requesters' ability to litigate their claims. 
   H.R. 1309 would address these and other concerns about the implementation of FOIA. It is a modest measure, but an important one that deserves the approval of the House. 
   That's especially true because, as the Rocky Mountain News noted in a recent editorial, ``The Bush administration may have been the most openly contemptuous of FOIA's mission since the act first passed. ..... President Bush will leave office in 2009, but it's not enough to trust that future administrations will abide by the promise of openness that FOIA represents. The law needs specific measures to ensure accountability, and the amendments within H.R. 1309 mark a large stride forward.'' 
   For the information of our colleagues, I attach the complete text of that editorial:

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (HONORING ASTRONAUT WALTER MARTY SCHIRRA AND EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES ON HIS PASSING -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life of one of our great space pioneers, Walter M. ``Wally'' Schirra and to speak in support of H. Res. 446, a resolution to recognize his many accomplishments and honor his memory. 
   Wally Schirra was one of the original seven Mercury Astronauts and the only astronaut to fly in all three of the earliest manned space programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. 
   He was known for being an exact and precise pilot, and this aviation excellence speaks for itself as Capt. Schirra flew 90 combat missions while serving in the Navy during the Korean War. Later, during his Gemini 6 mission as a NASA astronaut, Schirra conducted the first rendezvous of manned spacecraft in orbit, considered one of the most challenging tasks in space flight at the time. 
   Capt. Schirra was a great astronaut and a great American. What many of my colleagues may not realize is that Wally Schirra became an active businessman and citizen in Colorado after retiring from the space program. 
   In the decade after he retired from NASA's Astronaut Corps, he moved to Denver where he lived a life as a successful businessman and an active environmentalist. When he first came to Colorado, he became the president of an investment company. Several years after that, he started an environmental management firm that concentrated their efforts towards developing solutions for environmental problems faced by the government and private industry. 
   In addition to being an advisor to Colorado State University, Capt. Schirra was also an avid outdoors man, as evidenced by his tenure as a trustee of the Colorado Outward Bound School. 
   Later in his life, while he continued to be busy in civic life, he played an active role in Colorado politics and served as Colorado's honorary chairman for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign. 
   I and my fellow Coloradans will miss him, and I urge my colleagues to honor his memory by passing H. Res. 446.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this Defense Supplemental appropriations bill. 
   Whatever some may say, I think it would be grossly irresponsible to vote against it. That would be to vote against providing America's men and women in uniform with the equipment and resources they need and against providing them the best health care they may require when they come home. 
   I understand why some are urging a vote against the bill. Many Americans are frustrated and angry because we are four years into a war the Bush Administration assured us would be short and decisive. The Administration's misjudgments, lack of planning and poor leadership have made a bad situation worse. So there are many who do not trust the Bush Administration to find a way to end this war, and who believe Congress should simply act to cut off additional funds. 
   But whatever may be said about the wisdom of invading Iraq four years ago--and I am one who believed it was a mistake to do so--the fact is that we are still deeply engaged in Iraq. We also must finish the job of securing Afghanistan and defeating the Taliban and al-Qaeda. So long as our troops are in the field, we must provide them what they need even as we move to change the mistaken policies of the Administration in Iraq. 
   This bill begins that change. It includes important language to hold the president accountable to the benchmarks set by his own administration and the Iraqi government. 
   Those benchmarks were outlined in January, when President Bush announced that the Iraqi government had agreed to pursue all extremists, Shiite and Sunni alike; to deliver Iraqi Security Forces to Baghdad to join in the ``surge''; and to establish a strong militia disarmament program. President Bush also announced that Prime Minister Maliki and his government agreed to pursue reconciliation initiatives, including enactment of a hydro-carbon law; conducting of provincial and local elections; reform of current laws governing the de-Baathification process; amendment of the Constitution of Iraq; and allocation of Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects. 
   By holding the president and the Iraqi government accountable for achieving these benchmarks, this bill will provide General Petraeus and the Administration with the leverage necessary to help the Iraqi government forge a political solution. And we all know that it will take a political solution--not a military one--to end this war. 
   The bill is an important step toward what I think must be our goal--a responsible end to the war in Iraq, based on a strategy of phased withdrawal of troops, accelerated diplomacy and redeployment that is based on Iraqi stability and not arbitrary deadlines. 
   It is true that this legislation includes a date certain for withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq. I do not believe this language is wise and were it up to me, this provision would not be included in the bill. As a matter of national security policy, we should steer clear of arbitrary public deadlines and focus instead on realistic goals. Our military needs flexibility to be able to link movements of U.S. troops to the realities of the situation on the ground. 
   The deadline established in this bill--August of 2008--is far enough away that I believe we may be able to revisit it if need be, and while I find its inclusion troubling, I do not believe in letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. And the bill's language does give the president flexibility to protect U.S. interests, since it allows sufficient troops to remain to protect U.S. military and civilians in Iraq, conduct counterterrorism operations, and train Iraqi Security Forces. 
   The bill also protects our troops by limiting deployment schedules and setting minimum readiness standards--based on current Defense Department standards--for U.S. troops deploying to the region. The president could  waive these requirements but only by certifying in writing to Congress that waiving them would be in the interest of national security. 
   The bill also includes many provisions important to our troops, such as funds for military personnel for imminent danger pay, family separation allowances, and basic allowances for housing; funds for recruiting and retention in the Army Reserve and National Guard; and funds to develop countermeasures to prevent attacks from improvised explosive devices. The bill recommends the creation of a new Strategic Readiness Reserve fund, and provides $2.5 billion for the program, which is intended to improve readiness, training and equipping of U.S. forces not already deployed. 
   Given the recent revelations about problems with the defense health system at Walter Reed and other facilities across the system, I am very pleased that the bill provides $2.8 billion for military health care costs and $1.7 billion for initiatives to address the health care needs of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, particularly those suffering from traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder. Funding is also included to address facility deficiencies so the Department of Veterans Affairs does not have to defer facility maintenance and upkeep in order to provide quality health care services. 
   The bill also provides $52.5 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and funds the $5.9 billion request for the Afghan Security Forces and the $3.8 billion request for Iraq Security Forces. 
   And the bill includes $3.1 billion to fully fund the Pentagon's FY07 request for the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's recommendations, which is vitally important for Ft. Carson as it prepares to expand and for other military installations in Colorado. 
   On the non-military side, the bill includes critically important funding for farmers and ranchers in southeastern Colorado who were recently hit hard by winter storms. Thousands of cattle were killed in storms worse than the October 1997 storm that killed approximately 30,000 cattle and cost farmers and ranchers an estimated $28 million. The struggles that family agriculture producers and small counties face are significant and are having a negative impact on the livelihood of hundreds of farmers and 
   ranchers and their communities. So I am pleased that the Colorado delegation was successful in persuading the House leadership to include financial assistance for farmers and ranchers, including for those affected by Colorado's recent blizzards, and I am hopeful that the funding will be included in the final conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have entered the 5th year of the war in Iraq. Already, more than 3,200 of our men and women in uniform have made the ultimate sacrifice in the performance of their duty. More than 24,000 others have been wounded. The Iraqi death toll is at least 60,000, with more than 650,000 other Iraqis displaced and at least one million who have fled to Syria and Jordan and other countries. 
   Even these heavy costs are not the whole story, because nation-building in Iraq has degraded our ability to counter other threats to our national security around the globe. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am all too aware of the pressures on our active duty and National Guard and reserve soldiers, including a lack of equipment and training, multiple or extended deployments, and limited time at home between deployments. To be successful, U.S. forces must be trained, equipped, and ready to quickly deploy worldwide. Shortfalls in personnel, equipment, or training increase the risk to our troops and to their mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us who voted against authorizing the President to rush to war in Iraq were worried that while it would be easy to eliminate the Saddam Hussein regime, the aftermath would be neither easy nor quick. Sadly, our fears have proven to be justified. And now, as the Pentagon has finally admitted in its most recent quarterly report, the situation in Iraq is ``properly descriptive of a civil war.'' 
   Insisting on keeping our troops in the middle of that kind of internecine war is not a recipe for victory; it is only a prescription for quagmire. And as a new Foreign Relations Council report notes, we bear responsibility for developments within Iraq, but are increasingly without the ability to shape those developments in a positive direction. 
   We need to be scaling back our military mission in Iraq. We need to make the U.S. military footprint lighter--not in order to hasten defeat or failure in Iraq, but to salvage a critical measure of security and stability in a region of the world that we can ill afford to abandon. 
   But as we do so, we must work to avoid a collapse in the region--not only because we have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq, but also because our national security has been so badly compromised by the Bush administration's failures there. The President's decision to take the nation to war has made our country less safe. We need to change course and chart a path that enhances our national security and sets the right priorities for the war on terrorism and struggle against extremists. 
   This bill begins to chart this path, and I will support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, and I am compelled to respond to some of the criticisms of the Members of the other party about the intent of this legislation. 
   It is clear that the oil and gas industry is doing quite well. There are a number of tax breaks, tax credits, tax deductions, and encouragements that are already in place. This bill says the short-term benefits that were extended to the oil and gas community are overridden, and that the royalty problems that we have had are going to be revised and solved so that taxpayers get a fair return on their investments. After all, we own these assets as the people of this country. 
   This starts us finally on the right path by creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. It says we will set aside $14 billion to invest in clean energy technologies. And as the Chair of the bipartisan Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I can tell you that these are crucial technologies not only to protect our environment but to ensure job creation and, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, to ensure our national security. 
   So I want to stand in strong support of this legislation. We ought to pass it. The country is for it, and Democrats and Republicans are for it.  
   I want to echo the views of many of my colleagues who have talked about the importance of diversifying and balancing our energy portfolio and moving toward a clean energy regime. We all know that energy security and national security go hand in hand, and right now we don't enjoy either. That's why--as part of the 100 Hours agenda--we are passing this important legislation. We need a national effort to address our reliance on foreign energy sources. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 6. H.R. 6 starts us finally on the right path by creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve. The CLEAN Energy Act would set aside roughly $14,000,000,000 to invest in clean renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, promote new energy technologies, and improve energy efficiency. 
   As co-chair of the bi-partisan Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Caucus, I can tell you that renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies can increase our energy security AND allow us to think anew about our energy future. 
   This isn't just about doing right by the environment--this is also about creating jobs. The U.S. currently leads the world technology in developing advanced energy technologies. But we won't hold onto the lead for long unless U.S. government policies begin to favor their development more than they do now. With the world market for new energy technologies projected to be in the trillions of dollars in twenty years, we would be foolish to forgo this opportunity. 
   And it is an opportunity--for new jobs, for rural development, for a cleaner environment, for national security. States and localities have realize this, and with federal action at a standstill, many of them--like my state of Colorado--have already acted on renewable portfolio standards and other forward-looking policies. Now Congress is in a position to follow their lead. 
   We will use this strategic fund to extend the renewable energy production tax credit to give the market the assurance it needs to respond. We can extend energy efficiency tax incentives for buildings. equipment, and appliances, We can invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency research programs at the Department of Energy, and make sure that the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has enough money and enough staff to do its important work. It is these programs that can drive down costs, make commercialization of new technologies possible, and help retain America's leadership role in these technologies. 
   The best thing about investing in clean energy is that Americans support it. This Administration supports it. Democrats and Republicans alike support it. It is the right thing to do. 
   The CLEAN Energy Act sets our priorities straight, and for that reason, Mr. Speaker, I will support it wholeheartedly.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this legislation, though I am deeply disappointed that it does not include several key provisions from the bill that the House passed earlier this month. 
   The earlier version was an excellent energy bill that combined provisions developed by several different House Committees, as well as provisions from a Senate-passed bill, designed to start putting our country on a path toward energy independence, increased national security and economic growth, and addressing global warming. 
   The Senate lacked the votes to even consider that energy bill, so it was then stripped of the Renewable Electricity Standard that I championed in the House along with Representatives TOM UDALL and TODD PLATTS. 
   The House's adoption of that amendment earlier this year, and its retention in the most recent House-passed version, was a high point for those of us working for positive change that will benefit rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security. 
   But, to make matters even worse, even after that provision was dropped, for lack of just one more vote in the Senate, what remained of the House bill had to be further deformed. 
   So, for lack of just one more Senate vote, the bill we are considering today does not extend important tax credits for renewable energy production, such as the extension of the Production Tax Credit for solar and wind energy and other renewable technologies. The PTC in particular has been critical in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry, and I will work to win an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008. 
   And dropped with the tax credits were the House-passed provisions dealing with the Secure Rural Schools and Payments-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) program. Both would have been good for the Nation and particularly for Colorado because so many of our counties include large Federal land areas and therefore would have benefited directly from that part of the House-passed bill. 
   I strongly supported all those provisions, and I intend to continue working to win their enactment either on their own or as part of some other measure. 
   I regret that for the time being Congress is not able to do all that should be done to move us toward greater energy independence, which means greater national security, in ways that will lower energy costs, help our economy, and reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. 
   Nonetheless, with all its shortcomings, the bill the Senate has sent us will accomplish some worthwhile things and deserves to be passed. 
   Notably, it includes the first revision in decades of the fuel-consumption standards for automobiles. This step is long overdue and will result in increasing the efficiency of all vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. 
   I am also glad to note that it retains a provision on carbon capture and storage based upon a bill that I authored (H.R. 1933). Coal and other fossil fuels have been and will continue to be an important energy source for our country, but coal-burning power plants are also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The carbon capture and storage research, development, and demonstration program authorized in this bill will help us tackle this challenge while keeping our economy healthy and strong. It will authorize the Department of Energy to conduct demonstration projects for both carbon dioxide capture and carbon dioxide injection and storage. Not only will this research program help us develop this technology and make it more-economical, but it will also help us understand the implications of storing large amounts of carbon dioxide underground. 
   In addition, this bill will encourage manufacturers to build more efficient appliances, strengthen the energy efficiency of the Federal Government, and help businesses create energy-efficient workplaces. 
   And it will increase the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), which sets annual requirements for the amount of renewable fuels produced and used in motor vehicles. The new RFS has specific requirements for the use of biodiesel and cellulosic sources to ensure that these ethanol sources also advance along with corn-based ethanol. Furthermore, the bill includes critical environmental safeguards to ensure that the growth of homegrown fuels helps to reduce carbon emissions. 
   Additionally, the bill will create an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train Americans for good ``green'' jobs--such as in solar panel manufacturing and green building construction--that  will be created by new renewable-energy and energy-efficiency initiatives. This will provide training opportunities to our veterans, to those displaced by national energy and environmental policy and economic globalization, to individuals seeking pathways out of poverty, to young people at risk and to workers already in the energy field who need to update their skills. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed with this legislation because it came so close to being so much better. But, the bottom line is that even so it is much needed and long overdue and deserves to pass today so it can go to the president to be signed into law. I urge its approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill. 
   In recent days, discussion of the bill has included statements--by some supporters and some opponents alike--that I found exaggerated in their descriptions of the likely effect of its enactment. I regret that, and think it would be better to avoid the ``use it or lose it'' rhetoric that oversimplifies the issue and fails to reflect the reality that oil and gas exploration is a complicated commercial and scientific enterprise involving efforts not easily fitting within strict regulatory timelines. 
   But while the bill may not be as far-reaching as some have claimed, I think it is a reasonable response to current conditions and should be passed. 
   In essence, the bill would bar the current holders of Federal mineral leases--whether for onshore or offshore areas--from obtaining additional leases unless they are able to show that they are ``diligently developing'' the leases they already hold. The Secretary of the Interior would be responsible for spelling out in regulations exactly what would be needed to show such ``due diligence.'' 
   Current Interior Department regulations include provisions addressing due diligence requirements, so this is not a new concept. But I think giving it greater emphasis is appropriate in view of the continuing importance of oil even as we work to increase the availability and use of alternative energy sources. 
   More useful in terms of energy policy, this bill will reinforce the provisions of current law that aim to prevent hoarding of leases, and by providing an incentive for relinquishment of some leases may increase the opportunity for others to seek and obtain the right to explore for and perhaps produce oil or gas from those lands. 
   This approach is similar to that taken when Congress amended the coal-leasing laws by passing the Coal Leasing Act Amendments of 1976 over President Ford's veto. That 1976 legislation provided for a due-diligence requirement as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the laws governing leasing and development of federally owned coal resources--a provision that some analysts have said had the most immediate practical effect of any of the legislation's various provisions. 
   As a result, for several decades the holders of Federal coal leases have been required by law to diligently develop their leases, which has aided in the orderly and efficient development of the Nation's coal. I think a similar reinforcement of existing law for leasing of other Federal energy resources makes sense. 
   This bill alone is certainly not all that needs to be done to improve our energy policies. But I think it can make at least a modest contribution to achieving that, and so I will support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I voted against this bailout package on Monday, because I took a hard look at it through the eyes of Coloradans, and I didn't see what they needed to see. 
   What I saw was a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street banks that didn't do enough to reassure taxpayers that they'd get their money back, didn't have a sure process for holding CEOs accountable and limiting taxpayer-funded golden parachutes, and didn't address the mortgage crisis that is at the root of our economic problems and is forcing hard-working Coloradans out of their homes. 
   Just as important, what I saw was a ``rescue'' for Wall Street that did nothing to begin fixing the broken financial system that led us to this crisis. 
   As I look at the legislation we're being asked to vote on today, I'm deeply disappointed to say that none of that has changed. 
   Instead, the Senate has sent us a bill that adds a single improvement to the package the House rejected, plus hundreds of pages of ``sweeteners'' intended to win over those of us who opposed it the first time. Many of those ``sweeteners'' are things I support--the people of Colorado know I have worked long and hard for middle-class tax breaks and have spent my entire career as a champion for investment in the new energy economy. 
   But no amount of ``sweetener'' changes the fact that Americans deserve a better solution to our economic crisis than the one we've already rejected. 
   I have no interest in making the perfect the enemy of the good. Anyone who knows my work in Congress knows that I am not a ``my-way-or-the-highway'' legislator. Because of the greed and lack of oversight on Wall Street, we face an unquestionably grave economic situation that requires Congress to act. But a better solution is still within our reach--one that takes immediate action to get our economy back on stable footing while providing the protection, oversight, and fundamental reforms American families deserve. 
   I am still guided by the words of the legendary basketball coach John Wooden, who told his players, ``Boys, be quick. But don't hurry.'' 
   My hope was that after the House rejected Monday's bailout package, we in Congress would be quick to work together, improve the  legislation, and bring forward a revised version that would deserve and obtain broad support in Colorado and across the country. We had that opportunity until the Senate acted to re-package the old bailout bill in new clothing. We owe the taxpayers more than to hurry a deeply flawed package out the door at such tremendous cost to them. 
   I believe we could have added provisions that (1) provided independent oversight of the Treasury's program, (2) strengthened the equity position of taxpayers in purchasing mortgage-backed assets, (3) required the government to help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, and (4) insured that taxpayers will not be on the hook for irresponsible compensation packages for CEOs. 
   This bill claims to address these problems, but the exceptions in this bill swallow the rule. In short, the bill doesn't do what it claims to do. 
   On Tuesday, stronger provisions were within our reach and we should have worked to secure them 
   I hope--for the sake of all those people who have worked hard and played by the rules, only to see their retirement whittled away or their homes' values plummet--that this package does what its supporters promise us it will. 
   But in the end, my responsibility is to Colorado families, and I continue to believe as I did on Monday, that I cannot ask them to foot the bill for a bailout that costs so much, with so little accountability, so little reform, and so little protection for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. This bill moves forward the important principles that mental health deserves fair and equal recognition in our health care financing system and that individuals afflicted with mental health disorders deserve no less a chance at recovery than those afflicted with physical disorders. 
   These principles do not exist for their own sake, and there are plenty of practical reasons that mental health coverage should be equal to that of other types of health coverage. For example, the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that employers lose as much as $31 billion per year in productivity costs associated with having depressed workers. The story is much the same for alcohol-related illnesses and certainly for suicide. Even if these economic realities did not exist, there remains no scientific justification for treating mental health as separate and inferior to physical health. 
   Many attribute the historical disparities between the treatment of mental health and physical health to stigmas about the realness of mental health disorders and the credibility of those who claim to have them. If this is true, surely our scientific and health care communities have moved us beyond those stigmas and shown that mental health not only exists, but is as important to one's day to day life as any physical condition. It is time that our laws and our health care financing system caught up to our scientific knowledge in this important respect. 
   H.R. 1424 will move us in that direction. If passed, it will bring this aspect of our private health insurance system in line with what has worked for Medicare, Medicaid, the Veterans Administration, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--the very same health program available to members of Congress. This is not a mandate. Employer-based health care plans will not be required to offer mental health benefits, but those group plans with 51 or more employees who do offer mental health benefits will be required to provide coverage that is no less substantial than the coverage provided for physical health. This is sound policy, and ensures that those afflicted with mental health disorders can afford the care they need to lead productive, happy, healthy lives. 
   I am aware that there are some differences between this bill and the similar bill that passed the Senate last year. Some opponents of the House version, I think, have legitimate concerns about the effects of basing coverage on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The instances in which plans and states have adhered to the DSM-IV have not yielded the problems with overuse and treatment for the ``worried well'' that opponents predict, but the possibility that these problems could occur, I think, is strong enough that these differences should be addressed before the bill becomes law. I am hopeful that ongoing discussions between the House and the Senate will produce a bill that addresses these concerns and finds a suitable compromise. 
   I will vote for this bill because I believe that moving it forward in the legislative process is one more important step toward the final goal of instituting equity between physical and mental health coverage, a goal I hope can be achieved this year.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. 
   Passage of this amendment will not stop the proposed expansion of the Army's Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado, but it will delay consideration of the Army's plans until two very important questions can be answered: (1) What are the Army's real training needs, and (2) will the Army assure Coloradans that it will not resort to condemnation to acquire land? 
   Before giving the Army money to take the first steps toward expanding these training grounds, we should be convinced that there is a real military need for the Army to acquire an additional 418,000 acres. I have kept an open mind on this question and that that is why, along with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Readiness Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, I have asked the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on whether this expansion is the right way to meet the Army's training requirements and what other alternatives the Army should consider. 
   More important, it is abundantly clear to me that there is no support--even among proponents of an expansion--for the Army's use of eminent domain to acquire any land. But so far, the Army has been reluctant to give the State of Colorado and the landowners in the area a commitment that it will not resort to condemnation. For me, that commitment is essential, and unless and until the Army makes clear it will not use condemnation, I believe Congress should not allow the expansion process to go forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY IN SOUTHERN COLORADO REGION -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation to establish a national cemetery for veterans in southern Colorado, and I congratulate my colleague JOHN SALAZAR for his work on this bill. 
   I also want to recognize the work of my former colleague Joel Hefley and my current colleague DOUG LAMBORN on this issue. Establishing a national veterans cemetery in southern Colorado has been and continues to be a goal shared by the entire Colorado delegation. 
   For over 8 years, it has also been a goal of the Pikes Peak Veterans Cemetery Committee. And it has been a goal of the Department of Colorado Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Colorado chapters of the American Legion, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Association for Service Disabled Veterans. So many people have worked tirelessly to build support for this cemetery, and I hope they are pleased today that we are now one step closer to making it a reality. 
   This is a particularly timely bill to consider today, as we approach another Memorial Day and as we continue to send our troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. We remember the sacrifices that our veterans have made and the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform continue to make today to protect our freedom. 
   And at a time when our country is divided over the war in Iraq, it's even more important that we honor the service of those who have given their lives for this country and of the many veterans still among us. 
   Of course, it isn't enough just to remember--we must provide our troops and veterans with the care and support they have been promised. And we must provide them with a resting place within or as close as possible to their own communities. 
   With a growing military retiree and veterans population in southern Colorado and particularly El Paso County--and with Denver's Fort Logan cemetery rapidly filling up its burial spaces--it makes sense to provide for the future even as we ensure that southern Colorado's veterans receive the recognition they deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, for eight years, the Bush administration and its allies in Congress have allowed Wall Street to gamble with America's economy, and the results have been devastating for Main Street. The Administration consistently ignored the experts and failed to adequately oversee America's financial markets. Administration officials were warned that Wall Street's risky investments, combined with the mortgage industry's irresponsible practices, could produce a perfect storm that would threaten Americans' homes, jobs and life savings. Yet they did nothing. 
   When Wall Street's dangerous behavior began to undermine America's economy, the Bush Administration proposed a bailout that would have given the Treasury unprecedented power to spend taxpayer money without adequate oversight or an actual plan for fixing the systemic problems that led America to this crisis. At the time, I spoke out against the Bush bailout and called for a better proposal, one that would protect taxpayers, help homeowners and benefit Main Street, not just Wall Street. More importantly, I demanded that any plan to shore up America's financial markets include reasonable rules to ensure that Wall Street does not continue to gamble with our future. 
   We could have, and we should have, taken the time to do this right. Four hundred of the country's top economists, including three Nobel laureates, asked Congress to take more time to improve this proposal. With a proposal this far-reaching and complex, we had a responsibility to produce the best possible piece of legislation. The bill we are voting on today falls short. Instead of reforming Wall Street, we are using taxpayer dollars to insulate financial firms from the consequences of their own actions. The American taxpayer is on the hook for $700 billion to cover Wall Street's mistakes, and that is not right. Even worse, Wall Street is not being forced to change its behavior. This can only encourage more irresponsibility. 
   At the same time, the provisions that limit executive compensation in this bill are weak, meaning that corporate executives who ran their companies into the ground could still walk away with millions in taxpayer-funded compensation in the forms of golden parachutes or other lavish benefits packages. Again, this sends exactly the wrong message to Wall Street. This legislation may still use taxpayer dollars to reward executives who have failed their companies and subsequently hurt the American economy. 
   In addition, at a time when America's middle class is severely stretched to make ends meet, this $700 billion bailout not only seeks to rescue our 
   taxpayer dollars to bail out foreign comapnies. We must protect American taxpayers before we seek to rescue foreign companies while their governments do nothing. 
   Finally, this legislation does too little to help responsible homeowners. As a result, tens of thousands of families could lose their homes. More importantly, families who had nothing to do with failed mortgages could lose billions in assets as foreclosures continue to drive down property values. 
   I believe strongly that Washington must act to protect Main Street from the crisis on Wall Street. I supported an economic stimulus plan that puts working families before corporate CEOs by creating jobs, protecting children's access to healthcare and ensuring that struggling families do not go hungry. I have consistently supported strong action to protect middle class New Mexicans. But I could not vote to give Wall Street $700 billion of taxpayer money without solving the underlying problems with our economy. 
   I will continue working with my colleagues to reform America's financial markets, so Wall Street is not allowed to make the same mistakes over and over again. I will also continue fighting to support middle class New Mexico families that find themselves struggling in an economy devastated by the irresponsible acts of others. They are the true victims of the Bush administration's malign neglect of our economy. We must do what's right for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I support this budget resolution because it will begin the process of changing our budgetary course. 
   For 6 years, the Administration and the Republican leadership insisted on speeding ahead with misguided fiscal and economic policies. Ignoring all warning lights, they plowed ahead, taking us from projections of surpluses to the reality budgets deep in deficit and heaping higher the mountain of debt that our children will have to repay. 
   Many of us said it was urgent to stop persisting in that error and voted for alternatives, including those proposed by the Blue Dog Caucus. 
   But year after year our Republican colleagues insisted on taking their marching orders from the White House, moving in lockstep to endorse the Bush Administration's insistence that its economic and fiscal policies must continue without change. 
   I admired their discipline, but I could not support their insistence on driving us deeper into the swamp of fiscal irresponsibility that has left a debt burden of $30,951 for a typical middle-income family of four in Colorado. 
   And now, in this new Congress under new management, by passing this budget resolution we can begin to undo the damage they have done. 
   The resolution is better in its fiscal responsibility and in its priorities. 
   It follows the tough ``pay as you go'' budget rules to begin to reverse the budget deficits and to put us onto the path to a balanced budget. And under this plan, by 2012, domestic discretionary funding would fall to the lowest level, as a share of the economy, in at least a half century while spending as a percentage of GDP will be lower in 2012 than it has been in any budget adopted under President Bush--1 percent lower than it will be this year and lower than it has been in any year since 2001. 
   At the same time it provides for continuing middle-class tax cuts and reform of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to protect middle-income families from a tax increase by default. This is important because while in 2004 only 32,000 Colorado families were subject to the AMT, if nothing is done, this year that number will rise to 234,000 families in Colorado and hundreds of thousands more in other States. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am particularly glad to note that the budget resolution is also realistic and responsible about the need to maintain our national defense and honor our promises to our troops and veterans. 
   It provides for investing $507 billion for national defense and another $145 billion for overseas deployment and other activities while reordering defense priorities in order to make sufficient funds available for nuclear non-proliferation programs, military health care, and military pay raises and benefits. 
   I think ensuring the people who protect our country are provided for is a significant part of meeting our national defense requirements. So, I'm pleased that the resolution rejects increases in TRICARE fees for military personnel under age 65. 
   And the budget committee worked with the chairman of our committee, Representative SKELTON, to assure that the resolution will allow Congress to support the implementation of recommendations of the Commission appointed to review conditions at Walter Reed and other military health facilities--a provision that is so important for our wounded warriors. 
   The resolution provides for a much-needed increase in veterans' programs--for veterans health care, no less than $3.5 billion more this year (and $32 billion over the next 5 years) than the President's budget--to provide health care for new veterans, repair VA health care facilities, make needed investments in veterans' mental health care and traumatic brain injury, and speed up and improve the accuracy of disability claims processing. 
   This is a priority for me, because it will help ensure that the 427,957 veterans in Colorado receive care worthy of their sacrifice. It is also critical for the 17,419 Coloradans, who have served their country in Afghanistan and Iraq since September 2001, many of whom will need VA health care services. 
   The resolution also provides for increases homeland security and rejects the cuts to vital first responder and terrorism prevention programs that would happen if we adopted the President's budget for fiscal 2008. I support that because following the President's budget would mean reducing the State Homeland Security Grant Program--which awarded $88,508,658 to Colorado from 2003 to 2006--would be slashed by 52 percent and the Law Enforcement Terrorist Prevention Program (LETPP)--which awarded $22,392,512 to Colorado from 2004 to 2006--would be eliminated. 
   And the resolution provides for beginning to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations to make Colorado and our Nation more secure. 
   Similarly, the resolution recognizes the importance of research, development, and education in keeping our economy strong and our country secure. 
   It recognizes that scientific research provides the foundation for innovation and our ability to compete with other countries by setting us on a path toward doubling funding for  the National Science Foundation and research by other agencies while increasing collaborative research-purpose partnerships. 
   As a member of the Science and Technology Committee and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, I am particularly supportive of the resolution because it rejects the President's proposed cuts to aviation programs 
   within NASA in order to help ensure that such vital programs as development of the next-generation management system for air traffic can go forward. 
   Similarly, as one of the Chairs of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I welcome the resolution's declaration that increased research and development of renewable and alternative energy technologies ``needs to come soon and be substantial.'' I think that sets exactly the right priority. 
   And I similarly welcome the resolution's allowing for additional emphasis on science, technology, and mathematics (``STEM'') education by increasing funding for National Science Foundation programs that support training qualified teachers in these important areas. 
   The resolution recognizes the importance of investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency to improve our security by lessening our dependence on foreign oil as well as to reduce global warming and promote new technologies that can create American jobs. So, it creates a reserve fund that could target up to $14 billion over 10 years to invest in clean, renewable alternative energy and energy efficiency paid for by redirecting oil subsidies. 
   And it restores funding for environmental programs cut by the President's budget--including $3,162,000 in Clean Water revolving loan funds that help Colorado communities improve their wastewater treatment facilities. 
   As for education, the resolution allows for substantially more funding for helping Colorado's public elementary, middle and high schools educate the 768,600 children now enrolled--nearly $8 billion more in 2008 and 11 percent more over the next 5 years for education and training programs than requested by the President. 
   This means more resources to implement the No Child Left Behind Act, special education and Head Start. By contrast, if we followed the President's budget, 31,296 Colorado children would not receive promised help in reading and math and the Head Start program--which serves 9,820 Colorado children--would be cut by 1.5 percent below the 2007 level. 
   Small businesses are essential for Colorado's economy--and the resolution 
   rejects the President's proposal to cut the Small Business Administration by 26 percent from last year's request and 56 percent from 2000. It also recognizes the importance of job training for the kind of high-skilled workforce we need to keep America competitive--which is why it rejects the President's proposal to eliminate $54,403,000 in funding for job training and employment services in Colorado. 
   These investments to a growing economy for America's families are needed because, according to the Census Bureau, family income in Colorado has dropped by $4,041 since 2000, while health care and energy prices are climbing. But still more is needed. 
   So, I am glad that the resolution provides for increasing funding for State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--to help cover the 176,230 of Colorado's children do not have health insurance. And I am pleased that it also rejects the Administration's proposal to cut Medicare funding by $261,719,066 for Colorado hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health care providers--another misguided proposal that would make health care less accessible and affordable for many Coloradans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I can understand why the Bush Administration does not like this resolution. After all, it rejects the Administration's misguided priorities. But it's disappointing that so many of our Republican colleagues still are so willing to unquestioningly follow the president's lead. And, while I suppose it's to be expected, it's particularly unfortunate that they have decided to attack this budget resolution by resorting to recycling the old, tired--and false--claim that it is ``the largest tax increase in history.'' 
   The fact is that this is no tax increase in the resolution. It assumes the same level of revenues between now and 2012 period as projected by the Congressional Budget Office under its current-policy baseline, which essentially assumes no change in current laws governing taxes. 
   In other words, this resolution does not affect the top-heavy tax cuts the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership pushed through since 2001--they remain in place as they stand, which means they will not expire for 4 years. 
   I did not vote for all of those tax cuts, but I did support some that are most important for middle-income Coloradans. So, I am glad that the resolution provides for extensions of those in 2011, including an extension of the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent individual income tax bracket. 
   And when the rest of the tax cuts come up for reconsideration, Congress can and should consider whether to extend them, as they are now or in modified form. 
   I support that approach, which is quite different from the alternative approach taken by the Republican alternative, which insists on locking in all of the Bush tax cuts--the ones I did not support as well as those I did--and would put top priority on making them all permanent. 
   There are some things in the Republican alternative that I do support--including a constitutionally-sound line-item veto similar to my Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures (``SLICE'') legislation--but overall I think it is not a responsible approach and I cannot support it, just as I cannot support the other alternatives that go too far in the other direction by calling for large tax increases. 
   Unlike all those alternatives, the resolution developed by the Budget Committee is the best balanced in its combination of fiscal responsibility and refocusing priorities. I will support it and I urge its approval by the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I support this bill, but I think the Natural Resources Committee should consider whether additional legislation would be appropriate in order to improve the management of wild horses and burros on Federal lands. 
   The bill repeals a provision enacted in 2004 as part of an appropriations bill that itself repealed the prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros that had been the law since 1971. 
   The Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 established as national policy that wild free-roaming horses and burros were to be protected from capture, branding, harassment, and death and, among other things, it directed that ``no wild free-roaming horse or burros or its remains may be sold or transferred for consideration for processing into commercial products.'' 
   Practically since its enactment, the law's implementation has been problematic. In particular, the Bureau of Land Management--BLM--has been criticized by the Government Accountability Office and the Interior Department's Inspector General for the way it has responded to the challenge. 
   Under the act, the agencies inventory horse and burro populations on Federal land to determine ``appropriate management levels.'' They are authorized to remove animals determined to be exceeding the range's carrying capacity so as to restore a natural ecological balance and protect the range from deterioration. 
   Toward that end, the law authorizes removed animals to be offered for private adoption. New owners can receive title after a 1-year wait, with certification of proper care during that time. An individual may receive title to no more than four animals per year. 
   The law says that if adoption demand is insufficient, the remaining healthy animals are to be destroyed--but that authority has not been used for more than 20 years, and BLM was prohibited from doing so by funding limitations included in the appropriations act from 1988 through 2004. 
   The latest numbers I have seen indicated that there currently are an estimated 28,500 wild horses and burros on BLM's 199 herd management areas. I understand this is the lowest level since the early 1970s and is the closest to what BLM considers to be the appropriate management level since that time--but evidently BLM expects the population to increase to about 34,000 in this fiscal year while a reduced emphasis on removal, as proposed in the President's budget request for fiscal 2008, could result in a considerable increase in the number of wild horses and burros on BLM-managed lands. My understanding is that as of the end of fiscal year 2006 there were another 3,180 wild horses and burros on 37 ``territories'' managed by the Forest Service. 
   Removals have long been controversial. Some think they are not appropriate, while others are of the opinion that reduction of herds protects range resources and balances wild horse and burro levels with wildlife and domestic livestock. BLM says it bases decisions about appropriate management levels on population censuses and range monitoring, taking into account natural resources, such as wildlife and vegetation, and land uses, including grazing. 
   My understanding is that between fiscal 1972 and fiscal 2006, 268,709 horses and burros were removed, of which 216,942 were adopted, while others died of natural causes, were sent to holding facilities, or were sold. Because more animals have been removed than have been adopted, large numbers of animals are being held in facilities. 
   This was the context in which Congress enacted the requirement for sale of unadopted  animals that this bill would repeal. However, in April 2005, BLM temporarily suspended sale and delivery of wild horses and burros due to concerns about the slaughter of some animals. The agency did not sell animals directly for slaughter, and was requiring purchasers to give written affirmation of an intent to provide humane care. Nevertheless, 41 sold animals were resold or traded and then sent to slaughterhouses. Another 52 animals were sold to slaughterhouses, but Ford Motor Co. committed to purchasing them. In May 2005, BLM resumed sales after revising its bill of sale and pre-sale negotiation procedures. 
   I support this bill because the provision it would repeal was inserted without the benefit of any hearings or public notice and without an opportunity for the Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction, to consider possible alternative approaches. 
   For the same reason, when the House considered the fiscal 2006 Interior appropriations bill, I supported the Rahall amendment that prohibited the use of funds for the sale or slaughter of wild free-roaming horses and burros--an amendment that the House again included in the fiscal 2007 Interior Appropriations bill by voice vote. 
   After passage of this bill, the appropriate next step will be for our committee to review the status of the wild horse and burro program to see whether there is a need for more carefully considered changes in the law.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (GERALD R. FORD, JR. POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 49, legislation to name the postal facility in Vail, CO, after our Nation's 39th President, Gerald R. Ford, Jr. 
   I believe this bill is fitting as another means of honoring the legacy of President Ford, in large part because of his special connection to Colorado and the Vail Valley. I am pleased by the support it has received; all members of the Colorado delegation have co-sponsored the legislation. 
   In 1968 then-Congressman Ford and wife, Betty, first came to Colorado with their children to celebrate Christmas and to ski in the mountains at Vail. Like many other visitors, President Ford was inspired by the beauty of the area and found a connection to the land and to the surrounding community. 
   The Fords later owned a home and continued to vacation in Vail. When he became President, his vacations in Colorado helped introduce the world to the Town of Vail, and in fact, the family home was dubbed ``the Western White House.'' 
   Vail residents knew President Ford and his family as neighbors and friends and are proud of their long association with them. President Ford served on the board of directors of the Vail Valley Foundation. Vail also serves as the home of the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens and the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater. President Ford was beloved in Vail, where he was known to be a good neighbor, an avid golfer and a lover of the outdoors. 
   President Ford will rightly be remembered for his personal warmth, his decency, his interest in bridging the many divisions in America during the 1970s. My father, Mo Udall, served in the Congress with Gerald Ford, and while they were often on different sides in political matters--so much so that my father hoped to run against President Ford in the famous election of 1976--they were united by a common view that politics should unite people. They both were firm believers that in public life one could disagree without being disagreeable. 
   This is a credo I continue to believe in, and I commend the memory of both good men to this House, an institution they loved. 
   Coloradans, especially those in the Vail Valley, have come to think of him as the first President from Colorado because he was a great ambassador for the State, who established long ties to the people of Colorado. 
   As a dedicated public servant, President Ford served honorably in his years in Congress and in the White House. Most important, when America needed someone to reassure their trust in government after Watergate, he filled that leadership role with authenticity. 
   I believe President Ford's special relationship and legacy in Colorado should be appropriately recognized by naming the postal facilities in Vail, CO, in his honor. 
   I urge all members support the legislation today.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation that will help provide price relief for American families, open up new areas for domestic energy production, and assist us to make the transition to a new energy economy that will reduce our dependence on imported oil--all without adding to the federal deficit. 
   While this bill is not perfect--I would prefer to see the more comprehensive approach embodied in my ``American Innovation, American Energy'' plan--it is a step in the right direction and deserves approval. 
   It will help us address gas prices in the short term by including a provision (as does my energy bill) to release additional oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). This release would provide for a quick increase in the supply of petroleum in our consumer market and so could reduce the likelihood of further short-term increases in the price of gasoline and other refined products. And, it will do this in a way that is both cost-effective and protective of our national security interests. 
   Under the bill, the Energy Department (DOE) would sell at least 20 million barrels of light grade oil now stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and sales would continue for 6 months or until 70 million barrels have been sold, whichever comes first. But the draw-down would not be permanent because the bill would require the energy department to acquire, through purchase (using money from the sales) or exchange, heavy grade petroleum for storage in the strategic reserve, to replace the light grade petroleum that would be sold. 
   Right now, slightly more than 700 million barrels of oil are stored in the strategic reserve--so the amount to be sold under the bill would be only about 10 percent of the amount on hand. 
   Importantly, the bill specifies that the amount of oil stored in the strategic reserve could not drop below 90 percent of the amount stored when the bill is enacted. The most recent data I have seen indicate that the reserve is currently filled nearly to capacity, so the bill will not cause a significant reduction in the amount stored. 
   Furthermore, this bill will help diversify the type of oil in the SPR, meaning that this bill not only is compatible with the national security purposes of the SPR, it can actually assist in achieving them. 
   This bill will also require that oil companies pay their fair share of royalties on flawed leases granted in 1998 and 1999. Because of mistakes made by the Interior Department, oil companies holding 70 percent of leases issued for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in 1998 and 1999 became exempt from paying any royalties, costing American taxpayers about $15 billion. 
   And the bill will address the recently discovered ethical problems within the Department of Interior's Mineral Management Service (MMS)--problems that were particularly rampant at the MMS office in Denver. 
   Numerous government employees were found to have very inappropriate relationships with employees who worked for the very companies they were regulating. This bill will increase penalties for both MMS employees and companies that hold oil or gas leases, strengthen the MMS code of ethics, and strengthen the office of the Inspector General, which uncovered these problems. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, this bill recognizes that short-term solutions and fixing past problems are no ``silver bullets'' for the factors that have led to the current high price of oil and products such as gasoline that are made from oil. We need long-term solutions as well. 
   This bill includes opening up new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to oil and gas drilling. Specifically, the bill would end the current moratorium on OCS drilling and would permit leasing between 50 and 100 miles offshore if a State ``opts-in'' to allow it off of their coast, while providing protection for environmentally sensitive areas. I think that is a critical component of this provision--states must be able to have a say in drilling activity within their territory.  
   A separate provision in the bill deals with Federal lands that have been leased for energy exploration and development under the Mineral Leasing Act but where such activities have not yet occurred--yet another provision that is also in my energy plan. While it is important to understand the reality that oil and gas exploration is a complicated commercial and scientific enterprise involving efforts not easily fitting within strict regulatory timelines, I think that this is a reasonable response to current conditions. In essence, it would bar the current holders of federal mineral leases--whether for onshore or offshore areas--from obtaining additional leases unless they are able to show that they are ``diligently developing'' the leases they already hold. The Secretary of the Interior would be responsible for spelling out in regulations exactly what would be needed to show such ``due diligence.'' 
   These provisions also include a requirement for the Department of the Interior to offer at least one lease sale annually in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. This is an area of well-established potential that was initially made available for leasing in the Clinton Administration, and with regard to which the current Administration just today announced that 2.6 million acres would be offered at lease sales in the near future. Dictating a leasing timetable in legislation is unusual, and I have reservations about that approach--but the potentially beneficial effects on prices from tapping the reserves in this part of Alaska are undeniable. 
   In addition, the bill would reinstate a ban on the export of Alaskan oil that was previously a matter of federal law. Oil is a globally-traded commodity, so the effect of this will be limited, but it to an extent might reduce the extent to which imports are used to supply the domestic market. 
   And the bill calls on the President to use the powers of his office to facilitate the completion of oil pipelines into the National Petroleum Reserve and to facilitate the construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline to the continental United States to move the product to market. These are only exhortations, but I see no objection to their inclusion in the legislation. 
   I am particularly pleased that the measure before contains a provision that I authored, along with Representatives TOM UDALL and TODD PLATTS, to establish a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES). This provision will require utilities to acquire 15 percent of electricity production from renewable resources by 2020. While I would prefer to see us adopt a RES of 20 percent by 2020, as we have in Colorado and as is in my energy plan, establishing a 15 percent by 2020 is a good step in the right direction. 
   As co-chair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I am especially pleased to see the bill include needed extension for tax credits for renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) in particular has been instrumental in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry. An extended PTC will provide more market certainty and we must have an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008. 
   I must add that, while I am pleased that the bill provides a three year extension of the PTC for most renewable energy sources, I am concerned that it only provides a one-year extension for wind energy. Wind is a very promising renewable energy source and a one year extension will not be as helpful for the industry. I will continue to lead the fight to extend the PTC for more than one year in fact, my energy plan includes a four year extension of the PTC for all renewable energy sources. 
   The bill also extends the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy, qualified fuel cells, and microturbines for eight years. The ITC will help companies with initial investment costs in expanding these renewable energy sources across the country. 
   The bill also authorizes new clean renewable energy bonds (CREBS) for public power providers and electric cooperatives. This is a critical tool, especially for Colorado's rural co-ops and municipal utilities. 
   Of course, the cheapest kilowatt of energy is the one you don't use and energy efficiency also has a key role in addressing our energy needs. This bill will provide incentives to lenders and financial institutions, including the Federal Housing Administration, to provide lower interest loans and other benefits to consumers who build, buy or remodel their homes to improve their energy efficiency. It will also establish a residential energy efficiency block grant program to improve the energy efficiency of housing. 
   Transportation is another area of high energy use and public transportation is becoming more and more necessary as gas prices continue to rise. This bill establishes $1.7 billion in grants to transit agencies for the next two years, which will help reduce transit fares for commuter rail and buses and expands service. 
   While I would like to see much more for transportation, such as the increase in vehicle efficiency and additional advancements in alternative fuels that are included in my energy plan, this public transportation provision is a good start. 
   I maintain strong reservations about the pace at which this Administration is pursuing oil shale development in Western Colorado. Before commercial leasing occurs, we need to know more about oil shale development's impacts on water and local communities. 
   Until those questions are answered, I do not believe that the federal government should rush ahead with oil shale leasing and I therefore have been fighting, with my colleague Representative John Salazar, to ensure that the necessary research and development can be completed before we move ahead. I have also been fighting to ensure that the State of Colorado has a voice in the development of oil shale, so that the wisdom of Westerners can help us avoid the pitfalls that have sunk oil shale development in the past. 
   At the end of this month, the moratorium on commercial oil shale leasing is scheduled to expire. In the event it does, I believe that the state of Colorado should have a safety valve so that it can determine the pace of oil shale development within its borders. Section 171 of the energy bill currently before the House aims to create that safety valve, and to ensure that regardless of the Administration's desire to rush ahead with oil shale development at all costs, Colorado and other states can control the pace of development. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I think this bill deserves support. But it certainly is not all that is needed in terms of energy policy. We need to do more. 
   I think we need to look at increasing mileage standards for new cars and trucks. Specifically, I believe we have the technology to require that all new vehicles achieve 35 miles per gallon by 2015 and, with additional American innovation, we can achieve 50 miles per gallon by 2030. I also think we need additional incentives for Americans to purchase high efficiency vehicles and for manufactures to produce many vehicles that use alternative fuels. And we need to aggressively pursue development of alternative energy sources, including solar and wind power, in order to reduce our dependence not just on imported oil but on all fossil fuels. We also need to work even harder to increase energy efficiency, so that we get a greater payoff from all energy sources. 
   I hope today we can move this bill forward and promote positive change that will benefit our families and rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues in the House to vote for this needed legislation, and also encourage quick action in the Senate so that we may move it to the President's desk.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, support this legislation that will extend critical tax credits for renewable energy and for American families while not adding to the Federal deficit. 
   As co-chair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I am especially pleased to see the House take action on needed tax credits for renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) in particular has been instrumental in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry. An extended PTC will provide more market certainty and we must have an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008. 
   I must add that, while I am pleased that the bill provides a three-year extension of the PTC for most renewable energy sources, I am concerned that it only provides a one-year extension for wind energy.Wind is a very promising renewable energy source and a one-year extension will not be as helpful for the industry. I will continue to lead the fight to extend the wind energy PTC for more than one year. 
   The bill also extends the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy, qualified fuel cells, and microturbines for eight years. The ITC will help companies with initial investment costs in expanding these renewable energy sources across the country. 
   Rising gas prices are forcing many Coloradans to dip into their savings just to make ends meet. This bill will help families reduce their fuel bills by providing $3000 in tax credits toward the purchase of fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrid vehicles. It will also help address long-term fuel cost concerns by expanding production of homegrown fuels and incentives for the installation of E-85 pumps for consumers to fill up flex-fuel vehicles. 
   This bill also will support advances in energy efficiency and conservation in commercial and residential buildings, as well as energy efficient appliances. 
   And this bill will also help Colorado businesses stay competitive by extending the research and development tax credit for one year. While again I would like to see this key tax credit extended for more than one year, this is a step in the right direction. 
   To help with the hard economic times that Coloradans are facing, this bill includes several other key tax credits, including expanding the child tax credit for some of our neediest families, allowing teachers to take a deduction for purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pocket, and providing additional support for families paying for college education. 
   Although this bill includes several important provisions and I will vote for it, I am disappointed that it does not include provisions that passed in the Senate and in previous House bills--particularly those related to clean renewable energy bonds (CREBS) and the Secure Rural Schools Program. 
   CREBs provide a critical tool for public power providers and electric cooperatives to invest in renewable energy. This is a unique tool for Colorado's rural co-ops and municipal utilities and I hope to see us address this issue before the session ends. CREBS provisions were in the version of the bill originally passed by the House, but in the Senate they were revised. My understanding is that is the reason they have been omitted entirely from the bill now before us. My hope is that further discussions between the House and Senate will resolve this impasse. 
   The ``Secure Rural Schools'' program, originally authorized in 2000, was designed to establish stability to certain annual payments made to States and counties containing National Forest System lands and certain public domain lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  
   Since 1908, 25 percent of Forest Service revenues, such as those from timber sales, mineral resources and grazing fees, ha ve been returned to the States in which national forest lands are located. Because receipts from timber sales have fluctuated over time, the 106th Congress in 2000 enacted the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (Public Law 106-393) to address this instability by providing fundin g for a period of seven years, but requiring reauthorization after that time. 
   While Colorado is not among the States receiving the largest payments, the program has helped some of our rural counties meet urgent needs. In fact, last year payments under the program to Colorado counties amounted to more than $6.4 million, helping to offset the costs of public schools, roads, and other needs of Colorado residents. 
   That is why I cospon ored legislation (H.R. 3058) to renew the program's authorization, and why I voted for that legisla tion when the House considered it on June 5th of this year. Unfortunately, while 218 of us voted for the bill, the final total included 193 against and thus, because it was considered under a procedure requiring two-thirds approval, the bill did not pass. 
   In its version of this legislation the Senate included funding for both the Secure Rural Schools program and for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, which makes payments to counties across the country where certain categories of Federal lands are located. PILT is also very important to Colorado, and I strongly support funding for it--and I would have preferred to have both its funding and that for the Secure Rural Schools program included in the bill now before us. 
   Nonetheless, despite the lack of these provisions, this is a good bill. I hope we can move it forward and promote positive change that will benefit our families and rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security. 
   I encourage my colleagues in the House to vote for this needed legislation, and also encourage quick action in the Senate s o that we may move it to President's desk.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the gentleman for his generous offer.  
   I rise in support of the amendment. 
   I'd like to thank Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh and the Appropriations Committee for their leadership on this vital legislation that will help to provide quality healthcare, enhance education opportunities, and increase worker safety. 
   This is a good bill, but I think this amendment would make it better. 
   The amendment will increase the funding for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by $500,000, and is offset by a decrease to the Department of Labor Departmental Management Salaries and expenses. 
   As we all know the NLRB plays a vital role in labor-management relations. 
   It hears appeals of unfair labor practices and resolves questions about the composition of bargaining units.  
   We need to maintain its ability to do its job. 
   But without the additional funding this amendment will provide, there is a danger that they will have to lay off some of their staff in order to pay for their required overhead, including salaries. 
   The amendment would prevent that, and would also enable the NLRB's staff to handle cases efficiently and effectively, without sacrificing quality. 
   Funding is not the only problem that faces the National Labor Relations Board but congress should make it easier not harder for the National Labor Relations Board to administer decisions. 
   I urge the House to adopt the Shays-Udall amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report for the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations for 2008. 
   The funding provided in the conference report helps enhance our national transportation system at a critical time. Our transportation system is extended beyond its capacity. Public  and private use of highways, transit, and aviation systems are growing far beyond the current level of investment. 
   I am particularly pleased the agreement provides funds for a number of important projects not just in my own district but throughout Colorado. Our State faces a number of transportation challenges as a result of rapid expansion in the northwest Denver sububs and mountain and resort communities. Without the passage of this conference report, critical transportation and infrastructure needs for Colorado and the Nation will continue to be shortchanged. 
   I am committed to continue working with the rest of the Colorado delegation, local communities, the Transportation Committee and the administration to secure essential Federal funding to get people and goods from one place to another with a focus on transit and other transportation alternatives, and improving current modes of Colorado's transportation network. 
   The report also includes a number of important provisions with national implications. 
   The United States and Colorado are facing a housing crisis that has caused dire impacts to millions of homeowners. Very often a home purchase represents the largest single investment that individuals and families will make in their lifetimes. Homeownership is a cornerstone of the American Dream, and Congress needs to treat it as a top priority. I am pleased the report provides additional funding for counseling assistance for at-risk homeowners. Funding in the bill will assist thousands of borrowers with mortgage changes and restructuring to help them keep their homes. 
   I am also pleased the report makes changes to inequities in the retirement age of U.S. pilots. Like the Senate bill, the report raises the mandatory retirement age for pilots to 65, with certain exceptions. I supported similar provisions that passed the House in the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. We must take urgent action to ensure that more competent pilots are not lost. 
   Mr. Speaker this legislation is far from perfect but by passing the conference report, Congress will maintain its commitment to a safe, efficient and competitive transportation system that will fuel job creation. I urge its passage today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the chairwoman for yielding me time, and I rise in strong support of this legislation. The bill's purpose is to require more fair play for people with credit cards. 
   For many Americans, consumer credit is more than a convenience. They rely on it for everyday needs. And for them it's a necessity. But they aren't always treated fairly by the companies that issue the credit cards that they use. 
   As the chairwoman pointed out, I've heard from many people in my State of Colorado asking me to help level the playing field. They work to do the right thing and pay their bills on time, and they deserve to be treated in good faith by the credit card companies. 
   That's the reason I've been working to make some commonsense changes in the rules for credit cards over these last two Congresses. I introduced a bill in 2006, and then reintroduced it again this year. And I'm proud that it won the support of an array of consumer groups, as well as 39 cosponsors from congressional districts across the country. 
   Most of the provisions in my bill have been included in this bill, H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights. This is a good, solid bill that will bring real reform without arbitrary rate caps or price controls that could backfire and make credit less available. 
   Now later this week we'll be debating on how to respond to the problems in the credit markets. This debate will focus on a financial market crisis that's brought on, in part, by the reckless practices of lenders who thought the use of complicated financial engineering would make risky loans safe. 
   Across the country, people worry that we will be too concerned about rescuing the reckless and not concerned enough about fairness for hard working Americans who may be called upon to pay the tab. So it's appropriate, as we prepare for that debate, that we start by acting and bringing greater fairness to the millions of Americans who need and use credit cards. 
   I urge passage of the bill. I thank the chairwoman again for her leadership on this important measure.  
   Madam Speaker, as a proud cosponsor of this legislation, I rise in strong support of it as a way to add some common-sense rules to the laws governing issuance of credit cards. 
   Later this week, we will be debating how to respond to problems in the credit markets. As we all know, that debate will focus on a financial-market crisis brought on, in large part, by reckless practices of lenders who thought the use of complicated financial ``engineering'' would make risky loans safe. 
   Understandably, many in Colorado and across the country are concerned that Congress may be too concerned about rescuing those who took excessive risks and not concerned enough about fairness for hard-working American taxpayers who will be called on to pay the tab. 
   So it is appropriate, as we prepare for that debate, that we start by acting to bring greater fairness to the millions of Americans who need and use credit cards. I have heard from constituents across Colorado, asking me to help even the playing field on this issue. 
   They benefit from the widespread availability of consumer credit, and their use of that credit has been important to our economy. In fact, for many Americans, consumer credit is more than a convenience. It is something that many people need to use to pay for their everyday needs. For them, it is a necessity. 
   Of course, another word for credit is debt--and credit card debt has increased considerably in recent years. Overall, during the last decade, total credit-card debt rose by about 70 percent, and this clearly has an effect on consumers. 
   Some polls have reported that about 70 percent of surveyed families said the quality of their lives is adversely affected by the extent of their debts, and young people are more worried about going deeply into debt than about a terrorist attack. 
   Some have argued that much of this debt was caused by recklessness and an erosion  of financial responsibility. That was one of the main arguments advanced in support of the recent changes in the bankruptcy laws. 
   But while there was something to that argument, it was not the whole story and it put too much emphasis on borrowers alone. Instead of just focusing on borrowers, Congress should also do more to promote responsibility by those who provide the credit--and one place to start is with credit card companies. 
   That's the reason I have been working to make some common-sense changes in the rules for credit card companies. 
   I first introduced a bill to do that back in 2006, and reintroduced it again last year with our colleague, the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver. I'm proud it won the support of an array of consumer groups as well as 39 cosponsors from Congressional Districts across the country. 
   Now, I have joined as an original cosponsor of H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights, which includes many provisions based on my bill. 
   It includes protection against arbitrary interest rate increases. It will prevent cardholders who pay on time from being unfairly penalized. It will bar excessive fees and will require more fairness in the way payments are handled. And it would prohibit the use of ``universal default'' clauses--provisions that allow card issuers to impose a new, higher interest rate on a credit card account if there has been any change for the worse in the cardholder's credit score--even if the change is unrelated to the credit card account. 
   In short, H.R. 5244 is a good, solid bill that will bring real reform without arbitrary rate caps or price controls that could backfire and make credit less available. 
   It deserves passage today and prompt enactment into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I regret that it is necessary for the House to consider this matter today, but I will support the resolution because I have concluded that the Bush administration has made it necessary to do so. When this is disposed of, I hope we can promptly return to the pressing needs of the American people that Congress needs to address. 
   Last year, the Judiciary Committee began reviewing the actions of the administration related to the firings of a number of U.S. Attorneys and allegations that this was part of a pattern of improper politicization of the Justice Department. 
   After failing to get requested information voluntarily, the Committee served subpoenas on then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Josh Bolten. The president then invoked executive privilege and Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten, despite the subpoenas, refused to appear before the Committee. In response, the Judiciary Committee approved a resolution citing them both for contempt of the Congress. 
   I am not a lawyer and certainly not an expert on questions of executive privilege. But it seems clear to me that the administration has refused to negotiate in good faith to resolve this matter, offering only to allow some interviews under severe restrictions, including a bar to keeping of transcripts. 
   This is not the first time Congress has sought information from a president's advisors. The Congressional Research Service reports there have been 74 instances since World War II where even sitting White House advisers, including White House counsel, have testified before Congress, including 17 between 1996 and 2001. But I am not aware of any instance in which executive privilege has been invoked as a reason why a former advisor--such as Ms. Miers--will not even make an appearance before a Congressional committee in response to a subpoena. 
   And I am not persuaded by the administration's explanations about why it refused to allow Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolton to even appear, let alone to testify. For example, we have been assured that the President was not involved in the decision to fire the U.S. Attorneys. But if that is true, how can executive privilege, which is intended to assure that a president will receive candid advice, apply to this matter? 
   After reviewing the history of this matter, I find myself in agreement with someone who is both a lawyer and a distinguished former Member of Congress--Mickey Edwards, who during his service here as a Representative from Oklahoma chaired the Republican Policy Committee. 
   Commenting on this matter, he has written, ``If Congressional leaders are not able to persuade the administration to reverse its position and allow Ms. Miers to testify and Mr. Bolten to produce documents, then all Members of Congress, regardless of party, should insist that the subpoenas be enforced promptly and vigorously and to use civil litigation if, as the White House has hinted, it prohibits the D.C. U.S. Attorney from performing his enforcement duties.'' 
   I agree, and because that is exactly the purpose of this resolution, I will vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I regret that I cannot vote for this bill. 
   The bill is intended to provide a temporary response to the request of Admiral McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, for legislation to address what he says is a critical collection gap in our electronic surveillance capabilities. 
   I think Congress should take such action. That is why on August 3rd I voted for the House version of the legislation. That bill was supported by a majority of the House. However, it was considered under a procedure requiring a two-thirds vote, so our Republican colleagues, taking their lead from President Bush, were able to block it--and so now we are considering this different version, which has already passed the Senate. 
   Like the version I voted for earlier, this bill would make clear that no warrant or court order is required for our intelligence agencies to monitor communications between people located outside the United States, even if those communications pass through the United States or the surveillance device is located within the United States. The point of this clarification is to resolve doubts about the status of communications between foreign persons located overseas that pass through routing stations here in the United States. 
   I have no reservation in supporting this clarification to help resolve questions related to changes in communications technology since enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. And I think it is useful that the bill reiterates that individual warrants, based on probable cause, are required when surveillance is directed at individuals in the United States. 
   However, this Senate bill would go much further than the House version. It would allow interception, without warrants, of communications between someone in the United States and a foreign party suspected of involvement in ``foreign intelligence'' matters, which is broader and less precise than the requirement that the party be suspected in connections to a terrorist group such as al-Qaida. 
   I am not convinced such a sweeping grant of authority is justified, and cannot support it. 
   The bill does require a warrant from the special FISA court for surveillance of a U.S. resident who is the chief target of the surveillance. And the bill requires involvement of the Director of National Intelligence, as well as the Attorney General, in approving surveillance, rather than just the Attorney General alone as the Administration wanted. In that regard, it is not as troublesome as it might have been. However, again, I am not convinced that its safeguards of Americans' privacy and civil liberties are adequate. 
   I greatly regret that our Republican colleagues made it impossible for the House to pass a better version of this legislation. I recognize that the bill before us is not a permanent measure, but will expire in six months. Nonetheless, while I do think Congress should  act on this subject, I cannot support this bill as it stands.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I strongly support this amendment....... 
   I'd like to thank my cousin, Representative TOM UDALL, as well as Representative PLATTS and the rest of our colleagues who have worked so hard to push forward a renewable electricity standard. Speaker PELOSI also deserves our deep gratitude for her support and for working side by side with us during these last few weeks. We all understand the importance of this critical amendment, and I'm proud to have been a longstanding part of this great effort as it culminates in a vote today. 
   As demand for energy continues to grow in this country, we need to make sure that we continue to have affordable and reliable supplies. And, most importantly, as we move to more competition in the delivery of electricity, we must make sure that the environment and consumers are protected. 
   So it makes sense to put incentives in place to ensure that less polluting and environmentally friendly sources of energy can find their way into the marketplace. And that's what a renewable electricity standard, or RES, would help to do. 
   But it's not just about doing the right thing for the environment. 
   With almost all new electricity generation the last decade fueled by natural gas, our domestic supply cannot sustain our needs. Iran, Russia, and Qatar together hold 58 percent of the world's natural gas reserves. As demand for power continues to grow, we shouldn't be forced to rely on these unstable regions to sustain our economy, nor do we have to. 
   The best way to decrease our vulnerability and dependence on foreign energy sources is to diversify our energy portfolio. Half of the States in our great Union have already figured this out and have made the commitment to producing a percentage of their electricity using renewable energy. But all of our States will benefit under a national standard, which will bring natural gas costs down nationwide, create new economies of scale in manufacturing and installation, and offer greater predictability to long-term investors. 
   The Udall-Platts amendment requires utilities nationwide to produce 15 percent of their electricity using renewable energy sources by 2020. The amendment also allows up to 4 percent of that 15 percent requirement to be met with energy efficiency. 
   The amendment's definition of renewables is broad, including biomass--cellulosic organic materials; plant or algal matter from agricultural crops, crop byproducts, or landscape waste; gasified animal waste and landfill gas, or biogas; and all types of crop-based liquid fuels. It includes incremental hydropower; solar and solar water heating; wind; ocean, ocean thermal and tidal; geothermal; and distributed generation. The amendment also allows energy efficiency to make up 27 percent of a utility's targeted requirement. Every State has one or more of these resources. 
   The Udall-Platts amendment saves consumers billions of dollars. By reducing the cost of new clean technologies and making them more available, it will help restrain natural gas price increases by creating more competition for those fuels. 
   The Udall-Platts amendment will spur economic development in the form of billions of dollars in new capital investment and in new property tax revenues for local communities, and millions of dollars in new lease payments to farmers and rural landowners. 
   Not least, the Udall-Platts amendment will reduce air pollution from dirty fossil-fueled power plants that threaten public health and our climate. 
   The amendment does not burden some regions of the country at the expense of others, as the utilities would have you believe. It creates public benefits for all. 
   The argument that the Southeast is disadvantaged by the RES--that the Southeast has no renewable resources--ignores the plain truth. In fact, the Southeast is one of the regions of the country that will see the most benefit from this proposal. According to Department of Energy's Energy information Administration, the technology that does best under a 15 percent RES is biomass. Already, 2500 megawatts of generation come from biomass in the Southeast, and much of the waste from pulp and paper mills is not being used to generate electricity. 
   The Udall-Platts amendment gives States flexibility in achieving the standard. 
   Under the amendment, states can borrow credits against future renewables generation--for up to three years as long as they are repaid by 2020, which means the effective start date can be delayed and facilities ramped up more slowly. 
   The amendment gives three renewable energy credits for each kilowatt hour of power generated at on-site eligible facilities used to offset part or all of the customer's requirements. This means solar, small wind, and other distributed energy generation sources used in residential and business locations can earn triple credits. 
   The amendment also returns money to the States from alternative compliance payments for State weatherization programs, low-income energy assistance programs, and for encouraging the installation of additional renewables. 
   The amendment also lowers the initial target date for 2010 to 2.75 percent and makes the escalation to 15 percent more gradual so that utilities have more time to ramp-up renewable energy sales. 
   In summary, this renewable electricity standard will reduce harmful air and water pollution, provide a sustainable, secure energy supply now, and will create new investment, income and jobs in communities all over the country. 
   It is good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for our country. I strongly urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 3221 I rise in strong support of this very important legislation. It will begin the process of putting our country on a path toward energy independence, increased national security and economic growth, and addressing global warming. When combined with the legislation from the Ways and Means Committee, it will provide long-term incentives to boost production of electricity from renewable sources, including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, river currents, ocean tides, landfill gas, and trash combustion resources. 
   Other incentives will help expand production of homegrown fuels such as cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel and encourage more E-85 pumps to supply flex-fuel vehicles. The bill will encourage manufacturers to build more efficient appliances, help working families afford fuel-efficient plug-in hybrid vehicles, and help businesses create energy-efficient workplaces. It will encourage deployment of renewable energy by enabling electric cooperatives and public power providers to use new clean renewable energy bonds to help finance facilities to generate electricity from renewable resources. And it will help states leverage tax credit bonds to implement low-interest loan programs and grant programs to help working families purchase energy-efficient appliances, and make energy-efficient home improvements. Further, the bill will create an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train Americans for good ``green'' jobs that will be created by new renewable-energy and energy-efficiency initiatives. 
   I am glad the bill includes a requirement for a Renewable Electricity Standard (RES), added by an amendment by my cousin Rep. TOM UDALL, Rep. TODD PLATTS, and others, including myself. This is a great victory--the first time an RES has ever passed the House of Representatives--and it means that despite the strong opposition of those who prefer the status quo, the movement for positive change has grown stronger. Implementing a national RES will benefit rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security. 
   There are many other good provisions--but I am particularly proud of parts originating in two Committees on which I serve, which include many provisions based on legislation I introduced.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, the President's veto of this legislation was not a surprise but still very disappointing. 
   It was not a surprise because the President had clearly signaled his intention to reject the bill's requirement that all intelligence agencies follow the rules governing interrogation techniques followed by our military, even though the bill also authorizes supplemental funding for counterterrorism as well as funding for advanced research and development funding to  help maintain our technical capacity for intelligence, to repair and replace aging and inadequate power infrastructure, and to improve training and education of linguists, analysts, and human intelligence collectors. 
   But it was disappointing that President Bush refuses to agree to that simple requirement, because the result is to signal to the world that he refuses to recognize that the result will be to place every American, especially those in uniform around the world, at grave risk. 
   The United States historically has led in the effort to establish and enforce the laws of war and conventions against torture. Indeed, the Army Field Manual is an outstanding example of how our modern military effectively gathers intelligence and observes international norms of conduct. 
   The importance of that leadership and the appropriateness of the guidelines in the field manual were clearly recognized by Congress when we voted to approve the conference report's provision extending the field manual to the entire intelligence community--the provision to which the President objects and which has prompted him to veto the legislation. By extending the field manual to the intelligence community, the legislation would effectively outlaw waterboarding and similar coercive techniques. I support that because waterboarding is widely and rightly viewed as a form of torture and the refusal to renounce its use will result in greater damage to our national interests than the possible benefits of its possible use in the future. 
   I think the case for overriding the President's veto was well made by the Colorado Springs Gazette in a recent editorial pointing out that ``the use of torture blurs the line between civilized societies and ruthless barbarians.'' As the editorial notes,   
   In the larger struggle with jihadist terrorism and those tempted to support or harbor them, the perception that the United States has a certain moral authority is invaluable. Moral authority was a key factor in the long, twilight struggle with aggressive communism we call the Cold War. Using torture undermines that moral authority. 
   It is telling that the firmest opponents of the use of torture tend to be military and former military people who understand the dangers to captured military personnel if it is widely believed that the U.S. engages in torture. Instead of spinning unlikely scenarios in which torture might be justified, the government should announce that America doesn't do that any more--and mean it.   
   I agree, and that is why I will vote today to override the President's unwise veto of this important legislation. For the benefit of our colleagues, I am attaching the complete text of the editorial:   
   The High Road--Forswearing Torture Gives U.S. Moral Standing 
   So it's out in the open now. Central Intelligence Agency Director Gen. Michael Hayden admitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that the CIA used the coercive interrogation technique known as waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning, on three al-Qaida operatives in 2002 and 2003. The technique is widely viewed as torture, which is prohibited by U.S. law and international treaties. Hayden said it has not been used since 2003 but that the CIA could use it again if approved by both the attorney general and the president. 
   The Justice Department is currently investigating the destruction of videotapes of the interrogations of two detainees held in Thailand who were reportedly subjected to waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques to determine whether destroying the tapes amounted to obstruction of justice. 
   Public disclosure of these incidents should lead to a firm U.S. policy preventing government operatives from using torture in the future. Perhaps the best thing about the emergence of Sen. John McCain as the Republican presidential frontrunner is that McCain, who was tortured by the North Vietnamese while a POW during the Vietnam War, has expressed his firm opposition to the use of torture by the U.S. He has said that one thing that helped him endure his imprisonment was the knowledge that our side doesn't engage in such barbarity. 
   Torture is sometimes justified as the only way to extract information from detainees when an attack is deemed imminent, and Hayden said in 2002 and 2003 that everybody expected an attack on the U.S. following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But most experienced interrogators say torture seldom if ever produces reliable intelligence, that while other techniques may take longer, they generally produce better information. 
   At a more fundamental level, the use of torture blurs the line between civilized societies and ruthless barbarians. In the larger struggle with jihadist terrorism and those tempted to support or harbor them, the perception that the United States has a certain moral authority is invaluable. Moral authority was a key factor in the long, twilight struggle with aggressive communism we call the Cold War. Using torture undermines that moral authority. 
   It is dismaying, therefore, that a day later White House spokesman Tony Fratto was still saying that waterboarding might be used justifiably in the future. It would have been better to acknowledge that in the wake of 9/11 the U.S. used coercive techniques, that one could understand the temptation considering the circumstances and the lack of knowledge about al-Qaida, but that we had renounced the practice. 
   It is telling that the firmest opponents of the use of torture tend to be military and former military people who understand the dangers to captured military personnel if it is widely believed that the U.S. engages in torture. Instead of spinning unlikely scenarios in which torture might be justified, the government should announce that America doesn't do that any more--and mean it.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I supported this legislation when the House considered it originally, and supported it again in the revised form resulting from the conference with the Senate. 
   And I will support it again today because I think the president's veto was misguided. 
   Enactment of H.R. 1495, the ``Water Recourses Development Act,'' will ensure that important work to protect our lands and water will move forward while improving operations of the Corps of Engineers. 
   State and local governments in Colorado desperately need the funding authorized in this bill for environmental restoration, flood control, water supply studies and environmental infrastructure. Unless it is overridden, the president's veto will delay or prevent progress on important projects including environmental restoration on the South Platte River, development of water supply infrastructure in Boulder County and the watershed study of Fountain Creek, near Pueblo. 
   For the record, I am including a list of all the Colorado projects included in the conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress failed to pass a reauthorization of WRDA in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses. Congress needs to pass this vital legislation so we can invest in the necessary long term resources to create jobs and address the critical water infrastructure and environmental challenges facing Colorado and the nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and overriding the veto of this bill. 
   Colorado Projects Threatened by President's Veto: Environmental restoration South Platte River in Denver, Colorado; Expedited completion of the Watershed study, Fountain Creek, north of Pueblo, Colorado; $10,000,000 for the Arkansas Valley Conduit, Colorado; $10,000,000 for water supply infrastructure, Boulder County, Colorado; $1,000,000 for water and wastewater related infrastructure for the Ute Mountain project, Montezuma and La Plata Counties, Colorado; $35,000,000 for water transmission infrastructure in Otero, Bent, Crowley, Kiowa, and Prowers Counties, Colorado; $34,000,000 for water transmission infrastructure, Pueblo and Otero Counties, Colorado. 
   A requirement for the United States Geological Survey, in consultation with State water quality and resource and conservation agencies, to conduct regional and watershed-wide studies to address selenium concentrations in the State of Colorado, including studies--(1) to measure selenium on specific sites; and (2) to determine whether specific selenium measures studied should be recommended for use in demonstration projects.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I do not think the House should take up today the question of whether we will exercise our Constitutional authority to impeach the Vice President and to ask the Senate to try him on charges that, if proved, would result in his removal from office. 
   That does not mean I support the policies advocated by Vice President CHENEY or that I think his official conduct has been above reproach. On the contrary, I think that he has helped create many of the most serious problems our country now faces and that he is continuing to advocate policies that would make those problems worse and bring further difficulties upon us. 
   With President Bush, the vice president spearheaded the unfortunately successful effort to persuade Congress to authorize a rush to war in Iraq--which I opposed. He also was among those in the Bush Administration who refused to listen to the many well-informed people who argued that it was imperative that adequate measures be taken to prevent the disintegration of Iraq's social and governmental fabric that otherwise predictably would follow the equally predictable successful military action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime. And now he clearly is among those who seem to prefer again rushing to use military force--this time to respond to the potential danger of a nuclear-armed Iran--before other options have been exhausted. I strongly oppose that, and have introduced legislation--H.R. 3119--to prohibit funds from being obligated or expended for military operations or activities within or above Iran's territory or within Iran's territorial waters except pursuant to a new, specific congressional authorization.  
   But the question now before the House is not whether we think the vice president's actions have been helpful to the national interest, as his supporters presumably would contend, or whether they have had or could have adverse consequences--as I myself think. Instead, we are being asked whether we should now, today, proceed to charge that the vice president has violated his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the duties of his office and to defend the Constitution and thus should be impeached. 
   The resolution sets forth what its author says are the specific statements and actions of the vice president that constitute violations of his oath. I agree that those statements and actions are deeply troubling and raise serious questions about the way the vice president has used his position, both in communicating with the American people and in participating in the shaping of Bush Administration policies. But at this moment I am not prepared to say that there are adequate grounds to conclude that those statements and actions in fact constitute grounds for impeachment--and I do not think that Members of the House should be called upon to reach that conclusion today. 
   I think that before the House is asked to reach that conclusion, the vice president should have an opportunity to respond to the resolution's charges and the statements and actions it cites in support of those charges. I also think that before we are asked to vote on the resolution, we should have the benefit of hearing from appropriate legal experts and other qualified witnesses and that the Judiciary Committee should prepare a report that will provide the basis for any debate here on the floor of the House. 
   Impeachment is not entirely a legal question. It is partly political, which is why the Constitution entrusts it to Congress and not the courts. But I think it is essential that any decision to impeach any federal official should come only through a careful, thorough process that provides adequate due process for the accused and that will lay the proper foundation for a sound decision. I think to do otherwise, as the author of this resolution seeks to do, would further weaken the civility toward our colleagues and respect for those with whom we disagree that should be the basis for our service in Congress and would only add to the polarization and rancor that are all too prevalent in the Nation's political debates. 
   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I must oppose consideration of this resolution at this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3043, DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. 
   The conference report includes funding for many important programs and I recognize that the conferees had a challenging task in shaping the report because of budget constraints. Overall, I think the report is a good one and I hope that the President will change his mind and sign it. 
   This conference report funds our military construction needs and keeps our commitment to veterans, with the largest single funding increase in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The report provides needed funding for veterans' medical care--both for VA hospitals and clinics as well as for research into conditions such as Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, both of which are common problems facing Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. The report also includes funding to provide 1800 new claims processors to address the 400,000 benefit claims backlog. 
   I am pleased that key funding for Colorado installations and facilities has also been included in this report. 
   The report includes $7.3 million for a new F-16 facility for the 140th Air Wing of the Colorado Air National Guard at Buckley Air Force Base (AFB). I led the Colorado delegation this year in securing this funding, which will help the Guard replace an outdated facility that can no longer provide proper security and communications to support one of its key missions--to fly F-16s in support of homeland defense. The soldiers and airmen of the Colorado National Guard who are activated and deployed to support our homeland defense deserve this safe and modern facility. 
   The report also includes $61.3 million for the Fitzsimons Veterans Hospital, another key priority for the Colorado delegation. The funding will enable construction to begin on the facility's parking structure and energy plant. Denver's current Veterans Hospital is fifty years old, is at full capacity and does not meet the needs of our veterans. As Colorado's service members continue to be placed in harm's way, it is essential that we be prepared to meet their needs when they return home. This funding will put us on a path toward making the new campus at Fitzsimons a reality. 
   The conference report also includes an amendment, passed overwhelmingly in the House in June and later passed in the Senate, that prohibits the Pentagon from taking the first steps toward expanding the Army's Pinon Canyon training site. 
   After meeting with community members in La Junta and Trinidad in September, it is even more clear to me that the Pentagon has failed to convince Coloradans of a pressing military need for the Army to acquire an additional 418,000 acres at this particular location. I hope the Army hears the strong message Congress is delivering today that we will ensure that the livelihoods and property of Colorado citizens are respected and protected. 
   Another key provision for southern Colorado is the inclusion of $35.1 million for the construction of on-site chemical destruction facilities at the Pueblo Chemical Depot. 
   We need to continue to do all we can to safely and expeditiously remove the mustard agent remaining at the Pueblo depot. The sooner we clean up these weapons, the sooner the surrounding communities will be safe--and a clean-up by the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty deadline of 2012 will come at a lower cost to taxpayers. 
   The conference report also includes nearly $170 million to support Fort Carson as it expands because of the stationing of two new brigades and the new headquarters of the Fourth Infantry Division. This includes $53 million for new barracks; $18 million for an addition to Evans Army Hospital and a dental clinic; $8.3 million for a Defense Access Road to allow personnel and equipment to deploy easily from Peterson Air Force Base; $4.9 million for a new indoor range; $72 million for new unit operation facilities; and $13.5 million for construction of new facility support operations for the 13th Air Support Operations Squadron. 
   The conference report also includes $24.5 million for an Air and Space Integration Facility at Schriever Air Force Base and $15 million to upgrade academic facilities at the Air Force Academy. 
   This conference report also provides funding for the Department of Health and Human Services, one of the most vital agencies in our government. This report will increase funding by $4.4 billion over the fiscal year 2007 budget--a 6.9 percent increase and one that I strongly support. This funding will be important both to Colorado and to our country. 
   This report provides funding for a broad range of important projects, from increasing funding for essential research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to increasing health care access in rural areas. I strongly support include the 3.8 percent increase in funding for the NIH. This increase will be pivotal in jump starting a reinvestment in important medical discoveries. 
   Included in the report is important funding for Children's Hospital of Denver. Funding obtained to build the North Campus Ambulatory Surgery Center will broaden access to pediatric care in the north Denver metro area. This new development will also add more convenient alternative to patients, families, pediatricians, and physicians while also decreasing the burden on other health centers in the Denver metro area. 
   Making our health care system safe and more efficient is a goal of this Congress and I am happy to announce that Avista Hospital will contribute to that goal. Avista has been a leader in the Electronic Medical Record field and will continue to implement a cutting edge system thanks to funding included in the report. 
   The report provides for increases in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) which will fund important public health programs such as children's immunizations, environmental health and cervical and breast cancer screenings. 
   Our nation's youth are our greatest resource, and we must do all that we can to prepare them to lead our country in future years. This report would provide very important funding for the Department of Education to further the education of our children. 
   I supported the passage of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act in 2001 because we need to create higher academic standards and accountability in our education system and close the so-called achievement gap in this country. However, NCLB has been underfunded since it was first passed, meaning that local school districts do not have the resources available to try to meet these new standards. This report takes a step in the right direction by increasing funding for NCLB over both the fiscal year 2007 budget and the President's request. I am also pleased to 
   see increases in funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). IDEA provides resources to meet the unique challenges in educating children with disabilities. 
   In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, higher education is more important than it has ever been. Yet skyrocketing tuitions are making college education increasingly difficult for many students and families to afford. Just a few weeks ago, the College Board announced that the average tuition at four-year schools in my home state of Colorado had increased 16 percent from last year. Pell Grants are one important and effective way that the federal government helps students and families afford college. The conference report will increase the maximum Pell Grant award to $4,925. 
   I am encouraged that the report includes an increase in funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP is a critical program that helps many Colorado families, who are struggling to get by, avoid having to make choices between paying their heating bill and putting food on the table. The conference report will increase funding for this program by $250 million over the fiscal year 2007 budget. 
   I am pleased the labor provisions of this report reflect a new direction and commitment to  expanding job training and enhancing the safety of workers, by increasing funding for a number of employment, education, and protection programs for the American workforce. 
   With that said, I am disappointed the conference report does not include my amendment to increase the funding for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The board plays a vital role in labor-management relations. While funding is not the only problem that faces the NLRB I am concerned that without the additional funding, there is a danger they will have to layoff some of their staff in order to pay for their required overhead, including salaries. 
   The funding for programs included in this report is a cause for celebration, not a veto. The President suggested underfunding for many of these programs and has threatened to veto the report in its current form. I request that the President reconsider his veto threat and sign this conference report. 
   In summary, Madam Speaker, this is a good report that provides funding for many important purposes. It is good for Colorado and good for the country, and it deserves approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXPLORER I SATELLITE -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today we consider H. Con. Res. 287, Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the U.S. Explorer I Satellite and the Birth of the United States' Space Exploration Program, which I introduced last week. 
   My statement about its introduction highlighted the inspiring accomplishments of our early space pioneers who contributed to the successful development and launch of Explorer I--America's first space satellite--and the multiple achievements of our Nation's first 50 years in space. 
   Today, I want to focus on one of the major enablers of America's highly successful space program, namely our highly skilled science and engineering workforce. 
   As we celebrate 50 years of exciting accomplishments in space, we witness the return on our Nation's past investments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. 
   Those investments produced the cadre of highly skilled scientists and engineers who have led our Nation in pushing back the boundaries of scientific knowledge and making possible the human and robotic exploration of outer space. 
   Their contributions to our successes in space have also yielded critical benefits by promoting the innovation and advanced technology development that are central to America's competitiveness. 
   As was expressed so clearly in the National Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report and in the America COMPETES Act that was signed into law last year, our nation's economic strength cannot be sustained without renewed investments in STEM education. 
   Space has always been an attraction for some of America's best and brightest. Our space program provides a unique means of encouraging the pursuit of STEM fields. I urge my colleagues in Congress to support the STEM programs and educators we need to prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers who will lead America's next 50 years of accomplishments in space and on Earth. 
   And I urge you also to maintain Congress's commitment to making the investments necessary to continue a robust and vital space program for the Nation.  
   I would like to thank my colleagues Ms. GIFFORDS and Mr. ROHRABACHER for their support of the bill, along with the original cosponsors. 
   I urge adoption of my resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5818, the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008. This bill would provide $15 billion in loans and grants, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for States to buy and, rehabilitate foreclosed and vacated housing properties in order to resell or rent them out. 
   While I have some reservations about the balance in this bill between loans and grants, I think the potential threat to the value of American homes and the safety of our communities justifies the overall cost. Studies have shown that home foreclosures adversely affect the value of other homes in the same neighborhood, and the rate of home foreclosures in a neighborhood directly corresponds to a spike in crime in that neighborhood. In many cases, foreclosed and vacated homes have become the dens of vagrants, drug addicts and drug dealers. 
   H.R. 5818 attempts to reduce the likelihood of these problems by helping States buy and refurbish foreclosed and vacated housing properties to make them an appealing choice for qualified families to buy or rent. In addition, this legislation includes provisions to protect against housing speculator abuse by requiring that homes purchased and refurbished by a State be resold to families whose income does not exceed 140 percent of the area median income. This bill offers further targeted assistance for those Americans who need it most by requiring that half of the bill's grant money be dedicated to housing families at or below 50 percent area median income. 
   Finally, H.R. 5818 will direct funds to the States with the greatest need. Under this bill, each State's loan and grant authority would be based on the State's percentage of nationwide foreclosures reported during the previous four calendar quarters. This is a significant point for my home State of Colorado, which has consistently ranked among the top 10 States in percentage of foreclosures. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is a good measure that deserves our support. As I previously stated, the benefits of this legislation outweigh my concerns over its cost, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. 
   The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Weiner) having assumed the chair, Mr. McNulty, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5818) to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make loans to States to acquire foreclosed housing and to make grants to States for related costs, pursuant to House Resolution 1174, reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. 
   In most circumstances, I consider it counterproductive and not in the best interest of the American people for the Federal Government to intervene in the free market process. However, in certain exceptional times, I believe it is the duty of the Federal Government to act for the greater good of our Nation. And I think we are experiencing such an exceptional moment in American history. 
   The provisions of this legislative package will help stabilize the downward trend in the housing industry and overall economy, and prevent that trend from spiraling out of control. 
   The danger is real. Just last month, the Pew Charitable Trusts released a study that forecast one in 25 homeowners in my home state of Colorado will be in foreclosure within the next two years if Congress does not act now to curb this impending disaster. The national forecast of homeowners in foreclosure within the next two years--one in 33--is only slightly less discouraging. If we stand by and do nothing, as some have suggested, the damage to the overall American economy could be devastating. 
   First and foremost, this bill will help American families at risk of foreclosure to stay in their homes by allowing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to guarantee qualified refinanced loans. To do so, however, homeowners and their lenders must agree to sacrifice. Lenders could recover no more than 85 percent of a property's current value, but could avoid the potentially greater losses associated with unloading a foreclosed property. Meanwhile, participating homeowners could remain in their home, but must repay the Federal Government a percentage of the value of the home if they sell or refinance again. 
   The bill provides much needed measures to modernize the FHA, allowing expanded opportunities for families to secure affordable loans without having to turn to subprime lenders. The legislation also increases the Veterans Administration home loan guarantee limit, allowing our veterans to receive the dignified homeownership opportunities they deserve for honoring us with their service; reforms Government Sponsored Enterprises through strengthened regulation, while raising GSE loan limits for homes in high-cost areas; and encourages mortgage servicers to readjust at-risk mortgages by removing the threat of lawsuit. 
   This legislation would help remove some of the excess housing inventory by offering a refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers. It would also provide additional mortgage revenue bonds for states to refinance subprime loans, and help prevent soldiers from being unfairly penalized for their service by providing more time to get their finances in order when they return from service before a lender could start foreclosure. 
   A final important piece of this legislation would simply protect the right of States and cities to regulate their own foreclosure process. Some have argued that national banks and financial institutions should be exempt from these rules. I, however, believe it is the right of States and cities to have their own requirements and enforce their own rules throughout the foreclosure process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was very disappointed to learn of the Bush Administration's threat to veto this legislation, because I believe that it is important for us to act now to provide relief to America's stressed homeowners. It is my understanding that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson, as well as other Administration officials, had worked with Chairman Frank to shape provisions of this legislation, so this change of heart is doubly regrettable. I hope that the President will change his mind and sign this needed legislation when it reaches his desk. 
   This legislation has been carefully crafted to safeguard against fraud, corporate giveaways and speculator abuse. And as concerned as I was that the Federal Reserve had to devote $29 billion to prevent the collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns, I am equally concerned about the Federal Government taking action to rescue the housing market. However, without the stability that the Fed provided the investment banking industry, experts tell us that the bottom may well have fallen out of our economy. And it appears the same is true for our housing market--without the stability this legislation will help provide, it may not have the chance to correct itself and, eventually, rebound. Main Street deserves the same attention as Wall Street. 
   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting all three components of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this measure for two reasons. 
   First, I will support it because, as I have consistently said, I do think the basic law in this area--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA--needs to be updated to respond to changes in technology, which was the purpose of the current, temporary law. 
   That is why, last August, I voted for a bill (H.R. 3356) to provide such an update--a bill that was supported by a majority of the House, but did not pass because it was considered under a procedure that required a two-thirds vote for passage, which did not occur because of the opposition of the Bush Administration, which was supported by all but 3 of our Republican colleagues. That is also why I voted for another bill to update FISA--H.R. 3773, the ``Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen, Reviewed, and Effective'' (or RESTORE) Act--which the House passed on November 15th of last year. 
   Second, I will support it because I think it is distinctly better than the version the Senate passed--as an amendment to the House-passed RESTORE Act--on February 12th. 
   It does include some good features of the Senate version, including provisions that for the first time will provide statutory requirement that surveillance of the communications of Americans overseas will be done pursuant to appropriate orders of the courts. 
   But it differs from the Senate version in some important ways, particularly in the way it addresses the current lawsuits brought against several telecommunications companies by parties who claim that the companies acted wrongly by assisting with a surveillance program involving the massive interception of purely domestic communications. 
   Those lawsuits have been consolidated and are pending in one court, but evidently have made little progress because of the Administration's argument, still awaiting court resolution, that the suits are barred because they involve state secrets. My understanding is that the defendant companies have argued that government's invocation of the state-secrets privilege has had the result of preventing them from defending themselves, although at least one company has stated in regulatory filings that the cases against it are without merit. 
   President Bush has insisted that Congress throw these cases out of court by giving the companies retroactive immunity for whatever they might have done in connection with the surveillance program, even though the Administration and the companies themselves insist that those actions were lawful and that the plaintiffs' complaints against the companies have no merit. 
   Regrettably, last month the Senate decided to comply with the President's demand on this point, and their version of this legislation would provide that retroactive immunity. 
   I do not think that was the right decision. I agree with the Rocky Mountain News, which in a February 15th editorial said ``Letting this litigation proceed would not, as Bush [has] 
   said ..... punish companies that want to `help America.' Businesses that want to help America need to be mindful of the Constitution--and so should the government.'' 
   That is why I think the approach taken in the measure before us is better. Unlike the Senate version, it would not short-circuit the court by preventing the cases from proceeding. Instead, it would allow the defendant companies to defend themselves by freeing them from the ``state secret'' barrier erected by the Bush Administration. 
   Under the measure before us, the defendants will be able to demonstrate to the court the evidence they say supports their arguments in a way that assures the continued security of that evidence and that avoids the public disclosure the Administration says would be adverse to the national interest. This is a process that has worked well in criminal cases, and while I am certainly not an expert on the matter, I think it can work when applied to these civil cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is a matter of basic fairness to allow the companies now being sued, and those that may be sued in the future, to fully defend themselves and to try to show the court why, as the defendants in the current cases claim, they are already immune under existing law. 
   That is what this measure does--and, in fact, it does more. 
   Unlike the Senate version, it will protect the companies from lawsuits for compliance with valid authorizations under the temporary surveillance law (the ``Protect America Act'') passed last August for the period between the expiration of that law (but not the underlying authorizations) and the enactment of more lasting FISA reform legislation. 
   I strongly approve of that aspect of the legislation because while I did not support its original enactment, I do regret the fact that the temporary law was allowed to lapse. 
   I thought it should have remained in effect while we in Congress work to replace it with a longer-lasting statute. That was why earlier this year, I twice voted to extend it--first, by passage of a 15-day extension (H.R. 5104) and then by voting for a bill (H.R. 5349) that would have provided a further 21-day extension. 
   Regrettably, that second extension did not occur. Its failure was because of the opposition of President Bush and the resulting fact  that all our Republican colleagues here in the House, who voted against the extension and thus allowed the ``Protect America Act'' to lapse--a fact that has been conveniently ignored by many of those who have sponsored television commercials or otherwise complained about that lapse. 
   In any event, today we have the opportunity to make progress toward the goal of updating the FISA law in a way that will enable our intelligence agencies to obtain information needed to protect the American people while safeguarding our rights under the Constitution. That is what this measure does, and that is why I will vote for it. 
   For the information of our colleague, I am attaching the February 15th editorial of the Rocky Mountain News that I mentioned earlier.   
   No Immunity--Senate Veers Off Track in Its Surveillance Bill 
   The Bush administration is in a tizzy because Congress will take its Presidents Day recess and allow the temporary ``terrorist surveillance'' act passed six months ago to expire at midnight Saturday. 
   Earlier this week, President Bush actually suggested that al-Qaida operatives are watching the calendar, poised to plot new attacks freely with Congress absent--and U.S. intelligence officials will be largely powerless to stop them. 
   Don't insult the American public, Mr. President. You'll still have the ability to wiretap suspected terrorists--and the warrantless surveillance powers in the bill are valid until August. 
   Bush is riled because the House is leaving town without adopting immunity provisions in the Senate surveillance bill. The Senate version granted immunity from lawsuits--unwisely, in our view--to telecommunications firms that cooperated with the warrantless wiretaps on overseas calls. 
   If immunity is in the final legislation--and Bush has said he'd veto any bill that doesn't include it--it would kill the 40-plus lawsuits that have been filed against telecoms in federal court. The litigation challenges the legality of the program and the actions of telecoms that cooperated with the government. 
   If the lawsuits don't move forward, we may never learn if some telecoms compromised the privacy of innocent Americans. A grant of immunity could also set a dangerous precedent for other businesses when federal agents or local cops who don't have a court order demand private or confidential information about their customers.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' The CHAMP Act addresses many problems that we currently have in our health care system. It does not end health care inequality, but it will increase coverage for low income children, and it will stave off payment cuts for hardworking physicians, while increasing choices for seniors and strengthening traditional Medicare. 
   I believe that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and this act is a step in the right direction. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is set to expire on September 30, 2007. This year, six million children have health care because of CHIP. If Congress does not act, these six million will no longer have access to quality, affordable health insurance. This legislation also provides coverage for an additional 5 million children who currently qualify but who are not yet enrolled under CHIP. These children are in working families with parents who either can't afford insurance or have jobs that lack health care benefits. 
   Despite claims by some, this bill does nothing to ``expand'' the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains current eligibility requirements for CHIP. The majority of uninsured children are currently eligible for coverage--but better outreach and adequate funding are needed to identify and enroll them. This bill gives states the tools and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program. 
   It has been said that the CHAMP Act creates an entitlement for illegal immigrants. But in fact the CHAMP Act does not change existing law, which states that undocumented immigrants are not eligible for CHIP or regular Medicaid. And the CHAMP Act explicitly states that it provides no federal funding for Medicaid or CHIP for undocumented immigrants and requires audits of all State programs to ensure that federal funds are not being spent on undocumented children. 
   The CHAMP Act will protect and improve Medicare by increasing fiscal responsibility and ensuring access to doctors for seniors and those with disabilities. Currently experts agree that Medicare Advantage (MA) plans receive, on average, 12 percent more than the cost of care in traditional Medicare. Overpayments to certain plans can exceed 50 percent. By phasing out these overpayments over the next four years the Congressional Budget Office estimates that billions of dollars will be saved each year. While, increasing the solvency of Medicare and simultaneously reversing the catastrophic 10% payment cuts to physicians who serve Medicare patients. By reducing overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, wasteful spending will be reduced while increasing patient access to physicians. 
   Medicare Advantage plans originally sought to give beneficiaries more choices at a lower cost. However, overpayments to MA plans do not increase benefits but rather pay for the administrative costs, marketing costs and profits for private plans. The CHAMP Act levels the playing field by decreasing premiums for those enrolled in traditional Medicare. 
   By curbing the overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, this legislation decreases the cost for preventative health services for seniors, eliminating co-payments and deductibles for these vital services while saving lives and money. Further, this bill includes $3 billion for the rural health care safety net. This ensures access to quality care for those in rural America. 
   The health of our children is vital to the success of our society. The CHAMP act will raise the federal tobacco tax by 45 cents. According to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a 45-cent increase means that 1,381,000 fewer children will take up smoking. Adults, too, would be less likely to smoke, which means fewer smoking-related illnesses and lower health costs. Estimates are that this tobacco tax increase will result in long-term health savings of $32.4 billion and 669,000 fewer smoking related deaths. 
   The CHAMP Act has the support of the American Medical Association, American Association of Retired Persons, Catholic Health Association, National Rural Health Association, American Hospital Association, Federation of American Hospitals, American Nurses Association, Families USA, National Partnership for Women and Families, Children's Defense Fund, Child Welfare League of America, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. 
   I am proud to vote for this bill that seeks to protect those that are most vulnerable in our society by increasing health insurance coverage for low-income children and protecting and improving coverage for those enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   I applaud Chairman SKELTON for his leadership in guiding this bill to the floor today. He and Ranking Member HUNTER have done a tremendous job, and they have been ably supported by the expert staff of our committee. 
   I'm grateful to Chairman SKELTON for working with me to include things important for Colorado, including limits on how the Army can pursue possible expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in Colorado. I agree with Senator SALAZAR and others in the Colorado delegation that any expansion, if it takes place at all, must be conducted in a way that it is a win-win situation for the Army and for Colorado and that any expansion plan should not involve condemnation of private land. My proposal will shine a necessary caution light before the Army charges forward, and force the Army to do what it has so far failed to do--that is, to make a compelling case for why the proposed expansion is necessary to meet the training needs of our soldiers in the 21st century. 
   Other provisions I offered in the bill include--funding for a new squadron operations facility for the Colorado Air National Guard; promoting agreement between the Air Force and the city of Pueblo about flight operations at the Pueblo airport; urging the Defense Department to use on-site disposal of chemical weapons stockpiled at the Pueblo Chemical Depot; asking the Army to track pilots who train at the High-Altitude Aviation Training School in Eagle, Colorado; and reporting on opportunities for leveraging Defense Department funds with States' funds to prevent disruption in the event of electric grid or pipeline failures and encouraging the Defense Department to leverage Energy Savings Performance Contracts with Energy Conservation Investment Program funds to provide additional opportunity for renewable energy projects; and naming a housing facility at Fort Carson in honor of our former colleague Joel Hefley. 
   I am also pleased that the committee adopted two of my amendments, including one to repeal a provision adopted last year that makes it easier for the president to federalize the National Guard for domestic law enforcement purposes during emergencies. By repealing this, my amendment restores the role of the Governors with regard to this subject. My other amendment will continue the office of the Ombudsman that assists people claiming benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) and expands its authority. 
    Mr. Chairman, this bill rightly focuses on our military's readiness needs. After 5 years at war, both the active duty and reserve forces are stretched to their limits. The bill will provide what's needed to respond, including a substantial Strategic Readiness Fund, adding funds for National Guard equipment and training, and establishing a Defense Readiness Production Board to mobilize the industrial base to address equipment shortfalls. 
   It also provides important funds for the Base Realignment and Closure process, including $62 million to assist communities expected to absorb large numbers of personnel as a result of the BRAC decision. This funding is especially important to Colorado, given that Fort Carson in Colorado Springs will add 10,000 soldiers and will be home to 25,000 troops by 2009. 
   The bill provides substantial resources to improve protection of our troops, including additional funds for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, body armor, and up-armored Humvees for our troops in the field. The bill enlarges the Army and Marine Corps, consistent with the Tauscher-Udall Army expansion bill in the last Congress. And it will provide for a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for service members, boost funding for the Defense Health Program, and prohibit increasing TRICARE and pharmacy user fee increases. 
   The bill incorporates provisions from the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, which recently passed the House and was driven by the revelations of mistreatment and mismanagement at Walter Reed Army Medical  Center. These provisions establish new requirements to provide the people, training, and oversight needed to ensure high-quality care and efficient administrative processing at Walter Reed and throughout the active duty military services. The bill also establishes a Military Mental Health Initiative to coordinate all mental health research and development within the Defense Department, and establishes a Traumatic Brain Injury Initiative to allow emerging technologies and treatments to compete for funding. 
   Given the increased use of the National Guard and Reserves in recent years, the bill gives important new authorities to the National Guard to fulfill its expanded role, including authorizing a fourth star for the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, making the National Guard Bureau a joint activity of the Department of Defense, and creating a bipartisan Council of Governors to advise the President on how best to use the National Guard for civil support missions. The bill also requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to consider how to incorporate more National Guard and Reserve personnel into positions at Northern Command, based in Colorado. 
   I'm pleased that the bill fully supports the goals of the Department of Energy nonproliferation programs and the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction program, consistent with the 9/11 Commission recommendations. The bill also slows development of a Reliable Replacement Warhead and the construction of a new plutonium production facility, and establishes a bipartisan commission to evaluate U.S. strategic posture for the future, including the role that nuclear weapons should play in our national security strategy. 
   I also want to mention funding for missile defense in the bill. The bill increases missile defense funding for systems that address current needs and vulnerabilities, while reducing funding for less mature and higher risk systems. The cuts in missile defense programs in the bill have been cause for concern among some on the other side of the aisle. But the bill funds 93 cents of every dollar of the President's missile defense request, so the cuts are far from extreme. It fully funds the budget request for the Patriot PAC-3 missile, the Ground Based Missile Defense System, and THAAD development and deployment, and adds funding for Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense. But it makes reductions to the Airborne Laser program and funding for the 3rd BMD Site which the Administration has proposed building in Eastern Europe. 
   Importantly, the bill provides for an independent study to examine the political, technical, operational, force structure, and budgetary aspects of the proposed European missile defense deployment; an independent study to examine the future roles and missions of the Missile Defense Agency; a two year extension of the requirement for GAO to annually assess the missile defense program; and assurance that the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has access to all MDA operational test evaluation information. 
   In my view, the bill strikes the right balance with regard to missile defense. I did not support the amendment by Representative FRANKS to increase missile defense funds because I believe the Committee takes a better approach in its bill. Likewise, I did not support the amendment offered by Representative TIERNEY to decrease missile defense funds because I thought it went too far in the other direction. There are emerging and real, near-term threats facing the Nation, the warfighter, and our allies that we need to be able to counter, so I think it would be irresponsible to terminate the longer-term missile defense as Representative TIERNEY's amendment proposed to do. 
   Finally but no less importantly, the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed report on the implementation of the Joint Campaign Plan for Iraq, on national reconciliation efforts on the part of the Iraqi government, and on metrics to measure American efforts in Iraq, based on assessments by GEN David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker. The bill also requires the Secretary to produce a report outlining the direction of U.S. activities in Afghanistan along with indicators of progress, and the bill establishes a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. 
    Mr. Chairman, the bill we are considering today does an excellent job of balancing the need to sustain our current warfighting abilities with the need to prepare for the next threat to our national security. It is critical that we are able to meet the operational demands of today even as we continue to prepare our men and women in uniform to be the best trained and equipped force in the world. 
   This is a good bill, a carefully drafted and bipartisan bill, and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this conference report because it will begin the process of changing our budgetary course. While it is not identical to the version passed by the House earlier this year, like that resolution it is clearly preferable to budgets adopted by the House in previous years. 
   For the 6 years before the convening of this 110th Congress, the administration and the Republican leadership insisted on speeding ahead with misguided fiscal and economic policies. Ignoring all warning lights, they plowed ahead, taking us from projections of surpluses to the reality budgets deep in deficit and heaping higher the mountain of debt that our children will have to repay. 
   Many of us said it was urgent to stop persisting in that error and voted for alternatives, including those proposed by the Blue Dog Caucus. 
   But year after year our Republican colleagues insisted on taking their marching orders from the White House, moving in lockstep to endorse the Bush administration's insistence that its economic and fiscal policies must continue without change. 
   I admired their discipline, but I could not support their insistence on driving us deeper into the swamp of fiscal irresponsibility that has left a debt burden of more than $30,000 for a typical middle-income family of four in Colorado. 
   But that was then--and now, in this new Congress under new management, by passing this conference report we can begin to undo the damage they have done. The conference report is better in its fiscal responsibility and in its priorities. 
   It follows the tough ``pay as you go'' budget rules to begin to reverse the budget deficits and to put us onto the path to a balanced budget. And under this plan, by 2012, domestic discretionary funding would fall to the lowest level, as a share of the economy, in at least a half century while spending as a percentage of GDP will be lower in 2012 than it has been in any budget adopted under President Bush--1 percent lower than it will be this year and lower than it has been in any year since 2001. 
   Despite assertion by its critics, the conference report does not include any tax increases. To the contrary, it supports tax relief that would benefit the middle class--including extension of the child tax credit, 10 percent bracket, and marriage penalty relief--and provides for estate tax reform. 
   And it provides for immediate Alternative Minimum Tax relief, preventing more than 20 million middle-class taxpayers from being hit by the tax. This is important because while in 2004 only 32,000 Colorado families were subject to the AMT, if nothing is done, this year that number will rise to 234,000 families in Colorado and hundreds of thousands more in other States. 
   At the same time, it takes steps to crack down on wasteful or fraudulent spending in Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance programs and it supports actions to collect unpaid taxes as well as providing additional resources to reduce claims backlogs in the Veterans Administration, Social Security Administration, and other agencies. 
   Further, it directs House committees to identify wasteful and lower priority spending that can be cut. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am particularly glad to note that the conference report is also realistic and responsible about the need to maintain our national defense and honor our promises to our troops and veterans. 
   In addition to meeting the needs of the active-duty force, it allows for increasing funding for veterans' health care and services by $6.7 billion above the 2007 enacted level, and $3.6 billion above the President's budget. 
   This is a priority for me, because it will help ensure that the 427,957 veterans in Colorado receive care worthy of their sacrifice. It is also critical for the 17,419 Coloradans, who have served their country in Afghanistan and Iraq since September 2001, many of whom will need VA health care services. 
   It also provides more funding for urgent homeland security needs and to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. In doing so, it rejects cuts to vital first responder and terrorism prevention programs that would happen if we adopted the President's budget for fiscal 2008. 
   Like the House-passed version, it recognizes the importance of research, development, and education in keeping our economy strong and our country secure. As a member of the Science and Technology Committee and chairman of its Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, I am particularly supportive of it for that reason--and as one of the Chairs of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I welcome its support for research and development of renewable and alternative energy technologies. 
   As for education, the conference report allows for substantially more funding for helping Colorado's public elementary, middle and high schools educate the 768,600 children now enrolled, with more resources to implement the No Child Left Behind Act, special education and Head Start. By contrast, if we followed the President's budget, 31,296 Colorado children would not receive promised help in reading and math and the Head Start program--which serves 9,820 Colorado children--would be cut by 1.5 percent below the 2007 level. 
   These investments to a growing economy for America's families are needed because, according to the Census Bureau, family income in Colorado has dropped by $4,041 since 2000, while health care and energy prices are climbing. But still more is needed. 
   So, I am glad that the conference report provides for increasing funding for State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--to help cover the 176,230 of Colorado's children who do not have health insurance. And because it is so important for Colorado's ranchers, farmers, and rural communities, I strongly support the part of the conference report that supports policies to strengthen the farm bill's economic benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can understand why the Bush Administration does not like this conference report. After all, it rejects the Administration's misguided priorities. But it's disappointing that so many of our Republican colleagues still are so willing to unquestioningly follow the President's lead. And, while I suppose it's to be expected, it's particularly unfortunate that they have decided to attack this conference report by resorting to recycling the old, tired and false claim that it is ``the largest tax increase in history.'' 
   But the facts are otherwise. The conference report does not affect the top-heavy tax cuts  the Bush administration and the Republican leadership pushed through since 2001--they remain in place as they stand, which means they will not expire for 4 years. 
   I did not vote for all of those tax cuts, but I did support some that are most important for middle-income Coloradans. So, I am glad that the conference report provides for extensions of those in 2011, including an extension of the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the ten percent individual income tax bracket. And when the rest of the tax cuts come up for reconsideration, Congress can and should consider whether to extend them, as they are now or in modified form. 
   I support that approach, which is quite different from the alternative approach that would have been taken by the Republican alternative that the House rightly rejected earlier this year. It would have insisted on locking in all of the Bush tax cuts--the ones I did not support as well as those I did--and would have put top priority on making them all permanent. 
   I did like some things in the Republican alternative--including a constitutionally-sound line-item veto similar to my Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures (``SLICE'') legislation--but overall I thought it was not a responsible approach and I could not support it, just as I could not support the other alternatives debated in the House. 
   Regarding one of those alternatives, in reviewing the formal record of rollcall 209, the vote on the Kilpatrick substitute, I found I am recorded as having voted ``yes.'' However, I had intended to vote ``no,'' and my recollection is that I did vote ``no.'' 
   Unlike all those alternatives, and like the resolution passed by the House, this conference report is well balanced in its combination of fiscal responsibility and refocusing priorities. I will support it and I urge its approval by the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, in my view an act of violence against one person is an act of violence against all of us Our actions toward each other should--and our policies as a nation must--be based on compassion and understanding of human experiences if we are to truly have a nation of liberty and justice for all. 
   In other words, I think in our country all of us, regardless of our race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation, should be able to live our lives free from violence, intimidation, and discrimination. 
   That is why I believe Congress must pass legislation to make it more likely that people who are guilty of violent crimes based on bias are properly prosecuted, convicted, and punished. 
   The result will not be to end hate--nor to make hate a crime--but to establish that our government will not tolerate hate and bigotry that manifests itself in violence against anyone. 
   Because I support that result, since first coming to Congress I have cosponsored and voted for legislation similar to the measure now before us. 
   And that is why I will vote for this bill today. 
   The bill will amend the Federal criminal code to prohibit willfully causing bodily injury to any person because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of that person. 
   It also will authorize the Department of Justice to provide technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or other assistance to help local law enforcement agencies investigate and prosecute acts that are both crimes of violence under Federal law or a felony under State, local, or Indian tribal law; and also are motivated by prejudice based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim. And to further assist State, local, and tribal officials with the expenses related to hate crime cases, the bill would authorize the Attorney General to establish a grant program to be administered by the Office of Justice Programs that would have a particular focus on combating hate crime committed by juvenile offenders. 
   The bill also will broaden Federal coverage of hate crimes under two scenarios. First, under any circumstance, it will prohibit willfully inflicting bodily injury to any person, attempted or otherwise, through the use of fire, a firearm, explosive, or incendiary device, if such conduct were motivated on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person. Second, it will prohibit the same conduct, if such conduct were motivated on the basis of the victim's gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, in addition to the four bases covered by the first scenario, in circumstances involving specific jurisdictional ties to the Constitution's interstate commerce clause. 
   Under either scenario, offenders could be sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine, or for any term to life imprisonment if the crime resulted in the victim's death, or involved murder, kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, rape, or attempted rape. 
   The bill addresses two deficiencies in current law that limit the Federal Government's ability to work with State and local law enforcement agencies and have led to acquittals in some cases in which Federal jurisdiction has been asserted to backstop local efforts. 
   One is the fact that current Federal law provides no coverage for violent hate crimes committed because of the victim's perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability. The other is that current law requires proof that the crime was committed with the intent to interfere with the victim's participation in one of six specifically defined federally protected activities. The bill addresses both those limitations and provides the Justice Department tools to effectively act against bias-motivated violence by assisting States and local law enforcement agencies and by pursuing Federal charges where appropriate. This is the same approach Congress took in the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. 
   It is important to note that even after enactment of this bill, State and local authorities will deal with the overwhelming majority of hate crimes--and the bill is drafted to ensure that the Federal prosecution of hate crimes will be limited to cases that implicate the greatest Federal interest and present the greatest need for Federal intervention. 
   The bill is not intended to federalize all rapes, sexual assaults, acts of domestic violence, or other gender-based crimes. 
   In fact, for a hate crime case to be prosecuted federally, the Attorney General, or a high-ranking subordinate, would have to certify that pertinent state or local officials (1) were unable or unwilling to prosecute; (2) favored Federal prosecution; or (3) prosecuted, but the investigation or trial's results did not satisfy the Federal interest to combat hate crimes. 
   This certification requirement is intended to ensure that the Federal Government will assert the new hate crimes jurisdiction in a principled and properly limited fashion, consistent with procedures under the current Federal hate crimes statute. 
   It should also be noted that the bill respects and protects First Amendment rights. It will not bar or punish name-calling, verbal abuse or expressions of hatred toward any person or group--it deals only with violent criminal actions--and includes a provision explicitly stating that conduct protected under the speech and religious freedom clauses of the First Amendment is not subject to prosecution. In short, the bill does not criminalize speech or advocacy, and its enactment will not jeopardize anyone's right to associate, to denounce, to hold fast to a religious belief, or to do anything else protected by the Constitution's First Amendment. 
   Mr. Speaker, crimes motivated by bias are not as rare as many of us would like to think. Since 1991 the FBI has received reports of more than 113,000 hate crimes. In 2005, the latest year for which data are available, the FBI received reports from law enforcement agencies identifying 7,163 bias-motivated criminal incidents, with more than half being racially-motivated and others reflecting religious bias (17.1 percent), sexual orientation (14.2 percent) and ethnicity/national origin bias (13.7 percent). And, unfortunately, Colorado is not immune--in 2005 our state reported 59 crimes based on racial bias, 22 reflecting religious prejudice, 16 related to sexual orientation, 27 involving ethnic bias, and 1 involving a person's disability, and there have been more since then. 
   These sobering statistics demonstrate that the legislation before us is appropriate and necessary--especially because it is generally understood that hate crimes are often not reported as such. 
   Accordingly, I support the bill and urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANUFACTURING STIMULATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Chairman, I am pleased to support H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. 
   I am a cosponsor of this important legislation, which reauthorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST has not been completely reauthorized since 1992, yet it is the lead federal agency in much cutting-edge technology, such as semiconductor research and nanotechnology. 
   NIST is particularly important to me because one of its key laboratories is located in Boulder, Colorado, in my district. The Boulder labs employ more than 350 people and serve as a science and engineering center for significant research across the nation. 
   A critical component of this legislation is that it includes funding for construction at these laboratories. NIST's Boulder facilities have contributed to great scientific advances, but they are now over 50 years old and have not been well maintained. Many environmental factors such as the humidity and vibrations from traffic can affect the quality of research performed at NIST. In Fiscal Year 2007, NIST-Boulder will begin an extension of Building 1 to make room for a Precision Metrology lab. This new facility will allow for incredibly precise control of temperature, relative humidity, air filtration and vibration to advance research on critical technologies, such as atomic clocks telecommunications, and nanomaterials. To complete this extension, NIST will need further funding in Fiscal Year 2008 and Fiscal Year 2009. H.R. 1868 authorizes this critical funding. 
   The legislation also includes a needed funding increase for overall laboratory research at NIST. As part of the American Competitiveness initiative, NIST will use these funds to expand upon its world-class research, ensuring that the United States will continue to be globally competitive in many industries. 
   I am also Pleased to see that the legislation reauthorizes and gradually increases funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. The MEP program has a network of centers across the nation to help small and medium-sized manufacturers develop and commercialize their research. Minimal Federal investment has yielded substantial benefits to manufacturers across the country. 
   In Colorado, the Colorado Association for Manufacturing and Technology (CAMT) hosts the Colorado MEP (CMEP) program and has helped Colorado's more than 6,000 manufacturers save millions of dollars. Over the last 6 years, CMEP has decreased costs for Colorado manufacturers by almost $17 million and increased sales by more than $4 million--so I believe that this is a program that we must continue to support. 
   This legislation also replaces the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) with the Technology Innovation Program (TIP). The ATP has been a valuable resource to small manufacturers by funding technology development. The TIP will build upon and improve this program to help small U.S. manufacturers remain competitive in the increasingly competitive global market. 
   I would like to thank Technology and Innovation Subcommittee Chairman Wu and Ranking Member Gingrey, as well as Science and Technology Chairman Gordon, for introducing this critical legislation and working to bring it to the floor today. 
   In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1868.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, there are many things that can be said against this continuing resolution, as the House has heard during today's debate. But after all those things have been said, I am convinced the only responsible choice is to vote for it--and I will do so. 
   In fact, it was the failure of responsibility on the part of last year's Republican leadership in Congress that brought us to where we find ourselves today. If they had done their job of developing and enacting the legislation to fund the essential functions of government, it would not be necessary for us to be acting now to make up for their failures. 
   In fairness, much of the blame rests with the Republican-led Senate. While the House last year did pass all but one of the regular appropriations bills, only two of those bills ever received a final vote in the other body--and only those two were enacted into law. 
   But even here in the House, the Republican leadership never even brought to the floor the bill to fund the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services--not before the election, evidently because they did not want to have to discuss it during their campaigns, but not even in the lame-duck session last year. 
   Given the situation the resulted from their predecessors' failure, Chairman OBEY and his colleagues on the Appropriations Committee decided that the best way to proceed was to bring forward this long-term continuing resolution, intended to complete action on appropriations for the remainder of this fiscal year, and then to begin work on the appropriations bills for the fiscal year that lies ahead. 
   I support that decision, and I will support this continuing resolution. 
   There are parts of it that I think fall short of what should be done in a number of areas. But there are other parts that I strongly support, including the provision that withholds any increase in the pay of Members of Congress--something that I think is overdue. 
   More than a year ago--in October of 2005--I urged the House's conferees to agree to a Senate amendment to the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill that would have withheld a cost of living raise for Members of Congress. I regret that my plea was in vain, because I think we should be prepared to do our part when our country is at war, our homeland security must be improved, and the federal budget remains deep in deficit. 
   Withholding a congressional pay raise will make only a small change in the budget because the amount involved is minor compared with other expenditures. However, I think it is an appropriate first step for Members of Congress to forego this increase in our pay, and I am glad this legislation will have that effect. 
   I also am very pleased that the resolution includes $300 million in additional funding for the Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE, programs. My colleague Representative PERLMUTTER and I worked hard to get this funding included in the legislation, and I intend to work closely with  our colleagues in Congress and with the Department of Energy to ensure that the research programs carried out at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, in Colorado benefit from a good deal of those funds. 
   Despite the importance of NREL's work, flat or decreased funding for NREL in recent years--coupled with earmarks and inflationary cost increases--has effectively reduced the funding for renewable energy research, which has led to a continuing struggle for needed resources and great instability at the lab. This in turn has severely affected the lab's ability to develop new technologies and continue the United States' leadership in renewable energy technologies. The boost for EERE funding in this bill could go a long way toward helping NREL regain its critical momentum. 
   The parts of the legislation dealing with defense and national security include increased funding for defense health programs, for basic allowance for housing, and for two important Department of Energy nonproliferation programs--the International Nuclear Material Protection and Cooperation program, which secures weapons-grade nuclear materials in the former Soviet States, and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, which secures high-risk nuclear material around the world. 
   It also includes $2.5 billion for implementation of a round of military base closures authorized in 2005. While the $2.5 billion is an increase from the funding provided for fiscal year 2006, it will still leaves us $3.1 billion short of meeting our Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, commitments and nearly $1 billion short of the funds needed for military construction projects. Since the Army links its military construction and troop movement plans to BRAC implementation, this shortfall could have broad impacts on the rotation and return of troops and the building of new brigades. 
   It has been indicated that additional needs for BRAC and military housing will be addressed in the supplemental war spending bill we will soon consider in Congress. I hope that will be the case, and will work to achieve that result as well as to ensure that the Defense Department takes into account Colorado priorities as it makes the hard choices about which military construction projects to fund. 
   I also am pleased that Chairman OBEY and his colleagues recognized the importance of science programs across different agencies, allowing for increases at the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST. 
   However, I am greatly concerned about the impact this resolution could have on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. 
   In my district, NOAA operates the Earth System Research Laboratory, which has the largest concentration of NOAA research staff in the Nation--300--as well as the largest concentration of university staff funded by NOAA research, for a total of 1,000 Federal and contract employees. NOAA's programs in Boulder include the Space Environment Center, which provides essential space weather forecasting services; the NOAA Profiler Network, which gathers key weather information for a range of other agencies, including the Departments of Defense and Transportation; and the National Geophysical Data Center, the world's largest archive of geophysical data on observations of earth from space. 
   Funding for NOAA under previous continuing-resolution levels saw significant decreases, so I am pleased that overall the agency will see a return to the funding levels provided for fiscal year 2006. However, it is unclear how this will be distributed, and so there is a possibility that many important programs will not be adequately funded. I believe that we will have to work to address these issues when we consider the appropriation bills for fiscal year 2008. 
   NIST also has a significant presence in Colorado. The NIST facilities at Boulder have contributed to great scientific advances, but these facilities are now over fifty years old and have not been well maintained. Many environmental factors such as the humidity and vibrations from traffic can affect the quality of research performed in the NIST labs. Scientists have difficulty conducting cutting edge research in labs that have leaking roofs. NIST has included building renovations as a priority in past budgets, yet the final budgets have included so many earmarks that the agency's needs have not been met. The absence of similar earmarks from this resolution means that NIST may finally be able to address some of its most dire needs, including renovations of the Boulder facilities. I will work to ensure that much of the nearly $60 million in the NIST construction budget will be dedicated to renovating these facilities. 
   The appropriators had many tough choices to make with regards to funding the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA. Balancing the needs of the different NASA programs is critical and I appreciate that the appropriators realized that congressional intent needs to be clear and specific to ensure that no one program is completely devastated by funding cuts. While I am pleased that the decline in aeronautics research funding will be halted, I am also concerned about the cuts to the science and exploration programs, as well as to the space operations. It is not yet clear how NASA will accommodate these cuts. NASA is important to the Nation, and I will continue to push for adequate funding from my position as chairman of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science and Technology Committee. 
   Education is vital to our country's youth and our economic future and I am pleased that the appropriators have provided several important programs with funding increases that will help keep our country strong. These include increases above the fiscal 2006 funding levels for Pell Grants, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, and Head Start. Furthermore, the appropriators made a step in the right direction by increasing funding in Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB. 
   And I am pleased that by this resolution the Federal-aid highway program, in the Federal Highway Administration, is fully funded at the level guaranteed in the Safe, Accountable Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU, with an obligation limitation of $39.1 billion for fiscal 2007, $3.5 billion over the fiscal 2006 enacted level. 
   So, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I think Chairman OBEY and his colleagues deserve the thanks of the House for the work they have done to clear away the rubble left by the Republican leadership last year and to replace it with a firm foundation on which to build in the future. Adoption of this resolution will write an end to last year's sorry story and take the first step on a better, more responsible approach to carrying out our duties as legislators. I urge approval of the joint resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate legislative responsibility for the District of Columbia. 
   However, through enactment of the DC Home Rule Act Congress has authorized the residents of the District to elect a Mayor and City Council to be responsible for the day-to-day exercise of that authority. 
   I respect the intent of home rule because I think residents of Washington, DC--like residents of Colorado--should be able to govern themselves so far as consistent with the ability of the Federal Government to function. 
   And I think this principle of home rule for DC is made all the more important because the residents of the District are not fully represented here in Congress. 
   So, I have some hesitation supporting legislation that would in effect shape policies for the District of Columbia without the involvement of its elected officials. 
   However, I am supporting H.R. 6842 today because any flaws in its approach can be corrected as the legislative process continues and because I think it is needed in order to send a strong message to the District government to move promptly to revise its laws to reflect the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of DC v. Heller and thus to assure that the second amendment rights of the District's residents are not infringed. 
   That is the purpose of this legislation--one that I support, because complying with our oath to support and defend the Constitution is the first duty of all Members of Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to also acknowledge Mr. Marshall and the powerful sentiments he just shared with all of us. Mr. Speaker, this debate is long overdue. It is our first extended and substantive debate on the war in Iraq since Congress gave the President the authority to invade more than 4 years ago. 
   But if we do nothing more than debate the President's escalation plan, we will not keep faith with the American people who rightly expect this new Congress to bring our costly involvement in Iraq to a close. And while the resolution before us is largely symbolic and nonbinding, it can be, I think it should be, the opening part of a longer, thoughtful debate about our long-term national interests not only Iraq but the entire Middle East. 
   So this resolution is a start. And I will vote for it because I agree with the message it sends. The resolution expresses disapproval of the President's sending more troops to Iraq, an action that is contrary to the wise advice of the Iraq Study Group, critical members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and experienced military commanders like former Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
   The President's escalation is most likely too small to be effective, and adopting new counterinsurgency tactics comes 2 years too late. The resolution, in my opinion, represents the correct response to these facts. It expresses support for our brave men and women in uniform, but disagreement with the policy of military escalation. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we speak here today, the death toll in Iraq rises, and the war continues to drain our national Treasury, stretch our Armed Forces, and weaken our capacity to effectively counter Islamic terrorism. Congress needs to send the message that things must change. 
   I opposed the Bush administration's decision to go to war in Iraq, and I have never once regretted that vote. But today we must focus on the future. We cannot move the clock back, but we need to avoid making a bad situation worse. We should not be scaling up our military mission in Iraq, we should be scaling back. We need to make the U.S. military footprint lighter, not in order to hasten defeat or failure in Iraq, but to salvage a critical measure of security and stability in a region of the world that we can ill afford to abandon. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I know about the pressure on our active duty and National Guard and Reserve soldiers. They lack enough equipment and training. They are experiencing multiple or extended deployments and limited time at home between deployments. But to be successful our men and women must be properly trained, equipped, and ready to deploy worldwide quickly. 
   Shortfalls in personnel, equipment, or training increases the risk to our troops and to their mission. In short, this administration's policies have brought us to the point where we not only cannot sustain an escalation in Iraq, but also we are not fully prepared for other contingencies. 
   But that is not the only reason I oppose the escalation. I do not think the President's rationale for it makes sense, no matter our readiness levels. The just-released National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq agrees that the term ``civil war'' accurately describes what is happening in Iraq, and suggests that the conflict may in fact be worse than a civil war. 
   Putting more Americans at risk is not a recipe for victory. And as a new Foreign Relations Council report notes, we bear responsibility for developments within Iraq, but are increasingly without the ability to shape those developments in a positive direction. 
   So what should be the way forward? For one, I believe a reduction of military forces in Iraq and a phased redeployment of our Armed Forces to border regions like Anbar and the Kurdish areas of Iraq would be effective. That can give us flexibility to act militarily in Iraq if necessary, but will also increase the pressure on the Iraqi Government to move toward political reconciliation. 
   I do not think an immediate withdrawal of American forces or setting a date certain for withdrawal makes sense, but neither does an open-ended commitment for American blood and treasure. And as bad as the situation is in Iraq, we must work to avoid a collapse in the region. Not only because we have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq, but also because our national security has been badly compromised by the Bush administration's failures. 
   We should adopt the main policy recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, including stronger efforts of diplomacy in the region. It is not in the interests of any nation to have Iraq descend into further civil war and chaos. As challenging as diplomacy is in the Middle East, I believe the sacrifice of our soldiers demand that we engage in serious regional talks, including those with our adversaries Syria and Iran. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am convinced we must reach for bipartisanship in crafting our policy in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, the stakes in Iraq are very high.  The outcome in this region will have consequences for future generations that will long outlive those of us who are in Congress today. 
   Great leaders acknowledge mistakes, learn and chart a new course. For the sake of future generations and to keep faith with the generations that built America, let us be a Nation of great leaders.  
   Mr. Speaker, this is the first significant debate we have had on the war in Iraq since Congress passed the President's request for an authorization to invade Iraq more than four years ago. And even though our debate today is on a largely symbolic question--a non-binding resolution disapproving the President's announced plan for moving additional troops to Iraq--I believe it ought to serve as the beginning of a deeper and more thoughtful debate about our long-term national interests in the Middle East, and Iraq. 
   If all we do is debate the wisdom of a surge, we will not keep faith with the American people, who rightly expect this new Congress to bring our costly involvement in the Iraq war to a close. 
   Nevertheless, I will support this resolution disapproving the president's call for additional troops in Iraq because it runs contrary to the wise advice of the Iraq Study Group (the Baker-Hamilton Commission), critical members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and experienced military commanders like former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, on the best strategic approach in Iraq. The President's plan calls for an infusion of additional soldiers--probably too few to have the desired outcome--and utilizing counterinsurgency tactics that are two years too late and that I believe will be ineffective in the context of the civil war that has emerged in Iraq. 
   We are also expecting General David Petraeus and our troops to operate under a complicated joint command structure with Iraqi forces and political leaders that is unprecedented in our military history and undermines the ``unity of command'' rule in warfare. And all this comes at a time when the death toll in Iraq is rising and the war continues to drain our national treasury, stretches our armed forces, and decreases--rather than enhances--our ability to wage an effective war against Islamic terrorism. Even as we debate a ``surge'' in Iraq, we should not forget Afghanistan. We will win there if we redouble our efforts now. 
   I opposed the Bush Administration's decision to go to war in Iraq and I have never once regretted that vote. Today, we cannot move the clock back, but we can surely avoid making a bad situation worse. We should not be scaling up our military mission in Iraq--we should be scaling back. We need to make the U.S. military footprint lighter--not in order to hasten defeat or failure in Iraq, but to salvage a critical measure of security and stability in a region of the world that we can ill afford to abandon. 
   I say this as a Member of the Armed Services Committee who understands the pressures on our active duty and National Guard and reserve soldiers, including a lack of equipment and training, multiple or extended deployments, and limited time at home between deployments. To be successful, U.S. forces must be trained, equipped, and ready to quickly deploy worldwide. Shortfalls in personnel, equipment, or training increase the risk to our troops and to their mission. By all measurements, we are not in a position to sustain an escalation of troops. 
   But I don't believe the President's rationale for the ``surge'' makes sense, no matter our readiness levels. The just-released National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq agrees that the term ``civil war'' accurately describes aspects of the Iraq conflict and goes further in suggesting that the conflict may in fact, be more complicated and worse than a civil war. Putting more American troops at risk in this kind of setting is not a recipe for victory; it is only a prescription for quagmire. As a new Foreign Relations Council report notes, we bear responsibility for developments within Iraq, but are increasingly without the ability to shape those developments in a positive direction. 
   So what should be the way forward? How should Congress respond? 
   I believe a policy aimed at escalating diplomatic and political efforts is preferable to one that continues to rely on our soldiers to carry the heavy burden of nation-building--a mission that soldiers are ill-equipped for without strong international support, particularly in the midst of civil war and sectarian violence. That is why I favor a reduction of military forces in Iraq, and a phased redeployment of our armed forces to border regions in places like Anbar province and the Kurdish areas of Iraq, which should give us some flexibility to respond militarily should circumstances require it, but will also increase the pressure on the Iraqi government to move toward political reconciliation and stability. 
   I do not believe an immediate withdrawal of American forces or setting a date certain for withdrawal makes sense, but neither does an open-ended commitment of American blood and treasure. 
   As bad as the situation is in Iraq, however, we must work to avoid a collapse in the region--not only because we have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq, but also because our national security has been so badly compromised by the Bush Administration's failures there. The President's decision to take the Nation to war has made our country less safe. We need to change course and chart a path that enhances our national security and sets the right priorities for the war on terrorism and struggle against extremists. 
   To do this, I believe Congress should pass a resolution that embodies the main policy elements of the Baker-Hamilton Commission, including a call for stronger efforts at diplomacy in the region and internationally. It is not in the interests of any nation to have Iraq descend into further civil war and chaos. As challenging as diplomacy is in the Middle East, I believe the sacrifice of our soldiers demands that we engage in serious regional talks, including talks with our adversaries, Syria and Iran. 
   Finally, I believe we must reach for bipartisanship in crafting our policy in Iraq. The President misguidedly took us into war on the eve of a bitter national election. We must try hard not to compound this error by turning a debate on Iraq into a partisan game of one-upmanship where legitimate disagreement with the Administration's plan for escalation is called a betrayal of our troops or where resistance to immediate withdrawal is called war-mongering. 
   For my part, I intend to speak out loudly and often for a responsible withdrawal strategy in Iraq, but I will also offer proposals that are aimed at finding common ground. I will be introducing legislation that looks beyond the ``surge'' and toward the necessary and inevitable contingency planning that will be needed if we are to avoid deeper and more catastrophic scenarios in Iraq and the region. 
   Mr. Speaker, the stakes in Iraq are very high. The outcome in this region will have consequences for future generations that will long outlive those of us who are in Congress today. Great leaders acknowledge mistakes, learn, and chart a new course. For the sake of future generations and to keep faith with the generations that built America, let us be a Nation of great leaders.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MEJA EXPANSION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2740, the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act. This bill would increase accountability for the actions of the estimated 180,000 contractors now working in Iraq. 
   The September 16 incident in Iraq--in which 17 Iraqis died when Blackwater security contractors were accused of shooting at civilians indiscriminately--is only the latest in a string of such incidents involving Blackwater. This week a House Committee reported that Blackwater guards had engaged in 195 shooting incidents since early 2005, and in over 80 percent of those incidents, the Blackwater guards fired first. Several guards testified that Blackwater employees fired more often than the report states. 
   The good news is that the Defense Department, the State Department, and the FBI have all undertaken investigations and are viewing the September 16 incident more seriously than they have viewed other such incidents in the past--perhaps because of the Iraqi government's threat to ban Blackwater from the country. 
   But this incident highlights the many problems with private security contractors in Iraq. Contracting out inherently governmental security functions to private security firms is yet another example of the excessive outsourcing that has gone on in the Bush administration--and the billions in contract costs and lack of accountability that have followed as a result. 
   Initially these contractors were brought in to fulfill a temporary need, but now that Blackwater and other private firms are very much part of the fabric of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, we need to ensure that they are held accountable for their actions on the job. 
   One of Ambassador Paul Bremer's last actions as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority was to issue Order 17, which states that private contractors working for the United States or coalition governments in Iraq are not subject to Iraqi law. But as we have found, it's not clear to what degree they are subject to U.S. law either. 
   That's why the law needs to be clarified and expanded. The MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act amends the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to ensure that all contractors working in war zones--not just those working for the Department of Defense--are accountable under U.S. criminal law, and mandates that the FBI enforce MEJA by investigating and prosecuting offenses. 
   The point of this legislation is not simply to penalize those private security contractors who act as though they are above the law, though that would be the direct effect of this bill. The point is also to ensure that the actions of these contractors don't jeopardize their own safety and the safety of our military men and women in Iraq, who do operate under strict rules of engagement and who are held accountable for their actions. 
   Madam Chairman, I don't mean to diminish the risks faced by these contractors day in and day out. I understand that they are often forced to make split-second decisions that can mean life or death for themselves and for those around them. But as the events of September 16 have shown, the repercussions of these decisions can be far-reaching. There must be accountability and consequences for decisions made--whether in the middle of a war zone or under other circumstances. Private security contractors are not entitled to immunity from our laws. That's why I will support this bill today.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (COMMENDING THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY FOR ITS WORK OF PROMOTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR 30 YEARS -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 251, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, in Colorado. The facility serves our Nation as the chief research laboratory for energy efficiency and renewable energy for the Department of Energy. As the co-chair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I am proud to celebrate this organization and its invaluable work to set our country on a course towards sustainable energy practices. 
   The range of research areas at NREL is remarkable; from hydrogen-storing carbon nanotubes for fuel cell-powered vehicles to architectural computer design tools for low-energy construction to ``smart windows'' which automatically tint in order to cut the cost of air conditioning, NREL has developed cutting-edge technology for 30 years. NREL's National Wind Technology Center, located in my district, has helped push forward development of more efficient and economic wind turbines, which are critical to making the wind industry an important player in our Nation's energy markets. NREL will continue to be a leader on important research and development in these critical areas. 
   NREL continues to be an important resource for the people of Colorado. NREL is a critical participant in the Colorado Renewable Energy Collaboratory Agreement, which also includes the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Colorado School of Mines and Colorado State University. The Collaboratory will not only advance new energy research, but it will also encourage quicker transfer of new technology to energy businesses. For example, the new Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, C2B2, partners NREL and the Collaboratory with Colorado businesses to help reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil while researching commercially viable biofuel technologies. 
   NREL and its employees continue a tradition of service to the community. Hundreds of NREL employees have completed over 43 community service projects in the past 5 years. NREL has focused community efforts for its 30th anniversary on helping the ``Family Tree'' organization, which provides assistance to the homeless and victims of domestic violence. 
   On a personal note, I have greatly enjoyed working with NREL scientists and staff, including NREL's former Director, Vice Admiral Richard Truly, and NREL's current Director, Dr. Dan Arvizu. I have great respect for both men and look forward to continuing to work with Dr. Arvizu for many years to come. 
   As the world demands sustainable energy solutions in a new era of energy awareness, I am confident that the talented scientists, engineers, and researchers at NREL will continue to lead our country and the world forward in expanding and improving our energy resources. I join my colleagues in recognizing NREL for its 30 years of service and look forward to many years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the ``National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act.'' This legislation does a great deal to expand safe and affordable housing opportunities for millions of American families. 
   The bill will initially allocate between $800 million to $1 billion annually to States and local communities for affordable housing projects for purposes such as construction and rehabilitation. Funds may also be used for both rental housing and for down payment and closing cost assistance by first-time homebuyers. 
   It would reach this worthy goal without increasing Government spending or the Federal deficit. The revenue of the fund is supported through fees from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the increase in the number of FHA loans provided for in legislation already passed by the House of Representatives. 
   This fund is also targeted; it must be used for low- and moderate-income families, below 80 percent of State or local median income. The bill also prohibits funds from being used for administrative costs or expenses, political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling, travel expenses, and preparation of or advice on tax returns. Any misuse of funds is required to be reimbursed. 
   This legislation, now more than ever, is worth supporting to expand affordable housing and mortgage loan opportunities for families at risk. I urge a ``yea'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill but must oppose the effort to add a provision dealing with the estate tax. 
   I have long supported reform of the estate tax, not its complete repeal. 
   I think we should change it in a way that will strike the right balance, protecting family-owned ranches, farms, and other small businesses while recognizing the need for fiscal responsibility in a time of war. 
   But the motion to recommit would have simply added to the bill a permanent repeal of the estate tax. I do not support that and cannot vote for it. 
   However, I can and will vote for the underlying bill, which will repeal the use of private debt collection companies to collect Federal income taxes, delay the application of an onerous 3 percent withholding requirement on Government payments, and discourage individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying taxes. 
   I am a cosponsor of H.R. 695, the Taxpayer Abuse and Harassment Prevention Act of 2007. Like the bill now before the House, it would amend the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into contracts with private collection agencies to collect unpaid taxes. I support that because of the numerous instances in which private collection agencies have been guilty of taxpayer harassment, abusive calling, and violations of taxpayer rights, the Fair Debt Collection Act, and taxpayer return disclosure protections. I understand that right now the Federal Trade Commission has 130 complaints likely to involve the private tax debt contractors, and the Taxpayer Advocate has many more. 
   In addition, H.R. 3056 would delay until December 31, 2011, the application of a recently-enacted provision requiring withholding of 3 percent of the value of government payments to contractors and small businesses for goods and services. Local governments from across Colorado have contacted me to urge that the requirement be repealed--and while this delay falls short of that, it will provide additional time for Congress to consider repeal or drastic revision of the requirement. 
   Finally, the bill would impose an immediate tax on individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship in order to avoid paying their taxes and enact a scaled-back version of the Treasury Department's proposal to increase penalties on failures by independent contractors to provide Form 1099 information returns. I think these are reasonable and appropriate provisions that deserve support.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2881 and urge its approval. 
   The version of H.R. 2881 that is before us today is the product of a constructive, bipartisan collaboration between the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Science and Technology Committee. 
   I want to express my appreciation for the fine work done by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members and staff, and in particular Chairman Jim Oberstar and Ranking Member John Mica, along with the Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee (and senior member of the Science and Technology Committee), Jerry Costello, and Ranking Minority member Tom Petri. I appreciate the cooperative efforts that made this merged bill possible. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Bart Gordon, Ranking Member Ralph Hall, and my good friend and Ranking Member on the space and aeronautics subcommittee, Representative Tom Feeney, for all of their hard work on H.R. 2698, the Federal Aviation R&D Reauthorization Act of 2007--which was unanimously passed by the Science and Technology Committee earlier this year and which has now been incorporated into the bill we are considering today. 
   The Science and Technology Committee majority and minority staff has done great work on this bill and I would like to thank them  as well, especially Richard Obermann, Ed Feddeman, Tim Athan, and John Piazza for their hard work. I am pleased that H.R. 2881 will reauthorize a range of important R&D activities at the FAA--including R&D related to aviation noise and emissions reduction--establish new R&D initiatives in some key areas, and include provisions aimed at strengthening the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) initiative and the interagency Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), which has the responsibility for planning and developing NextGen. 
   Because of my limited time, I would like to highlight just two of the new initiatives in the bill that I think are especially important. 
   First, the bill establishes an interagency research program to better understand the impact of aviation on climate change. This is a serious matter, with both economic and quality-of-life implications, and thus I believe that this research effort is critically important. 
   Second, the bill establishes a multi-agency research program to conduct research on the impacts of space weather on aviation and air passengers. This is motivated by the increased importance of space weather to aviation, especially with the increased incidence of flight operations over the polar regions. 
   Mr. Chairman, while I could spend all my time discussing the important provisions from H.R. 2698 that have been included in H.R. 2881, I would be remiss if I did not discuss several other features of the bill that I think are important. It is clear, I think, that enhancing the Nation's aviation needs while addressing unique challenges of individual communities is not an easy task. I believe that this bill moves our Nation's air transportation system forward while being understanding of the obstacles that face each state and locality. 
   In June, the Department of Transportation (DOT) reported that only 72.5 percent of domestic flights by the largest U.S. airlines arrived on-time from January to April of this year. This is the worst showing since DOT began reporting on-time performance in 1995. Robust investment in aviation infrastructure is crucial to increase air capacity and decrease fight delays. I am pleased that this bill provides for increased funding for a number of FAA capital programs, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). 
   Passage of this legislation is vital to the health of the Nation's air transportation system and the continued economic vitality of Colorado. I am especially pleased that the bill designates a program within FAA to improve safety and efficiency of radar coverage in mountainous areas. While the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the FAA have already begun such an endeavor, this bill will further cement and provide funding for enhanced radar coverage at mountain airports in Colorado and elsewhere. Not only will this program increase safety but it will also provide multi-modal benefits by reducing congestion on highways due to flight diversions or denied service. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is no exaggeration to say that the Nation's air transportation system is critical to our economic well-being, our international competitiveness, and our quality of life. I believe that H.R. 2881 will help maintain its continued vitality and safety, and I urge Members to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (AMT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill--as I did for a similar measure last month--because of the urgent need to protect middle-income families from a massive tax increase that will hit them if we do not act to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. 
   The bill is not quite the same as H.R. 3996, which I voted for and which the House passed on November 9th. But it resembles that bill--and differs from the version passed by the Senate--in one very important respect: it is fiscally responsible. 
   The Senate has voted for a bill that does not even attempt to offset the costs of changing the AMT. 
   I think that should not be our first choice, because for too long the Bush Administration and its allies in Congress have followed that course--their view, in the words of Vice President CHENEY, has been that ``deficits don't matter.'' 
   I disagree. I think deficits do matter, because they result in one of the worst taxes--the ``debt tax,'' the big national debt that must be repaid, with interest, by future generations. I think to ignore that is irresponsible and falls short of the standard to which we, as trustees for future generations, should hold ourselves. 
   So, I think that the House pass this bill and give the Senate a second chance to reach that standard. 
   It may be that our colleagues at the other end of the Capitol will not take advantage of that opportunity, and it may be that in the end the urgency of protecting middle-income families from the AMT will take priority over correcting the mistaken policies of the last 7 years. 
   But at least for today, we should not give up hope that better judgment will prevail and so we should vote for this bill as it stands.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference report. 
   I applaud Chairman Skelton for his leadership in guiding this conference report to the floor today. He and Ranking Member Hunter have done a tremendous Job, and they have been ably supported by the expert staff of our committee. 
   I'm particularly grateful to Chairman Skelton for working with me to include things important for Colorado, including: a provision to keep the cleanup of the Pueblo Chemical Depot on track and fully funded; a review of DOD's training requirements for helicopter operations in high-altitude conditions, a provision that will help the High-Altitude Army National Guard Training Site in my district to establish its need for additional training helicopters; language requiring the Army to make its case for expansion at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site; an agreement between the Air Force and the city of Pueblo about flight operations at the Pueblo airport; a report on opportunities for leveraging Defense Department funds with States' funds to prevent disruption in the event of electric grid or pipeline failures; and restrictions on the move of key NORAD functions from Cheyenne Mountain to Peterson Air Force Base until security implications and promised cost savings are analyzed. 
   I am also pleased that the final bill includes two amendments I offered in committee, including one to repeal a provision adopted last year that makes it easier for the president to federalize the National Guard for domestic law enforcement purposes during emergencies. By repealing this, my amendment restores the role of the Governors with regard to this subject. My other amendment extends for 5 years the Office of the Ombudsman that assists people claiming benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, EEOICPA, which is so important for affected workers from the Rocky Flats site in my district. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill rightly focuses on our military's readiness needs. 
   After 5 years at war, both the active duty and reserve forces are stretched to their limits. The bill will provide what's needed to respond, including a substantial Strategic Readiness Fund, adding funds for National Guard equipment and training, requiring a plan for rebuilding our prepositioned stocks, and establishing a Defense Readiness Production Board to mobilize the industrial base to address equipment shortfalls. 
   It also provides important funds for the Base Realignment and Closure process, including additional funds to assist communities expected to absorb large numbers of personnel as a result of the BRAC decision. This funding is especially important to Colorado, given that Fort Carson in Colorado Springs will add 10,000 soldiers and will be home to 25,000 troops by 2009. 
   The bill provides substantial resources to improve protection of our troops, including additional funds for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles, body armor, lED jammers, and up-armored Humvees for our troops in the field. Consistent with the Tauscher-Udall Army expansion bill in the last Congress, the bill enlarges the Army and Marine Corps to help ease the strain on our troops and provides for an increase in National Guard personnel. And it will provide for a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for servicemembers, boost funding for the Defense Health Program, and prohibit increasing TRICARE and pharmacy user fee increases. 
   The bill incorporates provisions from the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, which passed the House earlier this year and was driven by the revelations of mistreatment and mismanagement at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. These provisions establish new requirements to provide the people, training, and oversight needed to ensure high-quality care and efficient administrative processing at Walter Reed and throughout the active duty military services. The bill also establishes a Military Mental Health Initiative to coordinate all mental health research and development within the Defense Department, and establishes a Traumatic Brain Injury Initiative to allow emerging technologies and treatments to compete for funding. 
   Given the increased use of the National Guard and Reserves in recent years, the bill gives important new authorities to the National Guard to fulfill its expanded role, including authorizing a fourth star for the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, making the National Guard Bureau a joint activity of the Department of Defense, and requiring that at least  one deputy of Northern Command be a National Guard officer. 
   The final bill also addresses ongoing problems of contracting fraud by tightening controls on managing contracts and improving whistleblower protections, as well as improving accountability in contracting by requiring public justification of the use of procedures that prevent full and open competition. 
   I'm pleased that the conference report fully supports the goals of the Department of Energy nonproliferation programs and the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction program, consistent with the 9-11 Commission recommendations. The bill also slows development of a Reliable Replacement Warhead and establishes a bipartisan commission to evaluate U.S. strategic posture for the future, including the role that nuclear weapons should play in our national security strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, the conference report we are considering today does an excellent job of balancing the need to sustain our current warfighting abilities with the need to prepare for the next threat to our national security. It is critical that we are able to meet the operational demands of today even as we continue to prepare our men and women in uniform to be the best trained and equipped force in the world. 
   This is a good bill, a carefully drafted and bipartisan bill, and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this conference report and urge its approval. 
   It deserves support for many reasons, beginning with its very existence--if it is approved we will have a final budget resolution in an election year for the first time for nearly a decade. 
   To govern is to choose, and one of the most basic responsibilities for those who want to be entrusted with positions of leadership is to make hard choices. This year, Chairman Spratt and his Budget Act colleagues--and their counterparts in the Senate--have demonstrated real leadership and have reached agreement on a conference report that will enable us to make the choices needed to keep us on a responsible budgetary path. 
   This conference report will make it possible for us to provide tax relief for the middle class; make needed investments in energy, education, innovation, and infrastructure; and to properly support our troops and veterans. And it does so while maintaining fiscal responsibility, because it complies with a strong pay-as-you-go rule and makes it possible to return the budget to surplus in 2012 and 2013, without raising taxes. 
   One of its best features, in my opinion, is the way it encourages investment in new businesses and industries that focus on renewable energy, clean fuel technology, and energy efficiency. This will create jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign energy, strengthen the economy, and ultimately help with high energy costs for consumers. 
   It also rejects the President's budget cuts to energy programs by providing for significant increases in programs such as weatherization assistance, renewable energy, and energy efficiency; and includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for energy legislation. 
   It also will enable us to continue working to retain and expand a skilled, technologically literate workforce and a strong research and development base. It provides for increasing funding for the Department of Education, and the National Institutes of Health. It also allows for more funding for science, space, and technology programs. 
   In addition, it sets the stage for much-needed investment in our nation's infrastructure, including more than President Bush has proposed for discretionary transportation accounts as well as full funding of Highway and Transit programs as authorized in the highway bill and funding for the Airport Improvement Program. All these are very important for Colorado, where the pressures of population growth have put severe strains on our highways, roads, and airports. 
   As a Member of the Armed Services Committee, I am particularly glad to be able. to support the conference report because it will enable us to provide the funding we need for national defense and to address the most critical threats facing our nation. It places a higher priority than the President's budget on programs such as Cooperative Threat Reduction and other nuclear nonproliferation programs, and on improving the quality of life for our troops and their families. 
   The conference report also recognized the need for higher funding levels for homeland security while rejecting the President's proposed cuts in law enforcement, the COPS program, firefighters, and other first responders. 
   And it takes an important step to help veterans get the quality health care they need and deserve by providing $3.3 billion more in discretionary funding for 2009 than the President's budget and $39 billion more over five years for veterans programs. 
   Similarly, it strengthens the safety net for those families most in need, allowing for more funding for home energy assistance (LIHEAP), for children's health, for nutrition assistance for women, infants, and children and for the Social Services Block Grant. And it accommodates legislation to reauthorize and expand the trade adjustment assistance program and to improve unemployment insurance. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that despite claims to the contrary, the conference report does not include any tax increases--in fact, it supports significant tax relief, including continued marriage penalty relief, child tax credit, and the 10 percent bracket, and provides for an additional year of tax relief for more than 20 million Americans who would otherwise be subjected to the Alternative Minimum Tax. 
   Nonetheless, some of our colleagues will object that it does not provide for making permanent all the tax cuts enacted since the Bush Administration took office. I supported  some of those cuts--including the 10 percent tax bracket, the increased child credit, and relief from the marriage penalty--all of which should be made permanent, but this conference report is not the place for an all-or-nothing approach to the entire list. We will have time later to consider which of the rest of President Bush's tax cuts should be extended. 
   Consistent with that more responsible approach, this conference report allows for only a small increase in revenues above the levels assumed in the President's budget--an increase that can be accomplished through closing loopholes that enable some corporations and affluent taxpayers to take advantage of offshore tax havens, and by doing a better job of collecting taxes that are already due under current law. 
   Mr. Speaker, seven years of fiscal irresponsibility have left a legacy of deficits and debt that it will take time and work to overcome. But the sooner we begin, the sooner we will complete the job of restoring fiscal responsibility and reordering our national priorities--and now is the time to take an essential step forward by approving this conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, which includes an array of tax cuts and other provisions that will help the small businesses that provide jobs for Americans in all sectors of the economy. 
   The bill will make it easier for small businesses to invest in new equipment by extending their ability to count such investments as a business expense, increasing from $112,000 to $125,000 the amount that can be deducted from their taxes and expanding the number of small businesses that can take these deductions. 
   In addition, the bill extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, WOTC--which provides incentives for hiring--and expands it to cover disabled veterans. 
   It also will enhance the current tip credit for small businesses, by maintaining the current tip credit that small businesses take for the Social Security taxes that they pay on their employees' tips, instead of allowing it to drop with the increase in the minimum wage. This is particularly important for many restaurants in Colorado and across the country. 
   And it will simplify tax-filing requirements for businesses owned jointly by married couples and ensure that small businesses are fully able to claim the WOTC and tip credit against Alternative Minimum Tax liability. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think this bill is an excellent example of the good results that can be achieved when we work together on a bipartisan basis. It has the support of the Administration and has also been endorsed by the national Chamber of Commerce, the National  Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the National Restaurant Association. 
   I have also received a letter of support from the American Farm Bureau Federation--which I will insert in the RECORD--noting that passage of the bill will directly benefit many farm and ranch businesses. This means it is particularly important for our rural communities in Colorado. 
   This is a good bill, and I think it deserves the approval of the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 (CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008) -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I am far from enthusiastic about voting for this bill, but I will do so despite its shortcomings. 
   Ironically, one of the worst shortcomings is that it is too long. It rolls into one massive measure provisions from no fewer than 11 regular appropriations bills that the House passed earlier this year, creating a ``consolidated'' omnibus that was not finished until yesterday and that very few if any Members have had a chance to completely review. 
   I regret that once again the apparent inability of the Senate to pass all but a few appropriations bills has led to this result. This is not the way Congress should do its work. That is  why I have joined as a cosponsor of a resolution, H. Res. 283, that would change the House's rules to generally bar consideration of a conference report including accounts within the jurisdiction of more than one appropriations subcommittee--and, while technically the measure before us is not a conference report, I think that it would be better not to proceed in the way we are doing today. 
   An even greater shortcoming is that this bill fails to provide the level of funding I think is needed for some important purposes. This results directly from President Bush's insistence that he will veto any bill appropriating more money than he has requested for domestic purposes and from the blind loyalty of Republican members of Congress, both here and in the Senate, who have made clear they will support any such veto. 
   But, despite these shortcomings, I will vote for the bill because it still is better than would have resulted if we had simply rubber-stamped the President's budget requests and because it includes provisions that will directly benefit Colorado and the Nation. 
   On a matter of great importance for all Coloradans, and especially residents of our Western Slope, the bill retains my amendment barring BLM from proceeding with final regulations for a commercial oil shale leasing program during fiscal year 2008, plus additional language in the explanatory statement that makes clear that the Interior Department must provide adequate time for the Governor and the public to provide input before any such final regulations are adopted. 
   This demonstrates that Congress has listened and will insist that the administration move carefully with regard to commercial-scale development of oil shale, even though the revisions of the oil shale provisions of the 2005 energy policy act approved by the House earlier this year are not included in the Senate version of the energy legislation that the House will consider later this week. Those revisions would have required that BLM issue proposed regulations and allow ample time for public comments on them. The language in this appropriations measure, which affects only final regulations, is consistent with that approach. 
   And the bill also provides funding for many things of direct immediate benefit to Colorado, including much-needed improvements to our transportation infrastructure, the continued acquisition of lands in the Beaver Brook watershed for inclusion in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, and work by the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation with respect to our vital water supplies. 
   Other examples of specific items for use in Colorado include funds for child abuse prevention and treatment programs in Golden, for career training in the health professions at Aims Community College in Greeley, for health information systems at the Avista Adventist Hospital in Louisville, for facilities and equipment to be used by Children's Hospital in Denver. 
   The bill's provisions for the National Park System include funds for several Colorado units, including land acquisition at Mesa Verde and for construction work at Rocky Mountain National Park. It also makes a start toward the Centennial Challenge initiative which has such promise for parks in our State and nationally. 
   And Colorado and the entire country will benefit because the measure includes funds for the vital work of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, including critical funding for the Energy Systems Integration Facility, ESIF. 
   ESIF will be a state-of-the-art facility to accelerate research into energy systems integration and the key issues of interconnectivity and control of resources. The $55 million included in the bill for ESIF will enable NREL to begin construction on this needed facility in fiscal year 2008, and the $7 million for South-Table Mountain, STM, Infrastructure will help with initial construction on this site while the $8 million for solar equipment will allow NREL to purchase state-of-the-art solar equipment for the Solar Energy Research Facility. 
   There is also funding for energy-related work at the Colorado School of Mines as well as for use in connection with a biodiesel project in Costilla County and the sustainable biofuels development center. 
   In fact, the bill provides a full $486 million more than President Bush requested for investments in solar energy, wind energy, biofuels, and energy efficiency--something that I am very glad to support. 
   In addition, I am glad that there is funding within NASA's earth science account to initiate important climate research missions as well as well as an endorsement of language in the House-passed Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations report that called for continued support for climate sensors already in development. This includes the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor, TSIS, which is being built by the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. 
   However, as chairman of the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, I am disappointed that to construct a bill the President would sign, the higher funding levels for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, provided in both the House and Senate bills had to be sacrificed. It is clear that Congress recognizes the value of NASA's activities in science, aeronautics, and exploration, and I hope the President will send Congress a budget request next February that would give NASA the resources it needs to carry out its important missions. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I want to highlight some of the items in the measure that are particularly important for Colorado's servicemembers and veterans. 
   These include $61.3 million for the parking structure and energy plant at Fitzsimmons Veterans Hospital and $7.3 million for a new F-16 facility at Buckley Air Force Base. 
   In addition, the bill will provide $35.1 million for the Pueblo Chemical Depot, to be used for construction of on-site chemical destruction facilities, with the goal of completing clean-up at the facility by 2012. 
   And it includes nearly $170 million to support Fort Carson in the context of the stationing of two new brigades and the new headquarters of the Fourth Infantry Division. This includes $53 million for new barracks; $18 million for an addition to Evans Army Hospital and a dental clinic; $8.3 million for a Defense Access Road to allow personnel and equipment to deploy easily from Peterson Air Force Base; $4.9 million for a new indoor range; $72 million for new unit operation facilities; and $13.5 million for construction of new facility support operations for the 13th Air Support Operations Squadron. 
   There is also $24.5 million for an Air and Space Integration Facility at Schriever Air Force Base and $15 million to upgrade academic facilities at the Air Force Academy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could continue at length but will conclude by simply noting that the bill provides much-needed funding to study diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, Parkinson's, and diabetes; to help small rural hospitals; and to provide 280,000 more underinsured Americans with access to health care. It includes more adequate funding that the president requested for education--including special education, after-school programs and Head Start, Pell grants and other student assistance--as well as for assistance to state and local law enforcement and homeland security. 
   So, while as I said the bill has serious shortcomings and while I would change many parts of it if I alone were ``the decider'' about the matter, I think it deserves approval tonight and I will vote for it.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support ordering the previous question because I think the House should proceed to considering H.R. 5719, the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act, without unnecessary delay. 
   Some have urged that Members oppose ordering the previous question so that the House could consider legislation to make permanent all the tax cuts the Bush Administration pushed through Congress in 2001. 
   I supported some of those reductions, but opposed others, and am not convinced that they should all be made permanent. But in any event, they will remain in effect until 2010. There is no need for us to consider today which should be extended, either as they stand or in modified form. I think instead we should proceed to the debate on H.R. 5719, and so I am voting to order the previous question.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this very timely and important measure. Its enactment will make a number of worthwhile changes in the current tax laws and the policies of the Internal Revenue Service, IRS. 
   To protect people against identity theft, it will require the IRS to notify a taxpayer if IRS finds that someone else may have made unauthorized use of the taxpayer's identity. 
   It will increase both the civil and criminal penalties that can be imposed on those who use misleading websites that imitate to seek to get personal information. This is important because people are losing thousands of dollars in tax refunds to such frauds. 
   It will strengthen IRS outreach to make sure that people know that they are entitled to tax refunds or to payments under the Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC. It would also permit the IRS to refer these taxpayers to low income tax clinics and increase funding for those clinics, and strengthen taxpayer protections from ``predatory'' providers of refund anticipation loans. And it clarifies that the IRS can use its website to publicize unclaimed taxpayer refunds. 
   To help small businesses, the bill will eliminate the outdated requirement to maintain and submit detailed call records to substantiate business use of employer-provided cell phones. 
   Of great importance to State and local governments--including every county in Colorado--it will delay for one year the imposition of a 3 percent withholding requirement on government payments for goods and services made after December 31, 2010. 
   Further, to protect all of us, the bill includes the ``Fair Share Act,'' which closes a loophole that now allows government contractors to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes. 
   An example of how the current law could permit this was recently reported in the press account of how a company operating under Federal contracts for reconstruction work in Iraq has listed the people doing that work as being employees of a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands. As a result, while people formally employed by the company with the Federal contract would be subject to the 15.3 percent payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare (half technically paid by the employer, the other half technically paid by employees), that is not the case with people who are counted as working for a foreign company. This is not fair or just. It should not be permissible, and this bill would stop it by closing the loophole. 
   In addition, the bill would strengthen accountability and protect taxpayers by repealing the authorization for the Internal Revenue Service to use private contractors to collect Federal income taxes. 
   Just today, the press is reporting that this program, while perhaps well-intentioned, has cost the government--that is, the taxpayers--some $37 million more than the total amount of taxes it has collected, while the contractors have collected commissions of up to 24 percent for their efforts. 
   The program has been marked by harassment, abusive calling, and violations of taxpayer rights and disclosure protections. The Government Accountability Office has reported that debt collectors placed over one million calls, many to innocent people, trying to reach 35,000 taxpayers and the Federal Trade Commission reports that as of last year it had received 130 complaints and the National Taxpayer Advocate has counted many more. The House has already twice voted to end this private collection program, and we should do so again today. 
   Madam Speaker, some have criticized this bill because it includes measures to implement the requirement that taxes be paid on funds withdrawn from a Health Savings account for purposes other than those related to health care. I think the purpose of these provisions is appropriate, but it may be that they could be more finely-tuned in order to achieve that purpose in a better way--something that may occur as the legislative process proceeds. In any event, I am not convinced that whatever shortcomings there may be in that or other parts of the bill are sufficient to outweigh the benefits of the rest of the legislation. 
   Overall, this is a good bill that will help the taxpayers and our country, and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this Defense Supplemental conference report. 
   Earlier, when the House considered the Defense Supplemental bill itself, I voted for it to ensure that America's soldiers get the equipment and resources they need and the top-quality health care they may require when they come home. 
   And I think the conference report is an improvement on that House bill. 
   As I said when the House debated the initial bill and again during debate on the motion to instruct conferees, I did not believe it was a good idea for the bill to include a date certain for withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq. So I'm glad that language has been made more flexible in the conference report. It includes a goal of March 2008 for completing the redeployment of U.S. combat troops, and allows sufficient troops to remain to protect U.S. military and civilians in Iraq, conduct counterterrorism operations, and train Iraqi Security Forces. I remain convinced that we should steer clear of arbitrary public deadlines for military actions and focus instead on realistic diplomatic and political goals. Our military needs flexibility to be able to link movements of U.S. troops to the realities of the situation on the ground, and successful diplomacy requires such flexibility as well. 
   My vote for the conference report is not a vote to support the Bush administration's policy in Iraq. We are 4 years into a war the Bush administration assured us would be short and decisive. The administration's misjudgments, lack of planning and poor leadership have made a bad situation worse--and the tactic of increasing troops for a temporary ``surge'' is no substitute for what is needed, namely, a strategy for containing civil war and a wider regional war. 
   But whatever may be said about the wisdom of invading Iraq 4 years ago--and I am one who believed it was a mistake to do so--the fact is that we are still deeply engaged in Iraq. So long as our troops are in the field, we must provide them what they need. Beyond supplying our soldiers, however, we must extricate them from what objective defense experts have characterized as an emerging civil war. 
   Disengaging from that civil war is the purpose of the provisions in the conference report designed to hold the president accountable to the benchmarks set by his own administration and the Iraqi Government--including enactment of a hydro-carbon law; conducting of provincial and local elections; reform of current laws governing the de-Baathification process; amendment of the Constitution of Iraq; and allocation of Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects. 
   I strongly support that approach because I am convinced that holding the president and the Iraqi Government accountable for achieving these benchmarks will provide us with the leverage necessary to pressure the Iraqi Government to forge the political solution we all know is required. In fact, Defense Secretary Gates has acknowledged that this provision in the House-passed bill has been helpful by showing the Iraqis that American patience is limited. 
   This conference report is an important step toward what I think must be our goal--a responsible end to the war in Iraq, based on a strategy of phased withdrawal of troops, accelerated diplomacy and redeployment that is based on Iraqi stability and not arbitrary deadlines. 
   The conference report fully funds our troops, providing $4 billion more for the troops than  the president requested. It honors our veterans, providing $1.8 billion more for our veterans' unmet health care needs, including additional funds for treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury care and research. It strengthens our military, providing $2 billion more to create a Strategic Readiness Reserve and address the serious readiness crisis our military is facing. 
   It also protects our troops by limiting deployment schedules and setting minimum readiness standards--based on current Defense Department standards--for U.S. troops deploying to the region. The president could waive these requirements but only by certifying in writing to Congress that waiving them would be in the interest of national security. 
   The conference report also provides $52.5 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and provides $9.7 billion for the Afghan and Iraqi Security Forces to help them assume greater responsibility for their nations' security. 
   And the conference report includes $3.1 billion to fully fund the Pentagon's FY07 request for the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission's recommendations, which is vitally important for Ft. Carson as it prepares to expand and for other military installations in Colorado. 
   On the non-military side, the conference report includes critically important funding for farmers and ranchers in southeastern Colorado who were recently hit hard by winter storms. Thousands of cattle were killed in storms worse than the October 1997 storm that killed approximately 30,000 cattle and cost farmers and ranchers an estimated $28 million. The struggles that family agriculture producers and small counties face are significant and are having a negative impact on the livelihood of hundreds of farmers and ranchers and their communities. So I am pleased that the Colorado delegation was successful in persuading the conferees to include financial assistance for farmers and ranchers, including for those affected by Colorado's recent blizzards. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us who voted against authorizing the President to rush to war in Iraq were worried that while it would be easy to eliminate the Saddam Hussein regime, the aftermath would be neither easy nor quick. Sadly, our fears have proven to be justified. And now, as the Pentagon has finally admitted in its most recent quarterly report, the situation in Iraq is ``properly descriptive of a civil war.'' 
   Insisting on keeping our troops in the middle of that kind of internecine war is not a recipe for victory; it is only a prescription for quagmire. And as a new Foreign Relations Council report notes, we bear responsibility for developments within Iraq, but are increasingly without the ability to shape those developments in a positive direction. 
   We need to be scaling back our military mission in Iraq. We need to make the U.S. military footprint lighter--not in order to hasten defeat or failure in Iraq, but to salvage a critical measure of security and stability in a region of the world that we can ill afford to abandon. 
   But as we do so, we must work to avoid a collapse in the region--not only because we have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq, but also because our national security has been so badly compromised by the Bush administration's failures there. The President's decision to take the nation to war has made our country less safe. We need to change course and chart a path that enhances our national security and sets the right priorities for the war on terrorism and struggle against extremists. 
   This conference report begins to chart this path, and I will support it. I hope the president will reconsider his stated intention of vetoing it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time, and acknowledge her leadership on this rule, as well as the leadership of the gentleman from Washington, for having the kind of debate we should have on the floor of the House. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the bill. I want to applaud Chairman Skelton for his leadership in guiding the bill to the floor today, and also acknowledge Ranking Member Hunter and our expert staff on the committee. 
   I want to particularly acknowledge the way in which Chairman Skelton worked with me on important items for Colorado, including limits on how the Army can pursue possible expansion of the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. 
   Others include funding a new squadron operations facility for the Colorado Air National Guard; promoting an agreement between the Air Force and the City of Pueblo about flight operations at the Pueblo airport; urging the Defense Department to use on-site disposal of chemical weapons stockpiled at the Pueblo Chemical Depot; asking the Army to track pilots who train at the High Altitude Aviation Training School in Eagle, Colorado; and naming a housing facility at Fort Carson in honor of our former colleague, Joel Hefley. 
   I am also pleased that the committee adopted two of my amendments, including one to repeal a provision adopted last year that makes it easier for the President to federalize the National Guard for domestic law enforcement purposes during emergencies. By repealing this, my amendment restores the role of the Governors with regard to this subject. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill rightly focuses on our military's readiness needs. After 5 years at war, both the active duty and the Reserve forces are stretched to their limits. The bill will provide what is needed to respond, including a substantial Strategic Readiness Fund and additional funds for National Guard equipment and training. 
   It enlarges the Army and the Marine Corps, consistent with the Tauscher-Udall Army expansion bill in the last Congress, and it will provide a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise for servicemembers, boost funding for the Defense Health Program, prohibit increasing TRICARE and pharmacy user fees, and establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Initiative to allow emerging technologies and treatments to compete for funding. 
   Madam Speaker, this is an excellent bill, a carefully drafted and bipartisan bill, and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5781, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act. 
   As most employers will tell you, the success of their operations depends on the quality of their employees. The same is true for the actions of the Federal Government. Our Nation's federal employees choose their path in government for love of country and dedication to our common goals. On the other hand, parents need to be able to create a bond with their new children. This bill seeks to remove the dilemma faced by many federal employees--choosing between government service or serving the best interests of children newly added to their families. 
   Under current law, federal employees are allowed up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a given year for the birth or adoption of a child. But like many other Americans, many federal employees cannot afford to take unpaid leave, especially with a new member of the family to support. Paid sick leave may only be used for the period that a new mother has been rendered physically incapacitated by the birth of her child, effectively penalizing those mothers who have a healthy baby with no complications. Federal employees can use paid vacation days, but the 13 days of annual leave after completing a full year of work, or even the maximum 30 days of leave saved up over several years, remains a small time frame for a parent to establish a bond with their new child. 
   H.R. 5781 would provide four weeks--just a single month--of paid parental leave for federal employees to establish a bond with their new child. It is important to note that many successful companies offer up to twice that amount, as evidenced by the 75 percent of Fortune 100 companies that offer six to eight weeks of paid parental leave for new mothers. 
   Americans want their Federal Government to operate as smoothly and as efficiently as possible. To accomplish this, we need the highest quality employees running it and focusing on national priorities such as homeland security and health care. This bill will help the Federal Government attract and maintain talented employees who value family as much as they value serving our Nation's government.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for these amendments today. They provide necessary funding for our troops, create new educational benefits for our veterans, and address domestic and global needs. 
   The war funding will pay for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq for the rest of this year and half of 2009. I support this because it will make it possible to provide the equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other supplies needed by our brave men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who have shown such extraordinary skill, determination and endurance in answering their call to service. 
   I opposed the Bush Administration's rush to war in Iraq, and voted against the resolution that authorized the President to send our armed forces into that country on the theory that this was necessary in order to deprive the Saddam Hussein regime of weapons of mass destruction. So, I understand why some of my constituents who also opposed the war want Congress to reject this funding measure. 
   And I could not agree more that the record of the current Administration demonstrates an  enormous failure of leadership. We desperately need new leadership that will bring to a close our open-ended military engagement in Iraq and will refocus on the very urgent tasks of reducing the terrorist threats in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
   But I am convinced that voting to deny funds to provide our men and women in uniform the resources they need to do their jobs is not the right way to bring about the change we need--especially because President Bush has shown he is prepared to veto funding for the troops rather than agree to change course. 
   This bill also improves veterans' educational benefits to more closely resemble the GI Bill of Rights that made it possible for so many World War II veterans to go to college. The GI Bill of Rights helped make possible the postwar growth of the middle class that was one of the greatest achievements of the Greatest Generation. Some have complained about the cost of providing similar benefits to those who are serving today. But to put those costs into perspective, we should remember that so far our spending for military activities in Afghanistan and Iraq has exceeded $800 billion. 
   By all indications, this bill will not be vetoed. Compromises were made on all sides to make it acceptable to the White House and the leadership of both parties. Of course, compromise means that everyone gives up something. 
   So there is good news: The bill addresses the needs of our soldiers and provides enhanced educational benefits for our veterans--but also extends unemployment benefits to help laid-off workers, provides relief for the thousands of people flooded out of their homes in the Midwest, and prevents the implementation of new rules that would increase the cost of healthcare, among other provisions. But there also is bad news: The bill does not include all the important policy provisions included in the first version of this bill, among them a requirement that our troops begin to redeploy from Iraq, a reminder to Iraq's government that U.S. troops will not remain in Iraq indefinitely. 
   I'm disappointed that the bill gives the President most of what he wants in Iraq spending without any significant policy constraints. Congress has tried and failed to include such constraints in previous spending bills, and here we have failed again. What we need is consensus here at home on a path forward 
   in Iraq, but as long as the architect of our current Iraq policy occupies the White House, I'm afraid that won't happen. 
   I hope that the next Administration will give serious consideration to the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group as a framework for consensus. Those recommendations would be accomplished by legislation I introduced last year, which would support a course of escalating economic development, empowerment of local government, the provision of basic services, a ``surge'' in regional and international diplomatic efforts, and lightening the American footprint in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I voted against war in Iraq because, as I said then, the Bush Administration was rushing to war without necessary international support or a clear plan to prevent the chaos that would follow after Saddam Hussein was overthrown. I was concerned a prolonged conflict would devolve into civil war. Since U.S. troops entered Iraq more than 5 years ago, we have lost thousands of our brave service men and women, seen tens of thousands more wounded, and spent half a trillion dollars in taxpayer money. 
   Yet the President's mission is no clearer, he has still offered no exit strategy, our enemies in Afghanistan have regained their strength, and our armed forces have been stretched to the breaking point. 
   Only Democrats and Republicans working together can find the path out of Iraq. I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on further steps we can take to change our broader Iraq policy. But today, I will vote to provide funding for our troops in the field, enhanced educational benefits for our veterans, and assistance for Americans suffering through the current economic downturn and the high costs of healthcare.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. 
   I am an original cosponsor of H. Res. 736 because it is important to recognize one of the amazing achievements of the Nation's aeronautics R&D enterprise. 
   I also think it important to honor Captain Yeager and the other brave test pilots who have helped push back the boundaries of flight--with results that have benefited our security, our economic well-being, and our quality of life. 
   As Chairman of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the Science and Technology Committee, I am well aware that this amazing achievement was not an isolated event. It is just one thrilling chapter in the great story of American aviation and aerospace. 
   I am pleased that our predecessors in Congress recognized the importance of aeronautics, and invested in it. 
   Americans were drawn to the challenges of advancing the state of aeronautics, and they gave much of their discipline and intelligence to overcome seemingly insurmountable technical obstacles. 
   At times, bravery was required, too, and the breaking of the sound barrier is a good example of that. 
   Today we honor the 60th anniversary of Captain Chuck Yeager's breaking of the sound barrier, but we also take inspiration from it to renew our commitment to ensuring that America remains preeminent in aeronautics R&D. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (COMMENDING NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER ON ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Concurrent Resolution 222, because I believe NASA's Langley Research Center to be a national treasure. With this resolution we are acknowledging nine decades of outstanding technological achievement. 
   However, before I continue, I must note with sadness that the driving force behind this resolution, Ms. Jo Ann Davis, is no longer with us. In addition to all of the other important causes and issues for which she was such an articulate spokeswoman, she was an ardent champion of the importance of NASA's aeronautics R&D programs. I shall miss her as we all will, and I am sorry that this is the last time that I will be able to have the opportunity to speak in support of one of her initiatives. 
   One of the strengths of the Langley Research Center over the past nine decades has been that while Langley researchers are experts in scientific theory, they are able to work with many others throughout the aerospace community. They aren't an isolated research lab, but instead have always worked shoulder-to-shoulder with industry and with dynamic people at other government agencies, including DOD. In short, the researchers at Langley are problem solvers. 
   Step into the Air and Space museum and with the first glance one grasps how rapidly aeronautics has developed. The X-1, the first manned aircraft to break the sound barrier, was designed by Langley staff. Nearby are biplanes from the First World War. The separation in time is just thirty years, but what a difference! 
   The folks at Langley played a large role in that transformation, and in further advances in aeronautics and in space exploration, with the latter spanning their work on Mercury, Gemini, the Lunar Orbiter, Apollo, Viking, the Space Shuttle, and Space Station programs. They have been a critical enabler of our modern air transportation system. 
   Last year, U.S. air passengers exceeded 750 million. To handle even busier skies, the Next Generation Air Traffic Control System (NextGen) is being devised. NASA Langley plays an important role in that effort. 
   For example, to test advanced concepts of aircraft self-separation, Langley conducted air-traffic-management research in its Air Traffic Operations Lab, in partnership with NASA Ames Research Center, Boeing, MITRE Corp. and United Parcel Service.  
   As another example, the NASA Aviation Safety Program--a partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and the Department of Defense that is led by Langley--recently tested a new way to predict thunderstorm turbulence. 
   We can't overlook the importance of military aviation to American freedom, and the importance of Langley to military aviation. 
   For example, during World War II, Langley used wind tunnel expertise to design modifications to fighter aircraft to improve their performance. Aerial dogfights were mostly contests between technologies, and a small improvement could make the difference between life and death. 
   Like the rest of NASA, NASA Langley promotes private sector participation with the Small Business Innovation Research program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program. The creation and transfer of innovation is a key goal at Langley. The Center delivers a steady flow of inventions and patents, across a range of technical areas. 
   In aeronautics and in space flight, Langley's parade of achievements has inspired generations of Americans, and has helped set the pace of American technological advancement. We need places like NASA Langley, and I hope that as we look back over its 90 years and celebrate its achievements, we are mindful of our future and work to maintain a strong and vital aerospace R&D capability at Langley and throughout our nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan concurrent resolution. 
   Human existence has marched through a great many generations, yet only in this last half century have humans taken to space. 
   We have been transformed by the space program. We live our lives differently, with long-range weather forecasts and GPS positioning and international cell phone calls and international banking. 
   We think of ourselves differently. Our space exploration has uncovered information about the universe that surrounds us. We now can conjecture about the first seconds of the life of the universe. We have learned much about where we are, and about what is happening around us, and about existence itself. 
   We think of our own planet differently. The sight of this fragile, blue ball, seen from a distance in dark space, stirred us, and provided impetus for the fledgling environmental movement. We realized that we had to sustain ``Spaceship Earth.'' 
   As the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee's Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, I observe the unique role that NASA plays in our technology capabilities. 
   The aerospace industry is one of America's biggest successes, and one of the strongest contributors to our trade balance. It owes much to NASA's fundamental aeronautics research. 
   Harder to quantify, but just as important, NASA's incredible achievements in space inspire young people to choose careers in technology fields. NASA recognizes this and has developed fine educational initiatives. 
   We have many competing societal priorities that must be addressed, but it is vital that we invest in the future, too. Throughout human history, the winner has been the nation that was more technically powerful. Investing in science and technology, with the space program and STEM education, is an investment for a richer and wider future. 
   If we aren't willing to make the investments to lead technologically, we know that others will take that lead. That isn't the future that I would like to see. Do we want a world in which our smart people are drawn to the work done in other countries, leaving us on the periphery? 
   There are widespread reports that China and India are building significant R&D capacity by investing in research at universities, and are elevating their industrial policies towards higher end work. 
   We have been warned. The National Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' laid it out. The investments that earlier generations made brought us our prosperous and secure lifestyle. Now it is time for us to renew these investments. 
   I am pleased with the American COMPETES Act that Congress and the White House enacted. It boosts STEM education to prepare the next generation for the technological challenges of the future and it strengthens our country's research and innovation environment to keep America competitive in the global economy. 
   Today when we look back over the 50 years of the space age, we feel proud. And I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. It tells a success story. Now it is our job to write another success story, by continuing to invest in the fundamentals of a strong technology sector: STEM education, space exploration, and technology research.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge its passage. 
   The bill is intended to provide journalists with a limited, qualified shield against efforts by prosecutors or other officials to compel public disclosure of the identities of whistleblowers or other sources of information. 
   Like 48 other States (and the District of Columbia), Colorado has already provided a similar protection for journalists, but of course that State law does not apply in Federal cases--for that a Federal statute is required, which is the purpose of this legislation. 
   And while I recognize that the Justice Department thinks no such law is needed--their view is that their own guidelines adequately deal with the subject--I think our experience in Colorado shows that it is possible to provide the assured protection that comes with a statutory shield without compromising the investigation of wrongdoing or the vigorous prosecution of crime. 
   I think this legislation does a good job of achieving a similar balance between protection for investigative journalists and their sources while maintaining the ability of the government to protect national security and conduct effective law enforcement. 
   Under the bill, journalists would be required to testify if a judge finds that a prosecutor, criminal defendant or civil litigant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an applicable test for compelled disclosure has been met. 
   For a prosecutor, that means showing that he or she had exhausted alternative sources before demanding information, that the sought-after material was relevant and critical to proving a case, and that the public interest in requiring disclosure would outweigh the public interest in news gathering. 
   The bill includes special rules for cases involving leaks of classified information or involving a journalist's being an eye witness to a crime. 
   The bill will enable federal law enforcement authorities to obtain an order compelling disclosure of the identity of a source in the course of an investigation of a leak of properly classified information. It also provides that disclosure of a leaker's identity can be compelled whenever the leak has caused or will cause ``significant and articulable harm to the national security.'' 
   And the bill also permits law enforcement to obtain an order compelling disclosure of documents and information obtained as the result of eyewitness observations by journalists of alleged criminal or tortious conduct, as well as cases involving alleged criminal conduct by journalists themselves. 
   And, in addition to provisions designed to guard against impairing efforts to prevent acts of terrorism, threats to national security, and death or bodily harm to members of the public, there are similar provisions to guard and make sure the legislation will not thwart efforts to identify those who disclose significant trade secrets or certain financial or medical information in violation of current law. 
   Mr. Speaker, the need for this legislation was well expressed by former Solicitor General Theodore B. Olsen in an article published in the October 4th edition of the Washington Post. 
   In that article, Mr. Olsen said:  
   ..... journalists reporting on high-profile controversies cannot function effectively without offering some measure of confidentiality to their sources. Their ability to do so yields substantial benefits to the public in the form of stories that might otherwise never be written about corruption and abuse of power. A person with information about wrongdoing is often vulnerable to retaliation if exposed ..... Yet it has become almost routine for journalists to be slapped with federal subpoenas seeking the identity of their sources. 
   Reporters do not expect to be above the law. But they should receive some protection so they can perform their public service in ensuring the free flow of information and exposing improper conduct without risking jail sentences. 
   The lack of federal protection makes for an especially strange state of affairs because the Justice Department has had internal standards providing protection to journalists and their sources for 35 years, and Special Counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald claimed to be adhering to those standards when he subpoenaed reporters in the Plame affair. Thus, as Judge Robert Sack of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit has noted, the only real question is whether federal courts should be given some supervisory authority to ensure that prosecutors have, in fact, met governing standards before forcing reporters to testify. The answer seems obvious: yes. 
   The District and the 49 states with shield laws have experienced no diminution of law enforcement efforts as a result of those laws. The legislation would not give reporters special license beyond the type of common-sense protection we already accord to communications between lawyers and clients, between spouses and in other contexts where  we believe some degree of confidentiality furthers societal goals. 
   This legislation is well balanced and long overdue, and it should be enacted.  
   I agree with Mr. Olson, and I urge all our colleagues to join me in voting for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and this bill. I want to start by applauding Chairman Skelton for his leadership and also Ranking Member Hunter. They have done a tremendous job as have their expert staff. 
   I am particularly grateful to Chairman Skelton and Chairman Smith for working with me to provide an important provision for Colorado. The bill prohibits the Department of Defense from transporting away from the Pueblo chemical depot in the 2009 fiscal year the hazardous wastes left after the chemical treatment of mustard agent. 
   This language is necessary because the DOD continues to look at treating these secondary wastes offsite despite studies showing that shipping these wastes will not yield benefits and despite the clear preferences expressed by the community of Pueblo to treat these wastes onsite. 
   Last year, Congress mandated that the DOD complete all chemical weapons destruction activities, including the destruction of 2,600 tons of liquid mustard agent housed at the Pueblo depot by 2017. The Department of Defense should get on with this approved plan to treat the secondary wastes at the depot and not delay this program any further.     
   More broadly, our bill focuses on our military's readiness needs. After more than 5 years at war, both the Active Duty and Reserve forces are stretched to their limits. Our bill will provide what's needed to respond, including funds to address equipment shortages for Active Duty and Reserve forces, improve the quality of our military barracks, ammunition maintenance, and expand training opportunities, among other important readiness needs. It increases Army end strength, consistent with the Tauscher-Udall Army expansion bill in the last Congress. And, importantly, it will provide for a 3.9 percent across-the-board pay raise for servicemembers, boost funding for the defense health program, and prohibit increasing TRICARE and pharmacy user fee increases.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation that will extend critical tax credits for renewable energy and for American families while not adding to the federal deficit. 
   As co-chair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I am especially pleased to see the House take action on needed tax credits for renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) in particular has been instrumental in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry. An extended  PTC will provide more market certainty and we must have an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008. 
   I must add that, while I am pleased that the bill provides a 3-year extension of the PTC for most renewable energy sources, I am concerned that it only provides a 1-year extension for wind energy. Wind is a very promising renewable energy source and a 1-year extension will not be as helpful for the industry. I will continue to lead the fight to extend the PTC for more than 1 year. 
   The bill also extends the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy, qualified fuel cells, and microturbines through the end of 2014. The ITC will help companies with initial investment costs in expanding these renewable energy sources across the country. 
   The bill also authorizes $2 billion of new clean renewable energy bonds (CREBS) for public power providers and electric cooperatives. This is a critical tool, especially for Colorado's rural co-ops and municipal utilities. 
   This bill would also benefit families who want to invest in renewable energy. It would extend the credit for residential solar property for 6 years and increase the annual credit cap, currently capped at $2,000, to $4,000. And it would expand the definition to include residential small wind equipment and geothermal heat pumps so that consumers have more options. 
   Rising gas prices are forcing many Coloradans to dip into their savings just to make ends meet. This bill will help families reduce their fuel bills by providing $3000 in tax credits toward the purchase of fuel-efficient, plug-in hybrid vehicles. It will also help address long-term fuel cost concerns by expanding production of homegrown fuels, including creating a new production tax credit for cellulosic biofuels besides ethanol, as well as an extension of the tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel. 
   I supported the energy bill that the House passed last year which included many of these important tax provisions, as well as the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 that the House passed earlier this year. But, for the lack of support in the Senate, these provisions have not yet made it to the President's desk to be signed into law. 
   And this bill will also help Colorado businesses stay competitive by extending the research and development tax credit for 1 year. While again I would like to see this key tax credit extended for more than 1 year, this is a step in the right direction. 
   To help with the hard economic times that Coloradans are facing, this bill includes several other key tax credits, including expanding the child tax credit for some of our neediest families, allowing teachers to take a deduction for purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets, and providing additional support for families paying for college education. 
   I hope today we can move this bill forward and promote positive change that will benefit our families and rural communities, save consumers money, reduce air pollution, and increase reliability and energy security. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues in the House to vote for this needed legislation, and also encourage quick action in the Senate so that we may move it to the President's desk.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PLATTE RIVER RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM AND PATHFINDER MODIFICATION AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, which I introduced earlier this year. 
   I want to express my thanks to Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Don Young, Subcommittee Chairwoman Napolitano, and Subcommittee Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers for making it possible for the bill to come before the House of Representatives today. 
   The legislation will authorize the Interior Department to participate in the implementation of the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program for Endangered Species in the Central and Lower Platte River Basin. 
   I consider myself fortunate to have the honor of introducing it, and am gratified that it is cosponsored by my Colorado colleagues, Representatives DeGette, Salazar, and Perlmutter, as well as the entire House delegations of our neighboring States of Wyoming and Nebraska. 
   Its purpose is to continue a cooperative effort involving the Federal Government and the States of Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming (and other entities and groups) aimed at recovery of endangered species in ways that will not involve the creation of Federal water rights or requiring the grant of water rights to Federal entities. 
   This legislation is the result of 14 years of negotiations that culminated last year when the Governors of Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska joined Secretary Kempthorne in signing the agreement. 
   Since then, initial implementing steps have begun and the President's budget for fiscal 2008 has requested the initial funding for the program. 
   The program is modeled after a somewhat similar program for the recovery of several endangered species of fish in the upper basin of the Colorado River. I have strongly supported that program because it has enabled us in Colorado and other participating States to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act while allowing continued development and use of water for other purposes as well. 
   While such arrangements are not easy to work out, I think doing so is far better than alternative approaches that are more likely to be marked by conflicts or litigation. So, I think all concerned in the negotiation of this important agreement are to be congratulated. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill that deserves the support of the entire House, and I urge its approval. For the benefit of our colleagues, I am attaching information about the background of the Recovery Program addressed by the bill:  
   BACKGROUND 
   Since 1997, the States of Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming have worked with water users, conservation groups and the Interior Department to develop ways to allow continued water use and development along the Platte River to comply with the Endangered Species Act (ESA). 
   In late 2006 the States and the Interior Department signed the final agreement for a basin-wide Recovery Program to benefit three endangered species (interior least tern, whooping crane, and pallid sturgeon) and one threatened species (piping plover) referred to as the ``target species.'' 
   The Federal government is to pay half the cost--and the bill authorizes appropriation of those funds. Total authorization would be $157.14 million plus any needed inflation adjustments.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this important legislation. 
   As a proud cosponsor of the bill, I want to begin by congratulating Chairman RAHALL, the lead sponsor of H.R. 2262 and our leader on the Natural Resources Committee, for all he has done to make it possible for the House to consider the bill today. 
   For many years, he has worked to replace the ancient mining law of 1872 with a statute more attuned to this era than to the days of the Grant administration--a worthy task that remains unfinished through no fault of his. 
   For him, it is personal. And it is personal for me as well. 
   My uncle, Stewart Udall, had the honor of serving as Secretary of the Interior during the administrations of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. During his tenure, he accomplished a great deal, but he wanted to do more. He has often said that reform of the mining law of 1872 was the biggest unfinished business on the Nation's natural resources agenda, and  has never let me forget that one of his final actions as Secretary was to send to Congress proposed legislation to accomplish that goal. 
   And, as Chairman RAHALL has reminded us all, my father, Representative Morris K. Udall, recognized the need for legislation such as the bill before us today. As chairman of what was then the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, he also accomplished a great deal, but he did not live to see that need fulfilled through its enactment. 
   So, I consider myself very fortunate to have the opportunity to join in supporting this bill and, by so doing, helping to accomplish what both my father and uncle recognized as a long-overdue step to provide the American people--owners of the Federal lands--with a fair return for development of ``hardrock'' minerals and to establish a better balance between the development of those minerals and the other uses of those lands. 
   Those are the purposes of this bill, and I think it is well designed to accomplish them. 
   Its enactment will replace the mining law of 1872 with a new statutory framework for the development of hardrock minerals on Federal lands. 
   Perhaps most notably, it will impose a royalty on gross income from hardrock mining on Federal land. Under current law, those who mine gold, silver, platinum, or other hardrock minerals from those lands pay no royalties at all--unlike those who extract oil, natural gas, or other minerals covered by the Mineral Leasing Act. 
   The royalty rate would be 8 percent of ``net smelter return'' for new mines and mine expansions, and a 4 percent net smelter rerun for production from existing mines. Those royalties, to the extent they exceed the costs of administering the new law, would go into a special fund in the Treasury and, along with certain administrative fees, would be available, subject to appropriation, to support reclamation programs and to provide assistance to State, local, and tribal governments. 
   I consider the establishment of this ``abandoned hardrock mine reclamation fund'' one of the most important features of the bill. 
   It is very important for Colorado because while mining brought many benefits to our State, it has also left us with too many worked-out and abandoned mines. Some of them are mere open pits or shafts that endanger hunters, hikers, or other visitors. And too many are the source of pollution that contaminates the nearby land and nearby streams or other bodies of water, and so are threats to public health as well as to the ranchers and farmers who depend on water to make a living and the fish and wildlife for whom it is life itself. 
   In fact, I have seen credible estimates indicating that the Western States have as many as 500,000 abandoned hardrock mines, and that just in Colorado there are over 20,000 old mines, shafts, and exploration holes. 
   In short, Mr. Chairman, there is an urgent need to clean up and reclaim these abandoned mines. But there are two major obstacles to progress toward that goal. 
   One is a lack of funds for cleaning up sites for which no private person or entity can be held liable. The reclamation fund established by this bill will be a major step toward remedying that problem. 
   The other obstacle is the fact that while many people would like to undertake the work of cleaning up abandoned mines, these would-be ``good Samaritans'' are deterred because they fear that under the Clean Water Act or other current law someone undertaking to clean up an abandoned or inactive mine will be exposed to the same liability that would apply to a party responsible for creating the site's problems in the first place. 
   Because that obstacle is not addressed by this bill, I have introduced a separate measure--H.R. 4011--that does address it. That bill, similar to ones I introduced in the 107th, 108th and 109th Congresses, reflects valuable input from representatives of the Western Governors' Association and other interested parties, including staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Environmental Protection Agency. It represents years of effort to reach agreement on establishing a program to advance the cleanup of polluted water from abandoned mines. It is cosponsored by our colleague from New Mexico, Representative PEARCE, whose help I greatly appreciate, and I will be seeking to have it considered as soon as practicable. 
   Another important aspect of the bill before us is the way it would modify the administrative and judicial procedures related to mining activities, including establishing a means for local governments to petition for withdrawal of Federal land from the staking of new mining claims. 
   That will enable local governments all over Colorado to have a much greater voice regarding activities that could have the potential to cause problems for their residents and for them to seek protection for such resources and values as watersheds and drinking water supplies, wildlife habitats, cultural or historic resources, scenic areas. In addition, Indian tribes will be able to seek protections for religious and cultural values. 
   I recognize that not everyone supports the bill as it stands. The Colorado Mining Association has informed me that while its members support reforming the 1872 mining law, they think the royalty rate that the bill would apply to new production is too high, and that they consider application of even a lower rate to existing production is unfair. I respect their views--although I don't think it is accurate to describe the royalty on existing production as ``retroactive,'' because 
   it will not apply to any production occurring prior to the bill's enactment--and I am ready to consider supporting changes in the royalty rates as the legislative process continues. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, one that deserves our support. In the words of a recent editorial in the Daily Sentinel newspaper of Grand Junction, CO, it is ``long- overdue and much-needed legislation.'' I urge its passage, and for the benefit of all our colleagues I attach the complete text of the Daily Sentinel's editorial.   
   Archaic Mining Law Needs 21st-Century Update 
   The mining industry that transformed huge swaths of western Colorado's landscape in the latter part of the 19th century was given a considerable boost by the 1872 Mining Law. And that legal antique continues to transform public lands in the state today. 
   However, long-overdue and much-needed legislation to finally reform the 135-year-old law is to be marked up in the House Natural Resources Committee today. 
   The mining legislation signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant was adopted when most Americans enthusiastically supported both the development of the largely unpopulated West by white settlers and full exploitation of its natural resources. Along with laws such as the Homestead Act and the Timber and Stone Act, the 1872 Mining Law helped drive that effort. 
   Over time, however, public-lands laws passed in the late 19th century have been eliminated or superseded. Only the 1872 Mining Law remains in largely its original form, allowing companies and individuals to stake mining claims on federal lands and eventually purchase those lands for as little as $5 an acre. 
   In Colorado since 1980, 17 companies and 40 individuals have obtained mineral rights and deeds to more than 84,000 acres of once-public land under the 1872 law, according to a study by the Environmental Working Group. Four more applications are pending to acquire deeds to mining claims in Colorado. 
   Moreover, unlike companies that lease the rights to recover coal, oil and gas from public lands, those who obtain gold, silver and other precious metals under the 1872 law contribute nothing to the federal treasury through leasing or royalty payments. And because there were no environmental requirements in the law, U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill to clean up thousands of old mine sites around the West. 
   The legislation before the committee would end the practice of selling federal lands for hard-rock mining. People could lease lands for mining--as they do with coal, oil and gas--but they could not gain ownership of them, often for a tiny fraction of their current value. 
   Additionally, the bill to reform the 1872 Mining Law would establish an 8 percent royalty for new mines. It would improve environmental rules, create reclamation bonding requirements for mines and give federal land managers more authority to balance hard-rock mining with other public-lands activity. Not surprisingly, industry lobbyists are trying to water it down. 
   Western Colorado's two House members, Mark Udall and John Salazar, support the bill. Others should, too. It's long past time this 19th century relic was revamped to reflect the new realities of the 21st century.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support H.R. 362, the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act. 
   I am a cosponsor of this important legislation, which will greatly increase the numbers of science and math teachers across the country, both through creating more teachers from current college students and by providing better training for the teachers already in our schools. 
   America has long been a center for science and engineering discovery. Just looking back over the 20th century, American ingenuity has been truly incredible. From Ford's Model T in 1908 and on to the personal computer in 1981, American innovations have transformed our Nation and the world, again and again, creating whole new industries and occupations. Going forward, new innovations will continue to be critical, both in maintaining a solid industrial base and increasing our standard of living. 
   In short--innovation leads to new products and processes that sustain our industrial base; innovation depends on a solid knowledge base in math, science and engineering; without this knowledge base, innovation as well as our industrial base will erode. 
   Along those lines, all jobs of the future will require a basic understanding of math and science. The most recent 10 year employment projections by the U.S. Labor Department show that of the 20 fastest growing occupations projected for 2014, 15 require significant mathematics or science preparation to successfully compete for a job. 
   To succeed, U.S. students will need a strong background in math and science and our students have proven that they have talent in these areas. Compared to other countries, U.S. fourth graders score above average in both math and science on international tests. Yet, by the time these students graduate from high school, they score near the bottom of all industrialized countries. 
   We must do more to keep students involved, interested, and educated in science and math fields. 
   This bill will help us increasing the number of well-trained science and math teachers, which will lead to more scientists and engineers in future generations. 
   H.R. 362 will enhance and expand the national corps of math and science teachers, both by recruiting new teachers with backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and by supporting current teachers. 
   Specifically, the bill will improve the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Noyce Scholarships will award $10,000 scholarships to students enrolled in STEM majors who commit several years to teaching. Furthermore, this program will ensure that these new teachers have mentors and other support as they begin teaching. 
   For current teachers, the bill will enhance NSF's Math Science Partnership (MSP) program, which provides sustained, content-oriented professional development for current teachers with summer institutes and master's degree programs. Furthermore, teachers participating in these MSPs are encouraged to become teacher leaders by sharing their knowledge with other teachers in their schools. 
   I would like to thank Science and Technology Chairman Gordon for introducing this critical legislation and working to bring it to the floor today. 
   In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 362. To ensure that we continue to have a strong and healthy economy in the new interconnected global market, we need to have a prosperous science and technology enterprise. This legislation will set us in the right direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report and, in particular, in support of Section 327 of the report, which prohibits interrogation techniques not authorized by the Army Field Manual on Interrogation. 
   Despite White House claims that the United States does not torture prisoners, we continue to learn about administration actions that seem to condone the use of coercive techniques in questioning prisoners. 
   A few months ago, we learned about a classified Justice Department memo from February 2005 allowing waterboarding and other coercive techniques. Then there was the Executive Order signed in July of this year that effectively opened a loophole for the CIA to practice interrogation techniques that go beyond those allowed by the U.S. military. 
   Reports this week of destroyed interrogation tapes showing CIA operatives using waterboarding and other ``enhanced'' techniques are deeply disturbing, and suggest a double standard, whereby these techniques are approved for use by the CIA but not by the Department of Defense and its intelligence agencies. All this points to the need for a common standard for humane and effective interrogation techniques across the Government, which is what this conference report provision calls for. 
   Senator John McCain has called the Army Field Manual techniques ``humane and yet effective,'' and has argued for a policy by which ``we will never allow torture to take place in the United States of America.'' In May 2007, General Petraeus wrote to U.S. troops serving in Iraq that ``our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual ..... published last year shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting information from detainees.'' 
   There is no reason why interrogation techniques that work effectively and humanely for our military interrogators cannot also work effectively and humanely for CIA and other intelligence agency interrogators. Section 327 of the Intelligence Authorization report sends a message that the United States believes no part of its government is above the law, and that no interrogation method is acceptable that could not also be used on Americans in enemy custody. 
   I strongly urge passage of this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this legislation and I urge its approval. 
   The bill would direct the President to temporarily suspend putting oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the end of the year, unless before that time the price of oil should drop below $75 per barrel. 
   This is the quickest step we can take to increase the supply of oil on the open market, and so to bring some relief to consumers suffering from the high price of gasoline and other petroleum products. 
   Currently, the Federal Government is putting some 70,000 barrels of oil into the strategic reserve each day, even though the reserve is 97 percent full. While there are no guarantees, economists estimate that suspending that action could reduce gas prices by 5 to 24 cents a gallon. 
   It should not have been necessary for Congress to be considering this legislation. Current law gives the president authority to suspend diversion of oil into the strategic reserve. 
   That authority has been used in the past, by the first President Bush, by President Clinton, and by the current President Bush, who did so  in 2006. And history shows using that authority can help consumers--in 2000, after such action, the price of oil dropped by one-third, from $30 to $20 per barrel. 
   That's why last November, with other Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, I sent a letter asking President Bush to again suspend putting oil into the strategic reserve. 
   Regrettably, the president did not agree to that request, or to a second similar request that many of us made last month. So now Congress must act to require what the president has declined to do on his own. 
   That is what this bill does and why I support its passage. But I think we should not stop there. There are at least five other steps to reduce the extent to which American consumers are paying the price for our flawed energy policies. 
   Specifically, we should--

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 15, Mourning the passing of President Gerald R. Ford. 
   While we mourn President Ford, we also celebrate this great American's life and unique contributions to our country. I believe he will be remembered as a devoted and decent man of impeccable integrity who put service to his country before his own self interest. In public life, there can be no higher achievement. 
   In 1968 President Ford and his family first came to Colorado to ski. He was inspired by the beauty of the area and found a connection to the land and to the surrounding community and ended up buying home in Beaver Creek. When he became President, his vacations in Colorado helped introduce the world to the Town of Vail, and in fact, the family home was dubbed ``the Western White House.'' 
   Coloradans, especially those in the Vail Valley, consider Jerry Ford to be the first President from Colorado because he was a great ambassador for the State who established long ties to the people of Colorado. He was known as the first skiing president, and because of this tireless promotion of Colorado's ski industry, he was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 2001. He was a good neighbor, an avid golfer and a lover of the outdoors. So you can see why I like to claim the former president as a constituent. 
   Because of his work with charities in Colorado and his contributions to our great state, I've introduced a bill which would rename the Vail Post Office after President Ford, and I hope that the House will take up that bill soon and pass it in his honor. 
   President Ford will rightly be remembered for his personal warmth, his decency, his interest in bridging the many divisions in America during the 1970s. My father, Mo Udall, served in the Congress with him, and while they were often on different sides in political matters they were united by a common view that politics should unite people. I remember a story in 1974 President Ford invited Arizona's senators and representatives to ride on Air Force One for a meeting he was having with Mexico's president. At the time, Arizona had two Republican senators and three Republican congressmen. They all declined. The one Democratic congressman--my dad--accepted the invitation. 
   ``All these other politicians don't want Ford to come into their district. Hell, I'm glad to see him in mine,'' my dad told a person in a crowd outside the place where Ford and the Mexican president were meeting. Mo then went into the crowd and put his arm around the president, telling him how proud Arizona was to have him. ``It's a great day for the state.'' 
   They both were firm believers that in public life one could disagree without being disagreeable. This is a credo I try to live by and I draw inspiration from my father and from President Ford. They were both practitioners of civility long before the term came a popular term of political art. 
   As a dedicated public servant, President Ford served honorably in his years in Congress and in the White House. Most important, when America needed someone to reassure their trust in government after Watergate, he filled that leadership role with authenticity. 
   In short, Gerald Ford helped heal our nation during a time of crisis, provided steady leadership and restored people's faith in the presidency and in government. We need leaders like him today.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the ``Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007.'' Homeowners in Colorado and nationwide continue to face an impending crisis. Millions of borrowers have found themselves with unmanageable loans that not only threaten the financial security of their families and communities, but also undermine the Nation's economy as a whole. Passage of this bill will address irresponsible business practices in the mortgage industry that have played a part in creating this situation. 
   There are grave problems in the housing market. Foreclosure rates are rising, housing prices are stagnating and too many Americans are overwhelmed by the rise in their monthly payments. And housing is not the only sector of the economy that has been affected by the tremors whose epicenter is located within the financial institutions involved in mortgage funding. 
   This bill responds to problems that have come to light as those tremors have spread. Its main benefit may be to reduce the likelihood of similar shocks in the future, by reforming mortgage lending practices to soften the impact of rising defaults and foreclosures, especially in the subprime market. 
   The bill establishes a Federal duty of care for mortgage originators. It prohibits steering consumers to mortgages with predatory characteristics and other abusive practices in the subprime mortgage market, and establishes a licensing and registration system for loan originators. It also expands and enhances consumer protections for ``high-cost loans'' under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act; requires additional disclosures to consumers, and includes protections for renters of foreclosed properties. 
   I am particularly pleased that this legislation establishes an Office of Housing Counseling within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (RUD). This provision will provide financial and technical assistance to States, local governments, and nonprofit organizations to establish and operate consumer education programs. These programs will both enhance the consumer's financial literacy and also provide people with better information about mortgage and refinancing opportunities. 
   I do have some concerns about the bill, particularly regarding the extent to which its preemption provisions could interfere with implementation of State laws regarding loan liability. Fortunately, this risk has been reduced through adoption of an amendment to narrow the preemptive effect of the bill. It is my hope that these provisions can be further reformed in the Senate and conference committee before the bill is sent to the President. 
   I am also concerned about the possible effects of an amendment offered on the House floor that could have created a major new liability for mortgage originators, assignees, and securitizers by establishing a ``pattern and practice'' violation with penalties of not less than $25,000 per loan and $1 million for the violation itself. As I understand it, the amendment would characterize as a ``pattern or practice'' as few as two loans, which might mean that a lender who has acted in good faith in making a loan may be found to have violated this very subjective standard--with massive liability. I found persuasive the argument that  such a potential for increased liability could have a chilling effect in the secondary market, making liquidity less available. Fortunately, this amendment was not adopted. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is a good measure that deserves support. Further legislation may be required to address our Nation's mortgage crisis and assist families in Colorado and across the country in restructuring loans and recovering from this financial disaster, but this bill is a necessary part of the response to problem that might have terribly negative impacts on our economic future--and I urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I have reservations about this bill, but I will vote for it today. 
   It is similar to one that I supported earlier this year but that failed to receive the two-thids vote necessary for passage under the procedure that applied to its consideration. 
   In my opinion, the RESTORE Act is far preferable to the legislation--the so-called ``Protect America Act''--that I voted against but which the House, to my regret, approved and is now law. 
   Fortunately, that law will expire early next year, so we have the opportunity--and, I would say, the responsibility--to replace it with a better, more balanced measure. 
   By a more balanced measure, I mean one that fulfills two equally important requirements--first, that of enabling our intelligence community to do its job to protect us against terrorism and other threats, and second, respecting and safeguarding the rights and liberties of all Americans. 
   And while this bill is not perfect, I think it does meet those tests and deserves to be passed today. 
   It is based on the legislation I supported earlier this year but in several important ways it is even better than that bill. 
   For example, it is more carefully focused, applying not to all foreign intelligence but specifically to intelligence collection related to terrorism, espionage, sabotage and threats to national security. It also provides that the minimization rules--the steps agencies will take to limit their actions so as to avoid inadvertent or unnecessary surveillance--as well as the guidelines for intelligence collection regarding all targets must be approved by the FISA court, not merely by an administrative monitor. 
   It includes critical language that says that actions in compliance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and with that law's  procedural safeguards, will be the exclusive means to conduct surveillance for intelligence purposes. And the bill restates current law stipulating that surveillance targeting Americans requires an individualized FISA court order. 
   It takes a great step toward greater accountability by requiring an audit of past surveillance activities by the National Security Agency and by mandating record-keeping on any interception of communications by American citizens and legal residents. 
   The bill eliminates ambiguous language in the ``Protect America Act'' that appeared to authorize warrantless searches inside the United States, including physical searches of homes, offices, and medical records. And it makes clear that the Administration cannot conduct surveillance against Americans without probable cause--even if they are outside the United States. 
   Furthermore, this bill, like the one hastily passed earlier this year, is not permanent but will expire at the end of 2009, at which time Congress will be able to reconsider it with the benefit of greater knowledge of how it has worked in practice and whether further refinements should be made. 
   Also important is what the bill doesn't do. It does not provide constitutional protections to foreign terrorists. The bill does not require the government to obtain a FISA order in order to intercept ``foreign to foreign'' communications of suspected terrorists, even if these communications pass through the United States. Nor does this bill permit the National Security Agency to collect the communications of Americans through a ``basket'' court order. Instead, the bill requires the Administration to certify that the targets are not Americans, and if it wants to conduct surveillance on Americans, the Administration must get a formal FISA order. 
   And, as now amended, it includes additional language to make clear that there are other things it will not do. Specifically, it will not prevent the lawful surveillance necessary to: prevent Osama Bin Laden, al Qaeda, or any other terrorist organization from attacking our country, our people, any of our allies. It will not prevent surveillance needed to ensure the safety and security of our Armed Forces or other national security or intelligence personnel. It will not prevent surveillance needed to protect the United States, the American people, or any of our allies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction or any other threats to national security. And it will not prohibit surveillance of, or grant any rights to, undocumented aliens. 
   The bill does grant authority to the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to apply to the FISA court for a single court order, or a ``basket'' order, authorizing surveillance of a suspected terrorist organization abroad for up to one year, as long as there are procedures in place to ensure that only foreigners are targeted and the rights of Americans are preserved. 
   In general, I am wary of the concept of broad scope ``basket warrants,'' which are not normal under our laws. But I am prepared to support this part of the bill on the understanding that it is limited in scope and not applicable within the United States and with the expectation that the question will be revisited if the audits indicate a need for reconsideration of this part of the legislation. In this context, I am glad to note that this legislation is not permanent and will expire at the end of 2009. 
   President Bush has criticized the bill, in part because it does not include a provision granting retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that assisted in the Administration's secret surveillance program without a warrant. I think it might be appropriate to consider such a provision, but not until the Bush Administration responds to bipartisan requests for information about the past activities of these companies under the program. I am not ready to grant immunity for the companies' past activities while we don't know what activities would be covered. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect, but I am not prepared to insist on perfection at this point. I believe we must do all we can to correct the shortcomings of the ``Protect America Act,'' even if it takes Congress a number of attempts to get it right. The RESTORE Act will give the Administration the authority it says it needs to conduct surveillance on terrorist targets--while restoring many of the protections that the ``Protect America Act'' has taken away. For that reason, I will vote for this bill today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this veto override. 
   The conference report includes funding for many important programs and I am disappointed that the President has vetoed it. I recognize that the conferees had a challenging task in shaping the report because of budget constraints, but Congress did a good job balancing critical health, education and labor needs with the tight budget. 
   This conference report provides much needed funding for health, education and labor programs for the nation and for Colorado. For example, included in the overall increase for the Department of Health and Human Services is an increase in funding for essential research at the National Institute of Health (NIH) to increasing health care access in rural areas, as well as additional funding for the Center for Disease Control (CDC). It also includes critical funding increases for several important education programs, including No Child Left Behind, Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), and Pell Grants. I am also pleased the labor provisions of this report reflect a new direction and commitment to expanding job training and enhancing the safety of workers, by increasing funding for a number of employment, education, and protection programs for the American workforce. 
   I am encouraged that the report includes an increase in funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP is a critical program that helps many Colorado families, who are struggling to get by, avoid having to make choices between paying their heating bill and putting food on the table. The conference report will increase funding for this program by $250 million over the fiscal year 2007 budget. 
   There are also critical Colorado-specific funds in the report. The report contains funding for Children's Hospital of Denver to help build the North Campus Ambulatory Surgery Center, which will broaden access to pediatric care in the north Denver metro area. This new development will also add more convenient alternative to patients, families, pediatricians, and physicians while also decreasing the burden on other health centers in the Denver metro area. 
   It also contains funding for Avista Hospital, a leader in the Electronic Medical Record field, to help Avista continue to implement a cutting edge system. 
   The funding for programs included in this report is a cause for celebration, not a veto. The President's budget request underfunded many of these critical programs and I am pleased that Congress has crafted a much better appropriations plan. While I am disappointed in the President's veto of the conference report, I am encouraged that we are attempting to override that veto today. This report is good for Colorado, good for the country and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, while I have some concerns about this bill, I will vote for it because I think on balance it deserves to be approved as a necessary step toward needed improvements in the current law. 
   I am far from expert in the intricacies of patent law, so I have listened carefully to those with more knowledge, including several companies employing substantial numbers of Coloradans that utilize patents in various fields. While they are not unanimous, most of them have urged support for the legislation. 
   I have also noted that the passage of the legislation, as a step toward needed improvements in the current law, is supported by the Consumers Federation of America, Consumers Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and other groups including the Financial Services Roundtable. 
   At the same time, I have listened to the concerns expressed by others who have raised a number of objections to the bill and think that its defects are so serious as to merit rejection of the legislation in its current form. 
   I take those objections seriously, but I have decided that nonetheless the better outcome today is for the House to pass the bill and for further discussion of the points they raise to occur in the context of debate in the Senate and then a conference between that body and the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will vote for this bill--as I did for a similar measure last month--because of the urgent need to protect middle-income families from a massive tax increase that will hit them if we do not act to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. 
   But I do so with some reluctance, because unlike the versions of the legislation previously passed by the House, this version reflects the inability of the Senate to bring itself to make the legislation fiscally responsible. 
   As changed by the Senate, this bill does not even attempt to offset the costs of changing the AMT. 
   I still think that should not be our first choice, because for too long the Bush Administration and its allies in Congress have followed that course--their view, in the words of Vice President Cheney, has been that ``deficits don't matter.'' 
   I disagree. I think deficits do matter, because they result in one of the worst taxes--the ``debt tax,'' the big national debt that must be repaid, with interest, by future generations. I think to ignore that is irresponsible and falls short of the standard to which we, as trustees for future generations, should hold ourselves. 
   But, as of today we are left with no choice except to vote to protect middle-class taxpayers, or to insist on making them pay the price for the stubbornness of others. 
   So, I will vote for this bill today, without enthusiasm but with determination to continue working for greater fiscal responsibility when the House reconvenes next year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, when the House considered this measure earlier this week, I voted for it even though I was far from enthusiastic about doing so. 
   Now that it is before us again--because the Senate changed it--I am even less enthusiastic about it, but I have reluctantly concluded that bad as it is, it needs to be passed. And so I will vote for it again. 
   Earlier, I said that one of its worst shortcomings, ironically, was that it was too long--rolling into one massive measure provisions from no fewer than 11 regular appropriations bills that the House passed earlier this year. 
   And now it is even longer, because the Senate has added an additional $39 billion, all for military activities in Iraq. 
   There is no mystery about why that happened. It happened for two reasons. 
   The first reason is that President Bush has insisted that he will not sign the bill unless these funds were added--just as he has insisted he will veto it if it provided more funding than he has requested for domestic purposes. 
   The second reason is that our Republican colleagues, both here and in the Senate, have made clear they will support any such veto. 
   And the result of the president's stubborn insistence and our Republican colleagues stubborn loyalty is that of the nearly $190 billion the president requested for Iraq and Afghanistan, this bill includes $39 billion for Iraq, to be available without conditions or significant restrictions. 
   This essentially unconditional funding approach is very different from the war funding bill I supported and the House passed last month, which would have provided targeted funding toward an ``immediate and orderly'' redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq. 
   I agree with those who say there are clear signs of progress on the security front in Iraq. But when he announced the ``surge'' of additional troops to Iraq, President Bush promised us more than progress on the security front. We sent more troops to Iraq to provide ``breathing space'' for the Iraqi government to move toward political reconciliation, and that hasn't even begun to happen. 
   I think that in the long term, there is no sustainable role for large numbers of U.S. troops to remain in Iraq--whether refereeing a civil war or waiting for the Iraqi government to decide to act within the ``breathing space'' our brave troops have provided and our taxpayers are paying for at $9 billion per month. 
   So I regret that this bill sends the wrong message by including no Congressional direction on how the funds for Iraq should be spent. 
   At the same time, we all understand that this bill includes no ``strings'' on Iraq funding because the Senate simply doesn't have the votes to pass such a bill and that Republican support for a veto would prevent it from becoming law if it should be passed. 
   What we need is consensus here at home on a path forward in Iraq. 
   I believe consensus can be found around the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, which I introduced as legislation earlier this year, including supporting a course of escalating economic development, empowerment of local government, the provision of basic services, a ``surge'' in regional and international diplomatic efforts, and lightening the American footprint in Iraq. 
   If legislation along those lines had been agreed to, we would not find ourselves making the difficult choice presented by this bill now before us. 
   Only Democrats and Republicans working together can find the best path out of Iraq. I will continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on further steps we can take to change our broader Iraq policy. 
   And today, I will vote for this omnibus bill because despite its shortcomings, I will not vote to deny funding for the body armor and other supplies our troops require and because in terms of funding for domestic programs, it still is a better bill than would have resulted if we had simply rubber-stamped the president's budget requests--and it includes provisions that will directly benefit Colorado and the nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker I am a cosponsor of this important legislation and rise to support its passage 
   As we all know, the real estate market is troubled. In Colorado and across the country, some families are caught in a bind--as prices have declined, they are finding that the value of their homes are less than what they owe on their mortgages. 
   And many of these people are experiencing financial problems--including increased payments required as the interest rates on their mortgages are adjusted--that can lead to foreclosure or require them to work out other arrangements with lenders. 
   That is bad enough--but as things stand now, in many cases they find that there is more bad news, because today homeowners are taxed on debt that they are no longer required to pay, either because a mortgage has been foreclosed or restructured.  
   That is because the tax code today treats the value of cancelled mortgage debt as taxable Income. 
   This bill will provide relief to people in this situation. It will change the tax laws so as to permanently exclude debt forgiven under these circumstances from tax liability. 
   It also will help make home purchases more affordable by a long-term extension of the tax deduction for private mortgage insurance. Current law allows certain premiums paid or accrued for qualified mortgage insurance by a taxpayer in connection with financing of the taxpayer's residence to be treated as interest--that is, to be deductible. However, this is now scheduled to terminate for any amount paid or accrued after December 31, 2014. 
   This bill will extend the deduction through December 31,2014. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good measure. I strongly support it and urge its approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would bar the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management from issuing any final regulations for commercial-scale leasing of oil shale and from offering any commercial oil shale leases during fiscal year 2008. 
   Current law requires BLM to issue those regulations, and to move to a full-scale commercial leasing program, on a crash basis and under a tight deadline. 
   I think that is a mistake, so I want to make it clear I support Chairman Rahall's bill, H.R. 2337, that would change that and other parts of the 2005 Energy Act. The Natural Resources Committee has favorably reported the chairman's bill and it is headed toward this very floor. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to slow the administration down in the meantime, in order to give Congress time to complete action on that legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, oil shale has great potential as an energy source, and therefore it is an important part of our energy policy. But it is also important to American taxpayers, because they own most of it. But it is particularly important for Colorado. 
   Our State has some of the most large-scale deposits of oil shale, and Coloradans, particularly those on our Western Slope, will be directly affected by its development. 
   Back in 2005, the RAND Corporation reported that the potential benefits of developing oil shale were significant. But they also made it clear that development will affect not only our land  but our air and the quality and quantity of our very limited supplies of water. It was noted that large oil shale development will bring significant population growth and is likely to put stress on the ability of local communities to provide the needed services. 
   In short, the report reminded us how much Colorado and our neighbors had at stake when Congress debated the oil shale provisions of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. 
   As I said, that law now calls for a crash program. I have been concerned, as many people have in Colorado, that that would bring a rush to commercial development before the Interior Department knows enough to do it right and before Colorado's communities have had a chance to prepare for what it will bring. 
   My concerns grew this year, when a witness from RAND told our committee that the economic, technical and environmental feasibility of oil shale development is not adequate to support the formulation of a commercial leasing program on the time scale mandated and the fundamental approach the Department of the Interior is currently taking may be counterproductive if the goal is to keep open the option for a sustainable domestic oil shale industry. Chairman Rahall's bill would correct some of those problems. 
   I want to be clear, I strongly support oil shale provisions, because I think they will help assure that any commercial development is done in an orderly way that takes full advantage of the important research and development work underway. 
   The bill would also relax the unrealistic deadline for the BLM to finish the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement now underway, and then the bill would allow a year, not just 6 months more, for the BLM to prepare a draft, not a final, but a draft commercial leasing regulation, after which the people in Colorado and elsewhere would have 180 days to comment. 
   I also support the bill and its mandate for developing a strategy for sustainable and publicly acceptable large-scale development of oil shale in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, and its continued requirement that we consult with the governors of those States. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am glad that the Natural Resources Committee on a bipartisan basis adopted my amendment to set aside part of the money that the Federal Government will get from oil shale leases to help affected counties pay for construction, operation and maintenance of public facilities and for the provision of public services. This addition reflects my concern about what large-scale oil shale development can mean for Colorado's Western Slope. 
   Mr. Chairman, I hope that the full House will follow our committee's lead and approve these changes in the current law. I certainly will do all I can to help Chairman Rahall be successful in this effort. But there is a risk that these efforts could be frustrated unless Congress first acts to relieve the pressure current law puts on the BLM to move ahead on a crash basis. 
   Mr. Chairman, that is the purpose of the amendment, and I urge the adoption of the amendment.

   We have always heard, Mr. Chairman, about oil shale being the fuel of the future. But as the Rand Report mentioned, I remind us, so are the potential problems. My amendment says, as we work to realize this promise, we are not closing our eyes to the problems in front of us.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Chairman, in a moment I am going to ask to withdraw the amendment, but I want to engage Chairman Dicks in a brief colloquy. But first let me provide a little bit of background here. 
   Mr. Chairman, as you know, the amendment deals with claims under an 1866 law known as R.S. 2477 that granted rights-of-way to build highways over Federal lands. This act was repealed in 1976, but because Congress did not set a deadline for people claiming these rights-of-way to come forward, we still do not know what valid rights-of-way may exist. 
   There are pending claims that affect military lands and lands once owned by the Federal Government that are now private property. Other claims involve national parks, national forests and other conservation areas. 
   When the Clinton administration tried to resolve this problem administratively, Congress blocked that by passing a law barring issuance of final regulations on this subject until Congress authorized them. That law is still on the books. The Bush administration has not asked Congress to change the law. Instead, they want to do an end run around Congress and to deal with these claims through an administrative process. 
   My amendment would have blocked them from doing that because I think we should deal with that problem through new legislation. Toward that end, I have worked for a number of years with counties in my State and introduced a bill based on the results of that work. 
   My goal has been and still remains to establish a fair and neutral process that will result in setting a time certain for claims to be brought forward so valid claims can be recognized and any invalid ones will be resolved and so to bring an end to litigation and controversy. I do plan to continue to work on that approach in this Congress. 
   If I might, at this time, I would turn to the chairman and ask him, does the chairman agree with me that it would be better for the administration to work with Congress to resolve this issue, rather than trying to follow a course that will lead straight to more litigation?

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I support this budget resolution, which will lay the foundation for the decisions about spending and taxes that we must make this year. 
   Our first responsibility as Members of Congress is to provide for our national defense and homeland security, in order to safeguard the lives and liberties of the American people. 
   For that reason, and as a Member of the Armed Services Committee, I am glad to be able to say that this budget meets that responsibility by providing $537.8 billion for national defense, which is in line not only with the amounts requested but also the recommendation of our committee. 
   I also support the budget because it puts the needed priority on moving to restore the capabilities so seriously eroded by repeated deployments and more than 6 years of war. And, even more important, it includes instructions to properly care for the men and women in uniform by rejecting TRICARE fee increases, providing funding to continue addressing problems such as those at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and calling for enhanced pay and benefits to improve the quality of life of our troops and their families. It also calls for allocating $4.9 billion more than in the current fiscal year for veterans' health care. 
   But that is not the end of our responsibility. We also need to act responsibly to change the policies that over the last seven years have brought us deeper budget deficits and massive increases in the national debt even as we make needed investments in our society here at home. 
   This budget meets that responsibility as well. It lays out a path that can bring the budget back to balance. It includes an essential aspect of fiscal responsibility by following the ``pay-as-you-go'' approach now embodied in our House rules, requiring that any entitlement spending increases or revenue reductions be offset, so that the bottom line of the budget is not worsened. 
   At the same time it allows for funding priority investments in education, children's health care, veterans' health care, and innovation but also accommodating tax relief for middle-income Americans. It rejects President Bush's proposed cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and assistance to local law-enforcement agencies while accommodating $50 billion over 5 years for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). It also allows for substantially greater appropriations that the president has requested for education, and energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. 
   And it includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to accommodate middle-income tax cuts, such as extension of the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, extension of the 10 percent individual income tax bracket, elimination of most estate taxes, extension of the research and experimentation tax credit, extension of the deduction for state and local sales taxes, and a tax credit for school construction bonds. In addition, through a reconciliation instruction to the Ways and Means Committee, it allows for action to protect more than 20 million middle-income taxpayers from exposure to the alernative minimum tax, which was never intended to apply to them. 
   As a member of the Committee on Science and Technology, I applaud the fact that the budget will allow an additional $1.98 billion over the amounts appropriated for this fiscal year for science, space, and technology. 
   That amount will fully accommodate the commitments made in the America COMPETES Act--a measure I was proud to cosponsor and champion in the conference committee--for the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science. 
   Further, the budget includes increased budget authority for energy technology research programs such as those at the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, ARPA-E and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which include help for small manufacturers and technology companies through the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Technology Innovation Program. 
   These programs have great potential to increase our economic growth and to foster innovation. As the global marketplace becomes more competitive, it is essential that we compete on the basis of improved skills and greater productivity, rather than follow the destructive path of trying to compete solely on cost with the half of the world's workers who earn less than $2 a day. 
   That is the purpose of the America COMPETES Act, and why it is so important that we provide adequate funding for it. And it also the point of the resolution's provision saying the House should provide sufficient funding so that our Nation may continue to be the world leader in education, innovation, and economic growth and so we can stay on a path toward doubling funding for the National Science Foundation, basic research in the physical sciences, and collaborative research partnerships, and toward achieving energy independence through the development of clean and sustainable alternative energy technologies. 
   In addition, as a member of the Natural Resources, and as a westerner, I also support the budget because it will allow for an increase of more than $6 billion in the amounts available for protection of our water and air and the sound management of our public lands and other natural resources. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is said that to govern is to choose--and today's debate demonstrates the truth of that adage because the House must choose among four competing proposals for how the budget should be shaped in the years ahead. 
   Before deciding to support the resolution approved by the Budget Committee, I carefully reviewed the three competing alternatives, and in each I found some things that I think have considerable merit. For example, I liked the additional investments in education, job training, and employment included in the alternative advanced by the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as the provisions regarding unemployment insurance, food stamps, and housing assistance highlighted in the Progressive Caucus alternative. And the Republican alternative includes procedures for a legislative line-item veto similar to legislation (H.R.  595) I have introduced under the name of the Stimulating Leadership in Limiting Expenditures (or ``SLICE'') Act and would place a moratorium on spending earmarks pending review of the earmarking process by a bipartisan panel--two ideas that I think could result in worthwhile reforms. 
   But, on balance, I have concluded that the version now before us, developed in the Budget Committee under the able leadership of its distinguished Chairman, the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr Spratt, is the best choice. It is a sound proposal that will enable our government to meet its responsibilities, at home and abroad, in a way that is fiscally sound and respectful of the need to provide tax relief for middle-income Americans and promoting a sound economy. 
   I will vote for it and I urge its approval by the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PROHIBITING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN DEFAMATION JUDGMENTS -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this bill, I rise to urge its approval by the House. 
   The bill responds to as increasingly serious threat to freedom of speech--the phenomenon often called ``libel tourism.'' 
   That term is used to describe lawsuits brought in other countries--especially the United Kingdom--by people claiming to have been defamed by publications that would not be considered defamatory in the United States. 
   As explained in a recent news article about the practice--   
   Britain is a legal refuge because of defamation standards rooted in common law. They essentially assume that any offending speech is false and the writer or author must prove that it is in fact true to prevail against the charge. In the United States, with its First Amendment protection for free speech, the situation tilts in the opposite direction: To succeed, libel plaintiffs must prove that the speech is false and published with a reckless disregard for the truth.   
   A notable example involves the case of Rachel Ehrenfeld, an Israeli-born writer living in the United States and her legal battle with a billionaire Saudi entrepreneur, Khalid Salim bin Mahfouz over her 2003 book on terrorist financing, ``Funding Evil,'' which asserted that Bin Mahfouz and his family provided financial support to Islamic terrorist groups. The book was not sold in the United Kingdom, but Mr. Bin Mahfouz's lawyers argued that more than 20 copies of her book had been purchased there online and that therefore the British courts had authority to hear his defamation complaint. 
   Ms. Ehrenfeld did not respond and because she offered no defense, the judge ruled that she had to pay a judgment of $225,000, apologize for false allegations, and destroy existing copies of the book. Mr. Bin Mahfouz has not sought to collect on the judgment, but Ms. Ehrenfeld says it has affected her ability to publish further books. And last year Cambridge University Press agreed to destroy all copies of ``Arms for Jihad'' and to write to 100 libraries around the world seeking to add an explanatory sheet to archived books. 
   Evidently Mr. Bin Mahfouz has filed more than 24 lawsuits against writers and authors, and his advisers have created a special Web site tracking the legal suits and apologies issued by writers and publishers. 
   The bill now before the House responds to this threat to free speech. It would bar any U.S. court (State or Federal) from recognizing or enforcing a foreign defamation judgment unless it determined that the judgment ``is consistent with the First Amendment.'' Thus, someone who had won a defamation judgment abroad would have to prove the case under U.S. standards before it could be enforced here. This will provide important protection for Americans and others who exercise the First Amendment right of free speech in our country. 
   I urge approval of the bill.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support the passage of H.R. 6063, the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2008, as amended by the Senate. H.R. 6063 provides important direction and ensures the leadership of the United States civil space programs and provides the next president with congressional priorities for America's future in aeronautics and civil space activities. 
   I am very proud that this legislation has been a bipartisan effort every step of the way. Our bill passed quickly through the committee process, and on June 18 of this year, H.R. 6063 passed the House by the overwhelming margin of 409-15. 
   Since that House passage, we have worked with our colleagues in the Senate to craft a final version that reflects the concerns and interests of Members in both Chambers of Congress. I am pleased that the Senate yesterday passed H.R. 6063, as amended, by unanimous consent. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall and subcommittee Ranking Member Feeney for their support and hard work on this bill. 
   I think a special acknowledgment is due Congressman Lampson, who represents the great City of Houston, and who has been tireless in his support of NASA. 
   I also wanted to point out, I think, the great model that Congressman Hall and Congressman Gordon present us here in our House, where they work together in a bipartisan fashion to make sure that NASA thrives, and is nurtured, and is in a position to excel in the years in front of us. 
   I also want to also take a minute and thank the excellent staff on both the majority and minority side for their outstanding work. On the Democratic side of the aisle, Dick Obermann, Pam Whitney, Allen Li, and Devin Bryant have all been instrumental in moving this bill forward, as has Wendy Adams on my personal staff. 
   I want to make special mention of Wendy. I know she is here on a Saturday, giving the extra effort that always characterizes her work on behalf of the committee and, in particular, the subcommittee. 
   I also wanted to take another bit of time and mention Dick Obermann and tell him how much I respect him and how much I have enjoyed working with him on all my years on the committee. He is, as everybody knows in this House, the epitome of professionalism. The House, the aerospace community, and I would say our country is fortunate to have his talents and intelligence and work ethic deployed on behalf of all of us. Dick, I will miss you and look forward to working with you wherever I am next year. 
   On the minority side, I want to thank Ed Feddeman, Kim Monroe and Lee Arnold for their efforts as well. We have truly worked together in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Now while the amended bill leaves out a set of House-passed provisions, I am confident that H.R. 6063, as amended, remains a good bill and puts NASA in the civil space program on a path that will help ensure our leadership in aerospace and aeronautics. 
   This year, as has been mentioned, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the U.S. space program and the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA has achieved remarkable accomplishments over the past decades in science and aeronautics and human space flight. All of us here want to ensure that the next 50 years of our space program are equally bright. 
   This is a very good bill. I urge my colleagues to pass it, as amended, to ensure continued United States leadership in NASA's science, aeronautics and human space flight and exploration programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the farm bill conference report. I would like to commend conference committee members for tackling the tough issues, offsetting costs, and producing a conference report that I can support. 
   To be sure, this is not a perfect bill. Yet, in my estimation, no amount of negotiation could produce a conference report that all would agree is perfect. Rather, what has emerged is a farm bill that is good for my home State of Colorado and good for the country. 
   For starters, this bill will provide millions of American families with access to healthy food. Nearly three-quarters of the bill's cost will support nutrition programs, including food stamps and emergency food assistance programs, as well as an initiative to provide fresh fruit and vegetables as healthy snack alternatives for a generation of schoolchildren currently battling an epidemic obesity problem. 
   This farm bill will help Colorado continue to lead in the development of homegrown energy programs that we need to help free us from our national addiction to oil and protect our environment. It increases investments in renewable energy technologies, while reducing the burdensome tax credit for corn-based ethanol and creating a new tax credit for the production of more efficient cellulosic biofuels. 
   Rural America can plant their fields with confidence, thanks to the farm bill's new disaster relief program, and this provision of the bill also might significantly lower future grocery bills by speeding up compensation for farmers subject to natural disaster and allowing them to bring crops to market faster. 
   In addition, American consumers will have added confidence knowing that this farm bill mandates critical food labeling for our meat supply, including country of origin, and improves oversight of USDA's enforcement of rules governing meat packers and stockyards. 
   Along with promoting safe food and renewable energy production, this legislation increases spending for conservation programs by nearly $8 billion. These programs will help protect agricultural lands from urban sprawl; enhance and protect our natural resources; encourage public access to private land; and protect sensitive wetlands and grasslands, areas that are especially vulnerable in Colorado's eastern plains. 
   Of particular interest to Colorado is that the farm bill includes provisions similar to those in a bill--H.R. 1182--I introduced dealing with the tax treatment of exchanges of mutual ditch stock. Mutual ditch companies are unique to Colorado and are organized for the mutual benefit of shared water rights rather than for profit. This provision allows for tax-free exchanges of shares of these mutual ditch companies. 
   Another measure included in the farm bill, which I supported during consideration in the House Natural Resources Committee, will protect domestic timber producers by stopping the flow of illegally logged foreign timber imported into the United States. 
   This bill will also help bolster America's international standing by helping to meet global food shortage demands. America is already the world's largest provider of food aid, but recent riots in developing nations around the world have shown that we must increase our efforts. This legislation will provide additional funding to purchase emergency food aid overseas, and reauthorizes the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program for infant, child and school nutrition programs in underdeveloped countries.  
   As I said before, this bill is not perfect. I applaud the conference committee for trimming subsidies for already wealthy farmers, but I would prefer tighter reform of these programs, especially at a time when consumers must sacrifice to afford increasing food costs. And any legislation of this size and scope--especially when it is developed as a compromise between the two Chambers--is likely to include provisions that might not deserve to pass on their own. 
   Taken in whole, however, the farm bill conference report successfully addresses the most important food and agricultural issues facing the Nation today, and fully pays for all new spending initiatives. I agree with the editorial board of the Denver Post, which wrote, ``this latest version of the Farm Bill is good for the entire country,'' and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I think Congress should act to reform the earmark process. 
   That's why I have introduced H.R. 595, the Stimulating Leadership in Limiting Expenditures (or `SLICE') Act, which would provide the president with a constitutionally-sound version of a line-item veto that could be used to force Congress to vote separately on any specific spending earmark. 
   That's why I am a cosponsor of legislation (H. Res. 727) to put a moratorium on considering any bill with any congressional earmarks until a bipartisan panel has been set up and made recommendations for that reform. 
   And that's why I am also cosponsoring the Earmark Transparency and Accountability Act (H.R. 631) which would require any earmark, to be effective, to be included in a bill's text--not just in a committee report--so it would be subject to amendment. 
   But I cannot support this motion to recommit. 
   If we were considering this legislation for the first time, it might make sense to consider sending it back to the Agriculture Committee for revisions. 
   But we first considered this bill a year ago. Since then, the Senate has also acted and the differences between their version and the one we passed last year have been resolved by a committee of conferees appointed for that sole purpose. 
   That purpose was fulfilled when the conferees filed their report, and at that point the conference committee ceased to exist. 
   So, this motion would not really send the conference report back for more work--it would send it into oblivion. 
   And while I know the conference report has flaws, I think they are not so great as to require us to in effect tear it up completely. 
   So I urge rejection of this motion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this supplemental appropriations bill today, but like many Americans who want to see an end to the war in Iraq, I am not happy about it. 
   In fact, I am deeply frustrated and saddened by the prospect, but I also am compelled by my conscience to this vote. 
   On Monday, Memorial Day ceremonies throughout Colorado and across the country will honor the men and women in uniform who have paid the full measure of devotion to duty in all of America's wars. 
   But as long as the war in Iraq goes on, every day will be Memorial Day. 
   Already, more than 3,400 of our servicemen and servicewomen have died in Iraq, and more will die before we withdraw our troops. Just last Friday, for example, 33-year old SFC Scott Brown of Windsor, Colorado, and 27-year old SGT Ryan Baum of Aurora, Colorado, were among them. 
   A friend of Ryan's family told reporters, ``Ryan never wanted to be known as a hero, he just did his job.'' In fact, he did his job--and he is a hero. 
   This is not a heroic day in Congress, but as his comrades are faithful to their responsibilities, we must be faithful to ours. 
   And one of those responsibilities--even for those of us who have opposed this war--is to support those brave comrades as they continue to do what the President has ordered them to do. 
   And now, today, all of us in the Congress face a dilemma that I foresaw 4 years ago--when President Bush first sent our forces into Iraq: having to choose either to take the guns out of the hands of our soldiers in the field or to let the President move forward with a misguided and reckless policy. 
   Cutting off funds for supplies and equipment for our troops is one way, of course, to bring this war to an end, and I understand why many Americans believe Congress should do so. But the more responsible way to end this war, in my opinion, is to change our policy, and to avoid making an already bad situation worse. 
   I opposed the Bush administration's decision to launch a pre-emptive war in Iraq because I believed it would be a diversion from our larger post 9-11 strategic objectives and I was not convinced that the President had an adequate plan and enough international support to secure and stabilize Iraq after overthrowing its regime. 
   I said at the time that getting into this war would be far easier than getting out. I wrote in March, 2003 that ``success in Iraq is not just about eliminating Saddam Hussein....... Success in Iraq also means managing the ensuing social chaos, keeping a lid on the Middle East powder keg, 
   thwarting terrorist attacks at home, and occupying and rebuilding Iraq--and doing all of this when our own economy is faltering, energy prices are rising and domestic priorities like health care and education are crying out for attention.'' 
   So, I offered my own resolution to slow the rush to war in 2003 and argued for a program of coercive inspections that would have uncovered the truth about weapons of mass destruction before shedding American blood. 
   When that was rejected, I voted against authorizing the President to send our forces into Iraq--and today, more than ever, I am convinced that my vote against the war was the right vote. 
   Congress, nevertheless, voted to give the President the authority to go to war, and he has used that authority, to disastrous effect. 
   I have worked to extricate us from the ongoing disaster. I was among the first in Congress to call for an exit strategy from Iraq. I have introduced legislation, cosponsored legislation, spoken out with my colleagues, published articles, traveled to Iraq to better understand the challenges we face, and asked tough questions of our military leaders during Armed Services Committee hearings. And I continue--every day--to pressure this administration in every way I can. 
   I firmly believe that our challenge is to withdraw from Iraq rapidly--but responsibly. For me, the debate today should be about how to carry out a responsible withdrawal. And that is the point on which I find myself disagreeing with many whose passion to end this war I respect. 
   They argue that the best way to get out is to vote today to cut off funding for our men and women in uniform, and in harm's way. I respectfully disagree, because that would sacrifice a responsible exit in favor of a rapid one--and in good conscience, I cannot support that anymore than I could support the reckless way we were led into this war in the first place. 
   I think responsibility demands that we provide the funding necessary to keep the many thousands of brave Americans now in service in Iraq supplied. With our troops stretched thin, forced to perform longer tours of duty and short of equipment and supplies, funding for the immediate needs of these men and women in uniform cannot be held hostage to disagreements about the folly of Bush administration policies. 
   Make no mistake--I have no doubt that the President's policies have brought our country to the brink of a national security crisis. I am angry that the President still refuses to accept a supplemental funding proposal for Iraq and Afghanistan that provides real accountability measures for ending the Iraq war. I voted to force him to adopt a different course, and when he vetoed that legislation, I voted to override that shortsighted and stubborn exercise of Presidential power. Unfortunately, and primarily because of the misguided loyalty of members of the President's party, that override effort failed, which is why we are considering the legislation now before us. 
   I did not choose the wording of the bill that we are considering today. It is not the bill that I would have written. But it will provide the essential funding to support and protect America's sons and daughters who are in Iraq right now doing everything we have asked of them and putting their lives on the line every day. 
   But another part is to bring pressure to bear on this administration to end this war because I don't want any more young dedicated Americans to lose their lives in this war. I want to bring them home. 
   So far, that pressure has not been enough, as was shown by the President's veto of a bill that fully funded our troops, held the Iraqi government accountable, and demanded that the  President change course and bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end. It is abundantly clear that he is not prepared to adopt a better course--and as long as we lack a sufficient majority to override his veto, we Democrats can't force him to do so without Republican support. 
   But I will persist, because I think it is up to those of us who opposed this war in the first place to show the way forward. 
   That is why, after the Memorial Day recess I will introduce legislation that implements the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group and provides a foundation for the phased withdrawal of American troops out of Iraq beginning in March of next year. So far over 40 Members of Congress--both Democrats and Republicans--have agreed to cosponsor this legislation. 
   I am hopeful that this bipartisan effort will lead to more such efforts. Republicans and Democrats alike believe that this fall is key to the future of U.S. military involvement in Iraq. By then, another funding package will be up for a vote, General Petraeus will be reporting back on the progress of the ``surge,'' and we will have other indications of progress on benchmarks based on reports that the administration will be forced to produce as part of this supplemental funding bill. 
   I commit to continuing to do what I can every day to bring this war to an end. Today, I believe the responsible thing to do is to provide needed funds for our men and women in uniform with this bill, which also includes benchmarks for the Iraqi government--an indispensable step toward having Iraqis begin to take responsibility for their own country's future.

   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I support this supplemental appropriations bill. 
   Among other things, it will provide critically important funding for farmers and ranchers in southeastern Colorado who were hit hard by storms last winter. Thousands of cattle were killed. 
   While I have not seen a final total of the damage resulting from this winter's storms, it seems evident that they will be even worse than those resulting from an October 1997 storm that killed approximately 30,000 cattle and cost farmers and ranchers an estimated $28 million. 
   The struggles that family agriculture producers and small counties face are significant and are having a negative impact on the livelihood of hundreds of farmers and ranchers and their communities. 
   Besides heavy crop and livestock losses and increased production costs associated with rapidly escalating input costs, many producers also face infrastructure losses that pose serious, long-term challenges to economic recovery. 
   So, I am pleased that the bill includes financial assistance for our beleaguered farmers and ranchers, as well as for many others in other parts of the country who need and deserve assistance.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, like H.R. 2237, this bill has serious flaws. However, while I could not vote for H.R. 2237, which would have required rapid withdrawal of troops from Iraq, I will vote for this emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
   I could not support H.R. 2237 for two reasons: 
   First, I do not support the idea of rigidly insisting on a date certain for withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq. I remain convinced that we should steer clear of arbitrary public deadlines for military actions and focus instead on realistic diplomatic and political goals. 
   Second, I am very troubled by the provision that would prohibit funding for troops described as being part of the ``surge.'' 
   My concerns do not reflect support for the administration's strategy. On the contrary, I still think an open-ended escalation--and that is the reality behind the Administration talk about a ``surge''--is no substitute for what is really needed, which is a strategy for containing civil war and a wider regional war. 
   That is why in January, I voted against President Bush's plan to increase the number of troops deployed in Iraq--a course he took against the best advice of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, military leaders, and other policy experts who have warned against extending our military commitment in Iraq. 
   But now nearly 14,000 additional troops have been deployed, and I think it would be irresponsible to vote to cut funding for their weapons and equipment and for all they need to keep them alive and fighting for our country in the midst of Iraq's civil war. 
   In short, while I remain convinced that it was a strategic mistake to go to war in Iraq in the way that the Bush administration did, the fact is that we are still deeply engaged there--and while our troops are in the field, we must provide them what they need. 
   On the other hand, I will vote for H.R. 2206, the revised Supplemental Appropriations bill, primarily for the same reason that I voted for the previous supplemental appropriations bill. 
   I believe we must vote to provide America's men and women in uniform with the equipment and resources they need and with the best health care they may require when they come home. I think it would be grossly irresponsible not to provide these resources. 
   And we must hold the president accountable to the benchmarks set by his own administration and the Iraqi government--including enactment of a hydro-carbon law; conducting of provincial and local elections; reform of current laws governing the de-Baathification process; amendment of the Constitution of Iraq; and allocation of Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects. 
   The bill seeks to hold the president accountable by ``fencing'' half the funds until the Secretary of Defense reports on meeting the benchmarks and Congress votes again to release the remaining funds. 
   I am not convinced that is a workable approach. But, I do not think its effectiveness will be tested, because I do not think it will become law in its present form--partly because the president has said he will veto it if it should reach his desk and partly because every indication is that the Senate will take a different approach. 
   Under these circumstances, I think the most important thing is for the House to pass a supplemental appropriations bill today and then to proceed to a conference with the Senate without further delay. I hope that the result will be a bill that will both provide essential funding for our troops and also hold the president accountable--but for that hope to be realized, it is necessary for the House to act today, and so I will vote for the supplemental appropriations bill now before us.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I am a cosponsor of this legislation and I urge its approval. 
   The bill will provide residents of the District of Columbia (DC) with full representation in the U.S. House of Representatives by permanently expanding the House from 435 to 437 seats, with one of the new seats allocated to DC and the other to the State next entitled to increase its congressional representation. Based on the 2000 Census, Utah is the State next entitled to increase its congressional representation, so Colorado's western neighbors will gain that seat. 
   As we all know, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution authorizes Congress to ``exercise exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever'' over the seat of government--that is, the area ceded to the Federal Government and now known as the District of Columbia. But I think residents of DC should be able to govern themselves--like residents of Colorado--to the maximum extent consistent with allowing the Federal Government to operate. And the fact is that right now more than half a million people living in DC lack an essential element of self-government--full representation in the House of Representatives. So, while residents of Colorado and every other State have a vote regarding the laws that govern DC, the American citizens living there do not. 
   Interestingly, this has not always been the case. The decision to locate the ``seat of government'' on the Potomac was made by the First Congress through enactment of the Residence Act. And for a decade--from 1790 to 1800--District residents were able to vote in Congressional elections in Maryland and Virginia, even though they were not citizens of those states, because of Congressional action recognizing and ratifying the ceding states' laws as the applicable law for the now-federal territory until further legislation. 
   However, in 1800 Congress passed a different law for DC, and since then DC residents have been denied voting representation in Congress--the very entity that has ultimate authority over all aspects of the city's legislative, executive, and judicial functions. And as early as 1801, the citizens of Alexandria petitioned Congress to create a functioning DC municipal government and restore its residents' representation in the House of Representatives. Over the years Congress did act to create a DC municipal government, but its residents remain without voting representation in Congress. This bill would remedy that. 
   Some of the bill's opponents argue that it is not constitutional because representation in Congress is reserved for Americans who live in one of the 50 States. I am not a lawyer, and do not claim to be a constitutional expert. But after careful review of the matter, including the opinions of people who unquestionably are experts, I am not convinced the opponents are right on that point. 
   As I said, the Constitution gives Congress very broad power to legislate regarding the District of Columbia. And, as noted in the Judiciary Committee's report on this bill, many Constitutional experts say that this power includes the power to restore to DC residents the right to vote for a Member of the House of Representatives that existed from 1790 until 1800. 
   In short, their view is that a right given by Act of Congress in 1790, then removed by another Act of Congress in 1800, can be restored by a third Act of Congress in 2007. I find that persuasive, and so I will vote for this bill even though it is likely that this interpretation of Congressional authority will be tested in the courts.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (21ST CENTURY COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to support H.R. 2272, the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007. 
   America has long been a center for science and engineering discovery. Just looking back over the 20th century, American ingenuity has been truly incredible. From Ford's Model T in 1908 and on to the personal computer in 1981, American innovations have transformed our Nation and the world, again and again, creating whole new industries and occupations. Going forward, new innovations will continue to be critical, both in maintaining a solid industrial and economic base and increasing our standard of living. 
   Federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, NSF, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, play a key role by funding cutting-edge research and training the next generation of scientists and engineers. Without Federal investment in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, STEM, research and education, very little of this achievement would have been possible--and we must continue this strong Federal support to reinforce our global competitiveness and our prosperity. 
   H.R. 2272, of which I am a cosponsor, will help strengthen and improve research and education efforts at NSF and NIST, helping to ensure that the United States continues to be a science and technology leader. Specifically, the legislation will reauthorize both NIST and NSF, as well as update the High Performance Computing Act of 1991. 
   For NSF, H.R. 2272 will continue the effort to double its funding over a 10 year time period by authorizing almost $21 billion for fiscal years 2008-2010. The bill will also encourage the participation of more scientists who have not received NSF funding in the past through 1-year seed grants. By targeting these grants toward these new recipients, the legislation will help support early career researchers and encourage higher-risk research. 
   The legislation also includes a needed funding increase for overall laboratory research at NIST. As part of the American Competitiveness initiative, NIST will use these funds to expand upon its world-class research, ensuring that the United States will continue to be globally competitive in many industries. I am also pleased to see that the legislation reauthorizes and gradually increases funding for key technology transfer programs like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, program and the Technology Innovation Program, TIP. 
   NIST is particularly important to me because one of its key laboratories is located in Boulder, Colorado, in my district. The Boulder labs employ more than 350 people and serve as a science and engineering center for significant research across the Nation. 
   A critical component of this legislation is that it includes funding for construction at these laboratories. NIST's Boulder facilities have contributed to great scientific advances, but they are now over 50 years old and have not been well maintained. Many environmental factors such as the humidity and vibrations from traffic can affect the quality of research performed at NIST. In fiscal year 2007, NIST-Boulder will begin an extension of Building 1 to make room for a Precision Metrology lab. This new facility will allow for incredibly precise control of temperature, relative humidity, air filtration and vibration to advance research on critical technologies, such as atomic clocks telecommunications, and nanomaterials. To complete this extension, NIST will need further funding in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. H.R. 2272 authorizes this critical funding. 
   As co-chair of the STEM Education caucus, I am also pleased that H.R. 2272 contains support and funding for NSF's STEM education programs. These programs include the Math and Science Partnerships program and the Noyce Scholarships program, as well as several STEM education grants that focus on teacher professional development. These will help increase the number of well-qualified science and math teachers across the country, both through creating more teachers from current college students and by providing better training for the teachers already in our schools. 
   I would like to thank Science and Technology Committee Chairman GORDON, as well as Ranking Member HALL and the other original cosponsors, for introducing this critical bipartisan legislation and working to bring it to the floor today. 
   I think we all recognize that investing in basic research and STEM education is critical for a strong economy and national security, and H.R. 2272 will help us improve the critical support for STEM education and research. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this bill because of the urgent need to protect middle-income families from a massive tax increase that will hit them if we do not act to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. 
   In technical terms, the bill would extend for one year AMT relief for nonrefundable personal credits and increase the AMT exemption amount to $66,250 for joint filers and $44,350 for individuals. 
   In real-world terms, that means it will prevent a tax increase for more than 302,600 Colorado households that otherwise would be required to pay more in Federal income tax when returns are due next year. 
   In addition, it will let taxpayers who do not itemize deductions take advantage of an additional standard deduction of up to $700 (for couples who file jointly) for State and local real property taxes--something that will greatly help many thousands of Coloradans affected by those property taxes. And it also will increase the eligibility for the refundable child tax credit. 
   Further, the bill will extend many important tax-law provisions scheduled to expire this year. 
   These include an extension of the deductibility of certain tuition and related expenses, which helps many to gain an education, and an extension of the ability of teachers to deduct the money they spend from their own pockets for supplies used in their classrooms. 
   The bill will help our men and women in uniform and our veterans in several ways, including extension of the ability of those receiving combat pay to count it for purposes of the earned income credit; extension of the special  rules that help veterans qualify for State-operated, tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond programs for access to low-interest mortgages; and the extension of rules that allow reservists called to active duty to make penalty-free withdrawals from their retirement plans if they need to do so. 
   Other important provisions will allow people to continue to make charitable contributions from their individual retirement accounts, IRAs, without incurring tax penalties and will allow Colorado ranchers and other landowners to benefit from favorable tax treatment of their actions to protect open space through conservation easements. 
   The bill also will delay implementation of a requirement, passed when our friends on the other side of the aisle were in the majority, that requires local governments (and others) to assume the burden of withholding part of the money going to those under contract to provide goods and services. This requirement is strongly opposed by county commissioners and other local officials across Colorado as well as by many companies that build roads or do other work under contracts with our State and local governments. 
   In addition, the bill includes provisions to directly address the problems facing many people affected by the problems besetting the housing market. One of these is a permanent repeal of the current law's requirement that people pay income tax on the phantom ``income'' they supposedly receive when they are no longer required to pay on a mortgage because they have lost their 
   homes to foreclosure or they are able to work out arrangements to avoid that result. Another will extend through 2014 the current ability of people to deduct the part of their mortgage payment that pays for mortgage insurance. 
   The bill also extends provisions that encourage research and development activities that are crucial to our country's economic future. It will allow restaurants and other small businesses to continue to take advantage of a realistic write-off period for improvements to their facilities. And it will retain the current law that encourages restaurants and other companies to donate unused food from their inventories to help feed people who need that assistance. 
   Mr. Speaker, all these are good provisions, and the bill overall is properly focused on tax relief for middle class families--a goal I strongly support. 
   But I do have some reservations about how the bill seeks to provide that relief without making our Federal deficit worse. 
   The bill's authors propose to pay for these provisions with a change in the current law that gives a substantial tax break to some investment fund managers by letting them treat part of their overall compensation as if were a capital gain on an investment. Another is a change to delay further a provision currently scheduled to take in effect next year regarding the rules for allocating certain expenses of companies that operate overseas. And a third is a change in the rules about taxation of deferred compensation. 
   Since this bill was introduced, there has been considerable debate about these provisions. I am not convinced that these provisions are the best or only way to offset the revenue costs of providing a temporary fix to the AMT--but the bill's opponents have suggested no alternative except to cut unspecified amounts of spending in unspecified parts of the budget or to further add to the ``debt tax'' that has already been imposed on our children (and their children) by the irresponsible policies of the last seven years. 
   The Senate will have to consider the legislation further, and if it makes changes a conference will have to resolve differences between their version and the bill now before us. So, it is possible that these provisions will be revised. 
   Mr. Speaker, I must note that I do not believe that it is wise to include in this bill, designed to address the AMT problem and to extend expiring tax-law provisions, such an unrelated matter as a restriction on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits of individuals living in the Virgin Islands. I think that if that issue is to be addressed, it should be done separately, perhaps in connection with a review of how IRS audits are conducted in Colorado and other locations as well. I will not oppose the legislation before us on that ground alone, but I think we do a disservice to the public debate on AMT reform by attempting to attach such a provision, and in any event I am not convinced it is wise to interfere with the IRS auditing process. 
   But, finally, the bottom line is that today we have the opportunity to provide tax relief to hundreds of thousands of middle-class families in Colorado. I think that is something I think the House can and should do without delay, and that is why I am voting for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will support this bill. 
   I will do so because, as I have consistently said, I do think the basic law in this area--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA--needs to be updated to respond to changes in technology, which was the purpose of the current, temporary law. 
   That is why, last August, I voted for a bill (H.R. 3356) to provide such an update--a bill that was supported by a majority of the House, but did not pass because it was considered under a procedure that required a two-thirds vote for passage, which did not occur because of the opposition of the Bush Administration. It was supported by all but three of our Republican colleagues. 
   That is also why I voted for another bill to update FISA--H.R. 3773, the ``Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseer, Reviewed, and Effective'' (or RESTORE) Act--which the House passed on November 15th of last year. Like those bills I supported earlier, this bill will replace the Protect America Act, enacted in August 2007--which I opposed. 
   The bill makes it very clear that to conduct surveillance targeting a person in the United States, the government first must obtain an individual warrant from the FISA Court, based upon probable cause. 
   And, importantly, it explicitly states that FISA and Title III of the U.S. criminal code are the exclusive means by which the government may conduct surveillance on American soil, and adds that any future statute must expressly authorize surveillance if the government is going to rely on it to conduct domestic surveillance. 
   It also includes new legal protections for Americans abroad, requiring an individual probable cause determination by the FISA Court when the government seeks to conduct surveillance of U.S. persons located outside the United States. 
   It requires prior review and approval by the FISA Court of the targeting and minimization procedures used to conduct surveillance of any foreign targets (unless in an emergency, in which case the government may authorize the surveillance and then apply to the FISA Court for approval within 7 days), and requires that this surveillance be conducted in accordance with the Fourth Amendment. And it requires the government to establish guidelines to ensure that Americans are not targeted by this surveillance (``reverse 
   targeting guidelines''), and requires the government to provide those reverse targeting guidelines to Congress and the FISA Court. 
   The legislation also includes important provisions to increase transparency and accountability. For example, it requires there be a comprehensive review of the President's warrantless surveillance program by the Inspectors General of the Justice Department, the Directorate of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, and the Defense Department--and it provides for them to report the results to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. 
   This report will review ``all of the facts necessary to describe the establishment, implementation, product, and use of the Program,'' as well as ``communications with, and participation of, individuals and entities in the private sector related to the Program.'' 
   I do not find equally satisfactory another aspect of the bill that involves accountability--the treatment of pending lawsuits against various telecommunication companies that acted to implement President Bush's clandestine surveillance program. 
   Like the bills I supported earlier, this measure would provide civil liability protection for private sector companies that provide lawful assistance to the government in the future. But it differs significantly in the way it addresses those pending lawsuits, which deal with the previous actions of the defendant companies. 
   Those lawsuits have been consolidated and are pending in one court, but evidently have made little progress because of the Administration's argument, still awaiting court resolution, that the suits are barred because they involve state secrets. My understanding is that the defendant companies have argued that government's invocation of the state-secrets privilege has had the result of preventing them from defending themselves, although at least one company has stated in regulatory filings that the cases against it are without merit. 
   President Bush has insisted that Congress throw these cases out of court by giving the companies retroactive immunity for whatever they might have done in connection with the surveillance program, even though the Administration and the companies themselves insist that those actions were lawful and that the plaintiffs' complaints against the companies have no merit. 
   Regrettably, the Senate decided to comply with the president's demand on this point, and its version of this legislation would provide that retroactive immunity. I do not think that was the right decision because I agree with the Rocky Mountain News, which in a February 15th editorial said ``Letting this litigation proceed would not, as Bush [has] said .....punish companies that want to `help America.' Businesses that want to help America need to be mindful of the Constitution--and so should the government.'' 
   I supported removing that ``state secret'' barrier and allowing the companies to defend themselves by demonstrating to the court the evidence they say supports their arguments in a way that assures the continued security of that evidence and that avoids the public disclosure the Administration says would be adverse to the national interest. This is a process that has worked well in criminal cases, and while I am certainly not an expert on the matter, I think it can work when applied to these civil cases. 
   In that respect, this bill is similar to the legislation I supported earlier this year. But it is not identical, and I do not think it is quite as sound. 
   Under this bill, a district court hearing such a case will decide whether the Attorney General's certification attesting that the liability protection standard has been met and is supported by substantial evidence. In making that determination, the court will have the opportunity to examine the highly classified letters to the providers that indicated the President had authorized the activity and that it had been determined to be lawful.  
   That is not as strong a requirement for accountability as I would prefer. However, in such cases both plaintiffs and defendants will have the opportunity to file public briefs on legal issues and the court should include in any public order a description of the legal standards that govern the order. 
   And, importantly, this immunity provision does not apply to any actions against the Government for any alleged injuries caused by government officials. 
   Madam Speaker, as Benjamin Franklin has warned us, people who value security over liberty will get neither--and the Bush Administration has finally agreed to end its disregard for liberty and agree to effective judicial oversight and involvement in intelligence surveillance. 
   That agreement that is embodied in this bill, and the choice before us now is whether to reject it or to support the compromise measure now before us. 
   After careful review, I have concluded that the bill adequately meets the test of protecting civil liberties while giving our country tools needed to effectively combat terrorism. 
   So, while--like any compromise--the bill is not ideal, I have decided the correct decision--the one that will fulfill my responsibility to protect both our national security and the civil liberties that make our nation worth defending--is to vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' H.R. 3963 does not end health care inequality, but it would PROVIDE continued coverage for children not covered by Medicaid, whose parents cannot afford to buy insurance and whose employers do not provide it. 
   These children--currently 6 million of them--are now eligible for coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)--but that program is set to expire and the President should have accepted this compromise legislation. Because the President would not accept the bi-partisan compromise bill we passed earlier, these six million children will go without health insurance unless Congress acts. 
   This legislation would assure continued coverage for those now enrolled and would ALSO provide coverage for an additional four million children who currently qualify, but who are not yet enrolled under CHIP. 
   The past concerns raised against SCHIP reauthorization by some have been addressed. The language concerning coverage levels and citizenship have been clarified and strengthened to remove any doubt that illegal immigrants are not covered under SCHIP. 
   The majority of uninsured children are currently eligible for coverage--but better outreach and adequate funding are needed to identify and enroll them. This bill gives States the tools and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program. 
   Earlier this year, I voted for the ``CHAMP'' bill to extend CHIP. The House of Representatives passed that bill, and I had hoped the Senate would follow suit. It would have increased funding for the CHIP program to $50 million, instead of the lesser amount provided by this bill. The CHAMP bill would have also addressed major health care issues, first by protecting traditional Medicare and second by addressing the catastrophic 10 percent payment cuts to physicians who serve Medicare patients. 
   However, in a compromise with the Senate, Congress did not send the CHAMP bill to the president. Instead, we passed a more limited, bipartisan compromise. Regrettably, the president chose to veto it and his veto was sustained. 
   So here we are again, the bill in front of us today deserves our strong support. It will pay for continued CHIP coverage by raising the federal tax by $0.61 per pack of cigarettes and similar amounts on other tobacco products. According to the American Cancer society, this means that youth smoking will be reduced by seven percent while overall smoking will be reduced by four percent, with the potential that 900,000 lives will be saved. 
   H.R. 3963 has the support of the American Medical Association, American Association of Retired Persons, Catholic Health Association, Healthcare Leadership Council, National Associations of Children's Hospitals, American Nurses Association, U.S. Conference of Mayors, NAACP, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and United Way of America. 
   It is imperative that we pass this legislation in order to protect those that are most vulnerable in our society by increasing health insurance coverage for low-income children. I hope that we have the opportunity to take up the other important Medicare issues addressed in the CHAMP bill soon.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I will vote to override the Presidents veto of this urgently needed legislation. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said ``of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' H.R. 976 does not end health care inequality, but it would have provided continued coverage for children not covered by Medicare but whose parents cannot afford to buy insurance and whose employers do not provide it. 
   These children--currently 6 million of them--are now eligible for coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)--but that program is set to expire and the President should have accepted this compromise legislation. Because the President does not accept this bi-partisan compromise bill, these 6 million will no longer have access to quality, affordable health insurance. 
   This legislation would assure continued coverage for those now enrolled and would provide coverage for an additional 4 million children who currently qualify, but who are not yet enrolled under CHIP. 
   I believe that health care should be a right, not a privilege, and this act is a step in the right direction toward that goal. So, I support this bill although I wish it went further. 
   Despite claims by some, this bill does not change the basic nature of the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains current eligibility requirements for CHIP. The majority of uninsured children are currently eligible for coverage--but better outreach and adequate funding are needed to identify and enroll them. This bill gives states the tools and incentives necessary to reach millions of uninsured children who are eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program. 
   Earlier this year, I voted for the ``CHAMP'' bill to extend CHIP. The House of Representatives passed that bill, and I had hoped the Senate would follow suit.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote for H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. I support making changes to the Medicare Part D plan to make it more accessible, affordable and easier to understand. 
   H.R. 4 repeals the part of the current law that prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating with drug companies for lower prices for those enrolled in Medicare drug plans. The bill would instead require the Secretary to conduct cost-saving negotiations, and in conducting these negotiations, the Secretary may not restrict access to certain medicines in Medicare, for example by requiring a formulary to be used by Medicare Advantage plans. Finally, the bill would require the Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the negotiations conducted no later than June 1, 2007, and every six months thereafter. 
   I am voting for this legislation because I hear from seniors in my district about how they are struggling to pay for the medicines their doctors tell them they need to take. No senior should be faced with the decision of cutting their pills in half, or pay their drug bill or their electric bill. 
   However, I have some doubts that this negotiation will actually result in lower prices than what private plans are already achieving for seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report on January 5, 2007, titled ``Federal Drug Price Negotiation: Implications for Medicare Part D,'' which says that the bill ``may not necessarily lead to lower costs for beneficiaries.'' The report also says the bill could affect the number and types of drugs that would be available to seniors and the amount of research and development and innovation by pharmaceutical companies. Nonetheless, H.R. 4 gives the Secretary of HHS great latitude in how negotiations will be conducted, and it is my hope that the Secretary will enter into these negotiations in a way that won't harm seniors' access to medicines or negatively impact new drug research and discoveries. Large employers, states and large pharmacy chains all use their bargaining clout to obtain lower prices for their consumers; Medicare should have the same opportunity to bargain for lower prices for America's seniors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think we need to try dfferent approaches to make lifesaving medicines available to our nation's seniors so I'll vote for this bill. I will continue to work on a prescription drug program that meets the needs of our nation's seniors.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, I will support H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007. Overall, it is an excellent bill, but I do have a serious concern about the impact of one provision, the state maintenance-of-efforts provision, on Colorado. 
   This bill will reauthorize the Higher Education Act and will help make our colleges and universities more affordable and accessible. 
   I am especially pleased that this bill will help students and families trying to afford the increasing costs of college. The bill increases the maximum Pell grant award to $9,000 annually, up from $5,800. Pell Grants enable many students to attend college, but with rising tuition costs these grants have lost some  of their purchasing power. This increase will allow Pell Grants to help students limit debt and expand their education opportunities. Also, Pell Grant scholarships availability will be expanded to year-round to allow students to use the funding when it best works with their schedule. 
   Not only will H.R. 4137 increase federal aid, but it will also make the process of applying for that aid much more straightforward. Streamlining the application process for Federal aid will make it easier for students and their families to determine if they are eligible for Federal loans. The bill will also create a two-page ``FAFSA-EZ'' form for low-income students and families who qualify for the ``auto-zero'' family contribution. 
   And the legislation will not just help students from low-income families--it will help all students become better informed by requiring that the Department of Education publicly provide a user-friendly list of all colleges and universities in the country with information on tuition and fees, average price after grant aid, recent price increases, and change in per-student spending. 
   Textbooks are a growing--and often overlooked--cost of attending college. Students can spend hundreds of dollars on textbooks every semester, adding up to thousands of dollars by the time they graduate. The bill requires college textbook publishers to provide full pricing information about both bundled textbooks and unbundled alternatives. It also requires that publishers sell unbundled versions of every bundled textbook they sell so that students are not forced to purchase unneeded extras, such as study guides or CDs. 
   H.R. 4137 reauthorizes two critical programs that help disadvantaged students thrive in college. GEAR-UP helps prepare low-income elementary and secondary students to succeed in college and the bill increases the authorized funding to $400 million for GEAR-UP. It also increases the authorization level for the TRIO programs--Upward Bound, Talent Search, and Student Services--to $950 million. The TRIO programs seek to increase high school completion and college participation and graduation rates among low-income and first- generation college students. African-American students make up nearly 50 percent of all TRIO participants. 
   The bill recognizes the debt that our country owes to our soldiers and their families. It creates a new scholarship program for active duty military personnel and their family members to help make college more affordable. The bill also establishes support centers to help veterans succeed in college and graduate. 
   As co-chair of the House Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education caucus, I am pleased that this bill builds upon the America COMPETES Act to expand and improve STEM education. It creates programs to bolster students' interest in STEM careers through collaborations with businesses and other stakeholders, as well as improves teacher training and development programs and focuses on recruiting teachers into high demand science and technology fields. 
   As I mentioned, I am particularly concerned about the impact that the maintenance-of-effort provision will have on my state of Colorado. This provision ties Federal funding to state funding. Though I applaud the effort by Chairman MILLER to encourage states to continue to support higher education, Colorado is in an unusual position because we have several constitutional provisions that limit the spending options of our legislature. These include the Tax Payer's Bill of Rights, or TABOR, and another that requires that the state increase funding for K through 12 education every year. Together with other constraints, these provisions have seriously affected the state's ability to fund higher education--and the maintenance-of-effort provision will not help matters. 
   While the manager's amendment improved this provision, I will work to see that this issue is further addressed in conference. 
   In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4137.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill because I strongly support a responsible redeployment of our troops from Iraq. 
   It should not have been necessary for us to consider this bill today. Back in March, I voted for, and Congress passed, legislation that would have begun a draw-down of combat troops in favor of a disengagement strategy in Iraq. Regrettably, however, the president vetoed that legislation and then moved in exactly the opposite direction by escalating the number of troops committed to Iraq. 
   So, while a war can't be effectively led by committee, by failing to exercise responsible leadership, the president continues to make it necessary for Congress to assert itself. And thus the House is acting again today--and whatever the outcome, we will act again and again until we find the necessary support to change course in Iraq. 
   The war in Iraq has cost this Nation the blood of its soldiers, the treasure of its citizens, and the good will of our allies around the world. The average number of attacks, Iraqi civilian deaths, and coalition deaths are all at their highest levels since the invasion. Over 3,600 American soldiers have died in Iraq, and we are spending over $10 billion every month to continue this failed policy. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I must point out that the time is rapidly approaching when we will not be able to sustain the numbers of troops now deployed in Iraq without calling back our National Guard and Reserve for second or third tours or extending the tours of current active duty troops beyond the already extended 15 months.  
   And our increasing military and financial commitment to Iraq limits our options for addressing other critical national security concerns even as a new intelligence report indicates that al Qaeda is operationally stronger than a year ago. The most disturbing news is that al Qaeda has regrouped to an extent not seen since 2001. 
   Proponents of the President's escalation--the so-called ``surge''--say we haven't given it a chance to succeed. But it has been under way since January, with the Iraqi government fully aware of the steps toward reconciliation it needs to take to enable U.S. forces to stay--and still, those steps aren't being taken. Today's interim report from the Pentagon tries to make a bad situation look better, listing ``satisfactory'' progress on a number of benchmarks required by the Congress several months ago. But in reality, as the report states, ``the security situation in Iraq remains complex and extremely challenging,'' the ``economic picture is uneven'' and political reconciliation is lagging. 
   I had hoped that by holding the president and the Iraqi government accountable for achieving these benchmarks, we would gain the leverage necessary to pressure the Iraqi government to forge the political solution we all know is required. But it appears that the Iraqi government is either unable or unwilling to bring its feuding factions together to achieve these goals. 
   The Pentagon's report blames those of us pushing for redeployment for the lack of progress toward political reconciliation, saying it has been hampered by ``increasing concern among Iraqi political leaders that the United States may not have a long term-commitment to Iraq.'' 
   But if the Iraqis won't make progress when we're there--and then threaten that they can't make progress if we leave--under what conditions will we see progress? The president has asked Congress to wait to act for the next progress report due in September. But what are we waiting for? He has dressed up his new approaches in many different ways since this war started over four years ago, and yet little has changed. 
   What we need--and what many Democrats and Republicans alike are calling for--is a responsible redeployment from Iraq. That is what the bipartisan Iraq Study Group ultimately called for, and that is the main reason I introduced legislation to implement its recommendations. I continue to hold out hope that we can forge a bipartisan consensus in favor of adopting the ISG as a foundation for a phased withdrawal strategy. I believe in this approach because responsible redeployment would allow Iraqis to take control of their own security by reducing U.S. combat forces while limiting the U.S. military to missions such as counter-terrorism, protecting U.S. Embassy personnel, and training Iraqi security forces. This bill will also allow necessary flexibility for our military forces to continue strikes against al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   This legislation calls for the beginning of redeployment and a troop draw-down within the next four months. It takes a different approach from H.R. 2237, the bill introduced by Representative JIM MCGOVERN (D-MA) that I opposed two months ago, in that it would not prohibit funding for our troops already in Iraq, and it requires the president to submit a comprehensive strategy providing specific plans for diplomatic initiatives and justifying the number of U.S. troops who would remain and explaining their missions. 
   I do question whether we can extricate all combat troops by April 2008, as it calls for--it could take as long as six months to move over one hundred thousand soldiers and their gear and to do this safely. This is one military exercise that we have to take seriously and spend time and resources to plan--because it could mean life or death for our men and women in uniform. But I believe we should set a target date now and begin this planning. This bill would force a change in strategy and mandate the start of a phased withdrawal and redeployment, and that is why I will vote for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. I will be very proud to support the bill on final passage. 
   While clearly this reform legislation, and I want to underline this is reform legislation, is a positive step forward in ag policy, I believe my amendment improves the bill. It is a win-win for ranchers and the environment. 
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment is modest and very simple. It would make a small reduction in the direct payment rate for cotton, just two-thirds of a cent. That savings, which would be $127 million, would be used to fund additional enrollment in the Grassland Reserve Program. The Grassland Reserve Program is a jointly administered program by the National Resources Conservation Service and the Farm Service Agency. It uses long-term rental agreements and easements to help landowners and producers restore and protect grasslands while maintaining them in a condition suitable for grazing. 
   This investment of Federal dollars also helps to leverage State and local monies to expand these preservation areas. The reserves that I am speaking of provide habitat for diverse wildlife, including prairie chickens, grassland birds, game species, and prairie plants. Unfortunately, it was underfunded in the previous farm bill. There remains, therefore, a significant backlog for those wanting to access the program. 
   According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture, the 2006 backlog of unfunded applications totaled more than $1.1 billion, or 11 million acres, and interest continues to grow. 
   Now, the Agriculture Committee has made great strides to enhance this grasslands program, but their hard work will be for naught unless there is additional funding to ease the backlog of program applicants. We really cannot wait to make this investment because much of America's grassland continues to be converted to row crops, and other grasslands throughout the west are being developed and subdivided. 
   According to CRS, between 1982 and 2003, we have lost more than 10 percent of our pastureland, which is over 10 million acres. 
   The amendment would reduce total direct payments in the bill by less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Direct payments are not the only support for cotton producers in the bill. As the committee report notes, there are important changes in the loan program to make American cotton more competitive and move stocks out of storage. The bill also allows the Department of Agriculture to continue to pay for upland cotton storage until 2012. 
   So the amendment doesn't cause real great hardship for cotton producers, but it would help many of our ranchers. I urge the House to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   As I close my arguments for this important amendment, I would again like to thank the chairman and ranking member for a bill that truly is about reform. That is the theme I would like to strike here. This amendment would take us further down the path of reform. 
   This is less than one-tenth of 1 percent to expand the Grassland Reserve Program. I would note for the record that a number of organizations that are highly respected in the States of Texas and Minnesota and all over the country support the amendment. The American Farmland Trust, Environmental Working Group, Republicans for Environmental Protection, the National Wildlife Federation, the American Bird Conservancy, Defenders of Wildlife, the Trust for Public Land all think that this amendment makes real sense. 
   It is $127 million, less than one-tenth of 1 percent out of the direct payments program to preserve these important legacy areas, our grasslands, in the great American west. I urge an ``aye'' vote. This is an important amendment that would help strengthen the bill.     
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (COLORADO NORTHERN FRONT RANGE MOUNTAIN BACKDROP PROTECTION STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 903, the Colorado Northern Front Range Mountain Backdrop Protection Study bill. 
   It is identical to a measure that passed the House last year but on which the Senate did not complete action. I appreciate the actions of Chairman Rahall, Ranking Member Don Young, and the staff of the Natural Resources Committee for making it possible for the House to consider it today. 
   The bill is intended to help local communities identify ways to protect the Front Range Mountain Backdrop in the northern sections of the Denver-metro area, especially the region just west of what will soon be the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. 
   The Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest includes much of the land in this backdrop area, but there are other lands as well. 
   Rising dramatically from the Great Plains, the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains provides a scenic mountain backdrop to many communities in the Denver metropolitan area and elsewhere in Colorado. 
   The portion of the range addressed in this bill also includes a diverse array of wildlife habitats and provides many opportunities for outdoor recreation. 
   Its open-space character is an important esthetic and economic asset for adjoining communities, making them attractive locations for homes and businesses. 
   But rapid population growth in the northern Front Range area of Colorado is increasing recreational use of the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest and is also placing increased pressure for development of other lands. 
   We can see this throughout Colorado and especially along the Front Range. 
   Homes and shopping centers are spreading up the valleys and along the highways. This development then spreads out along the ridges and mountain tops that make up the backdrop. 
   The result is potential loss of many of the very qualities that attract new residents. 
   This bill is designed to help provide a better understanding of what steps might be done to lessen that risk. 
   Already, local governments and other entities have provided important protection for portions of this mountain backdrop. 
   The bill acknowledges their good work and aims to assist further efforts along the same lines. 
   The bill does not interfere with the authority of local authorities regarding land use planning. 
   And it does not infringe on private property rights. 
   Instead, it will bring the land protection experience of the Forest Service to the table to assist local efforts to protect areas that comprise the backdrop. 
   Under the bill, the Forest Service will work in collaboration with local communities, the state, nonprofit groups, and other parties. 
   I think this is in the national interest. 
   The backdrop both beckoned settlers westward and was a daunting challenge to their progress. Their first exposure to the harshness and humbling majesty of the Rocky Mountain West helped define a region, and the pioneers' independent spirit and respect for nature still lives with us to this day. 
   We need to work to maintain the mountain backdrop as a cultural and natural heritage for ourselves and generations to come. 
   This bill is intended to assist in that effort, and I urge its approval.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. 
   In the time Congress has taken to debate what steps to take to address the housing crisis and its related economic impact, hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their homes to foreclosure and the U.S. economy has continued to weaken. 
   Since last year, the House has been responding, and most of the provisions of this legislation are identical or similar to measures that we have passed previously. However, only now has the Senate acted, by passing the revised version of H.R. 3221 that is now before us. As a result, much precious time has passed--and the time to act is now. 
   Adding to the urgency is the need to respond to the perceived problems affecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--and the Bush administration's request that Congress act to validate the steps by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to restore confidence in the soundness of those companies that are so critical, not just to the mortgage market, but the national economy and the international standing of the U.S. dollar. 
   The provisions to implement this administration proposal have drawn serious criticism from well-informed people concerned that they do not strike the right balance between the value of supporting those entities and the value of subjecting them to the same market forces that affect other private concerns. 
   I have carefully considered those criticisms, especially because, as a son of the West, I  prefer the Federal Government's influence to be limited, in particular when it involves the free market process. Our Nation's history has shown, however, that in certain times it is the duty of the federal government to take action to help people responsibly address problems they face--particularly if, as in this case, government may have contributed to the problems. 
   The value of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock has plummeted in the last year, down about 80 percent. The most dramatic slide occurred just weeks ago, and it was the promise that Congress would pass--and the President would sign into law--this legislation that halted the Government Sponsored Enterprises' (GSEs) freefall. With Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac responsible for $5 trillion worth of residential mortgages--nearly half of the value in home loans nationwide--our economy could be crippled for years. With the backing of the U.S. Treasury Department, as outlined in this bill, we can avoid such a catastrophe. 
   This bill also places a strong regulator in position to oversee Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, and protect against any similar pitfalls in the future. 
   On the ground in neighborhoods throughout America, the importance of this legislation is much more concrete. Simply put, this legislation will help American families at risk of foreclosure work responsibly with their lenders to stay in their homes. The number of foreclosed properties soared through the first six months of this year, with more than 340,000 American families losing their homes. 
   This bill will help hundreds of thousands of American families remain in their homes by allowing the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to guarantee qualified loans. However, both lenders and homeowners must agree to sacrifice in order to receive the FHA's backing, with lenders having to voluntarily take significant losses by reducing the loan principal, and homeowners having to repay the government a percentage of the value of the home if they sell or refinance again. 
   This legislation also provides States with funding to purchase, rehabilitate and sell foreclosed properties, and in the process improve the value and quality of neighborhoods hardest hit by the housing crunch. This package will help remove some of the housing industry's excess inventory by providing a refundable tax credit for first-time homebuyers, and by increasing the Veterans Administration home loan guarantee limit, so that our veterans can receive the expanded home ownership opportunities they deserve for serving our nation. 
   This legislation also creates an affordable housing trust fund, paid for with a percentage of future GSE profits, to provide acceptable affordable housing for low- and extremely low-income families--those who were too often the victims of deceitful and predatory subprime lending practices. 
   Mr. Speaker, my home State of Colorado was one of the first to realize the devastation of this housing crisis. Foreclosed homes can be found in far too many neighborhoods, especially in Adams County just outside of Denver--serving as a sober reminder of the need for housing reform. I was encouraged today to learn that the Bush administration removed its opposition to this bill. This legislation has been carefully crafted to safeguard against fraud, corporate giveaways and speculator abuse, and to provide a foothold for our nation's housing market to begin to rebound. This bill is a major step toward a more stable housing market, a more stable economy, and more stable households throughout the Nation. 
   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. UDALL of Colorado. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this resolution that President Bush has regrettably made necessary. 
   The immediate effect of the resolution will be to allow deferral of a vote on the proposed free trade agreement with Colombia. 
   Some say that the longer-term effect will be to make approval of that agreement impossible. But I think the reality could be just the reverse, because as you have said, Mr. Speaker, at this point the odds are against its approval and so deferring the vote on the agreement could be the only way it might ever be approved. 
   I have supported Free Trade Agreements with Bahrain, Singapore, Chile, Morocco, Australia, Jordan, Oman, and Peru, I'd like the opportunity to consider the merits of a Columbia FTA, but cannot jump to the conclusion that its provisions are fully acceptable, and I am troubled by allegations that labor organizers have been terrorized by government authorities in Columbia. It seems to me that the proponents of this agreement have the burden of making a compelling case that the agreement meets criteria Congress has insisted upon with regard to labor protections. 
   Therefore, deferring the vote will allow additional time for the Bush Administration and the other supporters of the agreement either to the make the case that it should be approved in its current form or to work with the Colombian government and the Congress to make revisions to respond to objections raised by its opponents. 
   It should not have been necessary for the House to act to provide that time. If President Bush had been willing to do more to resolve those objections, we would not be taking such action. But by deciding to formally transmit the agreement, which set in motion the so-called ``fast track'' procedures of the current law applicable to trade agreements, the President has brought us to this point. 
   And while the details are different, that approach is very similar to the one the president has followed on many other matters--demanding approval of his proposals and refusing to work with Members of Congress to resolve objections or accommodate other suggestions. 
   We have seen the pattern over and over, from the repeated vetoes of legislation to expand the State Children's Health Program, SCHIP, to revising the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, and with regard to more other matters than I have time to list. 
   But this time, by adopting this resolution, we can give President Bush time to reconsider that way of doing business, and give the other proponents of the Colombia trade agreement time to make the case for why it should be approved.
