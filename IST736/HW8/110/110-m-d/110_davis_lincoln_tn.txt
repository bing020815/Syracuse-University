<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. To the gentleman from Arkansas, thanks very much for your leadership on many of the issues that our Blue Dog Coalition championed here in the House. We championed them for many years, about 1994, 1995, when the Blue Dogs were established. 
   Basically, this group of individuals initially offered both sides, both caucuses, the opportunity to participate in the Blue Dogs, Republican and Democrats alike. 
   I have always continued to feel very confident that in America today we need American Democrats and American Republicans more than ever. What I mean by that is that we need Americans first and political parties next. Certainly those two political parties have done a tremendous job in driving many of the debates on many of the important issues important in America. 
   It has also given America a history as being the country in the world that championed civil rights, individual rights, and civil liberties; and we continue to do that. In many cases, as we  have engaged in battlefields throughout history, it has been to bring about democracy and freedom. 
   But as we talk about this, I want to digress just a moment and talk about a particular situation that is being considered today, which will be what's called combat training for our airmen. In many cases we put our soldiers who are in the Air Force in the battlefield, the battle zones, in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, in my opinion, without proper training for EMS, in the event there is something that happens that they are in the battlefield, they may be injured. I don't think they are properly trained, and, in many cases, we need to do that. So we are actually talking now about locating CBAT, which will be combat training for airmen in different areas. 
   I want to read a comment that I have prepared for the potential location of this particular facility. 
   From the Manhattan Project to TVA to the Apollo project to the Spallation Neutron Source and so much more, the Tennessee Valley Corridor and its key institutions, communities, businesses, and congressional leaders have always exemplified the phrase, ``National Leadership through Regional Cooperation.'' 
   Key leaders in our region continue to support our Nation by working to enhance and advance the corridor's key science technology and national security assets. 
   With that, one of the big challenges in warfare is adequate training for our combat troops. Afghanistan and Iraq have placed a new demand on the airmen of our Air Force for needed combat air support. These increased demands include prison guard duty, combat convoy support, and significant expanded security force duty. 
   With these additional responsibilities, the Air Force has acknowledged its airmen are lacking the ground combat skills necessary to meet today's demands. To address these needs, the Air Force has proposed, as former Air Force Secretary Roche has described it, a new program to ``bring together our battlefield airmen under a common training and organization structure to strengthen the combat power they bring to the fight.'' 
   Weapons training, tactical field cooperation operations and land navigation training, basic combat skills, physical fitness training and basic medical training will be a part of the core curriculum provided by new Common Battlefield Airman Training (CBAT) program. 
   The proposed location for this new Common Battlefield Airman Training program has now been narrowed down to three potential sites, one of which is in my district, Arnold Engineering Development Center in Arnold Air Force Base near Tullahoma, Tennessee. 
   Key leaders in the Tennessee Valley Corridor and I are convinced that establishing CBAT at Arnold Air Force Base would be the best course of action, an exceptional investment for the Air Force and the Nation. Arnold Air Force Base and the Arnold Engineering Development Center are already home to the world's premier flight simulations testing facility and continue to be vital national resources in the development of many of the Nation's top priority aerospace and national defense programs. 
   Arnold, with its history of extensive combat training during World War II, had abundant land available for CBAT training, with a dedicated 200-acre campus, small arms firing range and 9,000 acres for additional required training. In short, middle Tennessee and the Tennessee Valley Corridor have a world-class facility ready and willing to house this important new training operation. 
   The Coffee County community, the middle Tennessee/north Alabama region and, indeed, the entire Tennessee Valley Corridor strongly support our Nation's Armed Forces and their training needs as they continue to serve and defend our Nation. A better trained corps of airmen will not only give them the ability to operate more effectively in a combat zone and a better chance of survival, but will also help them better defend the United States in our post-9/11 world. 
   I strongly support and encourage all others to support Arnold Air Force Base's pursuit of this new CBAT program. 
   As we continue to train our soldiers who are on the battlefields throughout the world, certainly in the two hot spots today, perhaps we should say three, which would also include the area around the Balkans, we need to adequately train them. It's not right; it's not American to send someone into the battlefield without being properly trained. 
   I know we have others who want to speak here tonight; but I would like, if I could, before I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas, I would like to read an editorial that I sent to one of our local papers, and it deals with PAYGO, as we will address our deficits here in Congress: 
   ``At a time when the White House is attempting to position the Republican Party as fiscally responsible, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan bluntly said in his new book `The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World' that his party over the past several years put politics over fiscal discipline and lower government spending.'' At least one honest Republican. 
   ``During the past several years while we were witnessing the largest growth of government since the 1960s and a ballooning deficit, Mr. Greenspan was correct in advocating for a return to pay-as-you-go rules. These rules, re-enacted earlier this year after they helped restore fiscal discipline in Washington during the 1990s, require Congress to offset the cost of new spending or tax cuts with savings elsewhere. 
   ``The Blue Dog Coalition, a growing band of deficit hawk Democrats with a deep commitment to the financial stability and national security of the United States, has been pushing to reimplement PAYGO for several years. Their bark was finally heard earlier this year when they pushed the new congressional leadership to enforce the policy. 
   ``When PAYGO was in place in the 1990s, spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) declined from 22.1 percent to 18.5 percent by 2001. As a result, huge budget deficits became a budget surplus. Shortly after President Bush took office, the Congress unwisely let PAYGO expire, causing an explosion in government spending and yearly budget deficits. Our national debt grew by $3 trillion over this period, and by 2005, spending had clawed its way back to 20.1 percent of GDP.'' 
   Let's think about that a moment: $3 trillion increase since this President has been in office. What does that mean? 
   We roughly spend $450 billion a year today on interest alone. That's $1.2 billion a day. But let's just take the last 5 years since 2001, or 6 years since 2001, and look at how that $3 trillion is impacting our budget. 
   For instance, today, if we had continued down the path and just had a balanced budget, not necessarily a surplus but just a balanced budget, we wouldn't be spending $150 billion-plus extra in interest. Think of what that would do. We are spending today over 125, $130 billion in Iraq, supposedly, in Iraq, probably more than that. But, in essence, what we have done in the last 6 1/2 years, or last 6 years and 9 months of this administration, under control of the Republican White House and under the control of the Republican leadership on the other side of the aisle, we have increased just our portion of the interest, not retiring the debt, by over $150 billion a year. That in itself, that figure itself, alone, is over six times what the entire budget of the State of Tennessee is in one year. 
   So I think it's time that we again reclaim for this Nation fiscal responsibility and continue to be the strong defense hawks that our caucus, our Blue Dogs, has been.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. My friend from Arkansas, in the presentation earlier I had intended to discuss the 12 individuals that lived in counties that I represent before they lost their lives in Iraq. Four of those actually were not in my district, but there are 12 individuals that either live in the county I represent or in the district I represent. 
   I made a commitment some time ago that each day that when I said my prayers for those in special prayer need, that these families would always be a part of my prayer list. And I keep a list of those in my wallet, of those individuals. I hope I don't have to add a new name. Occasionally I'll have to take this out and redo it and add a name to it. I hope I don't have to add another name until we're able to settle and resolve and bring our soldiers home from Iraq and from Afghanistan. 
   These individuals have honored us and our Nation, 
   and I think that we, as Americans, need to be sure that we honor their name and their families, and that we keep them in our hearts and constantly in our minds so that we don't ever forget the commitment that they gave, and they gave all for this Nation.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. How can anyone in this Chamber or any American let politics, partisan politics, have a play in the decisionmaking as we talk about our young men and women who are willing to give their life and those who've given their lives on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan? 
   I think that it's time. I travel my district and I tell folks that bipartisanship seems to have escaped us here in Washington. I talked to some of the folks who were here years ago and people who visited Washington saying that Democrats and Republicans would get together after a debate, whether they disagreed on certain issues, but that they would get together after that debate and spend time in the evening as friends or families would spend time together. That needs, we need to recapture that here in the U.S. House. 
   I read a book recently, or a quote in a book recently that was made by that great fellow from Britain, Mr. Churchill. He'd been speaking at Fulton, Missouri in 1951, where he gave his Iron Curtain Speech. And he and two or three other individuals were still on the train and still awake. Mr. Truman, the President, and a bunch of his cabinet and staff had retired for the evening. And they were talking about how the circumstances of our life and circumstances of our birth influenced our success or failures in the world that we lived in. And what Churchill said is that: If I were to be born again, I'd want to be born in America. We need to change America to where people like Churchill and others will be saying again: I'd like to be an American if I was born someplace today. 
   I don't think that's happening today in the world. We've got to change that, and I think the partisan rancor that we have here on the floor is prohibiting us from projecting to the rest of the world and to the American citizens the best of America. And I hope that this compact will help lead us all into being less partisan and more bipartisan on this floor and in America.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. If the gentleman would yield, what that means is we're asking the Iraqis to occupy their own nation instead of our American soldiers. That, in fact, is what we're asking. We're asking the Iraqis to be their own policemen instead of the policemen on the beat being the American soldier. I think that should be expected by everyone, regardless of politics.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. In essence what that component says is that in a bipartisan way we want to be sure that the Iraqis have a surge in leadership for their own country, take over the control of their own country; that the Iraqis develop the military that they need to occupy their own country themselves. And, secondly, that they become the policemen in the field, on the roads, riding the Humvees, and not our soldiers. I thank my friend from Arkansas for each week that you bring to the American public the views, the ideas of the fiscal conservative Blue Dog Democrats, deficit hawks and defense hawks here on the House floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure today to come on the floor and talk about ways that this Congress and those of us who serve here can help those who are unfortunate to have lost a job. 
   I have watched the opposition on the other side attempt for the last couple of years to make illegal immigration their issue. I have watched with dismay as they continue to bring to this floor and blame Democrats in this Congress for the cost of gasoline at $4 a  gallon. Back home we have a saying: that dog ain't gonna hunt in this Congress. 
   In fact, when you look at what they attempted to do on immigration, their Presidential candidate introduced an amnesty bill, and now their attempts on the floor are to block this Congress from even introducing legislation or passing legislation that would have been an energy package that would even attempt, that would attempt, to tell oil companies you have to pay your fair share of taxes. 
   So what they're now trying to do is block legislation that gives amnesty to big oil companies. Again, that's not going to work. 
   And now they come to the floor saying pay-as-you-go principles are not being followed with this bill that's been introduced, and I hope it passes today. 
   So as we look at this legislation, let's talk about pay-as-you-go. I used to be an employer. Today in Tennessee, if you employ someone, you pay between .15 percent, less than 1 percent, up to 10 percent as an employer of what each employee earns. They're paying as they go. At Forbus General Store, my friend Joe pays every paycheck every week so much percentage of what his employees earned into a Federal trust fund. He's paying as he goes. And when someone has to be laid off because jobs are not available, the economy turned sour, those individuals apply for and receive unemployment benefits. 
   We're paying as we go constantly. We have close to $40 billion in the trust fund. Currently, this bill today scored with the CBO saves roughly $10 billion cost over 10 years. This Congress has attempted to address the issues of oil prices and unemployment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I thank the gentleman from Memphis, and deeply appreciate your management today of this resolution that we are discussing here on the U.S. House floor. 
   The tornados and storms and winds that recently tore across the South wrought upon each of our States the tragedy of loss of lives and families being separated. By now all of us have seen the images of fallen trees and toppled homes and, one by one, Tennesseans and other Southerners affected by this disaster have begun the seemingly impossible task of piecing their lives together, clearing wreckage, mourning the lost, and recovering whatever the storm failed to claim. 
   Our planet, for all its blessings, chooses indiscriminately at times to affront our shores, plains, valleys and farmlands with terrible acts. I'm proud to say, though, as we face the worst of the forces we cannot control, we continue to see the best of the humanitarian spirit that is very much within our power to command. 
   In this time of need, volunteer associations from the United Way to the Red Cross helped bring aid and comfort to the affected. Within days of the tornados' passing, the Red Cross alone helped provide shelter, comfort and over 44,000 meals with the help of nearly 1,600 Red Cross staff and volunteers in Tennessee alone. 
   Our local sheriff's departments and volunteer fire departments, neighbors, friends, those from the farm next door or the neighbor next door that may not have lost their home gathered together to offer a shoulder of condolence, hope for the future, and concern and compassion for those affected.     
   It was not long ago that the people of New Orleans endured the worst of what can happen when we fail to act. And in the wake of the storms in Tennessee and the South, we have shown that we will never commit the sin of inaction again. This week and last, we have shown there is no tornado so powerful, no storm so terrible that the winds of compassion cannot restore and repair any damage brought upon us. 
   We rise today to honor the losses of those affected, to grieve for those who were so callously and abruptly taken from us that night, and we placed a renewal of our great country and our States in the wake of this storm.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, it is good to be here to discuss what I believe is the foundation of our society and America, our Constitution. 
   In 1787, the articles were proposed that ultimately became the foundation for our Constitution. In 1789, 12 amendments were offered, of which only 10 were approved immediately, or pretty well immediately, by 1791. 
   Included in those are 10 amendments we often called the Bill of Rights. The first one, a lot of us talk about, our ability to have religious freedom. In the South, where I am from, that is something that we treasure. Our freedom of speech is included in number one. And number two is the right to bear arms. 
   Now, I know we don't live on the frontier anymore, but if you can imagine a farmer or someone moving his family into the wilderness in Tennessee, or as we moved westward, one of the things that you would find with them, pieces of equipment, more than just the farm equipment, was generally a muzzleloader, that would hang on many cases on the beam that supported the loft in the cabin in which the family would live. It was there for protection. 
   When he would go into the fields to farm, he would also take his muzzleloader with him, oftentimes leaning it upon a stump or a tree, where it would be for protection from wildlife or wild animals or from those who might be intending to do harm to his family or himself. 
   The second amendment gives us that right to protect our homes and our family, whether it is in Pall Mall, Tennessee, where I am from, are whether it is right here in Washington, D.C. We can't suspend the Constitution depending on where we live. 
   We had a huge argument over what is called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, about whether or not our individual rights were about to be jeopardized. In fact, many of us argued on this floor that there are certain constitutional guarantees that guarantee our liberty and our freedom from oppression and from an oppressive and intrusive government. In fact, that is not just for Washington, D.C., and it was just not for Pall Mall, Tennessee. It is for all of us who live in this Nation. So, for me, we cannot cherry pick and pick and choose what that Constitution guarantees us. 
   To me, I applaud the efforts of the gentleman from Mississippi to offer the substitute amendment that I believe will give individuals who live in Washington, D.C. the same opportunity to defend their sons and their daughters, their husband or their wife, and the home that they own from those who would do harm or be intrusive in their homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of this bill and the effort by this Congress to bring accountability to the war in Iraq. 
   This war is in desperate need of a new direction. For nearly 5 years, our brave men and women have valiantly toed the line for this administration, and I'm proud to say that they have had great successes in their mission. We have seen a terrible dictator overthrown, tried and put to death, and in his place the people of Iraq carried out free and open elections. For all of this, we owe our soldiers and their families a debt of thanks. 
   But today's debate is not about the purpose of this war. We are here to make a decision on how best to bring accountability to this engagement. Today's legislation will keep soldiers on the ground to oversee diplomatic missions, protect U.S. citizens, equip and train Iraqis to stand on their own and continue to engage in targeted attacks on terrorists as we seek them out. This is a responsible strategy that worked for Eisenhower in South Korea when troops remained to oversee the DMZ after major operations had ended, and it can work for America today in Iraq. 
   However, I have long felt that it is time to remove our men and women from the kill zones of Iraq. Our soldiers are trained to do the job of the United States military, not the job of police-on-the-beat for the nation of Iraq. We need to redeploy our troops so they can continue to carry out the work of defending America from terrorist threats around the globe. It is time for the Iraqis to occupy their own country with their own military and police force. 
   This bill begins the redeployment of our combat troops, while continuing to fund initiatives for our men and women that protect them from IEDs, traumatic brain injury and more. But the days of a blank check from this Congress must come to an end. The American people deserve a new direction in Iraq, and this legislation is an important step. 
   I would like to add that I bristle when I hear the other side talk of ``cut and run'' Democrats. The legacy of the Democratic Party is one of great wartime leaders. Andrew Jackson may have done the cutting at the Battle of New Orleans, but it was Colonel Packingham who did the running. It was President Wilson who convinced the American people to take on the oppressors in the First World War. It was President Roosevelt who said ``we have nothing to fear but fear itself'' before leading the charge into the battlefields of Asia and Nazi Germany. And it was President Truman who ended that war by dropping a nuclear weapon. 
   I am a member of a Democratic Party that has never cut and run, but has been responsible with our men and women in regard to their safety and families, as well as our national security. We need a change in Iraq and a change in course. This must happen.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (THE BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. When we talk about different coalitions, obviously there are many in this particular Congress, probably some several hundred different caucuses that deal with health care, deal with many different issues. But the one caucus in this House that deals with fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense basically is the Blue Dog Coalition. And when the Blue Dogs were established, here is basically what they said: 
   We are dedicated to the financial stability and national security of the country, notwithstanding partisan political positions and personal fortunes and do hereby agree to organize a Coalition to serve the interests of our country; 
   That government has an important and constructive role to play in defining an equal opportunity society built upon principles of individual rights and freedom and dedicated to creating conditions that serve the general welfare and prosperity of the people; 
   That the people have entrusted the representatives of our country to transcend politics, personal careers and fortunes in order to pursue the common good; 
   That a government too large and intrusive stands in the way of an opportunity society; 
   That government must live within its allotted resources; 
   That the burden of the American taxpayer should be reduced whenever possible; 
   That government agencies are created to serve rather than to restrict, regulate, and punish the American people; 
   That government should encourage work over idleness, personal independence over government dependence, and a free market which is not controlled, dominated, and excessively regulated by the government;     
   That the American Tax Code should be simply structured and designed to create incentives for income earning, saving, and investments in jobs and in expanding opportunities; 
   That personal responsibility is essential to the preservation of freedom and that government must strictly hold accountable those who are victims of criminal and irresponsible behavior; 
   That government should be a force that affirms traditional American values and stands against the forces that threaten them; 
   That government should always be aware that it is a creature of the American public, that it answers to the public for its failures and successes and should never be so arrogant as to use its powers to diminish personal rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution. 
   Sounds pretty ambitious, doesn't it? But in fact we hear those who serve in  this House Chamber. We hear those of different party persuasions talk about these particular ideas and how they have enacted those. 
   Let's talk about fiscal responsibility. I went back and did a little research. In the early 1990s, government was taking about 22.1 percent of gross domestic product in 1992 of the American worker's paycheck, of business paycheck. That is 22 percent-plus. For the next 8 years under the Clinton administration, we saw government reduce itself, or be reduced not by itself, let me correct that quickly. I have never seen government reduce itself, but we saw those in government, Democrats and Republicans, working together to reduce the spending in government to 18.5 percent of gross domestic product as of the 2001 budget area, in that 8-year period of time. 
   It has now climbed back up to where it is 20.8 percent, and that is gross domestic product. There has been more increase in spending in the last 6 years in the budgets of the United States than in any time in history other than the Great Society years of the Johnson administration. 
   The principles I just read are ashamed of that, and those of us who serve here who are Blue Dogs are ashamed to say that the code that we have established for those of us who serve as Members of Congress of the Blue Dog Coalition are ashamed of what has happened in the last 5 to 6 years. Deficits have skyrocketed. We have gone from $5.8 trillion in national debt to where it is a little over $8 trillion of national debt. 
   A lot of that has been because the 12 principles that we have and hopefully will be putting in place in this U.S. Congress in the next 2 years, had they been implemented and been in place, we would not have seen this outlandish spending, nor would we have seen the American taxpayer be obligated to the debt they have. 
   My chief of staff just had a newborn baby who he says cries a lot. I said, Beecher, have you explained to him, little Willis, that he just inherited $29,035? That debt is going to be his to pay.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I thank the gentlelady from California. 
   All of us, I'm sure, have had an opportunity--at least most--to visit the war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. And being there, we have observed the greatness of the volunteers who volunteer their service for this great country and to help preserve, defend, and to bring about liberty and freedom to others in different parts of the world today, mainly in those two war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the third one in the area of the Balkans. 
   But as they serve, some give the ultimate sacrifice. And for all of those who serve and who have served, and for those who have given the ultimate sacrifice, we can never really do enough as a Nation to thank them for their service and, ultimately, leaving their families with the loss of their lives. 
   In 1775, a shot heard around the world brought American men and women into battle at the Siege of Boston that lasted through the spring of 1776, which eventually brought us into war for our independence. After several years and the loss of many lives, we obtained our independence. Since that time, our young men and women have been willing to volunteer to go into the battlefields to preserve the freedom that our first military men and women fought to give us, and we've been willing to preserve that and we should continue as a Nation. 
   But I think when we look at those who give the ultimate sacrifice, sometimes we give the medals and we show sympathy and appreciation to the families, and then after a while, we forget that. I know in every courthouse and every city hall there are monuments that have the names of those who have given their lives for this country and paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
   On Memorial Day we visit and Veterans Day we visit, perhaps some special days like 9/11 we again remember and we visit those who have their names engraved on the markings and on the monuments in our courthouses and city halls throughout this country.     
   But I believe that just those two or three special occasions are not enough. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I didn't realize how little we were showing appreciation for those who gave the ultimate sacrifice until my very first visit in early 2004 to Iraq. We had just traveled from one part of Iraq, flying back into Baghdad in a C-130. And before we boarded the plane, there was an escort detail. And we noticed that there was a casket, a flag-draped casket. A very solemn occasion as you looked at the lines of the young men and women who were saying farewell to the one who had given his life. And they placed that in that cargo bay off the C-130. Those of us who were Members of Congress sat more to the front--those who have traveled obviously know that we ride the jump seats as we go in and out into Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   And for some reason, when I looked in the faces of those young men who were the escorts, the solemn faces, the faces who weren't looking to anyone, I don't think, for sympathy, but just understanding, for me, on that occasion, I said, I don't think we do enough. And in 2004, I introduced this bill, the same one that's here today, to where we can at least once a month--12 times a year, plus the other occasions--say thank you to the mothers and fathers, to the brothers and sisters of the one who gave his life, and to the one who gave his life, that America still cherishes, respects, loves and remembers the sacrifice that you gave to this Nation. 
   So for me, it is my hope that this bill passes unanimously, and that we honor those who have given their life for this great Nation of ours.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our military men and women. I will strongly support our soldiers serving in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. I support all off our veterans, men and women who have served our country with great honor and distinction, and because of my support for our military men and women, I also rise in support of this resolution. 
   I support this resolution because I see no evidence that an increase in troops will lead to anything other than more lost American lives. I do not think a troop surge will bring stability to Baghdad. I do not think the surge will enable the Iraqis to stand up and defend themselves, and I do not think the surge will end the religious and ethnic strife that has existed in the Middle East for centuries. 
   So here we are this week debating the President's proposal to send more troops into Baghdad. And as expected, the rhetoric from our friends on the right has at times been shameful. To suggest that Democrats and Republicans who support this embolden the enemy, that they are defeatist, and that we do not support the troops, and that we want to micromanage the war, and that we do not want to preserve freedom and liberty in our great country puzzles me. 
   It seems to me our friends on the right do not like discourse, they don't like questions, and they do not like meaningful discussions. They do not want us to question the President's strategy, instead they want us to follow him like sheep down a tragic street that dead-ends in failure. 
   Attempts to use fear and insults to quiet the administration's critics are distasteful and quite frankly hurt America. Why do those who oppose this resolution want to discourage the type of action that led to the founding of our Nation? The very actions that allowed the United States to continue evolving towards that never ending goal of a more perfect union. 
   Our country derives its strengths from the diversity of views and ideas that comes from its people. If we disagree with the President's proposal, it is our duty, particularly as Members of Congress, to say so. I maintain that is the highest of patriotism, and I am not the only one who thinks so. 
   The President Theodore Roosevelt said, referring to the Presidency, and I quote him, ``That there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and that this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in any American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President or that to stand with the President right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile, but it is morally treasonable to the American public.'' 
   I do not know about the majority of Republicans in Congress, but I agree with Teddy. Our actions this week do not dishearten the troops, nor reflect a lack of support for our troops. Defense Secretary Gates and General Pace both testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a resolution disagreeing with the President's proposal would not dishearten the troops. 
   In my opinion, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may have a little better idea of troop morale than Members of Congress. I strongly disagree with the notion that our actions this week embolden the enemy. If our lack of support for the President's plan emboldens the enemy, then public opinion polls also embolden the enemy, since polls show the majority of Americans disagree with the administration's policy in Iraq. And if this is the case, why do not we see condemnation of the American people for their views? It is because politically those who oppose this resolution know they cannot criticize the American public, but can criticize those of us who serve here in Congress. 
   If the actions of the House and American people embolden the enemy, then we need to consider everyone's comments. Iraq's prime minister al-Maliki recently said that the Bush administration's description of the Iraqi government's being on borrowed time, listen, gives a morale boost to the terrorists. The prime minister of Iraq is accusing the administration of doing the same thing that many of us are being accused of doing in this House chamber. How shameful. Let's get real. 
   I contend that the American people, the Democrats, the Republicans, and that President Bush loves America. The discussion we are having in Congress this week is an extension of the cure for America, because we all want what we think is best for our country. And what do we want? Success. We want security. 
   In order for us to have success and security we must force the Iraqi people to fight for their own country. In my opinion, the way we do this is not by adding more troops to the kill zone in Baghdad, but rather take our troops out of the kill zone and force the Iraqis to step up their efforts. 
   We should put our troops in a position to support the Iraqis when they need us. This way the pressure is on the Iraqis, not on our fighting men and women. The idea that we are going to cut and run from the Middle East and allow terrorists to control Iraq is false and has no basis in reality or in history. 
   We did not leave Germany after World War II, we did not leave Korea after that war, and we will not leave the Middle East after our soldiers' responsibilities in Iraq have ended. We did not leave the Middle East after the Persian Gulf War and we will not leave the Middle East now. 
   Mr. Speaker, the French did not win the Revolutionary War for us and we cannot win this peace for the Iraqis; they have to win it for themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I say thanks to my good friend from Ohio (Mr. Space) and others on the other side of the aisle who have taken it upon themselves to be sure that the ARC, the Appalachian Regional Commission, continues to exist. 
   Appalachia has long been plagued by lack of job opportunities and high unemployment, resulting in low per capita income, educational deficiencies, and a dilapidated infrastructure. 
   The Conference of Appalachian Governors was formed in 1960 to develop a regional approach to resolving these problems. In 1961 they brought their cause to President John F. Kennedy, known to have been moved by the poverty he saw during his campaign trips to West Virginia. At the time, one of every three Appalachians lived in poverty. Per capita income was 23 percent lower than the U.S. average. High unemployment and harsh living conditions had, in the 1950s, forced more than 2 million Appalachians to leave their homes and seek work in other regions of the Nation. By 1963, Kennedy had formed the President's Appalachian Regional Commission and directed it to create a comprehensive program for economic development of the Appalachian region. The resulting report was endorsed by the Conference of Appalachian Governors and President John Kennedy's cabinet. Soon after, Lyndon B. Johnson used the report to create legislation which ultimately created the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1965. 
   The ARC has long worked to address the long-term economic distress and isolation of the Appalachian region, and to press for greater Federal involvement in addressing the region's common problems. The ARC funds several hundreds projects annually affecting one of our Nation's most underserved populations. The ARC has played a leading role in granting consistently impoverished communities with improving water and sewer systems, sometimes providing running water for the first time, improving educational resources and teacher training in schools, access to health care, access to telecommunications and the Internet, and providing technical assistance for new business initiatives. They provide State and local agencies such as economic development agencies and human resource agencies in my 10,000-square mile congressional district, as well as nonprofit organizations. These projects have resulted in thousands of jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is just the tip of the iceberg of ARC's good works. It is necessary and appropriate to reauthorize this valuable asset for rural America. It is my hope this Congress does. And on a note from those that I represent, without that funding from ARC and many of the Federal agencies, people who are my neighbors would not be able to have a water line that has usable water, safe water, a sewer system, nor would they have in many cases first responder buildings, as well as equipment that is much needed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I thank my friend from Arkansas (Mr. Ross). 
   I have had an opportunity to get to meet a lot of folks that I have served with here in the U.S. House. All of those obviously within the Blue Dog Coalition have become pretty endeared to me because of the commitments we focus on as being deficit hawks and defense hawks. We talk about those issues conservatively. I am going to talk a little bit about each of those issues tonight. 
   I had a privilege recently to spend considerable time with my good friend John Salazar from Colorado. I have become convinced he knows how to hook up a piece of equipment. 
   I am also convinced in the conversations with him that he and his family have shared in the good Lord's Earth in being farmers with his brothers; and in talking with him, I had a much deeper understanding and certainly a much deeper abiding friendship knowing that as my brother and I both farm, brother doing most of it back home, that all of us come from different parts of the country maybe, but we all have that same spirit and that same heartfelt belief that America is the greatest place in the world to live and raise your family. For those of us who live in rural areas, obviously we believe that is probably the best place for America to raise their families. 
   I traveled today with a group of young students from both Clark Grange and York Institute, being named after Alvin C. York, Sergeant York, from the hometown of Pall Mall where I live, and as we traveled through the Capitol I could see their eyes light up as we talked about the history of this great building that we serve in, the great Chamber that we are in here this afternoon. 
   But as you look on the wall in the rotunda, you realize that America in the 1770s, in 1775, at the Boston siege, we convinced with our ragtag Army, the Continental Army, convinced the British soldiers and sailors that we could defeat them, and they set sail late in the winter, early spring and went to New York. We followed them there, and by 1776 we suffered a pretty strong defeat. 
   The first victory that we received for our independence, for our democracy that we have was in Saratoga in the fall of 1777, which convinced another nation called France to come and join us in our fight for independence, but I can assure you, no one won our independence for us. In this country, we fought until basically the battle at Yorktown where Cornwallis, general of the British forces, decided that he had to surrender, and surrendered. 
   That basically ended the hostilities until Washington in 1783 resigned his commission to the Continental Congress that existed at that time. So from 1775 basically until hostilities pretty much ceased in 1781, we fought for our independence in this country. We fought so we could establish a democracy that would be a shining example, as Mr. Reagan used to say, on that hill to the rest of the nations of the world that this is what can be accomplished. 
   That took us 6 years, and 2 years into being sure to sort of protect that fragile peace that we had until Washington gave up his commission and surrendered it in 1783. 
   I want to remind the people of America and the people of Iraq, we fought for our independence. We fought for this democracy that we have. No one came to this country and forced upon us a democracy. No one came to this country and said this is the gift we want to give you. 
   The blood and the tears and the hard work and the sweat of our young men and women from this country have been in Iraq now for over 4 years, toiling, and in fact, in many cases going to war with the Iraqis, first of all, to depose a ruthless dictator, we all agree with that, and then we fought with the Iraqis and in many cases against the Iraqis, whether they be Sunni or Shia, to say we want to give you this gift that we fought for over 200 years ago, we want to give you this gift called democracy. 
   In 2005, in December, we literally sent a surge of our troops over in the midsummer of 2005 to be sure that those brave individuals from Iraq, men and women, over 12 million of them, went to vote to establish the leaders of their country so they could establish their own Constitution. The surge then allowed them to vote. They finalized their commitment, in my opinion, for the democracy. 
   No one gave us ours. We are trying to give them theirs. And we have tried and we have tried and we have tried and we have spent billions of dollars making it happen.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. You have to invite me to come out to your home sometime. I invite you to my home in Pall Mall, but I have got to visit more with your family. As I learn more and more, I realize the quality of people that we have here serving. It was such a wonderful yield, the comments you made during that period of time. It is certainly good to be on the floor with you. 
   But as I talk about that democracy that we fought for, that we fought for, I realize that there has never been a time that a democracy in any country has ever been imposed from without. It has always been from within, the French Revolution, the startings of the Magna Carta where we said we are no longer going to give taxes if you are basically going to squander it on your parties, Mr. King. 
   When Israel established a nation in the Middle East, what type was it? It was a democracy. 
   My fear is that we can keep our soldiers, our young men and women in the battlefields in Iraq for a long, long time, and we can never force a democracy on the people of Iraq or anywhere else. We went into Iraq, and Iraq especially, without realizing the national customs, the traditions, the faith, their family values that are totally different in many cases than ours. 
   I think everyone loves liberty and freedom. I just believe as we engage that we ought to realize that we cannot impose our will on anyone unless we do it with a much larger force than what we have today. 
   Let me stay on Iraq for a moment.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I hear the other side, the minority party in this Chamber, talk about the defeatist Democrats, the retreatist Democrats, whatever terminology they want to use. I find that somewhat repulsive that there are those who would assume that Democrats want to lose a war. 
   Let me tell you something. I come from Tennessee. Andrew Jackson in the war of 1812 and 1814, when he had that battle, the war was over with. There had already been a surrender of the British. He still fought that war, and I believe he was a good Democrat. In World War I, a fellow named Woodrow Wilson, I happen to believe he was a Democrat, he fought the war until it was over with. We won that war. 
   In World War II, we went to war and took 16 million people. We call them the Greatest Generation. They came back home, and they started having children like rabbits in the spring. That is 77 million folks we call baby boomers. They give us a huge workforce in this country. 
   Then we went to Korea, and let me finish, in World War II, we lost Roosevelt during that time. Harry Truman had the forces. We had invaded Normandy and had conquered the Germans and had conquered Europe. We had already put in place the invasion Army that was going into Japan. Harry Truman changed course. You need to replay that message to the White House, Harry Truman changed course. He didn't put the invasion force in the ships. He dropped a couple of bombs, a horrible occurrence that happened, but it saved millions of lives and stopped the war. Then we occupied Germany and Japan, and they now have two thriving democracies in the world because they chose that type of government.  
   Then in Korea we had a fellow named Truman who got us engaged there as well, happened to be a Democrat. But the person who quit fighting was Eisenhower, a Republican. 
   In the 1970s, in Vietnam, the President at that time was a Republican named Richard Nixon, when we left Vietnam. We can talk about Democrats not following through. We have never lost a war when we have had Democrats in the White House. Andrew Jackson, when he was in New Orleans, a general, we couldn't keep him from fighting and conquering General Packingham. 
   I am tired about this talk of the Democratic Party not being strong on national defense. Baloney. That is not the case. Let's stop it. Let's start talking about how we win, and how we stay in Iraq, and that becomes winning for us. 
   This resolution that we vote on tomorrow still allows several thousand people to stay in Iraq after we have taken our soldiers out of the kill zone and the battle zones in Iraq. 
   We still will be there with several tens of thousands of troops that will be training, providing security, and protection, quite frankly, for many of the folks in Iraq. We will also keep tens of thousands of troops there that will seek out and search the al Qaeda cells if they exist in Iraq, or any terrorist groups that exist in Iraq. 
   So I get kind of unhappy when I hear the other side start talking about what great success we are having. It is my hope that this search would work, because then we in America can claim a huge successful victory in Iraq.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. As we move now, I want to move briefly to the accusing tone we often hear that Democrats are big government. When Bill Clinton became President in 1992, and was sworn in 1993, the government had grown to 22.4 percent of gross domestic income. 
   When he became the President, working with the Republican Congress in 1995, we saw a government decrease of 18.1 percent of gross domestic income. We saw over a 4 percent decrease in spending during the 8 years that a Democratic President was in office. It had grown to a little more than 22 percent under Reagan and Bush and had receded to 18.1 percent under Bill Clinton. 
   It has now grown over the last 5 years, 6 years, to over 21 percent. How can anyone in this Chamber talk about being conservatives or blaming anyone for growth? The growth periods actually have occurred under Reagan, Bush, decreased under Clinton, and increased under this Bush administration. 
   How do you call that being conservative? I just think that it is time that the American people realized that they are being told a lot of things on this floor that aren't true. 
   I used to see a truth squad. I really wish they were telling the truth on a lot of issues that they were talking about. 
   I thank you for allowing me to come visit with you tonight.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, we often hear from our friends on the right that when the Democrats question the war or the strategy in Iraq, we are disheartening our troops and emboldening the enemy. I guess it doesn't matter that there are many Republicans who also ask the same questions about the war. This attempt by the right to use fear and shame to quiet the administration's critics is distasteful and, I believe, hurts America. 
   Those on the right who take the argument further, suggesting that folks who don't agree with the administration's policies and don't keep their views to themselves are being un-American, really saddens me. It saddens me because it seems like those on the right are trying to discourage the very actions that led to the founding of our Nation, the very actions that allowed the United States to continue evolving toward the never-ending goal of a more perfect Union. 
   Our country derives its strength from the diversity of views and ideas that come from its people. If one idea isn't working, then someone has the freedom to suggest another idea that is different and might yield different results. In my opinion, the ability of the American people to discuss differing ideas gives our Nation great strength. 
   Additionally, I believe that when Iraqi people see Americans exercising their right to freedom of speech, the Iraqi people are not disenchanted by their prospects, but rather they are inspired to have a country as free as ours. They see our freedom as a beacon of hope for what their nation could become some day. 
   Frankly, it is the freedom we enjoy here that scares the enemy over there so much, because they know that once the people taste freedom, they will demand it for eternity for themselves. So we should not stifle our freedom here for fear that it may be negatively impacting the war over there, which I seriously doubt it is. 
   Furthermore, if the actions of Senators of both parties and House Members of both parties embolden the enemy, then doesn't public opinion also embolden the enemy? Since polls show a large majority of Americans disagreeing with the administration's policy in Iraq, not the war, the administration's policy in Iraq, if this is the case, then why don't we see those on the right condemning the American people for expressing their views and emboldening the enemy? It is because probably politically they know they can't criticize the American public. It is because it is easier to take pot shots at politicians than at everyday men and women in American society. 
   Additionally, if the actions of the Senate and the House and American public embolden the enemy, then I think we need to take a look at the administration. I quote: ``Such statements give a morale boost to the terrorists,'' Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, on remarks of the Bush administration describing the Iraqi Government as being on ``borrowed time.'' In essence, the Prime Minister of Iraq is accusing our President of emboldening the enemy by making such a statement. 
   I contend that the American people love America, that Democrats love America, that Republicans love America and that President Bush loves America. I contend that we all love America, and that the discussion everyone is having on Iraq right now is not an extension of their love for America, because we all want what we think is best for the country. We want success and we want security. If only we also wanted civility in Washington. 
   I know that once folks cross into the District of Columbia or read about something in Washington, it seems there is something triggered in their brains and our rhetoric is raised to a sensational point. We need to stop and ask ourselves, is this rhetoric helpful to the end goal, or just hurtful? 
   There certainly have been plenty of failures in Iraq and there is plenty of blame to spread. We should have sent in more troops, some say. We should have not disbanded the Iraqi Army. We should have kept better track of how our taxpayer dollars were being spent. We should have squashed the militias before they built a strong following, some say, and on and on.     
   I will tell you who has not failed: Our soldiers on the ground. The American soldiers won in Iraq. They defeated Saddam's Army, deposed a dictator and tore down the statue. They gave the country to the Iraqis. 
   Sadly, in my opinion and many others, the leaders in Washington have failed our soldiers because those in charge of Iraqi policy have been weak in dealing with the new Iraqi government, have not pushed them to find political solutions to the problems they face. The lack of political structure in Iraq falls squarely on the shoulders of the war planners, and I for one will not let the reputation of our fighting men and women be tarnished by the miscalculations of those in charge. 
   The question now must be, what are the next steps to bring success and security? That is our goal, is success and security. 
   The Blue Dog Coalition has drafted a resolution that can help us along our goals towards success and security. House Resolution 97 would improve our accountability in Iraq so we can make sure our taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely and going where they are needed to achieve success. 
   In my opinion, this resolution is the first step of many steps down the path to stability and success in Iraq. I, for one, stand with our military men and women, ready and able to walk down the path of success with them. 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I so often hear that cut and run is a strategy from Democrats. That is not the case. When we finished the war in 1945, military bases were established in western Europe, in Turkey and other places throughout the world. They are still there. As we finished our endeavors, as many people thought during the Korean War, our military bases are still located in South Korea. 
   We will never leave the Middle East, if the American people think that is the case. What we are talking about is being able to redeploy and do certain other endeavors that have not been done to make sure we win this war, win the peace, and have success in Iraq. We will be in the Middle East for a long, long time. My great-grandchildren will still see us be there. That is an area in which we have to defend America's freedom and liberty. 
   But we have got to take another look at having success, because what we are doing now is not having the success the American people demand, expect and we should have for them, and our troops deserve better than that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remaining portion of my time.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for the recognition. I'll be very brief, which is difficult for me to do, being from the mountains of Tennessee. Sometimes I get a little wordy. I had one of my folks back home tell me that after I'd been here for about a year, he said, LINCOLN, you've gotten so windy as those folks in Washington, I believe you could blow up an onion sack. I'm not sure exactly what he meant by that, but I had to tone down my rhetoric somewhat after that. 
   But it's good to be here to talk about accountability and, quite frankly, how the lack of accountability has gotten us in the situation we're in in Iraq, as well as in our budget management. When we take a look at how the growth of government grew through the 1980s up to the early 1990s, in 1992, we were spending roughly 22 percent of gross domestic product on national expenditures, on our budgetary process, Mr. Speaker. 
   And through the 1990s, we saw a downsizing of government through the Clinton-Gore years, where we were spending roughly 18.5 percent of gross domestic product. We now have seen that jump to the point to where it's somewhat over 20 percent in gross domestic product. We've seen government grow the last 6 years. We saw it downsized during the Clinton-Gore administration, and the 12 years prior to that we saw it grow to where it was well over 22 percent. 
   So, when we talk about accountability, let's be sure that America understands, Mr. Speaker, that it has certainly not been the Democratic Party that has made that happen. Under our management, under our watch, we saw a downsizing of government expenditures. 
   I want to move now to Iraq. I recently had an opportunity to visit the White House, Mr. Speaker, with our President, along with 12 or 13 other Members. We had a very frank conversation. In one of the conversations, the comment was made that we have a strong commitment in the Middle East, and we do have a strong commitment there. 
   We denied Hitler during World War II being able to obtain the oil in the Middle East. The tanks of Rommel ran out of fuel, and we were able, quite frankly, through the mass force we had, 16 million Americans, as well as help from Europe during World War II, the Allied Forces were able to eventually conquer Germany. 
   We then continued to be there and have a presence all through the Cold War, which also denied the Russians from being able to obtain the oil that was there. 
   There's no doubt in my mind that we're going to be in the Middle East for a long time when we leave the war zone and the hostile war zones of Iraq. 
   And as we made that conversation, Mr. Speaker, our President certainly agreed with that, that we have a long-term commitment and an interest in the Middle East for many years to come, and we will have. It's kind of like 1953, in South Korea, when Eisenhower decided a cease-fire would be in order, and we signed a cease-fire and have been maintaining troops in South Korea since 1953. We'll be in the Middle East for a long, long time. After the first Persian Gulf War, we maintained a presence there in the Middle East, and we'll still do that. It's how we stay that determines whether or not we'll win. 
   What my real concern is about this situation in Iraq is I don't think, Mr. Speaker, this administration, I don't think, Mr. Speaker, this President understands the gravity of what's going on in the Middle East. 
   Every country in the Middle East, some our friends supposedly and some might continue to be our friends, during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the Shah of Iran was also our friend. When the ayatollahs took over, we lost that friendship, and Iran no longer maintained our friendship. But in places like Saudi Arabia, in Kuwait, in the Emirates, when you look at Jordan, King Abdullah, a decree made him King, not an election. He is our friend, and I personally like King Abdullah, but he had an uncle named Prince Hassan that most folks thought would eventually go on to be King of Jordan. That didn't happen. 
   So, when we talk about having a free-standing democracy in the Middle East, in Iraq, I'm puzzled somewhat that that becomes one of the major objectives to determine whether or not we win. We need to have stability in Iraq, stability, Mr. Speaker. My hope is that eventually a democracy will occur. 
   For us to assume that the Shias, the Sunnis and the Kurds, in one of the most volatile mixed populations in any country in the Middle East, that we, you notice I say we, we're going to use that country as a model of how we democratize the Middle East, I think, is a flawed failure, will continue to be, and will be something that will be unsuccessful. 
   If, in fact, this administration, led by our President, had decided that we ought to have democracy in the Middle East, maybe he should have started with this gentleman he's holding hands with, the monarchy, the royal family of Saudi Arabia. I wonder how many times this administration, Mr. Speaker, how many times this President, Mr. Speaker, has talked to the royal family of Saudi Arabia and say, wouldn't it be nice to have in Saudi Arabia a thriving democracy, a freestanding democracy.  
   I wonder how many times, Mr. Speaker, this President, Mr. Rumsfeld and others, Mr. Speaker, asked the people of Kuwait after being liberated in 1991 that you should establish a democracy and not revert back to the royal families, to be dictatorial in the decisions that you made. 
   Every nation in the Middle East has a strongman-type government, except for Israel and except for Lebanon. Whether it's Syria, whether it's Iran, Iraq had theirs, the Emirates, Qatar, every country over there has a strongman-type government, and we believe that for us to consider having one, that we've got to democratize Iraq. I think that's a flawed policy, and, Mr. Speaker, I hope our President engages with this Congress to try to find some solutions to how we establish stability in the Middle East and certainly in Iraq. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding.

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I can assure my good friend from Georgia that I will not bore the folks for 35 minutes in this House Chamber, nor will I bore you that much, but it is certainly an honor to be with you here in this House Chamber, this historic Chamber. 
   I asked one of the freshmen Members as we traveled from the Chamber after voting recently through the tunnel going to the Cannon Building, and I said, well, your first 6 weeks, how does it feel? He said, LINCOLN, I want to be honest with you. He said, I never knew how it felt to work in a museum, but I do now. 
   Working here in this Capitol, where those statues of the tremendous leaders of the past, inside the House Chamber where many decisions have been made, where on December 8 we declared war on Japan in 1941 and then two or 3 days later, after being declared war on by the Axis Nations, Germany and Italy, and that declaration occurred here, declaration of war, really the last declaration of war that has been held inside this House Chamber and declaration of war that only Congress, quite frankly, can declare. 
   So, being here at this time of history and being on the floor with you and other members of the Blue Dogs certainly is an honor, not a privilege, but an honor that the folks back in my district have given me, and I believe that they expect us to come here and be bipartisan in our efforts, that we are not here to be demagoguing the other side or critical, but you have to try to work in a harmonious way to find solutions to whatever difficulties we have in this Nation. 
   I had a Member ask me when I first came here, LINCOLN, what did you want to change when you came up here? And I thought real hard, and it really did not take a lot of thought. My answer was I did not want to change America. No country in the world has reached the level of helping its citizens the way that this government of the United States of America has. I do not want to change it, but there are problems. We need to fix those, and we can do it by working together. 
   So, for me, my challenge to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and colleagues here on this side of the aisle, let us start being a little more civil with each other. 
   I left from this House Chamber after the debate we had on whether or not to agree with the President's plan for a surge in Iraq is something we wanted to do in this Chamber, and it got to the point where the questions of someone's patriotism became a part of that debate and dialogue. Of course, some may obviously follow suit with that, but we had a debate about whether or not we supported the troops. The resolution said we do. We had a debate about whether we agreed with the strategy, apparently the new strategy of this President to engage an additional numbers of troops in Iraq. 
   Now I want to talk a moment about that budget we looked at and at the deficit. I remember I was elected in 1980 to the State House in Tennessee. As I was travelling from my home of Byrdstown in Pall Mall to Nashville to the State capital, it came across the radio that we had just increased the national debt ceiling to a trillion dollars. That frightened me. A trillion dollars in the early 1980s. I remember that as we talked about increasing that debt ceiling by $20 billion or $15 billion how difficult it was in this House Chamber. Now we increase it by hundreds of billions of dollars without even really having an up-or-down vote on that particular debt ceiling increase. 
   I thought how ironic it was that in 1980 how difficult it was for a debt ceiling to be increased, and now it just seems to be as if a snap of the finger and all of the sudden, we reach that level. 
   Then I watched for the next 8 years, the next 12 years, as that debt not gradually, but very rapidly rose in the 3 and 4 trillions of dollars. I am thinking in a 12-year period of time, how is that possible. If we look back basically almost 200 years, we reached a trillion, and suddenly we had doubled and quadrupled what we had in that period of time. 
   Since 2001, even with the surpluses that were applied to reduce the debt that this country owed, for a period of almost 4 years, out 4 years of surplus budgets where we had more than we spent, we took in more than we spent, and started paying down the debt, I am surprised that almost $3 trillion in the last 5 years has been added to that figure down there. 
   I often hear people talk about the first thing a baby does--my chief of staff just recently had a newborn son in early December, and they nicknamed him 
   Willis, a pretty little thing, handsome little fellow. He came to one of my open meetings with him. On Saturday, we had 24 throughout the district. I represent 24 counties. The first thing little Willis did when he came to this earth, he started crying. I know now why he was crying. He realizes that this country, that these leaders in this Chamber, that this Nation has handed him a $29,000-plus debt, that he does not even have a job yet to pay off, and if we continue to go as we are going, before he gets his first job, he will owe more money than five times the first house cost me that I bought for our family in the late 1960s. 
   I want to talk now about Iraq for a moment. I hear people in this Chamber talk about cut and run being the policy of Democrats and staying the course being the policy of the White House. Both of those are wrong. I do not think standing the course is going to get it done, and cut and run is something, quite frankly, that I go back in history, and I cannot find that example, except some folks might say Vietnam. 
   But I saw Vice President Cheney in Japan early last week thanking our troops, and it dawned upon me that, let me say now we have troops in Japan after World War II. We have troops in Germany after World War II. I went back and looked at the tens of thousands of troops we have in Korea and South Korea after the Korean War; I go to Kosovo and in Bosnia and in Serbia and in the Balkans, and I realize that we have forces there from the late 1990s, although there were those in this Chamber on the other side of the aisle that called that Nation building and wanted to know when then-President Clinton was going to give us a time certain, even I think the presidential candidate at that time as well who later became the President in 2001, even he was talking about Nation building and a time certain that our troops should be pulled out.  
   As we debate this issue, it is ironic to me that anyone would accuse someone else of asking for some of the same considerations that they asked for a certainty of. But we are still in Bosnia and Kosovo and, quite frankly, this President that is here now and this Congress saw fit to stay there, that we should keep the peace with our friends of NATO. 
   But I look at other parts of the world. We are in Turkey. Our ally in NATO, the Turks, we still have bases there. But then I got to thinking, well, now, we had a war in the Middle East, a U.N.-sanctioned, totally supported, my understanding is we probably had three or four times the number of troops that went in 1991 to remove Saddam Hussein from his aggressive actions in Kuwait, and we forced him back into his country. Then we had north and south no-fly zones, had him pretty much contained. But we still have troops in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We still have troops in Kuwait. We still have troops in places like United Arab Emirates. Are we going to have troops in Iraq when this is over? This is never going to be over.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. I thank my friend from Georgia. 
   I think, what my hope is, all of us become a little bit more civil in this debate that we are having and realize that this is about America. We want security and we want peace. We want the Iraqis to win. What we have done is destroyed an Army in Iraq and I agree with that, we have destroyed an Army in Iraq that was able to defend, or at least to resist the Iranian Army with three times the population they have for a period of over 10 years. We now have to be the Army for the Iraqis. 
   It is our responsibility to defend Iraq. In essence, I think we have to put our troops along the Syrian and Iranian border to be sure that no one interferes with Iraq and let the Iraqis settle their own differences. Twelve million Iraqis voted in December of 2005. They established their government; it is there. Departments elected. It is time we let them govern themselves, but we must protect them. 
   You have been very kind to allow me to be here participating in this Blue Dog conversation. 
   Before I leave, one thing I want to say, one of the reasons we have been in the Middle East since shortly after World War II, quite frankly, we were there to keep Germany from getting all the oil that could have helped them delay the war much longer in World War II, maybe even have won some territories. Europe may have looked totally different if Hitler and his Nazis had been able to get control of the oil fields in the Middle East. We have been there and have been invited by governments in the Middle East for some time. Folks may or may not have agreed with us, but the leaders who were there invited us to help them. Quite frankly, there was fear in the Cold War that that might go to the Communist Nations of Russia and perhaps even China. So we have been there for a reason. 
   We now are there we say to protect ourselves from terrorists. My opinion is that we have to stay there to protect the Iraqis from other aggressor Nations and let them solve their problems and then we can bring our troops home. We will be there for a long time. The American public understands that. 
   Thank you for allowing me to speak.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Ross. 
   Certainly, it's always a pleasure to be here to speak when the Blue Dogs have a special session and an opportunity to come and speak before the Members of Congress, as well as the American people. There are some facts that I believe all of us need to know. I think the American people need to know this. 
   When you look at the oil reserves, the proved oil reserves, that we have in the world, America has about 3 percent. When you look at the actual production of the consumption of oil in the world, we produce about 10 percent of the world's consumption. Unfortunately, we consume almost 25 percent of all the production in the world, and in doing that, it makes us almost be a hostage to oil-producing countries. 
   Now, let's talk a little bit about how much oil that we use. We use over 7.5, almost 8 billion barrels of crude oil a year. We produce about 2.5 billion of that, and the rest we import, mainly from our hemisphere, some small amount from the Middle East, but mostly, from our hemisphere, whether it's Canada, Mexico, Venezuela. Different parts of our hemisphere comes to America. 
   Now, what does that tell me? If we have got 3 percent of the oil reserves, then we're always going to be held hostage. But where are those reserves located? 
   They tell us that we've got roughly 150 billion barrels of crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf. That's the max. Good estimates say we probably have no more than 85 billion barrels of crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf, add about 10 billion max up in ANWR or about 7.5 billion that we could actually take out of ANWR for a profitable margin for our oil companies. 
   That being the case, we have a 1-year supply in ANWR. We're hearing from folks who are making this a political issue that we just drill and drill our way out of it. 
   We import 5 billion barrels of crude oil a year, 5 billion barrels. If we, in fact, have 100 billion barrels of crude oil, which is the estimate that we would have probably in both ANWR, in the Outer Continental Shelf in Alaska, in the Outer Continental Shelf in the Pacific--about 24 billion in the Outer Continental Shelf in Alaska; 20 billion barrels in the Outer Continental Shelf in the Pacific; in the gulf about 44 billion; very little on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, about 3 to 4 billion barrels; little over 100 billion barrels total. That's a 20-year supply of what we're importing today. 
   And we will use all that up, and if we have another war, by the time we have to defend ourselves and have the abundance of oil, are we going to go to Saudi Arabia or Iraq or Iran and ask them for oil so we can fight them with it? 
   I think we have got to look at alternatives more than we have ever looked. Ten years ago, in 1998, the average price of a barrel of oil was $14 a barrel. Let me rephrase that. Just 10 years ago, $14 a barrel. Volatile conditions in the world, over-consumption, and in many cases, an unplanned energy policy that will make us totally self-sustainable has not occurred. 
   I did some research on windmills. From 1850 to 1900 over 6 million windmills were sold in this country. They ground our corn with it to make cornmeal. They ground our wheat to make flour. In some cases, they even used it  for electricity. In 1880, this country had 50 million people in it: 9.5 million families, 8.5 million households. In that 50-year period of time, 6 million windmills. They were smarter than us because we've become dependent on the combustion engine. We've become dependent on foreign sources for our crude oil. 
   It is time that we take a serious look at all the alternatives, including wind and solar, including nuclear. I'm not sure I'd like to say this. T. Boone Pickens is one of those guys, Mr. Speaker, that helped fund Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. When that guy comes to the Democrat Caucus and says you are on the right track, a staunch Republican, it tells me we are doing something right. 
   I would love to spend about 20 minutes here.

   This issue demands and requires leadership probably more than any other issue that we've addressed in this Congress, leadership on doing what's right, not fabricating an issue that we can solve it by just drilling our way out of it. It's going to take leadership to give us an energy policy that will sustain America's future.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (NATIONAL INFANTRY MUSEUM AND SOLDIER CENTER COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The oldest and largest branch of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Army infantry, was established on June 14, 1775, when the Continental Congress ordered the formation of 10 companies of riflemen. The riflemen comprised the first armed force of a new Nation, a Nation destined to become the greatest democracy the world has ever known. Since that time, the infantry has gone where other forces could not go and accomplished missions others could not attempt. 
   The story of the Queen of Battle has been written by individual infantrymen who have done their duty with pride, courage and honor. Their suffering and sacrifices won our freedom, preserved that freedom for over two centuries and will guarantee it in the future. Some were called heroes, some were not, but they were all members of a band of brothers who fought for their country in the cause of freedom. 
   For more than two centuries the United States infantry has fought alongside other armed forces to protect their freedom. Their missions have sent them around the world and literally brought them face-to-face with the enemy. 
   From the Siege of Boston of 1775 to San Juan Hill, to the Battle of New Orleans, to the Argonne Forest, where Sergeant York distinguished himself, to the beaches of Normandy, they hunted the enemy in the Shau Valley, parachuted into Panama, and currently subdue our enemies on cold mountainside and hot desert sands in both Iraq and Afghanistan. When policymakers finished talking, when debate has ceased, when negotiations have failed and orders are given, it becomes the mission of the United States infantry to execute our national policy. 
   Their courage, pride and sense of beauty to country and each other stood tall above any fear they faced. But the battle for our freedom has been costly. As many as 80 percent of all the servicemen and women who have died serving their country were part of the infantry. 
   To honor the infantry's decorated history, the National Infantry Foundation, in coordination with the United States Army, have broken ground on a new world-class museum honoring them. Located on a 200-acre site of Fort Benning, Georgia, the National Infantry Museum will serve as a tribute to the infantry's legacy of valor and sacrifice. This museum will honor these soldiers for their selfless service to our country, while also preserving for all time the artifacts so poignantly telling their stories. 
   It will tell the story of our ground soldiers, from the colonial period to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Lessons of the past will be retold to help lead us in the future. 
   Our children must learn and know that there are values and beliefs worth living for and worth dying for, that the freedom and liberty we enjoy today has come at a high price, and that the American values of patriotism, duty, courage and leadership are the hallmarks of the infantry and must be preserved. 
   With 290 cosponsors, this bipartisan legislation honors the legacy of the United States infantry with the minting of the infantry coin. Money raised from the sale of the coins will go towards maintaining the National Infantry Museum. 
   I applaud the efforts of the National Infantry Foundation, its rich history deserves to be kept alive for all who follow. These heroes are perhaps too humble to tell their own story, so we will have to do it for them. 
   I thank the gentleman from Georgia for authoring this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Chairman, I have listened to the debate on the floor, and I am somewhat puzzled. I have listened to the Republicans accuse Democrats of increasing gasoline prices. It reminds me of the fellow who said it would be like Roho the Rooster going to dinner with Colonel Sanders to imply that we are the ones that have caused this situation to occur this way. 
   I am looking at places like Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in the Middle East, who are being protected by our young men and women, our brave men and women in the Middle East, in the Middle Eastern war that we have with Iraq. And I watched them build these huge mansions and ski slopes, going out in the ocean and building whatever you would like to have, I guess. Are they selling sand? 
   I wonder if our President when he went over there realized that the most folks he was going to be protecting were the oil tycoons who are over there in the Middle East. 
   I wonder why Saudi Arabia is not spending more money to held rebuild Iraq. I wonder why United Arab Emirates and Dubai are building these palatial estates for their folks to have ski slopes in the desert. I wonder why they aren't helping Iraq rebuild. We are there protecting them. 
   And why isn't Kuwait, who is producing all of the oil, is not helping America, at least helping to defuse the situation in the Middle East? 
   Why is this President not calling on Saudi Arabia to increase their production so at least we can put maybe a glut of oil on the market that will be threatening and intimidating to the stock markets that choose to drive the price of oil the way that it is. There is no reason it should be inflated the way it is. 
   Why is this administration not doing something about this? Don't blame Democrats who came on this floor 16 months ago. How in the world can you in all honesty try to imply that it is the Democrats' fault that we are paying $3-plus a gallon for gas today. Look at the circumstances and the situations. Have the Democrats, who in the last few months have tried to say let's find some way to resolve the issue in Iraq, are we the ones who said we ought to stay forever over there, and to disrupt the oil markets, to make people throughout the world, including those in places like India and in China, who are using an increased amount of oil that we can't control in this country, but we can at least control our foreign policy that we have established. 
   So let's think about what we are being told here. The poorest countries in the world are paying $100-some for oil, just like we are in this country, considered to be one of the richest nations of the world. 
   India and China are paying the same price that we are paying in this country. I guess the Democrats forced the price up also in China and India. Maybe I'm missing something, but let's be honest in this debate and let's be honest with the American public and let's stop blaming folks for what is happening. 
   The turmoil and instability in the Middle East has brought about most of the situation that we have, and the economic growth, that may recede dramatically, may also drop it down. That might please you if that happens. 
   But I can tell you this much, the folks that I represent in my district came to the open meetings, and their concern was gasoline prices just like you're saying about your district.  
   They are also worried about health care costs and whether or not they will be able to survive. Small business folks are literally losing their business because they cannot afford to keep up the cost both of fuel and of health care costs. 
   We have a lot of problems we need to address, but blaming someone and saying the last 16 months we have brought to this Nation the high gasoline prices, Democrat leaders have, to me stretches the truth a little bit to where that rubber band breaks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. You're starting us off on a bad note. 
   It's good to be here this evening and to engage in conversation and dialogue certainly on the situation that we are in today in Iraq, and certainly in this country. 
   I want to deviate just a little bit and talk a little bit about my study hall period. Folks say that Members of Congress had recess. When I was in school and we had recess, we played most of the time; but I can assure you for the last several weeks of the month of August I did a lot of traveling in the district I represent, listening to a lot of people, the chamber of commerce, business people, individuals on the street, country stores, wherever I might have been, restaurants, coffee shops. We talked about a lot of things. People are worried about the war in Iraq. People are worried about the war in Iraq to the point where we know we can't lose there or we can't allow this nation to go into anarchy, but how do we prevent that from happening? 
   And as I listened to those debates and those dialogs, I realized that people were seriously concerned about what we're doing and how we're engaged. I hear people talking about whether we should have gone or not. That's legitimate, and I think historians, probably political scientists over the next several years, next decades and next centuries will obviously gauge that and will judge that. We can talk about whether the war was prosecuted right or not; and, quite frankly, I think there are some questions there as to whether or not this administration, Mr. Speaker, and whether this White House, Mr. Speaker, has engaged the way that would bring about a quicker resolution to where it would win much quicker in Iraq. 
   But when I went home on Sunday, I drove back down through the Shenandoah Valley, down Highway 81, hit Interstate 40, went across the Cumberland Plateau, and I realized what a beautiful Nation we have. When you look at those hills along the Blue Ridge down through the Shenandoah Valley and then the Cumberland Plateau near the Cumberland Gap and realize the beauty of this vast Nation that we have and the people who live here. 
   I had an opportunity, my first day off, to spend about 7 hours fishing at a great warrior's old mill, Sergeant Alvin C. York, in Palmyra where I live.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Ross, I had an opportunity with my oldest daughter and two of my grandchildren to go fishing. We were going to spend probably a couple hours there. We wound up spending over 7 hours. The last day that I spent in my district, I did the same thing, not intentionally. My middle daughter called and came up on Sunday, and I spent, as I did my first Monday home, my last Monday home I spent fishing in the rivers there below Sergeant York's home in the mill pond. Now, Sergeant York was a great American hero. But we have had other great American heroes, as well, Eisenhower being one of them. 
   I want to mention something about Eisenhower in just a moment. But first of all, I want to talk about what someone that America respects greatly said a few years ago. Clark Clifford and Richard Holbrooke wrote a book in 1991 called ``Counsel to the President.'' After Winston Churchill had made his ``Iron Curtain'' speech in Fulton, Missouri, they were traveling back on the train from Missouri. President Truman and many of his staff members had already retired for the evening. The three people who were basically sitting in the room at that time were Charles Ross, who was the press secretary for Truman, and Clark Clifford and Churchill. They talked about how our lives are influenced strictly by the accident of our birth.  
   What Churchill said, and I am quoting him as quoted in the book, ``If I were to be born again, I would wish to be born in the United States. Your country is the future of the world. You have natural resources, the spirit, the youth, the determination, which will steadily increase your global influence.'' He was correct in making that assessment over 60 years ago as he made this speech. He was correct then. And we are correct today to say that America's presence in the world today is recognized. 
   But why has it changed? Why would a great Brit, who is considered the Brit's Britishman, say, ``If I were to be born again, I would love to have been born an American''? How many people in the world today would say that? I would say that because when God put my soul in the body of a woman who lived in America, it was a great blessing for me just to be born in this country. We have got to regain and recapture throughout the world that spirit that folks from nations abroad have seen in this country, and I think we can recover it, to where we are looked upon, as Ronald Reagan said, as that shining light of freedom that folks can look at and aspire to. 
   We need an Eisenhower moment in Iraq. It has been said that after Eisenhower was elected President in 1952 that as he was ordered up he asked, as a general, from the military people in the field, the Army, if he could be able to have a few small planes that he would fly over South Korea and in parts of North Korea. It is also said, and his memoirs pretty much confirmed this, that after they landed he was silent for a few moments. And he basically said, We cannot win this war the way that we are fighting it, but we can't afford to lose it, either. We cannot win this war the way we are fighting it. He knew we would have to engage in a much greater, larger war that would include perhaps even China, which would have stretched America's resources and I think America's fiber to the breaking point. 
   Eisenhower understood that we were in a war that we should not have been in. Now some will question what I am saying. But that was Eisenhower's comments. It is a war that we are not ready to win. It is a war that we can lose, and we can't afford to lose. In his first 6 or 8 months of his Presidency, he brought about a resolution of a cease-fire in Korea. Did we stay there? Sure, we have been. Will we stay in Iraq? Sure we will. Every resolution that we passed on this floor that calls for a date certain authorizes this administration and authorizes the Defense Department to keep adequate personnel in the field and military presence in the field to help protect the resources, the assets of this country and protect our friends in the area and to help train the troops and the soldiers of the armies, the policemen, and the civilians of Iraq. We will be there several years from now, just as we were in South Korea, as we were in Western Europe. It is how we stay that makes the difference. It is how we stay that will make the difference. 
   The way we are there now I don't believe is the way we ought to be. We can no longer be the army for Iraq. We can no longer be the policemen in the streets, on the beat, providing security for the folks in Iraq. The Brits just pulled out. This great British leader named Winston Churchill, his country just pulled their troops out of Basra. Are we going to have a surge in Basra with American troops? 
   Mr. Speaker, let's ask the President that. Is that our intention now, that we will have a surge and resupply the troops there? Because it seems in southern Iraq obviously there is a lot of turmoil, a lot of killings, basically a civil war between the Shias, now some folks say are happening. In northern Iraq where the Kurds are, we are not there operating as the army or the policemen on the beat. In northern Iraq where the Kurds are, they are providing their own autonomy. 
   It is my opinion that the longer we stay in Iraq, the worse we will be. We need an Eisenhower moment in Iraq, not a General Custer moment, not a charge into the Little Big Horn to where we get destroyed. It is time that we reassess our situation in Iraq to a war that we win in Iraq. 
   I am saddened as I watch TV. I am seeing Iraq being sold by TV commercials as if we are selling an automobile to the American public. That saddens me when I see some of our wonderful soldiers, and I applaud them, who are saying, We cannot cut and run. I agree with them. We can't cut and run. But we don't need to be selling this war on TV commercials as the right thing to do. 
   The thing that we have not done, in my opinion, is that we have allowed Afghanistan to be left pretty much as an island to themselves. Oh, we are there. But just think what we could have done if we had spent the time and resources and kept the number of troops in Afghanistan that we moved to Iraq. 
   It is my belief that Karzai would have probably been, and still may be, someone that we may call their George Washington. We now see troubles in Pakistan. We are now seeing countries in Central Asia after the dominance of the Soviet Union for many years, many are floundering around trying to figure which is the best route to go. Each feels, I believe, that democracy is the best route to take. Many are struggling with their democracies in Central Asia. Just think of what we could have done in Afghanistan if, in fact, we had stayed there, helped build that country to take out those that would do harm to them, to destroy Afghanistan. We could have helped build a democracy that I believe would have been infectious, and an epidemic of democratic nations would have been springing up all over to continue to bloom and to progress in Central Asia. 
   It would have been infectious, in my opinion, in the Middle East, as well, and we would have seen I think the tumbling of the strongman-type governments. In every one of those countries surrounding Iraq, there is a strong person who runs those countries. If we had stayed and continued in Afghanistan, we would have seen, in my opinion, a much different Middle East than we see today and a much different Central Asia. 
   One of the real problems we have today is I think even Pakistan would have seen the success in Afghanistan and might have wanted to move further in that direction. In fact, the Taliban-type warriors and al Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden did attack us. I keep hearing these folks from the side saying, If we don't fight them there, we will fight them here. What do you think happened on September 11? They were here. And we have forgotten who attacked us. It wasn't Iraq. It was Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network. They are now, in some folks' opinion, in the areas of Waziristan and Pakistan. If, in fact, we allow, or if, in fact, Pakistan were to fall, guess who gets the nuclear weapons? 
   So our foreign policy, in my opinion, needs to be revisited. All of us need to start being American Democrats and American Republicans, not right-wingers and left-wingers. It looks like we have chosen up sides here and we have started to listen to the talk shows on one side or we look at the liberal communications on the other side, and all of a sudden that is what drives us in this country. It is time we start being Americans again, American Democrats and American Republicans, and look at our failures. Eisenhower understood it. George Custer found it out. We don't need a Custer move. We don't need to have advertisements telling us we need to have a war in TV commercials. 
   We need honesty, Mr. President. We need honesty. My request to you is that you have an Eisenhower moment, one of honesty. Let's get on with making sure we rebuild that area, put our troops out of the kill zone and stop requiring them to be the soldiers. Because if in Basra and southern Iraq and northern Iraq our troops are not there, and the only place where it seems the most violent actions that take place is where our troops are, that should tell us something. 
   We need to be sure that we keep enough troops to keep Syria or Iran, or quite frankly even our friend called Turkey, from invading Iraq for their own beneficial gain and let Iraq work its problems out. It is time. We have given them a government. They have accepted their government. They have elected their government. It is time for them to start leading and taking on the responsibility. I call upon this President, this administration, and this Congress to work together to make that happen.     
   We have built and helped build in South Korea over a period of 30-40 years one of the strongest democracies in the Asian-Pacific rim and Asia, the strongest economy called South Korea. It took a long time. It will take a long time to resolve the differences in the Middle East. It will take a long time to resolve the differences in Iraq. But we cannot do it the way we are doing it today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (THE NATIONAL DEBT AND THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, one of the things we really need to make sure of is that the American public as they watch this Blue Dog Coalition group here talk tonight, every one of us to the ``T'' comes from rural areas basically. We love America, we love our troops, we visit them. 
   I have been to Iraq five times and Afghanistan twice. I went for a reason, to tell our troops thank troops thank you, we love you, we appreciate you. We pray that an umbrella of safety will be put over our troops. We work for those back home to be sure that their families are recognized and that our communities uphold them and undergird them. 
   I don't want anybody to have a misinterpretation of what we are saying here tonight. This is about America, and it is not about TV ads that try to justify a war going on in Iraq. I am ashamed those things are on TV. We support our troops, and we will continue to do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (BLUE DOG COALITION -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Congressman Ross, thanks very much. I will be very brief. 
   During the campaign in November, October and September, obviously leading up to the November 7 election, I heard a great deal from those who would be talking about, do you favor cut and run or stay the course? 
   I submit to you that neither of those are good alternatives. And the sad thing is that the American public have been told that mission has been accomplished after landing on the battleship. And then shortly after that, the Iraqi insurgents were told, just bring it on. I think it is time that we bring on a little bit of accountability. And this accountability and the resolution that the Blue Dog Democrats have introduced doesn't deal with whether or not we stay, how long we stay. It just talks about the stay that we have already been there, account for it. Account for the almost $400 billion that has been spent of taxpayer dollars that could be used, quite frankly, maybe to have won the war in a better way, to have brought about a safe Iraq that is not there today. 
   And my real concern, as I go back and study the Tet Offensive, it is my concern that, as we send these 20-some thousand extra troops into Iraq, and as we start talking on the Shiia militias, that we may see the results of another Tet Offensive that we saw in 1968 in Vietnam. 
   I just hope that our President, that the Defense Department and those who are advocating additional troops not only will be accountable for what we have already done there, but at least present to us a better plan than what we have had presented to us in the past. 
   Stay the course, mission accomplished and bring it on just ain't got it done, and it is time that we look at what is going on in this country. When you look at Iraq and Iran, and you realize that when you hear that there are a billion folks of the faith of Islam, most of those are either in Asia, Central Asia and in Africa, not in the Middle East. Virtually all in the Middle East perhaps are the Islam faith except, obviously, for the nation of Israel. But when you look where most of the Shiias are, only 10 percent of the faith of Islam are Shiias. The other are Sunnis. And when you look at where the bulk of the Shiia population is, it is in Iraq and in Iran. 
   It is my fear that stay the course, bring it on and mission accomplished has only brought to us two nations in the Middle East, Iraq and Iran, with probably close to 7 percent of the Shiias that will be in control of two nations in the Middle East that will have under their soils around 50 percent of the oil in the Middle East. It is time, Mr. Speaker, that we take a serious look and do what the old crossing at the railroad used to say: Stop, look and listen to what we are doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, and its goal of reducing prescription drug prices for both the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. 
   Just like any new program, the current Part D benefit has its flaws. Make no mistake, however, the current Medicare prescription drug benefit has gone a long way in providing desperately needed assistance to seniors in Tennessee and across America in paying for their prescription drugs. Though far from perfect, the original bill passed in 2003 represented a breakthrough and an important milestone in the Nation's commitment to strengthen and expand health security for current beneficiaries and future generations. As a representative of an extremely rural district, the provisions that directly impacted my rural constituency were too good to vote against. Had I voted against the legislation, I would have essentially voted against my constituents, and I was elected to protect them. 
   Tennessee's Fourth District has a little over 27,000 elderly individuals with incomes less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level. The current benefit has directly assisted them in scaling down the cost of medicine and, as a result, has provided much needed assistance for low-income individuals. In fact, as of November, over 50,000 Tennesseans had been deemed eligible for the low-income subsidies provided by the original legislation. 
   The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 has directly impacted each of the 435 congressional districts in a unique way. While there is room for improvement, no one can deny that Part D has made great strides in helping our seniors to afford prescription medications. I applaud the program, but like my colleagues, I am committed to strengthening the benefit.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINCOLN DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. The responsible redeployment of our troops is a brave step toward a new direction for the war in Iraq. It will remove our troops from the most dangerous kill zones in Iraq and refocus our efforts toward defeating terrorism across the globe. 
   The decision to redeploy is one that I have not come to lightly. This bill gives the President the power to maintain a military presence in the region while, at the same time, imposing the accountability the American people demand that we enforce. 
   Four years into a difficult and prolonged engagement, I had hoped we would have seen better proposals for progress in quelling the violence. Throughout the course of our debate, whether on the air waves, Internet or in the halls of Congress, we've heard much of the supposed failures of our military goals. We hear often of continued strife and instability in the nation we sought to set free; of an Iraqi economy crippled by the trials of war; of parliamentary disputes, civil unrest and sectarian violence; and of a peace we all believe in that has yet to take place in Iraq. 
   But these stories, however true, are only a portion of our efforts. They are the darkest side of our endeavors meant to do good and sinfully omit the triumphs and victories of our sons and daughters who've done a great service. 
   For all that remains undone, our troops have accomplished a great deal. We brought free and open elections to a nation once shackled by a tyrannical regime. Iraq has experienced freedoms unimagined before, and Saddam Hussein was put to death for his crimes. 
   It is in this vein that we must continue our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, the greater Middle East and around the world, for it is essential to our security. 
   As we prepare to redeploy our troops from Iraq, we must commit as well to remain ever vigilant in the face of terrorism. Whether they are threats to America and her allies, whether radicalism threatens the foundations of the natural freedoms we've sought so hard to prove, we must prepare ourselves to face those threats and bring their agents either to justice or a swift demise. 
   We must continue our hunt for Osama Bin Laden and the instruments of al Qaeda. While I am behind the efforts to redeploy, our military must be equipped and prepared to protect American civilians, property and interests at home and abroad. 
   As I prepared my case today on the merits of redeployment, I was reminded of a speech delivered by Congressman Abraham Lincoln on January 12, 1848, that railed against President James K. Polk of Tennessee for bringing our country to war with Mexico. Lincoln believed that Polk had stretched the facts to fit the case for war, just as many have expressed their belief here that our President stretched the truth about WMDs to make his case for war. 
   President Polk's war with Mexico yielded the borders that stand today. Our nations endured the battle of Vera Cruz, the battle of Mexico City, but the results of the Mexican-American war remain, and our two countries live as partners in peace. The results of the war yielded positive results. History has favorably judged James K. Polk, just as history will judge this President. 
   So as the President considers signing the order to redeploy, I hope he will. I implore him to consider the advice of Mr. Lincoln.
