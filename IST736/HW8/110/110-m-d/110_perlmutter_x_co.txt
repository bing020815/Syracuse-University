<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Larson, and I want to thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for working together, for the give and take that's gone into this bill.  
   I rise in support, but I do recognize the complaints that Mr. Campbell raised in connection with this bill and this package. This is a short-term fix to some long-term fundamental economic problems that we have in the country, but it gives us a chance now to focus mid term and long term on strategies and investments that will strengthen our families and our Nation. These are strategies and investments that will call for sacrifice on the part of the Nation, as well as each one of us as individuals. 
   We will get a chance now, I hope, in future packages to look at the infrastructure of this Nation in energy and transportation, but this today will give the shot in the arm this country needs and give us a chance to really plan for the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, Today we are going to take up the DRILL Act; Drill Responsibly In Leased Lands. We recognize, on the Democratic side of the aisle, that part of our energy portfolio is oil and gas. We have 68 million acres that the oil and gas companies have under lease today that they could drill that they are not drilling. That is 14 years worth of supply to the United States. 
   But what we have, instead, is we have an addiction to foreign oil. And we have a picture here of the President and the King of Saudi Arabia. 
   We have to break that addiction. So we need to drill here in the United States. And under this particular bill, we require the oil companies to either use it or lose it. Drill on those 68 million acres. 68 million acres is the size of New England. Drilling locations, all across the United States and in the Outer Continental Shelf. Use it or lose it. 
   We cannot be tied to foreign oil forever. We have learned that lesson. It is time we have to have domestic drilling, and that is what the DRILL Act is. And even more so, it is time to switch to energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. If we are addicted to one commodity, we are going to be in trouble because we depend upon 8 oil countries and 5 oil companies and we are in real trouble. 
   Now, there is 68 million acres here is depicted. You can see, the size of New England, twice the size of Pennsylvania, bigger than Colorado. Huge amount of property. 
   Now, one of the things that we have done is there is another 23 million acres available in Alaska to drill, where there is a pipeline nearby.     
   The oil companies can drill there. Further, we can release some of the amount of oil we have in our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we have a chart here that shows that when we took oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1991, there was a 33 percent drop in the price of oil immediately; 2000, 18 percent, 2005, 9 percent That's what we're asking the President to do. 
   We need immediate relief, and then we have to switch and get off the addiction to oil by pursuing renewable energy and energy efficiency.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, I appreciate the comments of my friend from Illinois, who has assisted me on what we call the Green Energy Act in the Financial Services Committee. And that really is an act--which we will hear in that committee in a week or 10 days--designed to improve energy efficiency and renewable energy in various housing across the United States. Because he recognizes, as do I, as do millions and millions of Americans, that if we save a Btu, if we save a gallon of gas, it's earned; a gallon of gas saved is a gallon of gas earned, a Btu saved is a Btu earned. We can do much better, Mr. Speaker, than we've been doing when it comes to energy efficiency and adding renewable energy sources. And that's what the Green Energy Act is all about. And it applies to Native American housing, as does the motion to instruct, so that all Federal housing that's underwritten, supported by the Federal Government will be improved to energy efficient standards. 
   That's what we need to be doing, looking at efficiency, looking at renewable energy types of approaches. Because as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said yesterday to the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca) when he asked the question, well, what do we need to do to improve our energy situation? The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said we have to be more efficient in the way we use our energy and we have to start with renewable energy sources. 
   But I agree with my friend from Illinois, it's a comprehensive approach. We need to have drilling in the 68 million acres that currently is under lease by the oil companies and is not being used. And we have the bill that comes up this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, called the DRILL Act, ``Drill Responsibly In Leased Lands,'' that will go forward this afternoon so that oil companies take advantage of all the acreage that they have. Sixty-eight million acres is the size of New England plus, I think, New Jersey added on. It's a huge piece of property both on land and in the Outer Continental Shelf. That land and that water is already available for drilling. 
   So part of it is drilling, in terms of what we have right now. And I would encourage all my friends on the Republican side of the aisle to support the DRILL Act this afternoon because what we want to make sure is that oil companies don't just hold the property, but they use it. So they use it or they lose the lease; and we get it on to somebody else who's willing to proceed with drilling. Because we know we need to have oil--that's really a transitional fuel for the next 10 years--but we need to then move to energy efficiency and renewable energy sources so we're not addicted to one commodity. 
   This country has to have other ways to power itself. And as the gentleman from Illinois remarked, tomorrow some of my friends from the Republican side of the aisle are going to discover Golden, Colorado. It's the finest place on this planet. That's my home, that's my neighborhood. And I would recommend that everybody come visit Golden, Colorado, but the reason they're coming is to visit the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which is the finest laboratory for alternative energy and sustainable development in energy efficiency in the world. And at that laboratory we are working on those next generation of energy and fuels and the way to power this Nation in solar, in wind, in biofuels, in hydrogen, in geothermal, and all sorts of other things. And I congratulate my friends for coming over to visit the National Renewable Energy Lab, which they really have never supported much until now. 
   But I do see some unanimity coming among both sides of the aisle and a consensus coming among all of us that we have to really work on all phases of an energy plan, whether it's drilling, renewable energy, or energy efficiency. 
   Now, I've sort of boiled it down to three things, and I call it the three P's: Produce what we've got. We haven't talked about this second part, which is punish the people who are hoarding and gouging and speculating. And the third P is promoting energy efficiency and alternative energy. We can do that. And this country will be better off because it will be good for national security, it will be good for the climate, and it will be good for jobs. Thousands and thousands and thousands of ``green energy'' jobs will be available through promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
   One of the things that my friend from Illinois just talked about, which is drilling in ANWR, which is a reserve, a refuge, that's 10 years off. And the greatest projections are that that's 3 months' worth of United States supply of oil. So we're going to wait 10 years to drill for 3 months' worth of supply. 
   Now, one of my friends who I just saw on the floor, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), calculated that an average American family will spend $57,000 on fuel costs before the Republican plan to drill in ANWR would ever take effect. We've got to be working on other things before that. And the first one is to drill on the 68 million acres that are under lease and ready to go today. The second is to punish the people who continue to drive up the futures prices if, in fact, there is speculating or gouging going on. And the third is to promote alternative energy and energy efficiency. 
   But I support the bill that will come up before the House this morning, as does my friend from Illinois, and I would urge an ``aye'' vote. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume for a couple of comments. 
   I want to respond to my friend from Illinois concerning the support of the National Renewable Energy Lab. We'll start with that one. 
   I would concur that there certainly has been some support, but the two things I would point out to my friend are one, last in 2007 was the first time, really, the budget had been increased to the National Renewable Energy Lab in years and years and years under a Democratic majority. My friends who are going to go visit the National Renewable Energy Lab all voted against that, number one. 
   Number two, in the prior Republican Congress, there were cuts to the National Renewable Energy Lab where, in fact, scientists and engineers were going to be laid off. They were, in fact, laid off until the President went out to visit the National Renewable Energy Lab, and the department scrambled and reinstated those engineers and scientists who were going to be laid off in the face of the need for coming up with other ways to power this Nation. So I know that my friend from Illinois and I are in agreement that we need to change the way we power this Nation, and there is a transition to get there. 
   Then we need to be efficient in the way we use our energy, and we need to come up with other ways so we're not beholden to just one commodity. When we're beholden to one commodity, oil, we're beholden to eight oil countries, many of which don't like the United States, and to five oil companies. We have to change that picture or we're always going to face this problem. It's time for us to learn from our past. 
   The other thing I'd like to say in response to my friend from Illinois is that he talked about secret meetings. Well, the secret meeting that we really need to be talking about is the secret meeting held by Vice President Dick Cheney to create the energy policy that now has resulted in $4-a-gallon gasoline. 
   When the Bush administration took office, the price of oil per barrel was less than $30. Today, it's $150 or thereabouts. Maybe it has come down a little bit in the last few days, but is it any wonder that that happened with two oilmen running the White House? I don't think so. 
   With that, I'll yield 5 minutes, or such time as my friend may consume, to Congressman Yarmuth from Kentucky.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I appreciate my friend from Texas yielding to me. If people knew what happened in this secret meeting, we might know today why oil is at $4.35 a gallon, why it has gone from under $30 a barrel to almost $150 a barrel. But the Vice President has refused to provide any information to the public or to the Congress about that meeting.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   First, I would just like to say to my friend from Texas that with two of them in the White House and both Houses of the Congress in Republican hands up until 2006 when we started changing the direction of this nation, we saw that oil price going up and up and up and up. And it didn't change under them. If we always continue to drill and don't look at that as a transitional fuel and move to alternative energies, we're going to be in trouble. And we're going to have to learn this lesson over and over and over again. 
   With that, I will yield 4 minutes to my friend from Wisconsin.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I think we need to return the Chamber to what this bill is, which is Native American housing and the motion to instruct conferees, which we are all in agreement upon, and I would urge an ``aye'' vote on the motion to instruct. 
   We have gotten into a great debate over energy. And as I said earlier, the gentleman from Illinois and I and a number of people that sit on the Committee on Financial Services have worked on a bill which we call the GREEN Act. It is Green Renewable Energy Efficiency Neighborhoods. The purpose of that bill, similar to the motion to instruct with respect to Native American housing, is to provide energy efficiency incentives and renewable energy incentives with respect to housing across America. It creates a green mortgage market so there is a market to buy mortgages of homes that are energy efficient or have renewable energy features. It also helps to upgrade 50,000 of the 3 million units that the Housing and Urban Development either own or underwrite so that people in low to moderate-income housing have energy-efficient homes and lower utility rates. 
   One of the things that we and the gentleman from Illinois were talking about at the outset of this bill, was about trying to reduce utility costs in Native American housing, and that goes across the board for all low to moderate-income homeowners. 
   It has a number of other things involving residential energy development grants, as well as utilizing the services of the banks in particular areas, low-income housing areas to add energy efficient and renewable energy features to homes in various areas in cities and towns across the country. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote on the motion to instruct. I look forward to this bill going forward, and I look forward to having this conversation on the GREEN Act with my friend from Illinois in a couple of weeks when that bill comes for markup. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Tomorrow, several of my Republican colleagues are coming to Golden, Colorado, which is my home, to visit the National Renewable Energy Lab, and I want to welcome them, and I want to thank them for coming out to take a look at that laboratory. It's the finest laboratory in the world to come up with energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives. 
   In this day and age with gas at $4 a gallon, we have to look forward. We cannot remain hooked and addicted to oil and dependent on the Middle East. And so by them coming out to Colorado--they've never really favored renewable energy and energy efficiency--but it's time that we stop this addiction that we face. 
   And so we all know, and I'm beginning to hear my friends on the Republican side of the aisle recognize the need for renewable energy and energy efficiency because it's good for national security, it's good for the climate, and it is good for jobs; and I welcome them to my home in Golden, Colorado, and I look forward to them looking and visiting the National Renewable Energy Lab.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good evening. It's good to be here with my friend from Minnesota, and we just were listening to the gentleman from Iowa, and he was talking about what's the Democrat's plan. 
   Well, what is the Democrat's plan for energy? Well, it's just obvious what the Republican's plan has been with two oil men in the White House. You can see exactly what has happened to the price of oil under the Bush administration. From $25 a barrel to $134.35. 
   So when he is making comments or generally people are saying what is going on here, we can see with two oil men in the White House what the energy plan has been for this country, and that's higher and higher and higher gas prices. 
   Now, what we've got to do is we've got to take ourselves off of oil to a greater extent than we are right now. We have to relieve ourselves of this addiction. And in the short run, we're going to feel some pain, but in the long run, the liberation from being addicted to one commodity the way we are, which is oil, which is really having a ripple effect throughout the economy, will be fantastic. 
   And so what we are doing as Democrats is to provide other ways to save energy. A gallon saved is a gallon earned. A kilowatt saved is a kilowatt earned. And so what we want to do first is make sure that we're efficient in how we use our energy so that there is a lower demand and we aren't so hooked on petroleum and petroleum by-products. 
   Second, we've got to find other commodities that compete with petroleum, whether it is cellulosic ethanol or better ways to make electricity through renewable energy sources. As Democrats, those are the kinds of things we're doing. It's time for us to get to the future and not continue to be hooked on oil like we have been for the last 30, 40, 50 years.

And it is going to be across the spectrum, whether it is making our buildings more efficient, our homes more efficient when it comes to energy consumption, our cars more efficient, come up with different fuels, different ways to power this country, we can do those things; and it's just so obvious because it's good for national security, it's good for climate, and it is good for jobs. 
   But let us go back to this thing about they want to drill in ANWR, they want to drill offshore, they want to drill a million places. 
   Well, we know that right now, and I'll put up a chart, that right now oil companies are not drilling 30.6 million acres that they have offshore and 30.5 million acres that they have on shore.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I think the question is to try to distract from the real answer which is the plan, the energy plan has been to raise gas prices, and the energy plan has not worked. It's hurt Americans. And we have to come up with other ways so that we aren't dependent upon one commodity like that because we're dealing with eight or so countries in OPEC and five, or about five big oil companies. Very few countries and very few companies. And we need to have other ways to power this Nation, and we can do it. 
   I mean, we have the ability to come up with better and more efficient cars. We have the ability to come up with more efficient homes and not in expensive ways. We're talking about changing out windows, putting in more insulation. There are opportunities to add solar or wind so that we have renewable energy sources, and these are thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs; and certainly in the construction industry, those jobs are needed today. So it is a win-win situation if we're just going to have to do these things. 
   But even in the short run, we know that oil companies have plenty of places to drill that they aren't drilling today. So it's a phony argument.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. And, Mr. Ellison, you are right on the mark. This is about changing the direction of this Nation and not doing things the same old way that now is forcing us to see $4-a-gallon-priced gasoline. This is about changing the direction of this Nation, moving us into this century where we have many other ways to power this Nation. 
   Now we just, all of us as a country, as Americans, we have to step forward and do this and knowing in the short run that we're facing $4-a-gallon gasoline. Now, we're going to take a look, as Members of Congress, why we've seen this dramatic spike to $4, whether--hopefully there's not been manipulation, there's not been speculation that's been improper. 
   But even so, we need to come up with other ways to power this country, and we can do that whether it is through the research being conducted at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado, whether it is the new designs that we're seeing for cars across the globe. There are many, many ways that we can improve our energy situation, and most of them start with really pretty low-hanging fruit; and that's just being more efficient.

   So we are, as the Democratic Congress, moving us to a new energy future. We are changing the direction of this Nation. We're not going to follow the energy plan of two oil men in the White House. That's just not where we're going to go any more.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I think it minimizes it. I think there are plenty of opportunities to drill. 
   You know, having said we're going to change direction, we're not going to go cold turkey from oil and gas. It will play a role in our energy spectrum for a long time to come. But we certainly can reduce our demand. 
   There are certainly places to drill now that aren't being drilled by the big oil companies, and there are other ways that we can wean ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.     
   We just have to do that. We can't ignore this any longer, and this particular White House and the Republican Congress before us would just want to drill and drill and stay hooked on one commodity. It is never smart in business to only have one supplier.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. In Colorado, we've had kind of a slow economy for several years now. We've faced a lot of foreclosures in the Denver metro area and throughout the State. We keep feeling like we're going to come out of this slump and then kind of get bumped back in. I believe in Colorado we're going to come out of the slump before much of the Nation just because we went into it before much of the Nation. 
   But even so, with the oil prices the way they are, with the way the economy has been managed by this administration, the people in Colorado need a safety net which is what unemployment insurance is. These are hardworking people who, for one reason or another, may have lost a job. They're looking for work. They want work. They want to get back in employment, and they need to do that. People in Colorado are workers. They like to be employed. They like to earn an income. They like to provide for themselves, and given the slow economy that we've had in Colorado, which I think and I hope is ready to turn, people do need that extra safety net.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I'm sorry to say that he's considering that, and what I find so hard to believe is that the best investment this country ever made was in the GI Bill after World War II. And now we have had our men and women in Afghanistan and in Iraq for more than 5 years, which is longer than we were in World War II, and to provide them with education and educational opportunities simply will be a fantastic investment for this country. 
   The wealth that was created, the happiness that was created because people could live full lives and educated lives after World War II, those are the kinds of things that we want for America. And my Dad, when we're talking about this, and you can see him well up with pride about the GI Bill and how so many men came back from World War II and then were successful after seeing the horrors of war, but came back and were able to provide for their families in ways that nobody anticipated. He describes that as the greatest investment this country has ever made, and he kids around by then saying, ``And a distant second was the Louisiana Purchase.'' 
   So this GI Bill that we're proposing now for the 21st century will be a fantastic investment for our men and women who have served us. I believe we owe them a responsibility to provide for education, and we just need to go forward with this. And the White House has objected to this. Senator McCain has objected to this, as I understand it. And it just doesn't make sense.

Now, it has to have execution, but I know in Colorado, for instance, in terms of veterans' claims, there was this tremendous backlog. Because of what we did last year, we've added 65 people to the benefits section so that claims can be processed in a reasonable and timely fashion so that the benefits are received by our service men and women in a reasonable and timely fashion. So there has been actual progress on the ground.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Well, we've taken steps to stem foreclosures by using the FHA guarantee as a way to slow things. And the way it works is that a bank that has a loan to somebody can write the loan down to whatever the market value is. Then the FHA will guarantee 90 percent of this lower amount for the borrower so long as the borrower can pay that 90 percent back. Now they have to go through a credit check, and they've got to be able to pay the lower amount. 
   So the Federal Government is coming in to stop a foreclosure which, if it takes place, could result in a vacant home that then ends up decaying, and it starts the decay in a neighborhood. So it assists the neighborhood. It allows the bank to become liquid. And it gives the borrower a chance to make the payments at this lower amount. 
   Now, if the borrower were to sell in, I believe, within 5 years, the Federal Government would receive a portion of anything above the written down purchase price. But the bottom line is, in a very prudent and fiscally responsible manner, FHA is being used to guarantee lower loans, reduced loans so that we can limit the numbers of foreclosures in our neighborhoods and maintain the strength of our neighborhoods.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Well, I'd like to go back to the gas prices. 
   You know, I think that the gas prices show the lack of an energy plan by the prior Republican Congress, by this White House, except to the degree that it has caused an increase in oil prices. 
   You know, we're in Iraq in a substantial way; and a lot of it, in my opinion, has to do with oil. Now, the average price per gallon of fuel paid by U.S. military units in Iraq is at least $3.23. The price per gallon of gasoline for Iraqi residents is $1.36. Why the difference there? Oil revenues for the Iraqi Government is expected to be $70 billion, which should be paid back to this country when we are running a deficit. We're spending $2.5 to $3 billion a week to be in Iraq. And that obviously has had an effect on our economy over the course of these 5 years that we've been in Iraq. 
   We've got to change the direction of this Nation, Mr. Ellison. We're trying to do that every day. We need to change the direction when it comes to energy. We've got to change the direction when it comes to Iraq. We've been changing the direction when it comes to our veterans and living up to our contracts and responsibilities in terms of their benefits. 
   We're making a difference. We have a long way to go to really change the direction of this Nation. This country is in need of big change in a lot of ways. And I'm glad that I've been elected to the Congress by the people of the suburbs of Denver to try and institute some of that change. 
   And so with that, I would yield back to you, sir.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Israel on its 60th anniversary. While Israel is frequently cited as a model of democracy in the Middle East, I would like to focus on Israel's advances in embryonic stem cell research. 
   The United States is still trying to fully harness the potential of this valuable research. We aim to cure debilitating diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, epilepsy, spinal injuries, and others. But for years at facilities like Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, the Weizmann Institute, and many others, Israeli scientists have blazed a path for the rest of the world to follow. 
   For 60 years, Americans and Israelis have built a friendship embracing all that we share, and as the United States works to unlock the promise of embryonic stem cell research, we find yet another reason our friend Israel is so special.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Pallone. 
   We did have a chance to hear our friends from the Republican side of the aisle. They talked about how they could manage the budget, how this President's budget was great and good for America. But last November, the people of this country cut through the smoke and mirrors of the Republican budgets, and they asked for and voted for a change in direction of this country. 
   Let's just start with where this Republican President and the Republican Congress left off last fall when we had the elections. Under George Bush, under this presidency, we have had another $3.9 trillion added to the debt of this country. The debt on each one of us now is about $29,000 per person and rising every day under this White House and the Republican Congress. There was nowhere near a balanced budget at any time over the last few years, just continuing to dig us deeper and deeper and deeper into debt. 
   The people of this country saw it. They didn't want anymore of that, because they understand that, right now, because of that debt that has been incurred over the last few years, the interest that we pay on our debt now dwarfs what we spend on education, veterans' benefits and homeland security, to just name a few, because we are spending so much, because we borrowed so much. The President and White House has proposed a budget where we continue to borrow and spend and drive our country farther and farther into debt. 
   They talked about how they could manage the budget so much better. My friends here know they didn't even finish the budget. We had to take a mess that was left over by the Republican Congress and really the White House where they didn't finish their business. We had to deal with it last week to try to get our budget in order. 
   The Democratic Congress really is changing the way business is being done here in our Nation's Capital because we are addressing budget problems. And we are going to show that we really do believe in making health care a priority and not just giving lip service to it. 
   So I would like to yield back to Mr. Pallone or to our friend, Representative Castor, for their comments, and then I would like to talk about how the President's health care budget affects the people in Colorado, my fair State.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. My friend from Wisconsin is so right on this subject. It really is, where are your values? They are reflected in a budget. Now, as I said earlier, they didn't pass a budget last year. But last week, we passed a budget, and we wanted to show this country how much veterans mean to this country. And instead of cutting benefits, we raise benefits for our veterans. 
   We are changing the direction of this Nation because we know what the values of this Nation are, and they aren't reflected in the President's budget. They weren't reflected by the Republican's failure to deal with a budget last year. But they were reflected in what we did last week in taking a budget that hadn't been dealt with by the prior Congress and showing the world, showing this country, showing your State, my district, that we care about our veterans. And in this budget that the President has given to us for next year, again, this President has cut veterans benefits and medical benefits over the next 5 years. 
   I would like to yield back to my friend from Wisconsin.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Would the gentleman yield? I think the gentlewoman from Virgin Islands has something to say on this, too, but a couple of things. 
   In Colorado, on the point you are talking about, the SCHIP for kids, we have 176,000 kids who are at risk in this instance, and based on the President's budget, we cannot keep up with them. We cannot continue to provide them with the care that they deserve. 
   And as some of you know, I have a daughter with a chronic illness, and luckily, through my law firm, we had a good insurance program for all the trips to the emergency room and the different things like that. So we see on the one hand poorer kids, uninsured kids that are at risk, they are not going to be served, and under this President's budget, as you were saying, those of us who were fortunate enough to have a good insurance policy for kids with chronic illnesses or whatever might affect us, we are going to be taxed on this. 
   The President has said this budget, and some of his people have said this is a balanced budget with no new taxes over a 5-year period. Well, it is not a balanced budget, and there are new taxes on a lot of people, as you said, who have contracted for, worked for good insurance policies, and at the same time he says we are going to help the underinsured and the uninsured. What we see under the budget, it gets cut as well.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank my friend from New Jersey. Just for me, this past election was, the people wanted a new direction. They wanted checks and balances back in this country. They wanted a different perspective to be brought to the values of this Nation. As my friend from Wisconsin and my friend from New Jersey, my friend from Florida said, this budget that the President has presented reflects his values, but I don't think it reflects the values of this country. 
   Just as we did last week with the concurrent, with the continuing resolution, with the budget that we passed last week, we are going to reflect what I believe are the values of this country, whether it is with veterans. And I just notice, in the President's proposed budget, he is increasing medical care fees for military retirees. The budget increases enrollment fees and deductibles under TRICARE. I can tell you, as I have gone around, my area, Golden, Colorado, Brighton, Aurora, wherever it might be in the suburbs of Denver, those military retirees are already complaining about increases in TRICARE and cuts in benefits that come with respect to that, that we haven't fulfilled the promises that we have made for the great service that we have received from these men and women in our Armed Services. 
   Now, you know, what are our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq to expect? We are going to provide them with the best care and the best service that we can. And we have got to show prior military retirees that same respect. We have got to do it for our troops now. I question the President's budget on these things. We are going to change the direction of this Nation. We are going to show what our values are, and they are the values of the people of this country. I am glad to be here, to be a check and balance on this current administration.

The NIE report concluded that the U.S. has little control over the day-to-day developments in Iraq and that there is a strong possibility of further deterioration. 
   The report also refutes the President's claim that we could begin to see progress from his troop escalation within the next 6 months. Instead, the President's own intelligence experts expressed deep doubts that the Iraqis will be able to gain any real control over their militias within the next 18 months. 
   They also stressed that the major security problem is not the presence of al Qaeda but instead is the Iraqi-on-Iraqi violence. The intelligence officials make clear that the political accommodations are crucial to reducing sectarian tensions, but the report concludes that the parties are unwilling or unable to make them at this point.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, today I rise to commend my friend Peter Groff on his historic achievement of becoming the first African American State Senate President in Colorado's history. Senator Groff becomes only the third African American Senate President in U.S. history. This momentous accomplishment is well-deserved. 
   Senator Groff is one of the most honorable, bright, and deliberate individuals I have ever had the pleasure to serve with. He embodies statesmanship and has earned the trust and esteem of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
   Senator Groff's courageous and visionary approach to governing can be summed up in his own words: ``To be bigger than the politics of the moment.'' I find it fitting that the man nicknamed ``the conscience of the Colorado Senate'' would be the first in our State's history to shatter this once seemingly impenetrable glass ceiling. 
   In closing, the Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said, ``I don't measure America by its achievement, but by its potential.'' I can think of no better person to help Colorado achieve its potential than Peter Groff. He will serve Colorado with honor and distinction.

   It's great to be standing on the floor with gentlemen who have been elected by the people in 2006 to change the way this Nation is being run, and to provide the hope that we need to deal with the problems you've outlined. And we can do this, we know we can do this. This is a time where we change the focus from the wealthiest 1 percent to the hardworking people of middle America. This is the time for hardworking Americans. And we're going to provide, based on this stimulus package, a package of different approaches to help middle Americans, hardworking Americans, we're going to provide them with refunds so that there will be some money in their pocket, not just in the pocket of the wealthiest 1 percent, but in the pockets of everyone across America. Ronald Reagan used to talk about trickle down. Well, that's not how the economy works, it works trickle up. It's a flood up. If people in the middle have money, they spend it, and that will generate all sorts of new business in America. 
   We're also going to provide stimuli that will create many new jobs, whether it's in the energy sector. We can improve how we're dealing with health care and increase jobs there. But this is a time when we really are going to change how Washington is conducting business. The President would like us just to focus on the wealthiest. He would like us just to keep things the same. We're not doing that. We're here to provide hope to people and change so that people in their everyday lives know that they've got folks here who were elected to fight for them. And we are going to change things by providing a whole new approach to the economy this year. 
   We hope to provide a package that will be $100 billion, that's about 10 months in Iraq, that's nothing, where we can help this country really get on a solid footing economically, and then for the long-term future, really develop a whole new energy system that will provide thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs across this country, as well as revamp our health care system that has become such a drag on the economy. 
   This is a time when we have to look very hard and be realistic about the problems that face us. But when America really turns its attention to something, it changes the future. And that's what this Congress is going to do. That's our job. That's why we were sent here was to change the future and to provide hope to people.

They want us to look out in the short term, the mid term, and the long term. 
   And in the short term, you talked about it. We want to provide in a bipartisan way, working with our friends on the other side and with the administration, real relief to millions of people across America. And you described it as timely, targeted, and temporary. Relief that gets right into people's pockets where they can then buy those necessities, whether it's a washer or they have got to fix the sink or whatever it might be, because people, even those that don't run into terrible problems as you described, are having a heck of a time making ends meet. They're working 40 hours. They're working 60 hours. But if there is one bump in the road, a kid who has to have braces or any little thing just sets you back, because everybody is that close, as energy prices go up, as tuition goes up, as health care costs go up. So our job is to give them some relief. And when we do that, that will help the economy as a whole. 
   Then we have the mid term and long term, the trade policies. But for me in my area, which is primarily the suburbs of Denver, it is middle America. It is right down the middle politically. It is right down the middle financially. It's not rich. It's not poor. It's not Democrat or Republican. It is right down the middle as an independent kind of an area. And they are expecting  of us to turn the attention to them, to middle America, and not just the wealthiest people. And when we do that, we're going to change the face of this Nation again.

   After 4 years, billions of dollars and thousands of lives, President Bush is once again asking Congress to reward failure with a blank check for the war in Iraq. Many of my Republican colleagues are more than willing to give the President anything he wants, but Democrats refuse to be a rubber stamp for the President's failed policies and, instead, want to finally require Iraqis to take control of their country. And yet the President has threatened to  veto legislation that contains his own benchmarks for success in Iraq, ensures our troops have the training they need, and fully supports both our veterans and our soldiers wounded in combat. 
   Our legislation also commits additional funding to fighting the forgotten war in Afghanistan. Over the last 4 years, the Bush administration has redirected funds and troops away from Afghanistan, forgetting that al Qaeda and the Taliban were the ones that attacked our Nation in 2001.

   As the global war on terror continues, America dedicates much of its resources to tracking foreign terrorists at home and abroad. But in recent years, we have seen a rise in the number of U.S.-born criminals inspired by, but not necessarily affiliated with, groups like al Qaeda. And we have had, from Ms. Harman and Mr. Reichert and Mr. Lungren as well, a list of a number of incidents that we have seen recently. 
   It is vital that our Nation do what it can to understand the growing threat of homegrown terrorists and what we can do to prevent it. The Homegrown Terrorism and Violent Radicalization Act finally focuses attention on this matter. The bill establishes a national center of excellence to bring in the top minds in the world to explore the causes of radicalization. The legislation also enhances our international cooperation so we may learn from our allies who have extensive experience with homegrown terrorism. 
   But the centerpiece of this legislation is the establishment of a national commission to report to Congress the causes and preventive measures that we can take. The commission consists of academics, religious experts, counterintelligence officials, prison administrators, and many others with the experience provided for this input. 
   And I must make it clear this bill has strict oversight of the privacy officers within the Department of Homeland Security to ensure it respects personal and religious freedom.  
   As Americans, it is very difficult to understand why one of our citizens would want to terrorize his neighbors and countrymen. But it is a question we must face in order to protect our security. This bill tackles this head on, and I would like to thank our chairman and ranking member for bringing this bill forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House bill 1680, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act. On many of the 728 farms in my district and those throughout the country, hardworking farmers rely on ammonium nitrate as a trusted fertilizer that can produce more nutrients than natural fertilizers, but by its very chemical nature, ammonium nitrate is also a substance that, if mixed with certain fuels, can be used as a powerful explosive. The Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 is perhaps the most notable and frightening example of ammonium nitrate's potential. Therefore, we must do all we can to prevent criminals and murderers from obtaining this legal substance while maintaining easy access for our Nation's farmers. 
   The Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act creates a national registry to monitor the purchase and sale of ammonium nitrate. It further matches the names of applying farmers against the terrorist screening database so we can keep ammonium nitrate out of terrorists' hands. In particular, I am pleased to have worked with Mr. Lungren and with others throughout the committee to craft an expedited appeals process for farmers who have been adversely affected by the name check process. The Department of Homeland Security must either approve or deny an application within 3 days. If someone is denied a registration number under the program, they may appeal and get a resolution from the government within 3 days. The provision ensures that farmers who are misidentified do not jeopardize their livelihoods due to a governmental mistake. This is a commonsense bill that guaranties that ammonium nitrate in our country is being used for legitimate agricultural purposes and not for harm. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.

We were all sent here, I think, to bring change to this Nation and bring a new direction to this Nation. I am proud that we have been a part of really a bipartisan effort. As Democrats, we have been part of a bipartisan effort to change the way this country is being run. In this last 100 hours, with Nancy Pelosi really pushing us to the maximum, we have taken care of things that have been stymied, stalled and stopped in prior Congresses. 
   We have dealt with minimum wage that sat on the shelf for 10 years. We dealt with renewable energy which for my district is fantastic. We have the National Renewable Energy Lab. It is time for us to change our priorities and have a more diverse portfolio of energy sources so that we aren't relying on the Middle East all the time. It is good for national security, it is good for the climate, it is good for jobs. 
   We dealt with student loans. As I said a couple of days ago, I was at a dive meet this past weekend, one of my kids was in a dive meet, and a woman came up and thanked me because we were reducing the rate of interest on student loans because she had one daughter in college, another one coming up, a single mom, and this was going to help their family educate and really build for the future. 
   One of the things that I was most proud of, and I am talking to the gentleman from Tennessee because he participated in this, was on the stem cell bill. I felt so proud because that is what Congress, that is what the democratic system is all about. There was a bipartisan bill that passed legislation to allow for further stem cell research that holds out so much promise for so many people. One of my kids has epilepsy. We talked about that. DIANA DEGETTE and MIKE CASTLE, one a Democrat, one a Republican, worked very well together to bring about a bipartisan solution to something that will help so many people across this country. 
   There were other things. There was 9/11. I am a member of the Homeland Security Committee. And for us to finally pass the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission after years of it sitting there without any implementation by the Republican Congress was a great change. I am just happy to be here, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good afternoon, Mr. Speaker. Today is National Teacher's Day, a day which is very important to me and my family. 
   This year's theme for National Teacher's Day is ``Great Teachers Make Great Public Schools.'' And I know that's true. 
   I had wonderful teachers in the Jefferson County public schools, and those teachers had a tremendous impact on my life. 
   Our three daughters are products of Jefferson County public schools, and my sister is a public school teacher. 
   Few other professionals touch as many people as teachers do. Teachers are our role models, our confidants, our taskmasters and our moral compass. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to invest in our schools, reduce class sizes and ensure that our teachers have the tools and resources they need to give our children the high quality education necessary to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush has to get out of the White House a little more often so that he can see firsthand how average Americans are struggling to make ends meet during this holiday season. Over the past 7 years, the President has presided over an economy in which the poverty rate has gone up and household incomes have gone down. The average family is making less today than they did last year, while at the same time, everyday costs for food, home heating oil, gas, college tuition and health care skyrocket out of control. 
   Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan voiced concern this weekend that the economy may be heading into a recession early next year. Despite all of these warnings, President Bush stood before the American people and proclaimed that the American economy was strong and pointed to the tax cuts of his first term as a reason for this strong economy. 
   Well, the President needs a reality check. It is time for the President to recognize that the struggles of average working families are here to stay and he needs to check them out. Together,  we can address those concerns, and we wish to work with him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good morning, Madam Speaker. 
   This week, the House Budget Committee will prepare a Democratic budget that begins the process of fixing a fiscal mess created by President Bush and congressional Republicans over the last 6 years. This is not something that can be done in one year. After all, it took the prior Congresses and administration 6 years to turn a $5.6 trillion surplus into a $2.8 trillion deficit. That's a fiscal collapse over a 6-year period of more than $8 trillion. The misguided budget priorities of this administration have forced the President to borrow more money from countries like Japan and China than all of his 42 predecessors combined. That is not only a budget concern but also a serious national security concern. 
   It's time that we get our fiscal house in order. The Democratic budget will restore fiscal sanity here in Washington by actually balancing the budget over the next 5 years. This is something that the Republicans were not able to accomplish over the last 6. The Democratic budget will bring about change and a new direction in sound budgetary policies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Chairman, I think our friends on the other side of the aisle have framed this in a way that I think is legitimate, which is, how long will this relief be extended. We talked about this in committee. And my feeling is the relief has got to be extended until we actually get on the job. 
   Mr. Neugebauer mentioned the fact that there has been a substantial amount of money appropriated and obligated to repairing and reconstructing these homes in New Orleans, but a very small portion of it has yet to be extended. 
   We had a debate over a couple of sections; one, that vouchers, it has been 18 months or 19 months now, shouldn't be available for people outside of New Orleans; and now we are saying those same vouchers shouldn't be available for them in New Orleans. The problem that we have here, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that the job hasn't been done. There have been mistakes, missteps, miscommunication. Eighteen months seems like a long time, but very little has been done to reconstruct or renovate or rebuild the homes for so many people that were displaced. That is the bottom line here. 
   The bottom line is, coming from Colorado, coming from my background, my faith, we want to help people who are poor, we want to help them if they have been displaced by a huge natural disaster. They haven't been able to return because, through no fault of their own, things haven't been rebuilt or reconstructed. I can't see why we would want to strike section 306 because we haven't gotten the job done. Not through any fault of the people who have been dispersed throughout the country, but because of some problem either between the administration and the State of Louisiana or whatever. That is what has got to be straightened out here. We can't cut out this section and look ourselves in the mirror thinking that we have done the job. 
   The people that were displaced are entitled to return to New Orleans, they are entitled to return to these homes, and that is what this bill is about. That is why we brought this bill. You know, in a perfect world, everything should have been done by now, but it has not been finished, not anywhere near it. So we have got to step forward again. 
   We aren't trying to outdo ourselves. We are trying to finish what all of you started 18 months ago; but for whatever reason, we can blame the administration, we can blame the State, we can blame a lot of things, but it hasn't been finished. Our job is to finish the job and allow people to return to their homes in New Orleans as quickly as possible and not to cut this section 306. 
   So I am going to urge the House to defeat this amendment. I understand Mr. Neugebauer's desire to be fiscally responsible, I couldn't agree with him more. But the fact of the matter is the money is out there, things haven't been finished, and these vouchers are important to keep for the people.

   Mr. Chairman, this bill really, I think Mr. Wamp said it is best, is one about efficiency and it is about how we spend our money when it comes to energy independence. There is no question that the people of this country understand it very well, that this bill is good for national security, it is good for the climate and it is good for jobs, because it promotes energy efficiency, it promotes renewable energy and alternative sources of energy, and it adds sufficient funding to the Department of Energy so that it can really boost its Office of Science and its Office of Energy Efficiency. 
   I am fortunate to have in the Seventh Congressional District of Colorado the National Renewable Energy Lab, which is the finest laboratory of its kind in the world, to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. This bill will help the Department of Energy continue to support the National Renewable Energy Lab as it works with the private sector to come up with new ways to power America and the rest of the globe. 
   This is a fine bill. I thank the committee for developing this. I support it, and I ask wholehearted support from the Congress, because this, as I said, is good for national security, it is good for the climate, and it is good for jobs.

   For example, so far this year, we've passed legislation implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, approved a budget that achieves a balance in 5 years, passed sweeping congressional ethics reform, repealed big oil subsidies, invested funds in renewable energy and increased the minimum wage. 
   But the President continues his stubborn opposition to this new direction that we are providing on Iraq and on key domestic measures. He does not support or has threatened to veto about two-thirds of the important work we've already provided.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. The reason you seek amnesty or immunity or some sort of protection from being sued or charged is that there may have been wrongdoing. There may have been some violation of a law or potentially a constitutional provision like the fourth amendment, which you just read. 
   I think really the issue here, and you may all have been over this a dozen times, but it bears repeating, that there is a provision in our wiretapping law, and everybody calls it FISA. This is about wiretapping. This is about eavesdropping. There are times when you need to wiretap. There are times when you need to eavesdrop if somebody you have probable cause or you have general belief that somebody is going to do you harm. It could be a criminal enterprise or it could be a foreigner who wants to attack the United States. There was a glitch in our law which needed to be fixed. There was a technical glitch which said if there was a wiretap on U.S. soil, then you had to get a warrant. 
   Now the way that telecommunication works these days is somebody could be calling from Pakistan to Germany, two people, foreigners who aren't entitled to the protection of the fourth amendment, but that telecommunication, that phone call is routed through the United States. We changed the law, we, the Congress, to take care of a technical telecommunication glitch and said in that instance that you don't have to get a warrant. So if it's between a foreign individual and another foreign individual, there's no need for a warrant on foreign property. 
   Now we fixed this. But the President asked for more. He wants to get rid of the courts who are there to protect us as citizens, as Americans, and the Constitution of the United States. He says, I don't want those courts. I don't think they need to be present. Well, we needed them when Richard Nixon was President. We needed to make sure that before the government, before the White House, before anybody looks in on my house or your house, or any American's house, there has to be a reason. And the courts were that stop. That was that objective branch. So yes, we are going to keep the courts involved. 
   Secondly, the President or the White House or somebody had asked the phone companies to do these taps. Well, the phone companies knew how to do taps. They got a warrant. The law said, You get a warrant, you're protected, Mr. Phone Company, or Mrs. Phone Company. You can wiretap somebody's phone call. Well, it appears that in this instance they didn't get warrants. They circumvented the courts. 
   Now we don't know that for sure. We haven't been given all the information that we in the Congress or the people of America deserve. Now the phone companies are asking for amnesty. They are saying, look, if we didn't follow the law, we are sorry. Just forgive us. We know at least one phone company that said, Wait a second, this doesn't make sense. You're not giving us the warrants that the law requires. We are not going to do it. That, I am glad to say, is my local phone company, Qwest. 
   So it isn't like everybody did this. At least one phone company said we want to follow the law. So, you know, this is about amnesty for other phone companies and this is about avoiding the courts. That is what this administration wants and, quite frankly, I am not going to shirk my responsibility to the Constitution and to the people of this country by caving in to those particular requests.

Really what has been troubling I think to everybody is that the President says ``Trust me. Just give them amnesty. Just give them immunity.'' The phone companies are saying, ``We really can't talk to you because we are sworn to secrecy. Just trust us.'' 
   You know, I don't know about any of you and your constituents, but I know that my constituents expect good representation, good oversight of these kinds of things. And if the telecommunications are entitled to some protection, we have given them protection in the law. If you get a warrant, you are immune. You are doing your national duty by wiretapping or using your surveillance powers. But you got to go through the right process to protect those rights that we are so fortunate to enjoy as Americans.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Well, I want to step back for a second and just talk  about what I think our responsibility is with respect to this wiretapping surveillance stuff and our responsibility as Members of Congress, and really as citizens of this country, because we each have an obligation as citizens to do these same things, to uphold the Constitution and the rights that we all enjoy under the Constitution and to make our citizenry safe, to help make our families safe, our neighborhoods safe, our communities safe. 
   There is a way under the law as we have revised this surveillance law to do both of those things. We have fixed this technical problem that existed where foreigners were given certain rights under our Fourth Amendment that they weren't entitled to. We have corrected that in this law. But we have maintained the Fourth Amendment and the First Amendment and the Third Amendment and everything else within the Constitution for each and every American by including the courts to oversee this and supervise when the government says we want to eavesdrop on a citizen, and we are demanding of the President and the telecommunications companies, we want to see what it is you are asking us to let you off the hook about. 
   That is what is being asked. And they are saying sorry, we are not going to let you look at that. Therefore, we are going to say, then we are not doing our job. We are not going to just let you go get a get-our-of-jail-for-free or go scot-free without information. We are not doing our job then. We are not being accountable and responsible to our constituents. 
   As the President has laid this out, he is just trying to stir up fear in the American populace, which is wrong. He is trying to avoid the courts as being a check and balance on the awesome power of the Federal Government to invade our privacies. He doesn't want that, and he is asking us to give this carte blanche amnesty without really giving us the basis for that, and I object to all of those things. With that, I yield back to my friend.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. Klein. 
   Every other Saturday I have a ``government at the grocery.'' I visit different grocery stores throughout my district. This past week I was at a grocery store in Edgewater, Colorado, and the number one topic was the price of gas. Usually it has been Iraq, and we certainly are going to talk about Iraq tonight, but the number one conversation was about the price of gas. And people were saying, look, we understand that on a per-barrel basis, it's down, the cost is down, the price is down. Why is the cost at the pump up? 
   And, you know, we have excuses. The excuses this time, Mr. Klein, have been, well, we just needed to clean the refineries. They clean the refineries right at the beginning of the summer travel season because by restricting the supply, you drive up the price, and we can't have that anymore. We can't have our people being gouged in this country by manipulation of the market in that fashion.     
   What we are seeing is too few companies controlling too critical an item, a commodity, like gasoline, and that is what that price gouging bill was all about today. So I can assure you in Colorado, it is a major topic of conversation, and people want to see a change, and we are bringing that change to them by the bill we passed today and the direction we are taking this Congress. 
   With that, Mr. Kline, I would like to turn it over to my friend from Vermont, who always has something to say on any topic, but particularly I know he has something to say today on this gasoline price gouging.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. If the gentleman would yield, I think we have to get back to basics here. We have to have a diversified energy portfolio. 
   One of the things that you were talking about and Mr. Braley was talking about was renewable energy. The American people are way ahead of Congress, and it is our job to change the direction of the Federal Government on this subject because it is good for national security, and it is good for the climate, and it is good for jobs. 
   Quite frankly, if we have a diversified portfolio where we have biofuels, and where we use solar and wind where appropriate, and have hybrid types of cars, we will not be so beholden to a particular company or companies in the gasoline business. 
   Also we are going to stop funding both sides of the war on terror. 
   We need to talk about the war in Iraq. We will be voting tomorrow on supplemental funding to the President that will keep him on a short leash through September to see exactly where we are going with this war. 
   We have asked for a timeline. The President has rejected. He vetoed it. We have set benchmarks. He doesn't like those; but apparently, based on conversations we have seen in the paper, he may accept benchmarks. We need to see what is happening. 
   We had a briefing today from General Pace and from Secretary Gates and Ambassador Negroponte. The best they could say about what was going on in Iraq, mixed results. With the surge in one part of Baghdad, there was some reduction in casualties in Baghdad, but an explosion of casualties in the suburbs. You push in one place, and it pops out another place. They call it the balloon effect or toothpaste effect, the squeeze effect. 
   We have to make some changes here, and that is what this Congress is about. We will be keeping this President on a short leash. We will be imposing some benchmarks to see if there really is any progress in Iraq. 
   I know we all want to see progress and stability, but that is not what we are seeing on the television or reading in the newspaper. And the American public knows that. They are not being fooled any longer. We are going to change the direction of this war. We cannot continue by paying this kind of money at the gas pump funding both sides of the war on terror. 
   One of the things I am going to talk about tomorrow is the fact that by being in Iraq, we have stretched our military forces to the breaking point, both Active military and our National Guard. The National Guard, 88 percent of the equipment of the National Guard has been deployed to Iraq and hasn't come back. We are coming into a hurricane season. We have forest fires that are plaguing the West and Florida. Is our National Guard prepared to deal with that? 
   Their mission, they have three missions. The first mission is homeland defense, protecting our country against attacks that might happen here, whether it is a 9/11 or some other type of attack. The second is civilian support, helping in the event of another Hurricane Katrina. The third is to be deployed overseas. 
   Now, we know that our National Guard, I don't know if, in fact, in either of your States, but the Colorado Air National Guard is going to be deployed for the third time within the last 3 or 4 years to Iraq, which is stretching their ability to deal with things in Colorado or to assist other State National Guards in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. 
   We as a Congress have an obligation to look after this country and not to continue to pursue things where we are  refereeing a sectarian civil war. Things have to change. 
   I heard our friends on the other side of the aisle in the hour that proceeded us saying we have an obligation to protect and defend the Constitution, and they are absolutely right. And we have an obligation to protect and defend this country. We cannot continue the way we are going in Iraq. So the President wants to stay in Iraq. He vetoed a timeline that establishes a thoughtful redeployment of our troops. But at this point we will let him have, I believe tomorrow's vote will allow him, mostly with Republican votes, to have funding through the end of September. At that point we will see where this surge is going, whether it is better than mixed results. If that is the best you can say about the surge, it is mixed results, that is not very good, and it is time for a change, and we intend to bring a change to this country. 
   We all know that one of the issues in Iraq is oil. 
   We can't forget about that. We need to decrease our dependence on foreign oil so that we don't have to be in a place like Iraq unless it is there for real humanitarian reasons and not there for oil or other purposes.

So we are continuing to make strides so that this place is open and transparent and people really know that we're working for the betterment of the entire country, you know, not a select few, and that's really the change that's going on here. 
   That's why people wanted to see a new direction in this Congress. They wanted to see a new direction in Iraq. They wanted to see a new direction in how we did business within this chamber, and they're getting those very things. 
   I'm proud to be part of the impetus, the catalyst to make those kinds of changes, to make the big change when it comes to energy. We can't wait any longer to change the way we deal with energy in this country, whether it's because we're just continuing to put more and more exhaust into our climate or we want to wean ourselves from foreign oil or we want jobs. 
   I mean as Mr. Braley was saying, we need turbines, we need solar panels. There's construction jobs by the thousands and thousands as we move to a new type of energy for this country, and we're making that change.

   Now, the Republican Congress last year didn't even pass a budget, and this year the Congress sent a budget to the President that balances the budget within 5 years, as opposed to continuing to run deficit and deficit and grow the debt and grow the debt. We will balance this budget within 5 years. Quite a feat.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. One of the things that I think is also important is we have taken steps to be fiscally responsible. We dealt with a budget early on in February. We are dealing with a budget right now. We are dealing with the supplemental emergency request. 
   We are able, in those budgets, to put our fingerprints and our values, our budgets reflect our values, and one of the things, that we had a number of bills that came through here today, some things that are going to happen tomorrow, is back in February, we increased benefits to veterans like hasn't been done in the 77 years of the Veterans Administration, because we recognized the service and the sacrifice that these men and women made for our country. 
   We have increased their benefits; instead of scrimping along and they get the last little bits, we are increasing those benefits. We are working on the military hospitals, the hospitals. We changed the fingerprint. That's a value that we hold. We added money for renewable energy research. That's another value that we hold. We are increasing money for children's health insurance, another value that we hold dear. 
   We have done this within these budgets where Republicans in the prior Congress couldn't even pass a budget. We are showing the values of improving the lives of the people in the middle, not the wealthiest 1 percent, but the hard-working people in the middle and the veterans who so valiantly served our country over the many years. 
   I am just proud to be part of a Congress, part of a class with all of you where we really are changing the direction of this Nation. This is a big ship  that we are steering here. It doesn't change very easily, but in the last 3 or 4 months, we made some major changes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I thank my colleagues from Colorado, Mr. Salazar and Mr. Lamborn, for bringing this legislation to the floor. 
   As we approach Memorial Day, let us remember those who have fallen fighting for our country. And this is one way to recognize our service men's and women's sacrifices, by establishing a new VA cemetery in El Paso County. Although I don't represent that area, it is south of where I live, this is an area of our State that needs a cemetery of this kind. 
   Memorial Day is usually marked by parades, speeches, and the decoration of graves; but for the people of Southern Colorado, this means traveling up to Fort Logan which is in the Denver area. With the passage of this bill, the 150,000 veterans residing in Southern Colorado will have their own VA cemetery to honor and decorate. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, President Bush says he supports our troops, but his actions last week refute those claims, and his actions speak louder than his words. 
   Last Thursday, this House voted overwhelmingly, by 397-27, to support a defense authorization bill that gives our troops a much-deserved 3.5 percent raise, a lot less than the contractors from Halliburton are getting, contractors that the President has farmed out much of the war in Iraq to, but still a 3.5 percent raise.     
   Incredibly, the President has threatened to veto the bill. Two of the reasons he gave for his opposition are the pay raise and benefits to survivors. By threatening to veto this bill, how exactly is our President supporting our troops? Well, he is not. 
   Over the last 5 years, the President has asked much of our military. Extended deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have strained our Active military and National Guard and their families. This Congress overwhelmingly said we should reward our troops. If the President really wants to support our troops, he will sign the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Homeland Security appropriation, and I would just have to say the word ``irony'' has been used by both sides of the aisle quite a bit. I think the irony here is that the Republican side of the aisle is trying to do what they did last year, which is not to pass a budget, not to pass appropriations and try to bring this country to a halt by delaying, delaying, delaying. 
   Well, that's fine and dandy for them to play those kinds of games, but this country expects a change. It voted for a change in direction. It voted for strong national security, which this bill reflects and represents. 
   This bill reflects and represents protection on our borders, protection on our ports. We have additions to FEMA so that we have protection and response to natural disasters. Instead, our friends would like to stall and hold this Chamber hostage because they can't get the pork they want. They want their pork, and they want to eat it too. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is wrong. This stalling tactic has got to stop. This Nation deserves much better than what we are seeing from the Republican side of the aisle. 
   They would like us to ignore the fact that billions of dollars are missing in Iraq under their administration and under their leadership. They would like us to forget the fact that there were sweetheart deals to Halliburton and to many others where there was no bid and no contracts. 
   They would like the country to forget history, which has brought this  country into the biggest debt that we have ever seen. They would rather talk about earmarks, which they really mean to be pork, because they aren't going to get their pork. They aren't going to get their bridge to nowhere because we are not going to let them have that. We will fight for the American people every day, as long as it takes. 
   We are here because of guys like Jack Abramoff, Duke Cunningham, Bob Ney, Mark Foley. Those are the individuals that helped create a Democratic majority because people were tired of it, and they wanted a change in direction. 
   We're going to change the focus of this Congress and this Nation from what the Republicans did, which was the wealthiest 1 percent to the hardworking people in the middle. We passed a minimum wage law. We passed bills out of here to reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare part D. We are focused, ladies and gentlemen, under this bill on the national security of the United States of America. 
   Instead, our friends on the other side are focused on pork and their bridges to nowhere. 
   This is a travesty; this is a delaying tactic. This is not in the interests of the United States of America. I support this bill and ask for an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. And I thank my friend from Florida. This is a place where the Democrats and Republicans have come together to look after kids from hardworking families across this country. This is not something that is just given out, and it doesn't make any fiscal sense or anything else. This is for people coming from hardworking families where the kids don't have insurance. And instead of going to the doctors, which is the most fiscally prudent way for a kid to be treated, they have to go to the emergency room, and at the emergency room, then, we, the taxpayers, pick up the bill. It's the most expensive form of medical care we could have. So it makes utter sense that we provide insurance to 10 million kids across this country from hardworking families so that they don't have to go to the emergency room, so they can go to their doctor, get proper treatment. But that just doesn't seem to be acceptable to the President of the United States. 
   Here we are wanting to bring change. We promised our constituents that we were going to change the way this Nation's being run, and one of those places is providing insurance in a prudent fashion for kids from hardworking families. But we have a President who wants the status quo, does not want to assist the hardworking people in the middle, and those are the folks that make up my district. It's not a rich district. It's not poor. Financially, it's right down the middle and people are struggling. And one of the first things to go when you're putting food on the table is insurance. And we want to make sure that 10 million kids have that insurance in this country. We passed it once; we passed it twice. This President says he's going to veto it again. He's about the status quo. He calls himself prudent fiscally, a fiscal conservative. Just the opposite, ladies and gentlemen, just the opposite. 
   So my friends, you know, we came here to change the direction of this Nation. We passed a stem cell bill which would have provided relief to millions of people across this country or hope for them who have debilitating diseases. We passed the SCHIP bill for 10 million kids. 
   But this President, he doesn't want change. He wants things as usual. He wants Washington to run as usual. We are going to keep knocking on his door until we change the direction of this Nation. And I'm happy to be part of a class that is going to fight every day to do the right thing for our constituents and for the future of this Nation. 
   And with that, I'll yield back to my friends from Florida or Minnesota or New Hampshire, although he's not my friend, because I lost a bet on the Boston Red Sox game. But I would yield back to my friends.

<DOCNO>Mr. PERLMUTTER. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. Rahall, for bringing this bill to the floor, building this bill and spending a lot of time over the last 2 months to bring a compromise piece of legislation. And I want to focus first of all on the part of the bill that Mrs. Biggert was talking about, which is the Green Resources for Energy Efficient Neighborhoods (Green Act), which is a bipartisan section of this bill designed to make housing, commercial and industrial properties more energy efficient. 
   Now, how anybody on your side of the aisle could complain about energy efficiency is way beyond me because a barrel of oil saved is a barrel of oil earned, a Btu saved is a Btu earned, and how anybody could complain about that section of the bill, which Mrs. Biggert didn't, is beyond belief. She is a cosponsor of the Green Act out of Financial Services. But it creates a green mortgage market, it upgrades 50,000 units of HUD to energy efficient standards. We've seen and heard in our committee that HUD's utility costs have gone from $3.5 billion 4 years ago to $4.6 billion this year. We need to come up with different ways to power our country and be more efficient in how we do that. So there are all sorts of energy efficient measures that are a bipartisan portion of this bill. 
   But my friends on the Republican side of the aisle want to come up with the same old complaints, the same old arguments, the same old answers and the same old results. And it's all about oil. The problem is if we're addicted to one commodity, one fuel that is controlled by eight countries and five oil companies, we're going to have these problems all the time. 
   And I would like to say that our friends had the opportunity several years ago to come up with their energy bill. And the Majority Leader at that time, John Boehner, said the GOP energy bill would bring down prices. He said, ``So what is being done to bring gas prices down? The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a balanced bipartisan bill that will ultimately lower energy prices for consumers and spur our economy.'' (8/19/05). 
   It couldn't be farther from the truth. Gas prices have just gone up, so we've got to have a comprehensive approach. It can't just be about oil, although this bill does expand domestic production by a lot.

   This is a comprehensive bill that includes coal, includes renewables, includes energy efficiency, includes domestic production. This is the kind of thing that we need to break ourselves from the dependence upon oil from foreign countries. But with two oil men in the White House, what would you expect about gas prices? Gas prices are going straight up, and that is just what the Grand Old Party wants.

   My friends on the other side have been complaining for weeks that we don't have a comprehensive energy bill. We've passed bill after bill really designed to focus on new ways to power America. We can't be hooked on just one commodity anymore. We're hooked on oil. We are beholden to eight countries, most of which don't like us, and five oil companies. So we're always sort of at risk, and we've seen that this year with the price going straight up. 
   So we've got a bill that talks about energy efficiency, renewable energy, and incorporates domestic drilling all over the place, quite frankly, coal, a whole variety of things. 
   It's going to take our coming across the board with new policies with respect to energy to break our dependence on foreign oil. That's what this bill does. 
   And I always say, is it any wonder with two oilmen in the White House that the price of oil went straight through the roof?

This past Saturday, Madam Speaker, I was at one of my daughter's swim-and-dive meets in Arvada, Colorado, and a woman whose kids have gone to school with mine approached me and she thanked me for the action that we are taking reducing interest rates on student loans. She told me that one of her kids is in college now, and she has another one that will be going in a couple of years. She is a single mom, and her kids have done well in school, but the cost of college has become prohibitive for their entire family. She said her kids have been excellent students, but she was fearful they could not get into college and be able to pay for it. She was very happy we were taking these steps to reduce the interest rate on student loans. 
   She thanked me for the actions we have taken during these first 100 hours of this Congress to change the direction of this Nation and to change the focus and the cost of higher education for the millions of hardworking Americans in this country who want to send their kids to college just as she does.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, while years of deregulation policies have caused the biggest financial crisis in decades, Senator McCain is touting himself as the greatest deregulator. 
   The Senator has called government regulations unnecessary and burdensome, and has said they should be eliminated. Now he wants to extend his deregulation agenda to the health insurance industry, writing in an opinion op-ed this month, that, ``Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of State-based regulation.'' 
   For 8 years now, the Bush administration has turned a blind eye to all the trading, lending and borrowing that is now responsible for the Wall Street crisis.  
   Senator McCain now wants to extend that same strategy to the health insurance industry? Our Nation's health care system has enough problems, and we don't need to exacerbate them by implementing Senator McCain's dangerous new deregulation idea.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two members of one of my Colorado offices, Hannah Warfield and Jenny Barringer. These two are world-class athletes from my alma mater, the University of Colorado. They recently competed in the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in Eugene, Oregon; and in Jenny's case, the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. 
   I want to start off by saying a few words about Hannah, a native of Sydney, Montana, who competed in the women's javelin competition. Her work ethic is extraordinary; and despite the rigors of working a full-time job and recently graduating from the University of Colorado, she maintains a training schedule which begins at 5 a.m. in the morning and would humble even the most dedicated among us. 
   This work ethic propelled her to become the 2007 NCAA Women's Big 12 Champion in the javelin event, a distinction not achieved by a University of Colorado athlete in 20 years. 
   She is one of the most pleasant, organized and courteous individuals I have ever had the opportunity to meet. And although Hannah came just short of making it to Beijing, words cannot express the amount of pride and inspiration she brought to our office and our community with her dedication to the pursuit of her dreams. Hannah's positive attitude and tenacity should serve as an inspiration to all of us. 
   Next, I would like to take to moment to speak about Jenny Barringer from Oviedo, Florida, who competed in the women's 3,000 meter steeplechase event. Jenny is a true pioneer in the sport which made its inaugural appearance at the 2008 games. 
   Prior to the Olympics, she shattered the American record in the women's steeplechase with a time of 9:22:73. If that were not enough, she maintains a 3.7 GPA, serves as a sign language interpreter, volunteers with the Ronald McDonald House, Habitat for Humanity, and the local adopt-a-road program. 
   I can attest that Coloradoans watched her with excitement and anticipation as Jenny made her Olympic debut and competed in the Beijing games where she once again made history by breaking her own American record with a time of 9:22:26. This was a 9th place finish in the world. Jenny made our community and Nation proud. 
   But what impresses me most about Hannah and Jenny is that for as great as their athletic ability, they are even better people. Active in their communities, great students, combined with a desire to go above and beyond what is expected, they serve as a positive example of what can be achieved with hard work and a positive attitude. 
   As a father of three young women myself, all of whom are athletes, I can attest Hannah and Jenny represent the pride and hope every parent feels when they drop their own daughters off at an athletic practice. 
   It is an amazing honor to see two of our own in Colorado rise to this level, especially knowing it could not have happened to two better people. Hannah Warfield and Jenny Barringer embody the best our country could hope for in the next generation of Americans, and I am privileged for the opportunity to have come to know these two remarkable individuals.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good evening to my friends from the freshmen class. And I just want to say I listened to my friend from Minnesota as well as my friend from Vermont, and the reason we are here, the reason Mr. Ellison is here, the reason Mr. Welch is here, Mr. Klein is here, Mr. Hodes is here is because this Nation wanted checks and balances, and checks and balances means accountability. 
   There has been no accountability in Washington for the last 6 years; and as a result, we have had a variety of problems that have continued to arise again and again and again and again. And we can start with the no-bid contracts in Iraq, and the fact that there is some $10 billion that has evaporated into the ether. That is the kind of thing that we have to stop, and that is the kind of thing that the people of America voted to bring a Democratic Congress into being so that there were checks and balances to these no-bid contracts; checks and balances to a loss, a complete loss, of $10 billion, the whereabouts of which we are going to try to find, as the Congress of the United States of America is supposed to do, so that we act as a counterbalance to the executive branch. We aren't just here as a rubber stamp. 
   So start with Iraq. Let us talk about Katrina and the response that was just a horrible failure by this administration to a massive disaster in the United States of America, and the response after the disaster occurred has also been a disaster. As a member of the Financial Services Committee, it is clear that now we are 19 months after the hurricane which basically decimated New Orleans and many cities along the gulf coast, and yet we have not reconstructed, renovated, rebuilt much of the housing that was completely obliterated in that storm. So not only was the initial response a poor one, but after that the response has been very minimal and has to be improved. That is what checks and balances are about. 
   Checks and balances are when an administration, for whatever reason, releases the name of a CIA agent to punish her, to punish her husband, to whatever. It is completely wrong and needs to be stopped. And that is why people expect accountability in our government and they like checks and balances. 
   We have had revelations, Mr. Klein, over the past 2 or 3 weeks as to some of the conditions, particularly at Walter Reed but other veteran hospitals. Again, checks and balances and accountability would rein in excesses or neglect, one or the other. We have seen far too much of it. And we, as part of this freshmen class, are bringing those checks and balances back. 
   Now, obviously the other side doesn't like it. My friends on the Republican side, today they have been complaining with no end as to the approach we are taking to bring benchmarks to this war in Iraq. And they are complaining and complaining and complaining. But, finally, there are going to be checks and balances on this President and the way he has conducted the war in Iraq. 
   We are supporting our troops. We are supporting the veterans, and we are bringing conditions and accountability to the administration and accountability to the Iraqi people, as it is time for them to pick up what we have been carrying now for the last 4 years. 
   The American people understand checks and balances. They were tired of one-party government that led to excesses and neglect. We are here to provide accountability. That is exactly what we are doing. The administration doesn't like it. My friends across the aisle don't like it. But that is what the people sent us here to do, and that is precisely what we are doing. 
   And with that, Mr. Klein, my friend from Florida, I would like to yield back to you or to any of our other friends who are on the floor with us tonight to talk about why we are here.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I do have a point that I want to make. The power of the Federal Government is awesome, and if anybody is on the receiving end of the power of the Federal Government, you have a tough hill to climb. So the reason the people expect their U.S. attorneys and their government to operate in truth and honesty and in justice is because that power is so great, and when it is abused, the trust of the people goes right out the door, and without the trust of the people, we don't have much of a government here. 
   The people, in their unbelievable wisdom, maybe that is a little over the top, but the people in their wisdom chose to elect a Democratic Congress and a Democratic Senate because they know checks and balances can stop that kind of abuse. And we are seeing it now. 
   It is a shame that we see that U.S. attorneys, who could have been fired for any reason except for reasons that might ultimately be unethical, were being let go and were being threatened. That is just wrong, because the administration wanted to see the power of the Federal Government come down on somebody they didn't like.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I think I was elected to bring change to this Nation, a new direction to the Nation and positive things to this Nation, whether it is energy independence or assist with a whole variety of things concerning change in the direction in Iraq. I did not come looking to go on a witch hunt and to continue to do that. 
   The people obviously wanted checks and balances. They wanted oversight and accountability. Something like Walter Reed or something like we have just had with the Justice Department, those are things that just appeared now. These are not us going back and trying to dredge up old issues. These are things that have happened because of the neglect of the administration. These are things that appear, and we need to deal with them now. 
   I think the question is judgment. Before there wasn't good judgment. There wasn't oversight. There wasn't accountability. There weren't checks and balances. The people expect this from its Congress and from its Senate with respect to the White House. 
   Walter Reed is a shame. It is a shame. It is supposed to be one of our finest medical institutions anywhere in America or the world. It is there for our bravest men and women who have served us valiantly and have been harmed and hurt in a variety of ways, psychologically, physically, and we need to make sure that a place like  Walter Reed really does provide the care and the service and the best quality of medical services that we can provide, and not what has occurred. 
   The Congress today is something that gives Americans a chance for accountability, gives us a chance to deal with this administration on a straight-up basis, and the fact we are here, we are going to see improvements, just the fact that we are here, because it isn't just a rubber stamp anymore. There really is oversight.

   This Veterans Day, the Democratic-led Congress is working to honor our troops, military families, and veterans with quality-health care. 
   Today, the House will give final approval to a veterans funding bill that provides the largest increase for veterans in the 77-year history of the VA, and I hear our friends on the other side of the aisle complaining that that's 8 weeks overdue. Well, they had 12 years to do this and they chose not to. 
   Over the last decade, while the number of veterans has doubled, our Nation's investment in their health care needs has simply not been enough. Unlike the President, this new Democratic Congress vowed to fulfill our promise to our veterans; and, today, we will pass a final veterans funding bill that has been endorsed by all major veterans groups. 
   This new Democratic Congress has also made major strides in addressing the military health care crisis and the inadequacies of the disability system brought to light by the Walter Reed scandal. 
   Madam Speaker, as Veterans Day approaches, our Nation's veterans and military families should know that the promises that have been made to them will be fulfilled.

   First, explore the 68 million acres that are under lease to the oil companies today. Let's extract the oil that we have under lease and not go explore ANWR or the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Two, eliminate the gouging and the hoarding and the speculating that is going on that is increasing the price of oil per barrel by $60 or $70 per barrel. 
   The third E, encourage alternatives. We can no longer be hooked on just one commodity. We have to have other approaches and other ways to power this Nation or we will have to learn this lesson over and over and over again. That is what the Democratic Congress is doing--exploring what we have, eliminating the gouging and encouraging alternatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I want to thank Congresswoman DeGette and Congressman Castle for bringing this bill before the House. It is something for me that is personal. I have a child with epilepsy. 
   Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, this bill holds out promise for millions and millions of people across the country, whether they have Alzheimer's or diabetes or Parkinson's or Huntington's or someone who has epilepsy. It is something that we need to allow science to move forward on. It is this kind of promise, this kind of opportunity, and it is my job, I believe, as a Congressman, and it is this House's job, to improve people's lives. This has been done in so many laboratories, but now is being hampered. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman DeGette and Congressman Castle for the way they have managed this particular bill. I want to thank the House for the way it has been civil and respectful of both sides of the aisle on both sides of the issue. 
   This is one where there are firm convictions on either side. But for someone like me, who has a child with epilepsy, where there is hope, there is promise for her, that she can get better from this disease, this is something we need to pass, we must pass. 
   This is a pro-life bill, as one of my colleagues said earlier, and I urge the passage of this bill. I ask all of our colleagues to support this bill, and I hope that the President, Mr. Speaker, will take a second look at this and will certify and support this bill and not veto it as he has in the past.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, my position is similar to that of the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
   I had the opportunity the last 2 days to be down in the gulf coast, to be in New Orleans today, and quite frankly, Mr. Jefferson is entitled to a presumption of innocence. That is the way of our judicial system and our code in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, first, I rise in support of this resolution. An investigation needs to be conducted. We need to have the Ethics Committee take a look at this. 
   But I would also suggest to this House that when someone, anyone, is under indictment, it's a difficult position for him to do justice to himself or herself and to also do justice for their particular district, and those concerns were raised by people in New Orleans today, as well as in the newspaper. 
   So, as with Mr. Carney, I would suggest that the Ethics Committee take a good long look at this, that Mr. Jefferson obviously is going to take a good long look. I would suggest that he do justice to himself, prepare his defense, and that his district have someone else.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I just want to thank you and the committee for bringing a very focused piece of legislation to the House floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, to my friends from Texas, who have heard stories that this is a bailout, this is no bailout. This is about Strasbourg, Colorado, where there have been foreclosures around a neighborhood, and one person trying to sell their property can no longer do that because the value of their house is less than their mortgage. They are innocent. They didn't deserve this. 
   Secondly in Edgewater, Colorado, where the lender, the appraiser and the building owner got into cahoots, and a young couple buys a condominium, and now the properties around them are foreclosed. They are going to lose this property. They need assistance. They are innocent. They deserve some help from this government. 
   Same thing in Commerce City, Colorado. I heard all of these stories last night on a telephone town hall meeting while we were debating the Neighborhood Stabilization Act. That's what this bill is about. It's about the community as a whole. 
   Mr. Marshall from Georgia understands what this bill is about. It's about looking after our neighborhoods and protecting our neighborhoods and averting 500,000 foreclosures across this country. 
   Our neighborhoods, our cities, our towns are going to pay for this if the Federal Government doesn't assist in some fashion. This is a nationwide problem. The Nation has to stand up. We have to deal with this. This bill does it in so many ways, and I just appreciated coming to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. If the gentleman would yield, I thank my friend from Florida for yielding, because as to the very point you just raised, until March 27, 2003, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said this. You were talking about Iraq paying for its own reconstruction and the costs attendant to this war, which is running us anywhere between $2.5 and $3 billion a week, which we could use in any myriad of ways. 
   He said back on that date, ``There is a lot of money to pay for this that doesn't have to be U.S. taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the Iraqi people. We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.'' And Don Rumsfeld said that ``relatively soon'' could be 6 days, 6 weeks, he doubted 6 months. 
   Well, we have been there now more than 5 years, longer than it took for us to win World War II. And what we have, and I would like to point out the chart that is next to me, is we have a problem that has been created by the Bush administration, and Senator McCain would like to perpetuate. 
   So we have the Bush-McCain policies, the Bush-McCain policies being let's stay in Iraq. They don't have to pay for anything. Senator McCain said it might have to be 100 years. And at the same time, cutting our revenues to this government, so we run up the highest deficits on record. Under Ronald Reagan, under the first George Bush, we had big deficits, a surplus under Bill Clinton and the fiscal policies of the Democrats, and then a gigantic deficit under George Bush II. 
   What we need, ladies and gentlemen, what I say to my friends, both the Democrats and to the Republicans, is we have to have a change. We cannot have these same old, tired policies. If we have the same old, tired policies with respect to our foreign affairs, such as we are not going to charge the Iraqis for their reconstruction or we are never going to let them take their own destiny into their hands, we are going to have these same old costs and same old losses of life to Americans who have been in Iraq now for more than 5 years. 
   If we have the same old economic policies, which is what Senator McCain would like to have, it is just more Bush-McCain policies. We are going to run the deficit to levels we have never seen before, which then have resulted in foreclosures and a whole variety of things, foreclosures, job losses, et cetera. 
   We have to have a change. That change will come in this election on November 4th. We started this change in 2006 with the election of a Democratic Congress. We have been able to provide minimum wage increases to people. We have changed, for instance, the cost of student loans, so that more people can take advantage of our higher education system. Democrats took on the pharmaceuticals, so that more people can have lower priced pharmaceuticals. We have increased veterans benefits more in the last year than at any other time in the 70-plus year history of the Veterans Administration. This has happened under Democrats. 
   It is not the same old, failed policies that the Bush administration has had for the last 8 years or that the McCain campaign wants to perpetuate. We need a change, and that change will come with the election of a new President, and that President is going to be Senator Barack Obama, and it is going to continue by the Democrats maintaining a majority in this House. We cannot have more of the same. 
   There is real opportunity out there for this country. And we heard a little bit today from the Republicans about drill here, drill now. They want to go with the same old, tired energy policy, which just is only oil and gas and just drilling here and drilling now. I don't know exactly what they mean by drill here and drill now. 
   We had a very interesting story about an ethics scandal within the Interior Department, where some members of the Bush administration's Interior Department, who are supposed to be the watchdogs over the oil and gas companies who are supposed to pay royalties to this country for all of the minerals that they extract from the country. It said, ``Investigators from the Interior Department's Inspector General's Office,'' this is in the Washington Post today, it said, ``More than a dozen employees, including the former director of the Oil Royalty Program, accepted gifts, including ski trips, sports tickets and golf outings.'' The report alleges that the former director netted more than $30,000. 
   There was also the fact, they said, ``the government officials accepted lavish gifts, steered contracts to favored firms, and engaged in illicit sex with employees of the oil companies, Federal investigators reported today.'' 
   So that is the same old thing. We are so hooked on just one commodity, which is oil, which obviously is going to be part of our energy package no matter what. We are going to drill. We are drilling. We are trying to extract this. But we have to have a comprehensive energy plan, which is what the Democrats are proposing and we will propose within the next couple of  weeks, which includes renewable energy, it includes coal, it includes energy efficiency. 
   Those are the kinds of things that will provide thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs in Colorado and in the manufacturing areas of Ohio. That is the kind of forward looking, innovative approach that we have to take. That is what Barack Obama is going to do. We are not going to have the same old, tired policies exemplified by the Bush administration that John McCain wants to keep going.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. In your litany of things where they made promises, made promises, made promises, none of them turned out to be accurate or true. 
   One of them that just still boggles my mind is, just a few weeks after the invasion into Iraq, George Bush was on that aircraft carrier, saying, ``Mission accomplished.'' John McCain was saying, ``Mission accomplished.'' All of these guys were saying, ``Mission accomplished.'' We are now 5-years plus since that time. 
   Now, our men and our women have been doing an unbelievable job. Initially, their equipment was not proper. Their vehicles weren't built in a way that was safe. We've changed that. We've helped them because they've done a job that has been above and beyond the call of duty, but it's the Commander in Chief and the judgment of the Commander in Chief who is in place today that we have to question, his judgment and the judgment of whom we want to be Commander in Chief. 
   Who has the right judgment? Who can really take our reputation from what's now down in the gutter internationally and raise it back up? Who has the judgment to get this country working again? Who has the judgment and the energy and the ability to renew the strength of this country, to call on all of us to make the sacrifices and to meet the challenges that we've got ahead of us that we know will lead us back to the great Nation that we are and to the great people that we are? 
   It's not the same old administration. It's not the same old people. It's not the Karl Roves of the world. We're going to have to finish this change because we can do much better than we've done. 
   So, with that, I'll yield to my friend from Wisconsin.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank my friend from Wisconsin. I'm going to take a step back from the health care, talk about the GSEs, the Government Sponsored Entities, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which were, in effect, taken over, placed into conservatorship. 
   And sometimes I charge my friends on the Republican side of the aisle with not doing what needed to be done. But in this instance they did, back in 2005, pass legislation that would have prevented, or at least somehow dealt with these GSE problems, this takeover that we had to have in the last few days. 
   And it was Mr. Oxley who was the chairman of the committee at the time. There was a piece of legislation passed. He was an Ohio Republican who headed the House Financial Services, this is from the Financial Times of yesterday, until his retirement at the mid term elections last year. Blames the mess, meaning the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, on ideologues within the White House, as well as Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve. He says, he fumes about the criticism of his House colleagues. All the hand wringing and bed wetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. He continues, ``What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute.'' 
   He finishes, ``We missed a golden opportunity, we, being the United States of America missed a golden opportunity that would have avoided a lot of problems we're facing now if we hadn't had such a firm ideological position at the White House and the Treasury and the FED.'' 
   We now have had to take over these entities that have supplied money to help us all buy houses for decades and decades and decades, and it's as a result of a White House that didn't believe in any kind of regulation. We talked about it just a few minutes ago, with these guys over at the Minerals  Management Service and the frat house that they ran where they were getting gifts and they were getting sexual favors and all of that kind of stuff. 
   This administration could have cared less about regulation, and this country has been damaged because of it. We can't have these same old policies anymore, ladies and gentlemen. We can't afford it. This country can't afford it. We're too great a Nation. We're too great a people. Our neighbors, our friends, our families sacrifice too much to have this kind of approach by people, whether it's not regulating big government entities or sleeping with the people you're supposed to regulate. We can't have that anymore. We can't have more of the same. 
   We need a change. We need a new direction. That new direction is going to be Barack Obama, it's going to be the Democrats. We've got to finish the change that was begun in 2006 with the election of a new White House with new policies that are going to renew this Nation. And we can do that. And I know that, by all of us working together, there really is hope for this Nation, and we're going to take the action that brings about jobs and health care and, really, a return to what we know is great about this Nation.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, you can put lipstick on the failed Bush-McCain policies, but they are still the same old Bush-McCain policies. And those Bush-McCain policies have led our Nation into a recession. Americans need a new direction and a change. 
   Since taking control of Congress last year, congressional Democrats have been working to rebuild the Bush-McCain economy and help families struggling to make ends meet. We started by enacting the first increase in the Federal minimum wage in almost a decade, directly helping an estimated 5.3 million Americans and setting a new wage floor for another 7.2 million lower wage workers. When it's fully phased in, the pay raise will place an additional $4,400 in the paychecks of these workers. This year we extended assistance to unemployed workers who are having a difficult time finding a job in a Bush-McCain economy that is simply not producing jobs. Now we are preparing to introduce a new economic package that will invest in America and create new jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress cannot afford to wait to jump-start this economy. We must act this month.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the gentleman from Arizona for allotting me this time. I just want to bring us back to basics, for one thing. Whether it's the Kiwanis or the Cub Scouts or the PTA, ordinarily you talk about the issue that is at hand. And the issue that is at hand, ladies and gentlemen, and to my friends on the other side of the aisle, is we are talking about the Missisquoi and the Trout Rivers, the Wild and Scenic Rivers. 
   I want to thank my friend, Mr. Welch, for bringing this matter before the House of Representatives as to trying to maintain wild and scenic streams in Vermont. That is what is being debated. That is the bill on the floor, although our friends would like to completely change the subject. 
   Whether it's the Kiwanis or the PTA or the boardroom or the Cub Scouts, you try to have a relevant conversation. But they decided that is not the issue. They must love this bill. They would rather talk about something else. So let's talk about the something else, which is energy. 
   Now my friends on the other side of the aisle, the GOP, the Republicans, in 2005 passed what they said was a landmark energy bill. I want to quote the former Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, on July 28, 2005: 
   ``Americans need this (GOP energy) legislation to lower their energy costs, to drive economic growth and job creation, and to promote greater energy independence.'' 
   The minority whip, Mr. Blunt, said on that same day: 
   ``This (GOP energy) plan relies on simple economics. If we create a larger market for a greater amount of gasoline, we'll help drive prices down. This proposal moves the country one step closer to lowering the sky-high price of gas for consumers.'' 
   The President, a few days later, said, ``I am confident that one day Americans will look back on this (GOP energy) plan as a vital step toward a more secure and more prosperous Nation that is less dependent on foreign sources of energy.'' 
   Well, ladies and gentlemen, that energy plan that was promoted by the Republicans and supported by the President back in 2005 I think now turns out to be a really bad joke on the American people. We have had our prices of oil and gas going up by almost double, sometimes during this summer they almost tripled after that plan was implemented by a Republican Congress and a Republican President. 
   But that shouldn't surprise us. With two oilmen in the White House, what did you expect? This is exactly what we have gotten. Skyrocketing energy prices. 
   Now what we have got to do, and I can't believe that my friend from Utah, when he says that what we need to be doing is drilling here, and drilling now, really wants to drill in the middle of Salt Lake City or in any of the glorious places in Utah. This is something where it has got to be sensible energy policy. It's a comprehensive energy policy, which includes oil and gas.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I would like to say something to the gentlelady from Illinois. The Affordable Housing Fund has specific and definite parameters as to how it is derived and how it is built. So I am not sure what she is saying is there is no certainty attached to it. 
   And the other thing is this is a classic tail wagging the dog argument. My friends on the other side, here we have, as Mr. Bachus aptly pointed out, an entity. And it is a government entity, these GSEs with trillions of dollars of assets. And what we are talking about here is $500 million of affordable housing passing from one government entity to potentially another. It is less than one one-thousandth of the overall asset base of the particular GSEs, and less than 10 or 13 percent of the several billion dollars misstatement in accounting, which is what we are really trying to get to in this bill. 
   These entities could not account for their funds properly. They need more oversight. And I find my friends on the other side disregarding the purpose of this bill, which is the oversight to rail against the affordable housing for people in low and very low income situations from profits that are generated by a government entity. 
   They are saying that is wrong, that is socialism.

This is one of the most important pieces of economic legislation we have had in decades.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and also the gentlewoman for her kind remarks concerning this day of tragedy in Colorado. We have had a couple of those, Columbine, 9 years ago this week, as well as this tragedy that occurred on December 9. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness and regret that I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the victims and families of the tragic acts of violence that occurred on December 9 at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs and on the Faith Bible Chapel campus in Arvada, Colorado, with this resolution. 
   The senseless acts of violence partially took place in my district at the Youth With A Mission, YWAM, in the heart of Jefferson County in a community still reeling from the tragic events of Columbine several years ago. 
   The Faith Bible Chapel campus is about a block from where my father-in-law lives. It is a place I drive by almost every weekend when I am home. And it is a place in the late hours of December 8 and the early hours of December 9, a reverse 911 call had to go out to the entire neighborhood to advise them of the killings that had gone on so nearby. 
   All four young men and women lost their lives before the psychotic young gunman turned the gun on himself. This resolution seeks to honor the memory of these individuals: Tiffany Johnson, who was 26 years old; Philip Crouse, 24; Stephanie Works and Rachel Works who I believe were nieces of a friend of mine, John Works, who was a candidate several years ago for the 7th Congressional District of Colorado, which is the seat that I now hold. 
   This bill also seeks to recognize the survivors and the families victimized, and in particular, Dan Griebenow, Charlie Blanch, David Works, Judy Purcell, and Larry Bourbannais who were wounded during this senseless day of killing. 
   It is important to note that this resolution commends the heroism of the local first responders and law enforcement officials in the city of Arvada, Jefferson County, Colorado Springs, and El Paso County who responded quickly and professionally. 
   Especially, Jeanne Assam, a volunteer private security guard, who courageously rushed into harm's way and used her own gun to stop the shooter, thereby saving the lives of several other bystanders. 
   We will never know what was going through the mind of Matthew Murray, the young man who killed these people and wounded several more. We don't know what possessed his mind to take these senseless acts, but we do know that the people who were killed here in this particular incident and the people who were wounded will always stay in our memory and will be honored by this resolution. 
   Our Nation can never adequately come to grips with senseless tragedies like these. Whether it is some kind of care for the perpetrator in this instance from his psychosis, or whether it is additional protections that we might give to our churches and our schools, there are many things that we can do, but it is just a shame that sometimes, we can't understand the demons that possess people and cause them to come up with acts of psychotic violence like we have seen here. 
   It is my hope that this bill sends a message to the victims of these tragic events that they will continue to remain in the thoughts of our Nation, and they will never be forgotten for the events that occurred on December 9. This bill represents one small step in the process of healing for our communities affected by this tragedy. 
   In closing, I wish to thank each of my colleagues in the Colorado delegation, and especially Representative Doug Lamborn, who represents the city of Colorado Springs. I want to thank each of the 51 co-sponsors who join me today in expressing sympathy  to the victims and families of the heartbreaking acts of violence in Colorado Springs and Arvada, Colorado, with this resolution, H. Res. 886. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H. Res. 886.

   But instead, what we've seen in the last 8 years that this administration has pushed and promoted was a greed and gamble, immediate gratification, the theory that I want it now, and I'm not paying for it; my kids or your kids or somebody else is going to pay for it later. 
   To have these tax cuts and prosecute a war immediately turned this country's budget upside down. So you start with that failure. And we've been running behind ever since. 
   Then you forget about the lessons of the past. Now these guys wanted to reverse everything that's happened for the last 70 years, since the thirties. We came through the roaring twenties. We had our Calvin Coolidges, we had our Herbert Hoovers, and we paid dearly during the thirties because we understood at that point that we're going to give up a little bit of the upside so that we don't have the misery of the downside. But those lessons were lost on our friends in the White House. 
   They said, no. Let's not have any kind of regulatory, any kind of constraint on the system.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Debt does matter. And my friend from Pennsylvania was talking about how each of us has to live with the debt that we develop, or our borrowing affects us. It affects this Nation. This Nation has been on a drunken stumble through Wall Street down Main Street. 
   Instead of doing the sacrifice and the thrift, we've been borrowing and spending. And I say we. George Bush, DICK CHENEY and the Republican Congress established this kind of an approach, and it has set our country back so that we are a Third World Nation, borrowing from China, borrowing from the Middle East, borrowing from our friends in Europe. And we really are behind the eight-ball because when they don't loan we have trouble, a la, we've had AIG which we've had to bail out; Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and on down the line. Bear Stearns. 
   We've had a radical regime. We can't have this radical kind of an approach anymore. But John McCain wants to subscribe to what George Bush and DICK CHENEY have been pushing on this country for the last 8 years. This country can't handle that anymore. 
   We have to have a change. And we have to have a future that really looks at new ways to develop our economy and understand that there have to be  some constraints. The free market isn't perfect. It works well, but it isn't perfect because we all have some tendencies that go against those basic principles of sacrifice and thrift and investment and opportunity for all. 
   So what I look forward to, and Barack Obama intends to develop, is a new energy economy. That will put a lot of people back to work, and it'll help us so we aren't hooked on one product and subject to ransom when we go to the gas pumps. 
   We've got a lot of work to do ahead of us because these guys, in 8 years, have turned this country upside down. We can't allow it anymore. 
   We need a change and we need a new direction, and we need it right now. Luckily, we've got an election coming in 40 days or 48 days. And this country can renew itself, can rejuvenate itself. That's the promise of America, thank God. That's the promise for America.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. But that goes to another basic value that they have that just is wrong. They want to focus on the wealthiest 1 percent. They don't care about the 99 percent of hardworking Americans who are affected by this. It's hardworking America that are going to have to pick up the pieces after this administration. And really it's going to take all of us, in concert, together, pulling together, like only Americans can do, to deal with the shambles that we have, whether it's the way people were treated with Katrina, the fact that we have bridges falling down in Minneapolis, I mean, this is a time when we all have to pull together, and we have to look forward. 
   We can't go with the same old policies, the same old approaches of the Grand Old Party. It just doesn't work. We're in a new century, and it is time for some new ideas because we've got to move forward.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I'd just like to make two points. And it is the administration that is choosing who lives and who dies. I mean, this really is about winners and losers, and this administration is choosing Bear Stearns, does not choose Lehman Brothers, chooses Fannie Mae, doesn't choose Merrill Lynch, chooses AIG.     
   It is not a congressional action. These are happening within the administration. They're making these choices. Now, maybe we would agree, but we're not given that chance. They're doing these things overnight. 
   Now, there's a Latin saying, ``Res ipsa loquitur.'' Now, many might say, what the heck does that mean? It means, the thing speaks for itself. 
   What's happened in this Nation with these two guys, these two oilmen in the White House leading the charge, this country has turned upside down. And they may want to spread the blame to whoever. You know, Harry Truman had the old saying, ``The buck stops here.'' Those guys would like to spread the blame. They're the leaders, and they've led us down this path. 
   John McCain wants to follow that Bush path. He's trying to run away from it now, but his votes were with the Bush administration over 90 percent of the time. We have to have a change.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. What I was going to say is we are in a predicament, and there is a crisis of confidence, both domestically as well as around the world, because of so many steps that this administration has taken, whether it's to go into Iraq, whether it's, you know, how we dealt with Katrina, all of this mismanagement and unregulation or nonregulation or anti-regulation of the financial markets. 
   The good news, the good news about our country, the good news about America and Americans is that, with good leadership, we can do anything. Times of crisis are also times of opportunity. With good leadership, we can have this new energy economy, we can innovate, and we can be ingenious, and we can imagine things that will really transform this country and this world. 
   That's the kind of vision that is necessary, and we're not going to see that with the other side. Those are old policies. Those are old answers. That's the old way.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I just think one last comment I'd like to make is that there has been a transfer of wealth the likes of which we've never seen in this country. Whether it's to the big oil companies or to some of the Wall Street firms and to other nations, that has come out of the pockets of middle America. 
   And it is time that we come up with new ways to power this Nation. It is time that we, this country, instead of living on a borrow-and-spend philosophy, which is what has been the Bush administration's approach and is what McCain wants to pursue, that we start remembering the values that made us so strong, of thrift and sacrifice and investment, and opportunity for all, not just a select few at the very top. 
   The focus has been on the top 1 percent. It needs to be on the rest of America. And when it's there, that's when we're strong. That's when we are that shining light at the top of the hill, the beacon at the top of the hill. 
   We are a great Nation, and we have stumbled because of bad leadership over the last 8 years. But come November 4th, things are going to change, and we will have a new direction.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, today we will continue debating a bipartisan resolution that voices this Congress' opposition to the President's troop escalation plan. We are not alone in our opposition to the President's plan. 
   Military leaders have raised concerns since the framework of this plan was announced at the end of last year. Here are a few examples. In testimony before the Senate in November, General John Abizaid, the commander of Central Command said, ``I do not believe that more American troops right now is a solution to the problem.'' 
   Retired General Joseph Hoar stated last month, ``The new strategy reflects the inability of the administration to get it right. The proposed solution to send in more troops will not work. It is far too little and too late.'' 
   Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary of State, Colin Powell, said in December, ``I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, those are all men who have been on the frontlines. They join us in opposing the President's escalation plan.

<DOCNO>Mr. PERLMUTTER. (COMMENDING THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY FOR ITS WORK OF PROMOTING ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR 30 YEARS -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. McNerney, and I want to thank Mr. Hall. All of you are supporting this particular resolution, and it is one that is apropos for our time right now. We need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and the National Renewable Energy Lab, NREL, which is about three blocks from my house, is the leading organization in the world for developing energy efficiency technologies and renewable energy technologies. 
   Today, I rise to honor and commend that laboratory, which is the premier in the country. In 1977 the Solar Energy Research Institute opened and was designated a national laboratory of the Department of Energy. In 1991, President George Bush changed the institute's name to the National Renewable Energy Lab, which I will call NREL. 
   NREL is the principal research laboratory for the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and also provides research expertise for the Office of Science. Changing our energy policy and developing a new direction for energy was and is a high priority for Americans across the country. We must reduce our dependency on foreign oil and we must increase our supply of renewable energy. We cannot afford the status quo any longer. 
   Leadership in the House on both sides of the aisle has shown this understanding for the increase in renewable energy and energy efficiency across the country, and for the first time in a long time this Congress passed a budgetary increase to the Office of Energy Efficiency and to the Office of Science so that NREL can continue its vital and important research and development in these particular areas. 
   NREL has advanced our national energy goals by developing innovative ways to change the way we power our homes and businesses and fuel our cars. They have developed competitions for solar cars and energy efficient homes. In fact, many times the races have ended here in Washington, DC, and we have had on the mall these competitions among our colleges and brightest kids as to how to make our buildings more energy efficient. 
   NREL has worked to develop biomass, solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen, and the list goes on, types of renewable energy, and it has worked on both renewable energy for buildings, as I said, as well as renewable fuels for vehicles. Now more than ever we must seek ways to increase production of renewable energy and make our country more energy efficient, and NREL is helping to do just that. By seeking and creating avenues to develop renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency, we can strengthen our national security, protect our environment, and create thousands and thousands of new jobs. 
   I commend NREL on its work for the past 30 years, and I look forward to their work in the next 30 years. I thank the 1,200 current employees and the past employees who helped make NREL the leader that it is today. I thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from California as well as the Speaker for helping me with this bill and commending this laboratory for the good work that it does.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of my colleagues in the House and the Senate to exercise the courage to begin a true new direction in Iraq. 
   Our brave men and women serving in our military are completing every mission they have been asked; and for that I thank them and America thanks them. But the President keeps moving the goalposts and redefining the mission. 
   Last week, the President announced a potential drawdown of troops from Iraq by July of 2008, leaving approximately 130,000 troops in Iraq. This is no change, and it is unacceptable. 
   The American people will not be fooled by these smoke-and-mirror tactics. The President said the surge was intended to provide time for the Iraqis to make political progress; yet, there has been no political progress and no improvement in the situation in Iraq. The Iraqis have only met 3 of 18 benchmarks for success, all the while they are mired in a religious civil war. 
   Enough is enough. It is time for real change and direction in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the gentleman. 
   Simply put, dirt needs to be turned on the replacement Veterans Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado. This facility is the centerpiece of the VA's capital construction plan under the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services, the CARES project, which began in 1999. 
   Eight years are gone, millions of dollars in additional costs have been incurred, and three VA secretaries later, it is safe to say the time for action for Colorado and the Rocky Mountain veterans is now. They've waited far too long, and our taxpayers will pay far more the longer this project is dragged out. We have to get this project done. 
   It is for these reasons I understand and identify with the frustration many in our veterans' community feel in being shut out of the design process as they continue to see the construction of this important undertaking pushed back year after year. 
   Achieving consensus and moving forward with the construction of this facility has and will continue to be one of my top priorities in Congress. Simply put, it is not fair or right to punish our veterans by the repeated delays resulting each time a new Secretary of Veterans Affairs is appointed. 
   I believe our veterans deserve better than they've been treated through this process, and to quote the Denver Post, ``Changing plans midstream without bringing in the people who would use the facility or those who put their political capital to work to get money for the project is an affront.'' And the editorial concludes with, ``We hope the VA reconsiders its decision and honors the commitment made to veterans in the Colorado region. The long-anticipated standalone facility is sorely needed and further delay is unacceptable.'' And I couldn't agree more. 
   That is why I feel it is vital to provide the funding necessary for the Veterans Administration to move forward with the construction of the central utility substation, the parking garage,  and the surface parking lots of the proposed facility. These are all projects for which money has already been appropriated and is in the bank, and they're ready to go. In all likelihood, this is going to take more than the $20 million that the administration is currently calling for. 
   But with that, I would like to yield to the gentleman to ask if he's willing to continue to work with me to secure the funding required to build a facility our veterans can be proud of as soon as possible.

   I believe we as a Nation cannot thank enough our men and women currently serving in our public education system, such as my sister Cassie, for all that they do. I particularly want to take a moment to recognize the teachers in Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson County, Colorado, who enrich the education of our children and have a positive impact on our communities. 
   We must continue to invest in our public schools and colleges and ensure our educators have the tools and resources they need to give our children the high quality education to succeed in this increasingly competitive economy. Our teachers are dedicated, valuable public servants whom we owe a sincere debt of gratitude.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R. 2262 and the underlying legislation in hopes of reforming the 1872 Mining Law. 
   Chairman Rahall has been working toward this goal for many years, and I have tremendous respect for the expertise and dedication he has brought to this effort. I offer this support, though, with some reservations about the bill. 
   I favor cleaning up abandoned old mines, and we have more than our fair share in Colorado. And we need funding to achieve this worthwhile goal. 
   But I am concerned that generating this revenue by an 8 percent royalty may defeat the purpose of the bill. If mining moves offshore, which some economists tell us could happen, we won't have any mining from which to collect the royalties. 
   And I'm also concerned about the thousands of jobs, of high-paying manufacturing jobs, that are generated by mining. 
   We need to reform this old law. It's way overdue. I reiterate my support for this legislation, which has many, many positive attributes and is a good step towards reforming the law. But let's be sure we don't create one problem while we are solving another. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. Thompson. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act. This bill finally addresses the security of our Nation's rail and mass transit industries, and it has been put together in a bipartisan fashion. 
   The bill includes commonsense provisions that require transportation providers to conduct thorough risk assessment and threat mitigation plans. It also develops security training guidelines for front-line workers who are the eyes and ears on the ground. 
   Finally, it gives over $1 billion in Federal grants for first responder training, for purchasing of emergency response equipment, interoperable communications systems and cargo and passenger screening equipment. These steps identify where we are vulnerable and give the right people the training and equipment to make us less so. 
   I also commend the committee for adopting the two amendments I introduced. 
   The first, which I introduced with the help of Congressman JOHN SALAZAR from Colorado, adds Transportation Technology Center, Inc., in Colorado to the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium so that it can bring its expertise in providing additional security to rail and mass transit systems. As the Nation's premier rail training facility, this will give greater ability to respond to rail disasters. 
   My other amendment is one that I worked on with my friend from California, and it clarifies Department of Homeland Security rules on what crimes constitute security risks for employees during a background check, and it provides a redress process for individuals who feel they were unfairly fired or terminated. 
   Mr. Chairman, the security of America's railroad and public transit systems are too important to ignore any longer. This bipartisan, commonsense bill will drastically improve our security. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Yes, I concur with your description of my amendment. I thank you for the question. 
   First, I would like to thank the committee and my friend from California, because we worked out language that would prevent preemption of Federal, State or local laws for security background checks. 
   Furthermore, these requirements only apply to Department of Homeland Security guidelines. Private employers may conduct subsequent or alternative security background checks, looking for other crimes, based on their employment agreements or other applicable laws. 
   However, if a person is adversely affected by that security check with regard to his or her employment, the employer may not use Homeland Security as the impetus for that adverse decision. 
   This section addresses the concerns brought to our attention at a hearing on the impacts of background checks on the transportation workforce. Additionally, it provides a redress process modeled after the transportation worker identification card program that carefully balances the importance of background checks while protecting the Nation's critical infrastructure.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 7 years of President Bush's economic policies have put a tremendous strain on middle-class families. Since 2001, health care premiums have gone up almost $6,000, college tuition has increased by $2,500, and gas prices have more than doubled. With these increases and paychecks that have, on the average, fallen, it's no wonder that the majority of Americans say their economic situation has not improved in the last 5 years. 
   While the Bush administration is eager to give tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans and assist Wall Street firms like Bear Stearns, it does little to help middle-class families. Madam Speaker, the Democratic House recognizes the immediate need to help middle-class families, and that is why our budget prioritized middle-class tax relief and why we are proposing a second economic stimulus package.

<DOCNO>Mr. PERLMUTTER. (A SERIOUS COURSE CORRECTION NEEDED FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, Senator Lugar, the former chairman and current ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went to the Senate floor and said that the President's troop escalation is not working. Then yesterday Republican Senator Voinovich said the U.S. should begin pulling troops out of Iraq so that people know we are indeed disengaging. But the President and his spokesman said, no, we need more troops and more time. 
   It has been clear for at least a year that a serious course correction is needed in Iraq. But, unfortunately, Republicans in this House of Representatives continue to rubber stamp the Bush administration's war policies. Democrats are changing the course of this misguided war, but with a stubborn President unwilling to face reality, congressional Republicans must break ranks with the President to do what is best for our Nation and for Iraq. 
   It is my hope that the congressional Republicans will seriously listen to their colleagues' comments and conclude, as Democrats already have, that we need to dramatically change our policy in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration with its neocon philosophy either cut back, opposed, ignored or choked off restraints on the markets, especially those of Wall Street, while borrowing billions of dollars from China and Saudi Arabia to finance tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans and while prosecuting the war in Iraq. 
   The borrow-and-spend approach and the party atmosphere cannot go on forever, and the bailouts, takeovers and bankruptcies of the recent weeks demonstrate that the party is over. 
   Bush's Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, is asking Congress for hundreds of billions of dollars to compensate for market excesses and wants the money within a week or two to restore confidence to the financial markets. I will listen to Mr. Paulson and his plea on behalf of the Bush administration about this immediate infusion of cash and the purchase of billions and billions of dollars in bad loans to take the burden of this bad debt out of the markets, but I must say I have my doubts about the foxes guarding the hen house or giving the Bush administration any more authority over anything. Thank goodness we did not privatize Social Security.

   My mother-in-law was born on Molokai, has Filipino Hawaiian and Chinese ancestry and has 14 brothers and sisters spread from Hawaii to the Philippines. And she helped instill in my daughters the heritage and the values of family, hard work, and indomitable spirit. And I feel blessed to have those particular values from the Asian American community instilled in my children. 
   This is a great country. To have that kind of heritage and that kind of ancestry in my family now is what makes this country so great. So I get to celebrate Mother's Day and I get to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle and they ask, what's the Democrats' plan for energy? Well, with two oilmen in the White House, it's obvious what the Republicans' plan has been, and it has been a constant increase in the price of gas since the day George Bush and DICK CHENEY took office. 
   There are 68 million acres under lease for oil production not being used, being hoarded, being kept out of the market. It's a red herring to say we need to drill more. It's available. What we really need to do is get off the addiction to oil. 
   We have learned this lesson before. We don't need to keep learning it. We need to have research and development in new ways to power this Nation. 
   At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, with just tweaking the battery of a Prius, the lab reached 100 miles to the gallon. We can no longer be dependent on the Middle East for oil production. We have to change this Nation and its energy plans. To do so is good for national security, good for the climate and good for jobs. 
   We have to change the direction of this Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PERLMUTTER. (FAIR, ACCURATE, SECURE, AND TIMELY REDRESS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this opportunity to speak on an excellent bill, and I want to commend my friend from New York for bringing this bill to the House of Representatives and bringing it through our committee. 
   So I rise today to express my strong support for the Fair, Accurate, Secure and Timely Redress Act or the FAST Redress Act. 
   At Denver International Airport, the Nation's fourth busiest airport, tens of thousands of passengers go through security each day. For most, the screening process is straightforward and is as efficient a policy as possible. But for some, like the John Thompsons of Colorado, flying is a painful and difficult experience, not because of the items they bring through security or the way they act, but simply because of their name. And they range from 8-year-olds to 80-year-olds. 
   There are thousands of Americans whose names are similar to terrorists listed on the No Fly List. And when travelling, the airlines and TSA do not distinguish these law-abiding Americans from criminals on the list who happen to have the same name. As a result, these citizens may be forced to undergo extensive, time-consuming additional screening and questioning. This happens not just once but every single time the person travels. 
   To avoid it happening on every occasion, they can go through the Department of Homeland Security Travel Redress Inquiry Program to get removed from the list, but that process is slow and ineffective. Furthermore, it doesn't currently address the concern that each airline uses the travel redress program differently. 
   That is why I am a cosponsor of this important legislation. Our Nation's passengers affected by mistaken identity deserve an office within the Department of Homeland Security to help resolve these identity problems once and for all. Our Nation's passengers deserve a comprehensive cleared list to match the No Fly List which is provided to airport security and the airlines to be used in a uniform manner. 
   Our Nation's passengers deserve a Federal plan to verify their identity and make sure they are safe to fly. This bill achieves these goals and makes our flying public safer while keeping commerce going. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman Clarke and Committee Chairman Thompson, as well as Ranking Member Mr. Lungren and Chairwoman Sheila  Jackson-Lee and the other members of the committee for their hard work on this important matter. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PERLMUTTER. (VETERANS' EPILEPSY TREATMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank Mr. Filner for this opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2818, the Veterans' Epilepsy Treatment Act, which establishes a national epilepsy network within the Veterans Affairs health care system. 
   I introduced H.R. 2818 on June 21, 2007, and now, 1 year later, I'm pleased it was reported out of the VA Committee by a voice vote. 
   The measure has the support and sponsorship of 135 Members of Congress. And I want to thank Chairman Filner, Subcommittee Chairman Michaud, Ranking Member Buyer, Mr. Miller from Florida, and their staff for the work they do on behalf of our Nation's veterans and for their work on H.R. 2818. 
   I also want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer for the interest he has taken in this bill, and Rick Palacio from his office. 
   H.R. 2818, the Veterans' Epilepsy Treatment Act, will establish five epilepsy treatment centers called Epilepsy Centers of Excellence which are going to be co-located at the VA polytrauma centers in Palo Alto, Minneapolis, San Antonio, Richmond and Tampa. These centers will care for veterans experiencing seizures, and especially those we predict will develop epilepsy as a result of suffering traumatic brain injury while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a moral obligation to our service men and women who are defending our country overseas to help them when they return home. Our veterans health care system is the best in the world, and H.R. 2818 will make our system even stronger.     
   Today estimates show some 89,000 veterans have epilepsy and 42 percent of that number is service connected. 
   Epilepsy is often defined as two or more seizures, and during Vietnam, a number of men and women returned home with head wounds and head injuries. Of those who came home with these types of injuries, some 53 percent developed epilepsy within 15 years thereafter; 15 percent of those who developed epilepsy did so 5 years or more after their combat injuries. 
   For these service-connected injuries, the relative risk for developing epilepsy is 25 times higher than in the population as a whole. These statistics indicate the number of veterans who will develop epilepsy due to the extended combat in Iraq and Afghanistan is only going to rise. And with the IED injuries that our men and women have suffered, we know that that's going to occur. That is why we need expert clinical and research staff to work together to diagnose, care for, and research the long-term effects of epilepsy. 
   This bill takes those steps by creating a National Epilepsy Program through the establishment of five sophisticated centers for epilepsy care. In addition, each Veterans Integrated Service Network, or VISN, will have an epilepsy referral clinic and the VA's telehealth capacity will be expanded to track the neurological diagnostic tests of our rural veterans. These centers will develop and administer treatments and possibly cures for our veterans, allowing them to live their lives to the fullest. 
   It establishes a National Coordinator For Epilepsy within the VA system, and it will provide educational materials throughout the country to assist people in dealing with epilepsy or those who may come into contact with people with epilepsy. 
   Moreover, the body of knowledge developed through the research conducted by the VA will help our society as a whole. And I will admit to having a child with epilepsy, and, quite frankly, if, in fact, the research that's developed by the VA assists her, I will be very thankful for that on a personal basis. 
   The bill authorizes expenditures of $5 million per year for the years 2009-2013. A small price to diagnose, treat, and research epilepsy for those who have served us so valiantly all around the globe. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2818, the Veterans Epilepsy Treatment Act. I want to thank the Epilepsy Foundation, the Brain Injury Association, the American Academy of Neurology, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Blinded Veterans, and the Vietnam Vets of America for their support of this bill. Again, I want to thank the VA Committee for supporting this bill and voting it out by a voice vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. I thank the chairman. I thank the chairwoman for bringing this bill. And Congresswoman Capito and I are part of this energy efficiency task force. And I know that she has strong feelings toward building in an energy-efficient, sustainable way. We have a big difference of opinion as to property rights on this one. And it's unusual, here in this instance, the Federal Government is the owner and the financer of these projects. It has the right, as any property owner does, as any owner does, to say how it wants its building built. And that's what's done within this proposal, within this bill, and that is to build these units in a green fashion. And so that, I think, is appropriate. It is an appropriate exercise of ownership to say we want these to be green. And the people of the United States of America in this last election said we have to be more energy conscious. We have to figure out a change to how we power this Nation and how we consume energy, and this is where we get started as a Federal Government. 
   Now, one of the things we've talked about is the flexibility within the bill as to the standards to be used. We use the words ``substantially equivalent.'' And if, in fact, HUD or EPA or the Department of Energy is being recalcitrant, isn't following through on developing substantially equivalent standards, you can bet that our side of the aisle will work with you and the various Departments to make sure they get off their fannies and they do develop some substantially equivalent standards so that there is flexibility. 
   This is a good bill. This is a bad amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker and Members of the House, tonight we will hear the President give his State of the Union address, and I expect and I am confident that he will address energy issues. 
   I had a meeting this morning with an Assistant Secretary from the Department of Energy, and I believe that we are going to have a chance to have bipartisan effort, Democrats and Republicans, coming together with the President to deal with energy efficiency, renewable energy, and redeveloping and re-energizing our distribution grid throughout the country. This is going to be good for all of America, no matter what side of the aisle you might be on, because it is good for national security. It is good for the climate, and it is good for jobs across this country. 
   In the Seventh Congressional District of Colorado, which I represent, the suburbs of Denver, we have the preeminent laboratory in America and in the world in the National Renewable  Energy Lab. And with this focus on energy conservation, renewable energy and distributing energy in a way that is reliable, we will make this country more secure. And I am confident that the President is going to focus on it, as will we in the Congress.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good morning. 
   My friends on the Republican side of the aisle are complaining about gas prices, but with two oil men in the White House, is it any wonder that the price per barrel has gone from $30 at the beginning of the Bush administration to $150 or thereabouts.  
   The Republicans have taken the tack that we should drill, drill, drill. That's not the answer. We're not going to drill our way out of this problem. I would say it's the three P's: produce from the 68 million acres that we have under lease and are permitted today, punish the people who have been hoarding, gouging, and speculating in oil futures, and the third is promote efficiency and alternative forms of energy. 
   We've learned this lesson too many times. We need to come up with a new way to power this nation. If we do these three P's, produce from what we've got, punish those people who are gouging us, and third, promote energy efficiency and alternative energy, we will change the direction of this nation. And we need to do it right now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   And to my friends, Mr. Hensarling and Dr. Price from the Financial Services Committee, you raise some legitimate points. But I think three questions have to be asked, and if they're answered in the affirmative, then I think we must go forward and pass this bill. 
   First, do you believe that the domestic auto industry is essential to America, whether it's for jobs or national security? I think the answer is ``yes.'' But that doesn't answer the whole question. 
   The second two questions are, are you throwing good money after bad, or can you restructure these companies so that they can be competitive and succeed going forward? I think the answer is ``yes.'' We've received reorganization/restructuring plans from them that show really an ability to compete and to bring technology that leapfrogs Japanese technologies and other technologies into the future for our companies. So we can restructure these companies. 
   And the third, can we protect the advances, the loans, that are made by the United States to these companies for the next hundred days? And the answer is ``yes.'' And in fact, we've gone about as far as we can go within the bounds of the Constitution and say that such loans shall be senior and prior to all obligations, liabilities, and debts of the automobile manufacturers, and we will take all available security and collateral. 
   So we've done those three things. Is it essential? Yes. Can they be restructured? Yes. Have we secured the taxpayer? Yes. 
   So we are making a loan for 100 days until a reorganization plan is approved by the President's designee. If in fact during that time there is no reorganization plan or one that is not viable, that designee can call the loan. 
   So this is a step for 100 days to protect an industry that is essential to this country. I've thought about this a lot. We have done what we can to limit executive pay, to stop dividends or distributions during the period of the loans. 
   So we are taking steps to protect taxpayers for an industry that is essential to this country, and we will see over the next 100 days whether they can be restructured.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good morning, Mr. Speaker, it is nice to see a Coloradan in the Chair. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 7 years now the Bush administration has done the bidding of big corporate interests. The administration has never supported regulation of big business, and in fact they have eliminated important oversight that is necessary to protect the American consumer. In other instances, agencies have simply turned a blind eye. For a time this benefited big business, but we are now seeing how devastating the failure to enforce the law or regulations can be for both the American people and the American economy. 
   Last month the Bush administration bailed out Bear Stearns out of fear that if the Wall Street giant filed for bankruptcy, many more supposed giants would follow. What the administration refuses to admit is that had it enforced the law and properly regulated Bear Stearns and the other giants for the last 7 years, they never would have been in this predicament in the first place. 
   Mr. Speaker, the administration should be commended for finally recognizing the need to enforce the laws and regulations that are on the books. Unfortunately, it should not have taken a huge economic and housing crisis for them to recognize the importance of government oversight. That is, after all, part of their job.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, it is good to see you in that chair, Mr. Speaker, because you and I, I think, are here because people in this country wanted a new direction. They had had enough. They wanted a change. And they want a new direction in how this country is being run. And if there is a single subject where they want a new direction, it is on Iraq. 
   Now, we have a resolution before us tonight that is a vote of confidence for our troops and a vote of no confidence for our President's policies in Iraq. First and foremost, I want to say that I support our troops and will fight to make sure they have the equipment they need and deserve. What they require on the battlefield they must have. What they need when they come home we must provide. 
   However, our troops are entitled to sound public policy with a realistic mission that strengthens America's national security interests. I am opposed to the President's proposed surge of sending 21,000 additional troops to Iraq. I was opposed to the invasion of Iraq, and I believe that we have taken our eyes off the necessary war in Afghanistan and against terrorism by the costly distraction of nation-building in Iraq. 
   We must be seeking Osama bin Laden. That is where our attention must be focused. But this surge is not a change in direction, but it is more of the same. 
   The President has not listened to the American people. He has not listened to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group or even to our senior officers such as Generals Powell, Abizaid, and Hoar. 
   Now, my opponent and I in this last election debated the issue of a surge. How my opponent knew that there would be a surge, that is beyond me. But he supported the escalation and I opposed it. And I still oppose this surge, because in my opinion it is too little too late. 
   The people of the Seventh Congressional District of Colorado spoke loud and clear. They questioned the President's policies in Iraq. Americans elected a new majority in Congress to act as a check and balance, and not a rubber stamp of the President's policies, especially those in Iraq. 
   It is time to turn over security to the Iraqi people, press forward with diplomatic efforts, create a multinational reconstruction effort and redeploy our troops from Iraq by the spring of 2008, as recommended by the Iraq Study Group. 
   It is time for Iraq to take responsibility for its future. Mr. Speaker, I urge the Congress and all of the Members to vote in favor of the resolution that is before us tonight.

   Mr. PERLMUTTER. Good morning, Madam Speaker. And you know, I have been listening to the complaints by the Republicans about gas prices, but with two oil men in the White House, is it any wonder that oil per barrel has gone from $30 dollars to almost $150 driving gas prices through the roof? The question is, what are we going to do about it? And I would say it's the three E's. 
   The first ``E'' is explore and extract from the 68 million acres that are under lease today in the United States. That's more oil than anything up in Alaska or in ANWR. So let's explore and extract. 
   The second ``E'' is to eliminate the gouging and the speculating and the hoarding that's going on in the marketplace. 
   And the third ``E,'' the most important ``E,'' is encourage alternatives and efficiency. We cannot be hooked to one commodity forever. We've learned our lesson. It's time to pursue alternatives. So this democratic Congress is doing just that, those three E's: exploring, eliminating, and encouraging alternatives.
