<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the temporary Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act law that we enacted in August as a stopgap measure expires on Friday. We passed the RESTORE Act in November to provide some FISA reform. The Senate is at this moment completing the action. This extension will give us time to consider responsible FISA reform in both Houses of the Congress while fully preserving current intelligence capabilities while we do so. I hope that everyone would agree that this is the most responsible approach for protecting our freedom, as well as our security. 
   I further hope that we would all agree that we need to consider FISA reform responsibly, with the care it deserves, and to preserve the prerogatives of the House to have our own voice heard. 
   This extension is not a vote on the temporary law that we have been living under since August of last year, nor is it a vote against the temporary bill or against what the Senate is working on. It is a vote for avoiding a headlong rush into possibly ill-conceived legislation. We should all be able to come together on that, and I am confident that we can. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Last August, a number of Members with whom I agree lamented the fact that we got jammed by the other body and the clock and ended up with a bad law. Here I am again today trying to stop that same thing from happening again. And yet, in what I can call only in kindness misguided perfectionism, there are those here who would come to the floor to criticize this bill, a 15-day extension. Now it is easy to do that; it is harder to get a good law from both of these bodies at the same time, and that's only what this committee is trying to do this afternoon. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise, first, to thank the Members of the House for this very reasonable debate, and I want to thank particularly my colleagues on the other side. Ranking Member Smith has been excellent in helping us work out, as closely as we can with reservations, nothing is perfect, but I appreciate the spirit with which he has come to the floor today. 
   The extension is not a vote for the temporary law that we have been living under since August. It is not a vote against the temporary bill or against what the Senate is working on. It is a vote only to avoid a head-long rush into possibly ill-conceived legislation. And I think we have all been able to come together on that. 
   I'm grateful to our leadership and to the Members on the other side of the aisle for the discussion that brings us here this afternoon.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This agreement with the Senate builds on the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act passed this summer. The ambitious legislation before us today, which includes wide-ranging solutions from 10 House committees, invests in the future of America and puts our nation on a path towards energy independence. It will strengthen national security, lower energy costs, grow our economy, create new jobs, and begin to reduce the threat of global warming. 
   With this legislation, Congress is taking groundbreaking steps to address the crisis of climate change. The bill will increase the efficiency of our vehicles. It makes an historic commitment to American-grown biofuels and requires that 15 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources. The legislation strengthens energy efficiency for a wide range of products, appliances, lighting and buildings. It also repeals tax breaks for big oil companies, and invests that money in clean renewable energy and new American technologies. Not only will these measures reduce our dependence on foreign oil and grow our economy, they will also save consumers billions of dollars. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act includes several provisions that will strengthen our national security by decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. I am particularly pleased about the compromise that was reached on fuel economy standards, raising standards for new cars and trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The bill ensures that this fuel economy standard will be reached, while offering flexibility to automakers and ensuring that we keep American manufacturing jobs and continue domestic production of smaller vehicles. I want to applaud Speaker PELOSI and Chairman DINGELL for reaching an agreement that is supported by both environmentalists and the automobile industry. 
   The legislation before us today also reduces our dependence on foreign oil. The initiative includes a historic commitment to American biofuels that will fuel our cars and trucks. It includes critical environmental safeguards to ensure that the growth of homegrown fuels helps to reduce carbon emissions and does not degrade water or air quality or harm our lands and public health. The plan establishes a plug-in hybrid/electric vehicle tax credit for individuals and encourages the domestic development and production of advanced technology vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. It also includes tax provisions totaling approximately $21 billion--which includes the repeal of about $13 billion in tax subsidies for Big Oil. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act will help lower energy costs by promoting cleaner energy, greater efficiency, and smarter technology. It requires utility companies to generate 15 percent of electricity from renewable sources--such as wind power, biomass, wave, tidal, geothermal and solar--by 2020. The bill includes landmark energy efficiency provisions that will save consumers and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars on energy costs by requiring more energy efficient appliances, such as dishwashers, clothes washers, refrigerators and freezers. It requires improved commercial and federal building energy efficiency and assists consumers in improving the efficiency of their homes. The bill also strengthens and extends existing renewable energy tax credits, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, landfill gas and trash combustion, while creating new incentives for the use and production of renewable energy, as well as supporting research on solar, geothermal, and marine renewable energy. 
   The energy bill will help create new American jobs and reduce the threat of global warming. The landmark fuel efficiency standard, renewable electricity standard and energy efficiency provisions will not only save consumers and businesses money, but will also significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, this package creates an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train a quality workforce for ``green'' collar jobs. These investments in renewable energy could create 3 million green jobs over 10 years. The bill helps small businesses lead the way in renewable energy by increasing loan limits for purchasing energy efficient technologies. It rewards entrepreneurship in the energy sector by increasing investment in small firms developing renewable energy solutions. This initiative also takes aggressive steps on carbon capture and sequestration to come up with a cleaner way to use coal. 
   For too long, our country has lagged behind the rest of the industrialized world in recognizing and taking action to address the climate change crisis. Global warming endangers all of us, but threatens to have the most devastating impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable. Our nation is the richest in the world and one of the largest contributors to global warming, yet, until today, it has not made any substantial efforts towards addressing the problem. I am proud to join with my colleagues as we at long last put America on the path to becoming part of the solution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EMMETT TILL UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. I thank my chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime. 
   Mr. Speaker, today is a very important day. What we're doing is recalling a difficult period in American history to understand the combined climate at that time that coexisted with fear and violence during the civil rights era. And so we have the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. 
   The first thing I want to do is try to recapture, for the moment, all those who were not in the Judiciary Committee the day of the testimony, because it moved both Republicans and Democrats and visitors when we had Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, who was himself a victim of the violence that marked the civil rights era, talking to us about Emmett Till and how this youngster's life was taken. 
   And it was one of those moments in judiciary history that we were all electrified by the ability of our witnesses to recapture this moment in our history.     
   It was a remarkable hearing. I commend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and others, including the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith, and also I lift up the name of Steve King of Iowa. Everybody was moved by this determination that at this point in American history we are now moving forward at a pace that may not always be recognized, faster than we think. And the reason I say that is that we are now going back into history to make the corrections that law enforcement could have and should have made at that earlier time. So it is to me a very powerful determination of the Committee on the Judiciary to bring H.R. 923 to the floor for the expedited action that is required this morning.

There are only a few people left in America today who put their lives on the line knowingly in this struggle for justice, and the one in this body, the 110th Congress, is none other than John Lewis of Georgia, and I yield him as much time as he may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Act of 2008. This bill would establish a temporary program providing extended unemployment benefits in every State to individuals exhausting their regular unemployment compensation. The duration of these extended benefits would equal the lesser of 13 weeks or half the duration of regular unemployment compensation. 
   This bill could not be any timelier. It is no longer debatable as to whether the retraction of the economy is hurting every-day Americans across our nation. Over the first three months of 2008, the U.S. economy lost a total of 232,000 jobs. With the labor market in such a steep decline, more workers face the possibility of layoffs and current unemployment compensation recipients face greater difficulty in becoming reemployed. The total number of unemployed workers has already grown by 1.1 million over the last twelve months. 
   The economic forecast is even worse in my home state of Michigan. While economists worry about the overall health of our economy, as the national unemployment average creeps above 5.5 percent, prospective employees in Michigan face a 7.6-percent unemployment rate--one of the highest state rates in the nation. 
   Luckily, this bill recognizes that the retraction of the economy has hurt some communities more than others. Under this bill, states with high unemployment, like Michigan, would be able to provide an additional 13 weeks of extended benefits. This would give the unemployed a total of 26 weeks of coverage as they transition into new positions.  
   Madam Speaker, we need to help our workers, especially those in who have been hit the hardest by this economic downturn. At the same time, we need to stimulate our economy in the most effective manner possible to prevent the downturn from spiraling into a recession. This bill accomplishes this goal. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a study this past January specifically endorsing the use of extended unemployment benefits as a cost-effective way to boost the economy. 
   We in the Congress need to be both smart and compassionate. Let's help the unemployed while protecting those who currently have employment. Let's stimulate the economy and create new sustainable job opportunities for the American worker. Let's pass H.R. 5749.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of S. 5, the ``Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007.'' This legislation will give hope to 100,000,000 Americans, by greatly expanding scientists' access  to embryonic stem cell lines and will create opportunities for medical and biological scientists to continue further investigation for additional stem cell lines. Moreover, this legislation will impact greatly the future of treatment of serious diseases. 
   During the last decade of research, significant scientific advancements have been made that allow scientists to research genetically stable and long lived human stem cells, by methods that would not destroy or endanger human embryos. The discovery of the new lines of stem cells has greatly enhanced the probability of additional discoveries in various treatment and cures. The support of continued research into this kind of scientific discovery gives great hope to many Americans and others around the world who depend on the scientific advancements that this country has been known for in decades past. 
   It is time that this groundbreaking research moves forward. I optimistically look forward to the many advances that will be made in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (BAIL BOND FAIRNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the Congress, of the House here, the bail bond system in our country is under considerable pressure. Some would even say that it is broken. The reason is that Federal courts increasingly use bail bonds to ensure that a defendant appear in court but it also is used to make sure that a defendant complies with other requirements while awaiting trial.     
   As a result of a combination of these factors, there have been critical problems that have developed. When you merge the use of bail bonds, there is presented a greater risk of forfeiture, and, thereby, this has made it much more difficult, especially for those with limited means to obtain these bonds. Frequently, the amount of the bond goes up, sometimes a great deal. 
   Now, historically, of course, the sole purpose of a bail bond was to ensure that a defendant appears in court. When a bail bond is also used to guarantee compliance with collateral conditions of release, a court may direct the bond to be forfeited should the defendant violate any of these conditions, even if the defendant appears in court. This, of course, heightens the risk of forfeiture and makes it now virtually impossible for many persons to obtain these bonds, because the cost of the bond goes up. 
   Also, merging the traditional purpose of bail bonds with other conditions of release creates a perverse situation where, ironically, there are less incentives for the defendants who violate these conditions to then appear in court. As a result, thousands of defendants are failing to come to court, which increases the expense and effort by Federal law enforcement officers to secure their presence. 
   Also, family members and friends of the defendant, who pledge their homes, put the house up for capital, life savings or other assets, are at greater risk of losing their property as well. So, fewer family members and friends feel that they can afford to take the risk of assisting and procuring a bond. 
   Now, while wealthy defendants can use their own assets for collateral and gain pretrial release, those less-wealthy defendants are incarcerated before trial even when there is little or no risk of flight or threat to the public. Remanding a defendant into pretrial detention when he or she is neither a flight risk nor a danger to society also creates an undue financial burden on our Nation's prison system. 
   It's also highly unfair to an accused who, of course, thus far, has not been convicted yet of anything. So, hence, the Bail Bond Fairness Act. 
   What this measure does is attempt to address the problem by restoring the historical purpose of bail bonds; namely, that they be used solely to ensure the defendant's physical presence before a court. Under this measure, a Federal judge has the authority to declare a bail bond forfeited only under the circumstances of where the defendant actually fails to appear in court as ordered, and not simply because the defendant has violated some collateral condition of release. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this bill and am very pleased to commend the leaders and members of the subcommittee on crime for helping us bring this measure forward in such an expeditious manner. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2286 restores the use of bail bonds to the traditional purpose of ensuring that a defendant appears in court as directed. It removes the risk that a defendant's family and friends will forfeit their homes, savings, or other assets even though the defendant appears, just because of failure to comply with some unrelated collateral condition. And perhaps most importantly, it will increase the appropriate availability of bail bonds to all, not just the wealthy. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the lead sponsors, the gentleman from Illinois, RAHM EMANUEL; the gentleman from New Jersey, RUSH HOLT; the gentleman from California, XAVIER BECERRA; the gentleman from California, MIKE HONDA; and the gentleman from Minnesota, KEITH ELLISON, with more than 50 other cosponsors of this important legislation to protect the right to vote. Obviously there is no more important issue that comes before this Congress than protecting the right to vote. It is the cornerstone right of our democracy. Without it, all other rights and privileges enjoyed by us are in jeopardy. 
   Protecting this right, however, has not been an easy task. Historically, it was not until passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that we began to accord the highest meaning to that right. Less than 40 years later, however, we endured the debacle of the Florida 2000 presidential election.     
   And the problems continue. In the most recent midterm and presidential elections, we learned of numerous incidents in which deceptive practices were used to thwart and frustrate citizens from exercising the right to vote. Some voters were, believe it or not, told to vote on the wrong day. Wednesday is not the right day to vote in congressional or presidential elections. Others were told that they could not vote without paying outstanding parking tickets. Others were told that they would be imprisoned if they voted without paying overdue utility bills. Ultimately, eligible voters were misled, deceived and disenfranchised in a number of other ways. 
   It is our collective intent in the Judiciary Committee to end this practice, and we are here talking about seriously protecting the right to vote. 
   I believe every Member of the House of Representatives cares deeply about this issue, and that is why we must pass the measure under consideration, for this bill explicitly prohibits deceptive practices, provides voters with greater Federal protection and increases the penalty for voter intimidation and misinformation in campaigns. 
   What makes me proud of this measure is that so many of our organizational friends in the voting rights community and the civil rights community as well have joined us in support of this legislation. Among them are the People For the American Way, the very historic Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, the NAACP, the ACLU, the Jewish Council For Public Affairs, and the New York City Bar itself. 
   This is not an entire solution for reforming and improving the election process. Among other things, we also need to reduce our reliance on unverifiable electronic voting machines, which undermine accountability and our citizens' confidence in election results. We also need to ensure a fair allocation of voting machines in polling places, as well as a unified system of educating those who work the polls as to the rules and procedures. We should make election day a national holiday, so no one has to choose between their responsibilities as citizens and their responsibilities to their employers. 
   But this legislation is an important step and one that we should take today. Let's face it: If we allow the infrastructure of our democracy to remain frazzled and to decay, our citizens will rightly lose confidence in the legitimacy of the voting process, and we should work to keep that from ever happening. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I merely want to close by thanking the distinguished ranking member on the Crime Subcommittee, Randy Forbes, for the excellent work that he performs all the time, but especially on this bill. I want no misunderstanding about our appreciation of this bill being about prohibiting deceptive practices against eligible voters. 
   This is not a measure that deals with prosecuting ineligible voters unless they try to deceive eligible voters. The issue of voter fraud is a very serious one, well publicized, and it is the intention of the Chair of the committee that the Subcommittee on Crime hold hearings on this subject because we think it is an important one that needs to be examined very clearly. 
   But today, we move forward from the 15th amendment in the Constitution, we move forward from the Voter Rights Act of 1965 that has been amended several times, and we now come to a specific set of practices that have been very detrimental in coercing and intimidating and confusing many voters. 
   I am so pleased that this committee at this day and time is prepared to deal with preventing voters from being disenfranchised by being misled on their way to polling. It has been documented and we are directly prohibiting these kinds of tactics and we are turning many of them from a misdemeanor into a felony. I congratulate all the members of the Committee on the Judiciary and particularly the sponsors of this piece of legislation, and urge support of the bill.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure cosponsored with me by the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Lamar Smith, to extend the Antitrust Modernization Commission by 30 days so that it may have time to wrap up and finalize its report and shut down its operations. 
   This modernization commission dealing with antitrust has been in existence since 2002 and was created with the purpose of examining whether the need exists to modernize the antitrust laws. It began meeting in 2004 and for the past 3 years has been studying many aspects of antitrust law, including how these laws operate in a modern, information-driven economy. 
   Also, they were charged with examining the intersection between antitrust law and intellectual property law; about immunities and exemptions that are enjoyed under our current antitrust law; the relationship between the Federal and State antitrust law enforcement; the application of antitrust laws in regulated industries; and the merger review process. I look forward to reviewing the commission's final report, which is due in April of this year. 
   I anticipate that the Judiciary Committee will take a close look at the recommendations contained in the report and will continue to work with the commissioners even after the report is completed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   The reason we have this commission is because there are acknowledged to be some serious considerations, some problems that we need to examine in the area of antitrust law.     
   The antitrust laws were derived from the Sherman Act of over a century ago, and they are very important, and they have helped us in terms of developing an economy that is in some respects the envy of the entire planet. 
   But there has been so much activity in the antitrust area that there has been some concern whether or not we have gone overboard. This past year is the fourth largest in the history for  mergers. Since the Oracle merger, which the Department of Justice sued on and lost, the Department of Justice itself hasn't gone to trial to block a proposed merger in memory. 
   And we are having larger and larger mergers and acquisitions. They are troubling: SBC and AT&T, a $16 billion-valued merger; AT&T and BellSouth, an $86 billion merger; Verizon and MCI, an $8.5 billion merger; Sprint and Nextel, $36 billion; Cingular and AT&T Wireless, about $47 billion worth of coming together; Kmart with Sears, Roebuck; Hewlett-Packard and Compaq; NBC Universal and NBC and Vivendi; Morgan Chase and Bank One; Procter & Gamble buys $54 billion in new acquisition; the Bank of America with FleetBoston. We have got something that needs far more consideration. 
   And I want to praise the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin, who helped us create the special outside committee to aid us, and we look forward to their reports. And I join the gentleman from Texas in helping to develop the time needed for us to get the report. 
   We on the Judiciary Committee feel this is a hugely important subject. And we want to particularly praise the vice chairman of the commission, Attorney Jon Yarowsky, who himself was a former member of the House Judiciary staff for a considerable number of years.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bill we are considering today is a modest one, but I want to emphasize that the issue it relates to is of utmost importance. 
   For over a century, the antitrust laws have provided the ground rules for fair competition. They are our economic bill of rights. Antitrust principles are necessary to preserve competition and to prevent monopolies from stifling innovation. Competition produces better products, lower prices, and wider choices--all to the benefit of consumers. 
   The cornerstone premise of our antitrust laws is essentially a conservative notion: that free and unfettered competition will produce the best results for consumers. To the extent that anticompetitive conduct or conditions have hindered this healthy process, the antitrust laws are there to arrest those violations and remedy the competitive harms. 
   In the Sherman Act, we prohibit contracts or conspiracies that restrain trade, and exclusionary or predatory conduct that sabotages the efforts of rivals. For egregious violations, there are high fines and prison terms. There are also treble damages for victims. 
   And we have supplemented those protections in the Clayton Act, by giving the antitrust enforcement agencies the power to challenge anticompetitive mergers in their incipiency, to prevent their harmful effects from ever taking place. 
   The competitive landscape in the United States has been undergoing dramatic change in recent years. Technological and market innovation has come at us at breakneck speed. We have witnessed a wave of consolidation in some of our key industries. According to Thomson Financial, this past year was the fourth largest in history for mergers and acquisitions. 
   At the same time, we have also seen familiar and novel forms of exclusionary conduct that interferes with the enterprising efforts of competitive businesses to cultivate and serve customers. 
   The telecommunications industry is one key industry that has experienced significant consolidation. This year, AT&T acquired BellSouth Corp.--after just last year acquiring SBC--in a deal that creates a telecom behemoth with $117 billion in revenue. 
   This has particular consequences in the area of net neutrality. For people who innovate in the area of technology, and for those who enjoy those innovations, this free and open access to the Internet has been a boon. New applications are being developed every hour and are able to be instantly distributed on the Web. These new applications--coupled with new content, such as broadband television--have the potential to offer a new array of choices to consumers. 
   Unfortunately, some telecommunications companies have a different vision for the Internet. They have floated the idea of charging websites for access.

   The antitrust laws can help ensure that network neutrality, the bedrock of the growth of the Internet, remains in place. 
   In the media, the FCC's relaxed cap on ownership in national and local broadcast markets, and relaxed cross-ownership restrictions between broadcasters and newspapers, has enabled concentrated wealthy interests to control a large portion of the media in some areas. Consumers are thereby 
   often deprived of a diversity of viewpoints and voices in news and entertainment. 
   Imagine a world where you wake up, read the local newspaper, turn on the television to watch the news, drive to work and listen to the radio, pass a few billboards containing advertisements, return home later at night and turn on your cable to watch a movie or some sports--only to find that each of those media outlets is owned by the same company. It may sound farfetched, but it is not. This is the world we are evolving into. In this world, instead of ten voices with ten different viewpoints, there may only be three. The antitrust laws may be our only hope of preventing this. 
   The story is even bleaker for independent broadcasters, and for minority participation in the media industry. As of 2001, minorities owned only 3.8 percent of the full-power commercial radio and television stations in the nation, and only 1.9 percent of TV stations. If ownership of the media is controlled by four or five conglomerates, minority-owned stations and programming that appeals to minority interests could become a thing of the past. 
   In the home appliance industry, Whirlpool Corp., the largest maker of home appliances, merged with Maytag Inc., the third largest. The deal cost $1.8 billion and produced a company that manufactures much of Sears' Kenmore line as well as the brands Jenn Air, KitchenAid, Amana, and Magic Chef, and controls as much as 70 percent of the U.S. market for large home appliances such as washers and dryers. 
   In the oil industry, we've seen massive increases in gasoline prices. After Hurricane Katrina, the Washington Post reported price increases of as much as 88 cents per gallon in a single day. Some stations in Georgia were reported to be charging as much as $6 a gallon. In Illinois, prices reportedly shot up 50 cents per gallon overnight, and the state attorney general received more than 500 reports of price gouging. At first blush, it would seem that these increases go far beyond anything justified or relating to the market disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina. The FTC's report on this phenomenon was less than satisfactory. 
   We have also seen significant consolidation in the health insurance industry. In recent years, Aetna agreed to acquire Prudential Health Care, the fifth largest for-profit health care company, at the same time it was in the midst of completing its purchase of New York Life. In 1996 Aetna was also permitted to acquire U.S. Health Care. As a result of these acquisitions, Aetna became the largest health care provider in the nation. 
   Recent years have seen more than a dozen health insurance competitors eliminated through mergers and acquisitions. A study of market concentration by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that ``both the group and individual [health insurance] markets are heavily dominated by a relatively few large insurers.'' Business consumers of health care have become increasingly alarmed by this concentration, with Charles Blankenstein, a health expert at William Mercer Consulting, warning that employers are ``bear[ing] the cost of these acquisitions'' as ``choice in the marketplace is rapidly diminishing.'' 
   In the airline industry, lagging profits have led to a marked trend toward further consolidation. Because air travel is a vital portion of the nation's transportation infrastructure, we can't simply turn a blind eye and chalk this up to economic bad times. Often these mergers have the potential to reduce the flight options available to consumers, and ultimately may lead to higher ticket prices. 
   In this environment, vigorous antitrust enforcement is particularly important. We need to be able to rely on the federal antitrust enforcement agencies--the Antitrust Division in the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission. We need to be able to have confidence that they are doing everything they should to protect competition in our economy and the benefits it brings to us all. 
   That is why active oversight of antitrust must and will be an important part of the work of the Judiciary Committee. We will ask these agencies about merger enforcement, and why they do not seem to be challenging an mergers. We will ask them about their policy on civil non-merger enforcement against monopolization and other anticompetitive business arrangements. And we will ask them about their commitment to prosecute criminal antitrust violations. 
   The Committee will also create a task force, as we did in the last Congress, so that we can more closely examine competitive developments in important industries, including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and insurance, as well as topics such as interoperability of new technologies, credit card interchange fees, and transparency in standard setting. 
   As we prepare for the work ahead in this vital area, we will look forward to reading the Antitrust Modernization Commission's final report, and reviewing its assessment of the state  of health of the laws we rely upon to preserve our economic liberty. 
   I thank the Antitrust Modernization Commission for all its work over the past few years. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (HONORING JACK VALENTI -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Members of the House, I rise today to express my gratitude for having known and worked with Jack Valenti, who passed away last week after a lifetime that included serving as a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps, flying 51 combat missions as the pilot commander of a B-25 attack bomber, a man who was a senior aide in the Lyndon Baines Johnson White House, serving as the first special assistant to President Lyndon Johnson, and as president of the Motion Pictures Association of America. 
   In 2004, Mr. Valenti reflected on his extraordinary career when he said, ``I'm the luckiest guy in the world, because I spent my entire public working career in two of life's classic fascinations, politics and Hollywood. You can't beat that,'' he said. 
   Nothing about Jack Valenti was average. He started his adult life as an Army B-25 pilot in World War II, flying many combat missions over Italy. He returned from the war with numerous decorations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with four clusters representing additional awards. 
   After the war, while working full time, Jack Valenti earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Houston, and then went on to Boston where he earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University. 
   Known as one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, he headed the Motion Picture Association for 38 years. During that time, I had the opportunity to work with him on a number of projects, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which ensured protection for intellectual property in order to allow the rollout of digital technology. Mr. Valenti is also well known for creating the film rating system which assigned for the first time a rating to films. In other words, he created a system that would let them voluntarily categorize their films rather than requiring that we do it by legislation. 
   His political career was by no means mundane, either. Before he went to the Motion Picture Association, he served as the first special assistant to President Johnson, and was in the motorcade on November 22, 1963 when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. He then boarded Air Force One with President Johnson and was there for the famous picture of President Johnson being sworn in, and he became President Johnson's special assistant. 
   After a lifetime of achievement, while most people would be more than ready to retire, Jack Valenti turned his energy toward a cause he had been concerned about for many years, and began leading in the fight against HIV and AIDS. He became president of the nonprofit Friends of the Global Fight, whose main goal is to support the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Thankfully, we will all be able to read about Jack's enormous accomplishments and fascinating life, because he just finished his memoir before passing, which is entitled, ``This Time, This Place: My Life in War, the White House and Hollywood.'' It will soon be published. 
   While most people with this amount of influence may be too busy for many, Jack Valenti defied this stereotype by continuing to be both a mentor and friend to almost everyone with whom he came in contact. He kept his promises, promptly returned phone calls, and is described as generous, loyal, and honest by those who knew him. It is an understatement to that say Jack Valenti will be sorely missed.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (OBSERVING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABOLITION OF THE BRITISH SLAVE TRADE -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to join in this discussion to congratulate my colleague from New Jersey DON PAYNE and my dear friend who brought this to my attention only yesterday from California (Ms. Lee). I am so pleased to hear this discussion going on commemorating the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, but also the recognition of William Wilberforce, after whom the famous African American university, Wilberforce, was named, a distinguished member of the British House of Commons. 
   What we are discussing here is not just ancient history. It is not just a  recollection of why we have a 13th amendment to the Constitution prohibiting slavery. But we are talking about one of the great iniquities of our civilization. Slavery has always been a problem that we have dealt with across our centuries; but today and in countries all over the world, we are beginning to examine where it goes. 
   We heard the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) recite present problems. We have heard the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) talk about things that lead us into conditions of such abject poverty that people are made vulnerable to the whole question of being subjugated and eventually so impoverished that they end up being oppressed or exploited. 
   We know that many are still being trapped in trying to leave one country to improve their economic conditions, and they end up under false pretences in a forced work circumstance. Frequently, it's prostitution for young women. And for this 110th Congress, with these resolutions, H. Res. 272 and H. Res. 158, are now beginning to deal with this subject, not only in the present circumstance but examining the roots and the origins of this obnoxious, inhumane, indescribably evil circumstance in which we find men, women and children still under such oppression today. 
   For that reason, I am proud to stand here as the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over our constitutional amendments and to join with the distinguished members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who recognize that after many unsuccessful attempts, the British Parliament finally abandoned and made slavery illegal, but finally, after a great deal of effort were able to stop it. It didn't stop because we passed a law. Slavery and second-class citizenship and the denial of the rights of Americans didn't stop because we passed the 13th amendment. It didn't even stop after we passed a series of Voting Rights Acts to enforce the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. 
   So here we are today, again recommitting this Nation through the people's House to make certain that everyone understands how this came about, how the Atlantic slave trade was so evil and that its legacy lingers over this Nation today. 
   I congratulate all of the leaders of these two measures and in commemorating the legacy and remembering this great Parliamentarian from England, William Wilberforce. Many of our predecessors worked, as tirelessly as we do, through the last couple centuries to deliver on the simple promise of freedom; but guess what, it doesn't turn on us just keeping people free. A free people have to become educated. They have to work. They have to raise their family. We have to put this enormously important consideration into the context of what it means. 
   To be free is not free. To be free means that you can get educated to compete in a computerized technology. It means to be able to be healthy and to live and grow to make everyone have this wonderful opportunity. It was said so then to every man and woman and child the chance, the chance, the gold shining opportunity to become whatever they could in the course of one's life. 
   We celebrated the life yesterday of our dearest colleague Juanita Millender-McDonald as she was memorialized in Los Angeles. What a dynamic, unusual, amazing circumstance of a young girl from Alabama transporting herself to the first elected chairwoman of color of the House Administration Committee. 
   These are the kinds of opportunities that are open to us, to the 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who all have equally poignant stories. We have an African American chairman who had to join the Army because he could not get a job. That is existing today. 
   It is in that spirit of looking back and yet confronting the realities that I am so proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have made this an important day to remember, to reflect on and to plan how we move the condition and the plight of all 300 million of our citizens forward. 
   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding me this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, the problem of animal fighting has been in the news a lot lately, with the recent indictment of quarterback Michael Vick, who is alleged to have been involved in a major dogfighting ring. As we are debating the bill that provides funding for the Department of Justice, I wanted to express my hope that the Department will devote the needed resources to bring an end to this vicious so-called ``sport.'' It's cruel and barbaric, and often associated with other crimes. I commend the Department for its ongoing work to determine the truth of the allegations in the Vick case, and urge that it continues to expand its efforts to crack down on animal fighting across the country. I also wanted to note that the DOJ's Safe Streets Task Force could play a key role in increasing law enforcement action against dogfighting. 
   Sadly, animal fighting occurs in all corners of our country, impacting hundreds of thousands of animals every year, and also our communities. Indeed, it is estimated that there are more than 40,000 professional dogfighters nationwide and 10 underground dogfighting magazines. Cockfighting is also a multi-million dollar nationwide industry. 
   I'm pleased that this Congress took action against animal fighting earlier this year when we passed the Federal Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act and established felony penalties for these crimes. That measure will provide an important additional tool for law enforcement to combat dogfighting and cockfighting enterprises. 
   To make this new law truly effective, though, we need to encourage the active and ongoing participation of Federal law enforcement. Such participation would bolster protection for our neighborhoods in addition to assuring the welfare of animals. Animal fighting is often associated with illegal gambling and acts of human violence. The Chicago Police Department recently revealed that over a 3 year time period, two-thirds of 332 people arrested for animal abuse crimes in the city were also involved in drug crimes, according to the Humane Society of the United States. 
   To combat dogfighting and associated crimes, I recommend that the Safe Streets Task Force devote a considerable amount of its attention and funding to the issue of dogfighting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health and Iraq Accountability Act. 
   This legislation will support our troops and veterans, hold the Bush Administration and Iraqi government accountable and bring our soldiers home by August 2008 or sooner. It will also provide emergency funding for critical programs that have suffered from years of neglect. 
   This supplemental appropriations bill provides emergency funding for critical programs that have long been underfunded by the Republicans. It includes $750 million to correct the funding shortfall in the State Children's Health Insurance program so that hundreds of thousands of children will not lose their health care. It provides $2.9 billion for Katrina relief and recovery. The bill also includes $2.6 billion for homeland security needs left unaddressed by Congressional Republicans, as well as $1.7 billion to remedy the unconscionable state of our military and veterans' health care systems. All of these issues are emergencies in their own right and rise to the level of inclusion in this emergency supplemental spending bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007. This bill takes an important first step towards a new energy future by investing in clean energy resources that will reduce harmful pollution and help break our addiction to foreign oil. 
   H.R. 6 would reclaim $13 billion in tax breaks and giveaways that the Republican Congress extended to big oil in 2004 and 2005 and ensure that oil companies pay their fair share to drill on public land. It would use that revenue to create a Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve to invest in clean, renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, promote new energy technologies, develop greater efficiency and improve energy conservation. 
   Over the last several years, Big Oil has raked in record profits while our dependence on foreign oil has climbed ever higher. At the same time, scientists have uncovered new and alarming facts about global warming that demand our urgent attention. While there is broad, bipartisan public support for investing in clean energy technology, the last Congress and the Administration seem to have been more concerned with taking care of their Big Oil buddies than steering us toward a sustainable energy future. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to chart a new course. H.R. 6 establishes a forward-thinking approach to energy that looks to American innovation to provide renewable energy for our future. Our security, our economy, and indeed, our very existence require nothing less.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank our chairman, Mr. Skelton, and I stand proud today with my fellow veterans in the House of Representatives to register our opposition to the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq and to show our support for our men and women in uniform. 
   Now, last November 7 the American people sent a clear message to Congress and the President: we must end the war in Iraq. Now after nearly 4 years of bloodshed, death and destruction, Congress is likely to go on record as opposing the plan for escalation of this war. 
   No longer will Congress stand by while the President wages a war that defies logic, common sense and human decency. This week we shall take a stand. This week, we tell this administration enough is enough, stop ignoring the American people, stop ignoring your generals. And by the way, I include to the gentleman from New York two speakers ago, General Colin Powell, no less agrees with us. 
   Stop ignoring the foreign policy experts. Stop wasting American lives and resources on this disastrous and unnecessary conflict. This week's debate on this resolution represents an important turning point in public dialogue about Iraq. And so I welcome it, but it is not enough. The escalation must be stopped, and we cannot let the momentum against the war subside after we deal with the escalation. 
   Our priority must remain ending the fighting and dying in Iraq. We must end the senseless deaths of servicemembers like marine Tarryl Hill of Southfield, Michigan, who only last Wednesday died when his vehicle drove over a bomb in Fallujah. 
   Tarryl Hill was 19 years old. He had joined the military to help finance his education to become a chemical engineer. I do not want to see one more promising life like his extinguished on the altar of this administration's arrogance. The loss of Tarryl's life brings to mind the bereavement of another patriot from Flint, Michigan, Lila Lipscomb, whose 26-year-old son, Michael, died in Iraq in April 2003, when his helicopter was shot down. 
   A member of a military family, Ms. Lipscomb initially believed President Bush when he told the Nation that war was necessary for our national security. But her son's letters from the front lines and his tragic death showed her that he should have never gone to Iraq. 
   I need to spend a little time explaining my opposition to the troop surge, which is simply even more of the same. This policy is going in precisely the opposite direction recommended by the generals who get transferred if they do not agree. 
   It would simply expose GIs to more intense door-to-door fighting, in the vain hope that in the meanwhile the Iraqis will miraculously reconcile with us still being in their country. 
   The real and underlying question is how we remove ourselves from this quagmire. As I have emphasized many times, our Constitution gives Congress the central role in decisions of war and peace. Last fall the American people spoke loudly with their votes. We should be here showing the voters that we heard them and that their trust was well placed. 
   The ultimate, unequivocal authority of the Congress is the power of the purse. And so we must use it. Supporters of the President's failed Iraq policy have argued that using Congress's spending power to end the war means that we do not support the troops. It is beyond absurd to suggest that those of us who favor ending funding for the war would simply abandon the troops in the field without equipment and the supplies they need.  
   Cliches about supporting the troops are not really about our service members' best interests. The true purpose of these accusations is to distract us from the fact that we are bogged down in an unwinnable war that threatens to drag on for years, if not decades. Keeping our troops out of harm's way, especially when war is unnecessary, is the best possible way to support them. The American people understand that marching ahead blindly into oblivion is no way to support our troops. That is why they have asked us to end this war. 
   Mr. Speaker, the administration continues to live under the illusion that it can salvage its reputation by achieving a military victory in Iraq, when it is clear that diplomacy is the most effective means at our disposal. The recent National Intelligence Estimate reflecting the collective judgment of U.S. intelligence agencies only confirms what we have seen in the daily headlines for almost a year. It concludes that the civil war has reached an intensity that is ``self-sustaining'' and that there are no Iraqi national leaders with the ability to stop it. No wonder the administration stalled completion of the NIE until after the election and the President's presentation of his latest proposal. 
   Most of the American people know that there is only one way to proceed in Iraq. We must begin the phased withdrawal of American troops in the next 4 to 6 months and conclude it within the year. Redeploying our Armed Forces does not mean ``cutting and running.'' On the contrary, we suggest continued and extensive involvement in the region through renewed diplomacy, a regional conference and reconstruction that is free from fraud and abuse. This sensible path is the only one that can lead us to victory.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS COVENANT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. I thank the Speaker and the leaders, the floor managers on this provision. I want to thank first of all the ranking member, Lamar Smith; the Chair of the Immigration Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, Zoe Lofgren; and in particular, my friend, Chairman Nick Rahall of the Natural Resources Committee because we have all worked together in making important refinements to the bill. There was a great deal of cooperation. 
   As it is now clear, what we are dealing with now is the fact that the minimum wage question, the immigration standards, and the taxes to the islands are of great consequence. I commend all of my colleagues here this afternoon for the tremendous work that has occurred. 
   Labor unions and human rights groups have long called attention to these abuses. And both the Clinton and Bush administration Justice Departments have brought prosecutions under the 13th amendment. 
   I do also want to commend this administration for the excellent work they have done in this regard.  
   The decision in the 1976 Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to leave decisions on minimum wages, immigration standards, and  taxes to the Islands has had tragic consequences. 
   Wide-open guestworker programs, and utter lack of basic labor protections, turned the Northern Marianas into a haven for sweatshops. But modern slavery didn't just occur by day, in the garment factories. It also occurred by night, as cruel brothel owners used deceit and brutality to gratify the demand for prostitutes. 
   Labor unions and human rights groups have long called attention to these abuses, and both the Clinton and Bush Administration Justice Departments have brought prosecutions under the Thirteenth Amendment against some of the most notorious offenders. But these efforts have been blunted at every turn by the factory owners and their high-paid lobbyists. 
   A more fundamental effort is clearly needed, and long overdue, and this legislation will finally provide it. It brings the Commonwealth under the Immigration and Nationality Act, with a balanced approach that will help the Islands through the transition. Workers in the Islands will no longer be kept in the shadows, where they have been too readily prey to abuse. 
   We can see how this effort is already having a result. Just this weekend on Saipan, as many as 15,000 workers and their supporters marched for unity and justice. Fifteen thousand marched on an island of only 60,000 people. We owe it to them to act. 
   The fundamental immigration policy and human freedom issues at stake are of obvious importance to the Judiciary Committee, and I deeply appreciate the openness of the Natural Resources Committee, under the leadership of Chairman RAHALL, in working with us on important refinements to the bill. 
   Immigration Subcommittee Chair ZOE LOFGREN and I have also had tremendous help from Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH, in making these improvements in a bipartisan fashion. Finally, I would like to thank the Administration for its constructive role in bringing us to this point.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (IMPROVING OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, and Members of the Congress, I am delighted to come here this evening to have listened to two doctors and a judge talking about a subject that is of great interest to me as well. And the reason that I mentioned their names is that the subject matter that brings me to the well tonight with other colleagues is how we improve the health care system.     
   And when I hear Judge LOUIE GOHMERT, who serves with distinction on the Judiciary Committee, I always love to try to involve him in what we're doing. And of course we have great respect for Representative Gingrey, the gentleman from Georgia, who is a physician, a medical doctor; Dr. BOUSTANY of Louisiana. All of these are gentlemen whose attention I would like to draw and invite to join us in this and future discussions about the state of health care in the country. I will be making every attempt to communicate with them on it. 
   We happen to have a doctor here on our side, Dr. DONNA CHRISTENSEN from the Virgin Islands, a medical doctor as well. And so just think of the exciting exchange of views that might have otherwise occurred. 
   But this is nevertheless an opportunity to take special orders to review, Mr. Speaker, that over 45 million Americans are currently without any form of health insurance whatsoever. More than eight out of ten of these Americans are members of working families, of all things. And then another 50 million Americans are underinsured and face possible financial ruin due to an unexpected medical bill for hospitalization or other emergencies that might occur. 
   And so for many Americans, the cost of health care, the cost of insurance, the insecurity of employer-based coverage--because many companies are downsizing or moving out of the country entirely--and these factors limit their most important choices in life: staying well and staying healthy, their decisions to work, to raise a family, to return to school, to have children, to retire early or not, to change careers. And the fact of the matter is that health care is the number one subject for nearly everyone in this country. 
   And so it is truly odd that some of my colleagues seem to believe that health care for all is somehow divorced from what they perceive to be the ``American Dream.'' Indeed, the American Dream is posited on the notion that you would be healthy. Before you would become educated, prosperous, rich, accomplished, you have to have good health. Physical and mental as well. 
   And so I begin our discussion underscoring the fact that the American Dream assumes that we're in good health and that good health, continued good health is available to all. 
   One of the Presidents of the United States once stated that Americans already have universal health care because the emergency rooms cannot legally refuse to treat patients. That is the sitting President of the United  States that made that statement, the 43rd President of the United States. And there's only one way that he could have made that statement, and that is that he's never had to use the emergency room for health care or it would be very clear to him that this is the most expensive and immediate and emergency-type circumstance that a person could receive medical care. 
   I wish he would come with me--if I had one wish, I would probably wish something else other than coming with me to the hospital to an emergency room to find out what it's like and how limited the treatment of necessity is because the hospital is defective or the doctors are not fully prepared--but they're under the stress of all emergencies coming from anywhere in the area to come in. 
   So that sort of reminds me of the phrase ``Let them eat cake.'' 
   ``Go to the emergency room. What is the problem?'' 
   Well, the problem is that many emergency rooms cannot handle all of the cases for people who don't have insurance. And I am sorry to report that on some occasions, they are not able to entertain the health needs of the people that seek emergency room medical treatment. 
   And so we, in our office, have been bombarded with the tales, the tragic stories from people who are facing permanent injury, unemployment, death, bankruptcy, foreclosure, even the breakup of families due to the unaffordable health care costs. 
   So during this discussion this evening, we want to share--I invite that we share with each other the experiences that have been related to us, Mr. Speaker, that have come from the American people because nothing has become clearer in the course of my experience here that before we can discuss policy options to reform our health care system, Congress needs to hear from patients and citizens and constituents who suffer under our current non-system, broken way that we deliver health care in the United States. 
   And so it is in that spirit that we begin this discussion. 
   I want to just relate one, and this is entitled ``Robin's Story.'' 
   ``My son was 16 when he was diagnosed with a rare form of liver cancer (undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver). I was married. My husband and I were both working and we had health insurance through my husband's employer,'' Robin says. ``I had recently lost my job as a professor at a business college and was trying to start up my law practice from my home office. When Taylor got sick, we were barely making ends meet. 
   ``The doctors had told us Taylor,'' 16 years old, ``Taylor didn't have cancer but they weren't sure what the mass in his liver was. When they opened him up, they knew it was cancer but it took 5 days to determine the exact type of cancer. They had to close Taylor up without removing the tumor because it was so intertwined with his major blood system. They would have killed him,'' they thought, ``if they tried to remove it. 
   ``As I sat next to Taylor's bed at about 3 in the morning, we both were awake because we couldn't sleep. My husband and I had words. We were so stressed over the uncertainty of our future. We were facing the possibility of losing our son to cancer and we couldn't even pay our bills, let alone pay for the medical bills we were already facing from the surgery and hospital stay. Then to have to pay the cost of cancer treatment was overwhelming. 
   ``Apparently Taylor had heard parts of our conversation. He lay on the bed, barely able to get up to go to the bathroom, facing an uncertain future. He said, `Mom, I'm so sorry about the money.' 
   ``I can't begin to explain how inadequate I felt. I couldn't take care of my own son. He should be focusing on recovering from this major surgery and on gathering his strength to fight the biggest battle of his life. Instead he was worrying about how we were going to pay for all of this. 
   ``We had insurance but we had a large deductible and co-pay. The cost of his treatments over the next year was a quarter of a million dollars. Even though we only had to pay a percentage, 20 percent of an astronomical figure is astronomical. Our phone rang constantly with creditors and collection agents wanting to know when we were going to pay our bills. I was unable to work much because Taylor's treatments and the everyday issues of cancer were as much as I could handle. So in addition to extra bills, we had a fraction of our previous income. 
   ``After Taylor's first surgery and chemo treatment, we were preparing to leave the hospital. We were told we would have to administer a shot to Taylor every day to try to keep his blood counts high enough to continue his cancer treatment. It was stressful to consider giving your son a shot every day. That doesn't compare to the moment the first 14 shots were delivered to our hospital room along with a statement for $6,122! My heart sank to my stomach. I asked the delivery person if I had to pay them right then. He said they would bill us. Thank God. I can only imagine having to decide whether we would pay our mortgage payment and electricity, or give our son a shot that might save his life. 
   ``We eventually got to the point we couldn't pay our mortgage. Our electricity was turned off many times. Each time, I had to pay the amount due plus an extra $100 cut-off fee. If I couldn't afford the original bill, how would I afford the additional $100? Friends and family raised money to help us. It didn't even begin to touch the amounts we owed. And as he turned the corner towards survival, everyone believed that the crisis was passed and stopped helping us. 
   ``We are so blessed because our son survived cancer. It is truly a miracle. But our family didn't survive. After 23 years, my marriage dissolved. The financial pressures were more than the marriage could stand. I still have all of the medical debts and other debts on top of that. I try to just get through each day. I know that I am one of the lucky ones. Although I didn't survive cancer, my son did. I know many families who lost their child and then are also financially devastated. ..... probably even more so than I because they had years of medical treatment that failed to save their child. 
   ``We tried to keep our insurance coverage. But we had to go on COBRA coverage, which was over $1,000 per month in addition to the medical bills. So both Taylor and I and Taylor's father have no insurance. After treatment, Taylor went in for a checkup every 3 months. Each checkup costs $6,000. We are now on six month checkups and hope to go to one a year next year. 
   ``However, all of the other medical issues will just have to be placed on hold. Because I don't have health insurance, I don't take care of medical issues I used to address as they arose. Last summer I fell. I may have broken my wrist or at least tore ligaments. I didn't go to the doctor but just let it heal on its own. My wrist will always be a problem because it didn't heal right. Taylor's beautiful teeth that we worked so hard to straighten with braces will just have to be dealt with later.     
   ``I just pray Taylor or I don't have a major medical problem. I live in fear for both of us because I know what treatment can cost. 
   ``What I learned through our ordeal is that the individual is expected to pay for an inflated `retail' price for health care but the insurance companies, the ones who have the financial ability to pay, have made deals with the providers to pay a fraction of the `retail' price. As an `insured,' we received an explanation of benefits showing that the insurance company was given a `discount' and they usually only paid one-third of the amount paid by an individual with no insurance. That is so wrong. That means that the individual is paying the price for the insurance companies' `discounts.' 
   ``This insanity must stop. We need to tell our story. The insurance companies and providers are making money on the backs of individuals already in crisis, facing life threatening illness and financial struggles because their income is reduced. I knew that survival is related to attitude. I assure you we are losing lives because it is hard to have a positive attitude through financial crisis on top of medical crisis. I want to help tell the story.''  
   A similar wind is now blowing in the 21st century. I believe the people, not special interests, should decide what type of health care system exists in this country. I believe this  wind of change will usher in a new day; a day when hope for the just treatment of all of our brothers and sisters will be reborn. 
    A truly open and democratic process is needed as we pursue this endeavor to ensure equal, just, and comprehensive care for all. To this end, I implore the inclusion of the American people in this discussion, so that the singular, resounding voice of those who believe in change, who believe in moral responsibility, can reverberate across the nation loudly enough so as to drown out those who would profit from continued injustice. 
   The struggle for health care for all is the civil rights struggle of the 21st century. Let there be no doubt: the powers aligned against us are powerful and vast; the coming struggle will be long and hard. But, we have been down this road before, and we have succeeded. We shall succeed once again, because as Fannie Lou Hammer once said, we are sick and tired of being sick and tired. 
   KATHRYN'S STORY 
    My sister was 46 when she saved enough money and was able to go to her doctor for a physical. Her doctor discovered an orange sized mass in her uterus. He recommended that she have an ultrasound. She said she would when she had saved more money. This was August 2005. She continued to work two part time jobs, one at a hospital as a housekeeper in the operating room on the OB/GYN floor. The other job was working for the State of Michigan as a maintenance worker cleaning restrooms. She worked hard and was a loyal employee. Unfortunately, both jobs were part time, so no benefits were offered. She also didn't qualify for aid from the county or State because she worked too much! By September 2006, she was dead. The mass was cancerous, spread to her ovaries, and finally to her lungs. She died three months after diagnosis. Medicaid was approved after her death. 
   CONCLUSION
   My friends, the vital issue of the health care crisis in this country is rising to the surface; the plight of the uninsured and the underinsured can no longer be ignored. As the election season continues to progress, and as we draw nearer to a new administration, the time is now for Members of the House to call for serious, comprehensive health care reform. 
   Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.'' I am privileged to have known Martin Luther King, Jr. and to have worked closely with him on civil rights issues. Madam Speaker, health care is a civil right. 
   It is the spirit of the civil rights crusaders of the past from which we should draw inspiration and strength. Abolitionists did not settle for piece-meal appeasements or token change. Rather, a dynamic and sweeping wind reshaped the Nation for the better, capitalizing on a nagging conscience that Americans, both black and white, knew was the moral and just thing to do.  
   I'd like now to turn to the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands, Dr. DONNA CHRISTENSEN, who not only serves on two very important committees in the House of Representatives, but in addition, she chairs the Congressional Black Caucus Health Caucus, and I've had the honor of working with her across the years, and I would yield to her.

   Mr. CONYERS. I'm pleased now to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis), who I had the great privilege to be in the White House when his Second Chance bill was signed into law after many years of working in this body and the other body to see that it came to fruition. It derived from his long experience as a civil rights activist, as a commissioner, a county commissioner in Chicago, and as a community health worker in community clinics for a considerable period of time. I'm so proud that he's an original cosponsor of H.R. 676, and I yield to him.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSWOMAN JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor the life and career of the Honorable Congresswoman, JULIA CARSON, who was elected to Congress in 1996, and who died on December 15, 2007. Representative CARSON was a most respected friend and colleague of mine and also many other Members of Congress. The Honorable JULIA CARSON was from the Seventh Congressional District in Indiana. Ms. CARSON was a dedicated servant and worked tirelessly for the people of this country and in particular she strongly advocated on behalf of those who were living in poverty or were homeless. 
   The list of legislative efforts that Representative CARSON helped to create in this and in previous congressional terms spanned many issues and these legislative efforts are now a permanent part of the history of this Congress and of this county. In particular Representative CARSON gave her support for primary, secondary and college, education; and she believed in ``single payer'' health care, for all citizens of this country; she also believed in equal justice for all and lived a life that reflected some of these fundamental values that were the hallmark of her service to this country. 
   Congresswoman JULIA CARSON honored the legacy of the late Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks when she introduced legislation which came to fruition on March 4, 1999, when Mrs. Parks was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Representative CARSON also introduced legislation to have a commemorative postage stamp issued on behalf of Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks. 
   Representative JULIA CARSON will always be remembered by her successful political career and will continue to make her indelible mark in history as a natural politician who steadily strengthened ties between people and who never forgot the community which she loved and served. People who worked with her in Congress will not forget the great sense of humor she would bring to them, when we all were experiencing long and arduous efforts that were often expended in the process of making daily decisions on significant and lengthy congressional efforts. 
   Her continued efforts in Congress addressed the issues and supported legislation in the following areas: She was a staunch 
   advocate for equal rights for men and women. She demonstrated a sincere concern and fought for the relief and support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. In her wisdom, she advocated for many medical advances in veterans health care. Her continued outspoken support for the Second Chance Act of 2007, was well recognized. She spoke out for the support of the National Literacy act of 2007. In times of great suffering she stood tall and commemorated the Rutgers University women's basketball team for their vigor in remaining proud of the skill that the team had achieved. She introduced a bill for establishing the celebrated National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. She honored the life of Arva Johnson, a pioneer in the United States Capitol Police Department, when she became the first African American female to wear the police badge. She supported the Horse Slaughter Protection Act. She recognized the 20 years of service of the world famous, Dr. James Hadley Billington, as Librarian of Congress. Congresswoman Carson supported the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. She worked for the benefit of all persons to have access to affordable drugs and medicines by supporting the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act. In the era of DNA research Representative CARSON supported the Stem Cell enhancement Act of 2007. These are a few of the noble congressional legislative actions that she heartily supported and advocated for in the history of her tenure in the Congress of the United States. We appreciate her great efforts in the progress that has been made from all of her humanitarian efforts. 
   I extend my greatest sympathy to the family of Congresswoman Julia Carson on the loss of their mother, a warm and wonderful humanitarian who was an exceptional public figure and who has graciously served this country with her grace, wisdom and gentility. 
   We will all miss her.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This agreement with the Senate builds on the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act passed this summer. The ambitious legislation before us today, which includes wide-ranging solutions from 10 House committees, invests in the future of America and puts our Nation on a path toward energy independence. It will strengthen national security, lower energy costs, grow our economy, create new jobs, and begin to reduce the threat of global warming. 
   The Energy Independence and Security Act includes several provisions that will strengthen our national security by decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. All told, this legislation will slash U.S. oil consumption by over 4 million barrels per day by 2030--more than twice our current daily imports from the Persian Gulf. I want to applaud Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Dingell for reaching an agreement on fuel economy standards that is supported by both environmentalists and the automobile industry. This bill will raise CAFE standards for new cars and trucks to 35 miles per gallon by 2020--the first increase in 32 years. It ensures that this fuel economy standard will be reached, while offering flexibility to automakers and ensuring that we keep American manufacturing jobs and continue domestic production of smaller vehicles. 
   Today's legislation puts us on a path to reducing global warming. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 24 percent of the total amount the U.S. needs to cut by 2030 to help save the planet. The bill increases the efficiency of buildings, homes, appliances, and lighting. It also makes a historic commitment to American homegrown renewable energy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. 
   The bill before us today will also lower energy costs and create new American jobs. Increased vehicle fuel efficiency will save American families $700 to $1,000 a year at the pump, producing $22 billion in net annual savings for consumers in 2020. The building, appliance, and lighting efficiency provisions will save consumers $400 billion through 2030. In addition, by expanding American-grown biofuels to 36 billion gallons in 2022 and supporting cutting-edge energy research, the bill will help create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. It also provides job training that will prepare workers for 3 million new ``green'' jobs over 10 years. 
   For too long, our country has lagged behind the rest of the industrialized world in recognizing and taking action to address the climate change crisis. Global warming endangers all of us, but threatens to have the most devastating impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable. Our Nation is the richest in the world and one of the largest contributors to global warming, yet, until today, it has not made any substantial efforts towards addressing the problem. I am proud to join with my colleagues as we at long last put America on the path to becoming part of the solution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1227, the Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007. This resolution will improve flexibility for previously appropriated funds for hurricane recovery efforts on the Gulf Coast. In addition, the bill would free up for use $1.175 billion in funds previously made available to the State of Louisiana under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, but not being utilized by  FEMA. The legislation also includes a number of provisions designed to preserve the supply of affordable rental housing and would authorize 4,500 new housing vouchers for the purpose of project-based assistance for supportive housing units for seniors, disabled persons, and the homeless. In addition, this bill would require HUD to provide a replacement voucher for every public housing and assisted housing unit that is not brought back on line. The House also adopted the Green Amendment which extends FEMA housing assistance until December 31, 2007 and then transfers eligible households to HUD's tenant-based rental assistance program. This amendment is of vital importance, because it addresses the looming September deadline and gives more than 12,000 families the assurance that they will not be displaced for a second time as they await the rebuilding of their housing. 
   In effect, this bill provides an opportunity for our government to correct some of the injustices to the residents of the Gulf Coast for the: slow and sometimes mismanaged response of the Bush Administration. This bill helps those displaced residents begin to regain stability in their lives. 
   A test of our government's commitment to these citizens occurred when the first flood waters and storm surges arrived. Unfortunately as the waters slowly receded, the government also moved slowly. It is in this aftermath, over 18 months later, that we finally begin to address the grave miscarriage of justice that occurred. 
   The current status has former residents caught in a perpetual, vicious circle in that the storm damaged areas do not have enough schools, hospitals and services to support their return home. However, these resources are not available because there are not enough people in their neighborhoods to support having hospitals, schools and services. The lack of housing fuels this crisis and prevents many from returning to the area. 
   Currently, fewer than 200,000 of the 454,000 pre-Katrina displaced residents have returned home. The survivors of Hurricane Katrina are not asking for a hand out, these survivors were not displaced through any fault of their own and we must immediately use our resources to help them return home. We must treat the survivors of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf Coast region the same as we have treated survivors of other natural disasters. 
   Though we have much work ahead to make the residents of the Gulf Coast whole, this is a very important first step.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. There being no further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hastings of Florida) having assumed the chair, Mr. Holden, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1227), to assist in the provision of affordable housing to low-income families affected by Hurricane Katrina, pursuant to House Resolution 254, he reported the bill, as amended by that resolution, back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, while I am personally opposed to this bill, and have set forth my reasons elsewhere in this debate, the Judiciary Committee has nevertheless assisted the bill's drafters in an effort to help ensure that it does not inadvertently impair fundamental legal rights and protections. 
   In that regard, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would like to further illuminate Congress's intent with respect to three provisions in section 119 of the bill, the section regarding judicial review and related matters. 
   First, the limitation on injunctive and other equitable relief in section 119(a)(2)(A). This provision is written in light of the expected need for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, ``TARP,'' established under the bill in the Treasury Department to be able to act quickly on its decisions to purchase particular assets in the marketplace. 
   Accordingly, the grounds for obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief, which could potentially impair the efficiency of the TARP's response to breaking market developments, is limited to remedying constitutional violations, while all underlying rights, and the availability of monetary damages where warranted, are preserved. Moreover, even in cases of constitutional remedy, there are special provisions in section 119(a)(2)(B)-(D) for expediting resolution of the matter in court.  
   It should be kept in mind that the bill provides for a number of avenues to protect against possible overreaching by the Secretary or the TARP, including a special Inspector General, ongoing Government Accountability Office review, and a congressional oversight panel. Nor do the limits alter the normal rules governing agency rulemaking or adjudication, which are not the sort of actions that require the same kind of rapid response envisioned for TARP's marketplace decisions. 
   Second, the provision regarding homeowners' rights in section 119(b)(1). This provision clarifies that a sale of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities to the TARP in no way impairs the claims or defenses of the homeowners whose mortgages are involved. All rights and interests of the homeowners, whether under the terms of the mortgage instrument or under law, are fully preserved. This means, among other things, that the TARP, in acquiring interests in these securities, does not thereby obtain the right to use any of the extraordinary collection methods and other recourse that is available solely to the Government, which it has been given for collecting fines and other debts owed directly to the Government which the homeowners here did not contract to be subject to. 
   This provision does not prevent modifications to which the homeowner agrees, such as a reduction in interest rate, reduction in loan principal, waiver of fees and unpaid interest, or other forbearance that enables the homeowner to avoid foreclosure, continue living in the home, and keep the mortgage. In fact, this provision is designed to encourage TARP to consider such modifications whenever prudent. 
   And it often will be, benefitting the investors in the mortgage-backed debt as well as the homeowners involved. The costs of foreclosure to the investors--leaving aside the costs to the homeowner, and the community of which the homeowner is a part--will generally far exceed the costs to investors of a mortgage modification. 
   Indeed, taking into account costs such as foreclosure expenses, damage to vacant homes, maintenance, the loss from sales of vacant property in a declining market, the net recovery by investors in a foreclosure situation can be a small fraction of the amount owed on the mortgage. Many foreclosed homes end up being sold in bulk through distress sales, for only a few thousand dollars each. And all of this feeds a vicious circle of increasing foreclosures and declining home values. 
   Loan modifications are almost invariably better for the investors, who continue to receive a steady stream of mortgage payments, as well as for the homeowner, who is able to stay in the home, for the neighborhood that keeps more of its homes occupied and property values supported, and for the entire community that benefits from the homeowner's economic contributions. 
   Third, the savings clause in section 119(b)(2). As written, this provision is a combination of two separate sentences. And the first sentence has two separate purposes. 
   One purpose of the first sentence is to preserve current and future responsibility for wrongdoing, and to ensure that this legislation is not interpreted to relieve wrongdoers from accountability or liability to those whom they have harmed. The Congress is aware of civil litigation brought by shareholders, ERISA participants, or by or on behalf of financial institutions, against officers, directors, and in some cases counterparties whose alleged misconduct caused or contributed to their losses. The Congress is also aware of media reports of criminal investigations. 
   These matters are for the justice system to resolve. The Secretary, and the Executive Branch in general, should cooperate as appropriate with public and private efforts to recover losses from wrongdoers in the financial market, whether those efforts are brought by a governmental entity, securities purchasers, employees, or the corporation itself, or are asserted on behalf of the corporation derivatively. Nothing in this Act is intended to impair any legal rights as against private parties to recover for or redress wrongdoing under Federal or State law. 
   The other purpose of the first sentence is to clarify, similarly as with mortgage-backed securities in section 119(b)(1), that a transfer of nonmortgage financial assets to the TARP does not impair any of the underlying rights, claims, and defenses of borrowers who are not in privity with the TARP and have not contracted for or consented to any such impairment. 
   This does not affect the ability of the TARP and the financial institution transferring the assets to contract between themselves as to which rights and obligations related to those assets will be assumed by Treasury, and which rights and obligations will be retained by the financial institution. Rather, it clarifies that whichever of them deals with the borrower going forward must do so on the same terms, and owes the same duties, as under the original agreement, so that the rights the borrower contracted for or enjoys under law are in no way impaired. Again, this means, among other things, that the TARP, in acquiring these assets, does not thereby obtain the right to use any of the extraordinary collection methods and other recourse that are available solely to the Government, which it has been given for collecting fines and other debts owed directly to it--which the borrowers here did not contract to be subject to. 
   The second sentence in section 119(b)(2) addresses what has come to be termed ``tranche warfare''--litigation among the various categories, or tranches, of investors in structured mortgage-backed securities, each vying for primacy in any modification of terms, at each other's expense. This sentence clarifies that, except as established by contract, a servicer of pooled residential mortgages that become subject to the TARP, if that servicer owes any duty to ensure that net present value of payments on a loan exceeds anticipated recovery in foreclosure, owes that duty not to any individual investor or faction of investors, but to the investors as a whole. 
   Accordingly, the servicer, in agreeing to or implementing a modification or workout plan shall be deemed to be acting in the best interests of all such investors or holders of beneficial interests if the servicer takes reasonable loss mitigation actions, including partial payments. This clarification is intended to further encourage modifications to mortgage loans when, in the judgment of the loan servicer, in the overall interests of the investors.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, today the House of Representatives will vote for the second time this week on Secretary Paulson's flawed bailout legislation. His plan lacks the  core principles needed to improve the economy. To be a viable plan, the legislation must include (1) enacting a moratorium on foreclosures, (2) restructuring mortgages to make them more affordable, and (3) prohibiting interest rate increases associated with subprime loans. These initiatives can be achieved without spending one dollar of the taxpayer's money. In addition, empowering the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to guarantee all depositors and bond holders would provide immediate liquidity to credit markets. 
   If the Congress acts imprudently today, we may end up draining our national treasury of over $700 billion in resources without curing our economic ills. Such a decision could effectively tie the hands of the next President and kill universal health care and job programs before they are ever drafted. 
   I agree with former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz and other leading economists that action must be taken to tackle the problem posed by the tightening of the credit market. I simply disagree with the administration's proposed solution. 
   Although it hasn't been reported in the mainstream media, there are real legislative alternatives to this bailout that have been vetted by some of the best economic minds in the Congress. 
   One plan, offered by Representative Peter DeFazio and other members of the so-called ``Bailout Skeptics'' Caucus, proposes some common sense changes to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation policies. I have cosponsored this legislation because I believe it will efficiently free-up capital, protect the taxpayer, and give the next President the fiscal flexibility he will need to address the dire problems brought about by the current economic slowdown. 
   Another plan, proposed by billionaire financier George Soros, mimics a successful model used in Norway and Sweden. The plan would inject credit into the markets in a direct and low-risk manner by empowering the Treasury Department to purchase preferred stock and discounted common stock from faltering lenders. I called for this type of direct capital deployment measure earlier this week, because it would provide the taxpayers with a tangible return on their investment and keep toxic mortgage-backed securities off the government's books. 
   On top of these plans, I and many of my progressive colleagues have continually advocated for bankruptcy reform that would give judges the freedom to renegotiate home mortgages during court proceedings. National Assistance Corporation of America CEO Bruce Marks and I agree that this reform is a necessary component of any bailout plan. 
   Most Americans have never heard of any of these alternative proposals because they have only been presented with a single, flawed narrative--either accept this bailout plan or tempt economic catastrophe. This is a false choice that, unfortunately, has been successfully peddled by the President's fear-mongers and broadcast by a compliant media. 
   The tactic being used by Paulson creates an atmosphere of fear. The events of the last two weeks are reminiscent of the days leading up to the adoption of the Patriot Act, and to the invasion of Iraq--times where fear-mongering dampened the careful and deliberate consideration of alternative courses of action. This time, instead of scaring the American people with tales of weapons of mass destruction or planes piloted by terrorists, the President bullies the taxpayer with dire warnings of a credit freeze that will bring our economy to its knees. 
   There are serious options for dealing with this crisis that don't involve giving away billions to the richest, most irresponsible businessmen. My vote against the bailout today is not a do-nothing vote; it is a vote for a real solution. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past. Detroiters, Michiganders, Americans, and billions of people around the world are depending on us to get it right.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, which requires equity in the provision of mental health and substance-related disorder benefits under group health plans. This much needed legislation would finally provide for true mental health insurance parity, offering mental health and substance-abuse benefits on par with medical and surgical benefits, ending discrimination against patients seeking treatment for psychiatric disorders. 
   Mental illnesses have a devastating affect on our nation. According to a 2005 Harvard study, over 35 million Americans suffer from a moderate or serious mental disorder in any given year. Societal costs, such as loss of productivity and the burden on family caregivers, total $113 billion annually. As well, the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health reported in 2003 that mental illnesses constitute the leading cause of disability in the United States; the Commission noted that half  of those who need mental health treatment in this country do not receive it. 
   The treatment of mental illness works. Unfortunately, only those who are able to access care can benefit from it. Most mental disorders are chronic, ongoing illnesses that require consistent and persistent treatment in order to achieve remission. It would seem unconscionable to limit the number of times a cancer patient sees their oncologist for treatment; those suffering from severe psychiatric illness should not be held to a lesser standard of care. 
   Despite disinformation put forth by some of my colleagues today, the concept of mental health insurance parity is not a new one. In fact, as members of Congress, we all enjoy the benefits of mental health parity that our constituents are deprived of. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program has offered mental health and substance-abuse benefits on a par with general medical benefits since 2001. A convincing study of the FEHB program published by the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006 proves that the implementation of parity in insurance benefits for behavioral health care can improve insurance protection without increasing total costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, the inequity of coverage with regard to mental health and substance abuse treatment benefits is tantamount to discrimination against the mentally ill, and it reinforces the strategy of insurance companies to deny care rather than provide care. It is our duty to end this intolerable discrimination against the mentally ill, and pass H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (REVISING SHORT TITLE OF THE FANNIE LOU HAMER, ROSA PARKS, AND CORETTA SCOTT KING VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION AND AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2006 -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 188, which would rename the Fannie Lou Hamer Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, to include the names of civil rights pioneers Cesar E. Chavez, Barbara C. Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and Dr. Hector P. Garcia. It passed the other body unanimously, and I would hope that this House would follow suit. 
   I want to commend SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, a distinguished Member of the Judiciary Committee from Texas, who introduced legislation in the House. It is vitally important that we all remember the many courageous leaders whose achievements make possible the work we do today. 
   The reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act was an important achievement. The extension of this historic civil rights legislation passed in the last Congress with broad bi-partisan support. 
   The Voting Rights Act has, since its enactment in 1965, helped to fulfil the promise of this nation to the world that all are created equal, and all have an equal right to determine their destinies. 
   Although the 15th Amendment to the Constitution was meant to guarantee that ``[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,'' that guarantee was not given full effect for many former slaves and their descendants for a full century after its adoption. 
   The Voting Rights Act changed the legal landscape and gave citizens, backed up by the Department of Justice, new legal remedies to ensure that their voices would be heard at the ballot boxes--freely, fairly, and equally. 
   It is therefore fitting that we should add the names of these four civil rights leaders to the title of the Voting Rights Act. 
   Who were these leaders? 
   Cesar Chavez dedicated his life to the rights of some of the most vulnerable and powerless in this nation. The migrant farm workers who pick our crops were unable to provide even the most basic needs for their families. Lack of decent pay, schooling, education, sanitation, housing, and political power made them some of the most oppressed Americans. In a land of plenty, these workers had nothing. 
   Edward R. Murrow rightly called it our ``Harvest of Shame.'' 
   Cesar Chavez organized the unorganized, built a national movement, and won a contract and a life with dignity for these workers. As the founder of the United Farm Workers, he brought hope, dignity, and self-respect to thousands of hardworking Americans who had  faced bleak oppression and disenfranchisement. 
   With the founding, and the success, of this movement, nothing would ever be the same. 
   Barbara C. Jordan was a distinguished Member of this House from Houston, Texas, from 1973 to 1979, and a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
   In 1966, she became the first African American to serve in the Texas State Senate since 1883. 
   In 1972, she and and Andrew Young became the first African Americans elected to Congress from the South since 1898. 
   If those dates are jarring, they should be. The post-Reconstruction era was marked by violence, state-sponsored terror, and legal roadblocks that disenfranchised African Americans throughout the South. These efforts were so effective in undermining the plain command of the 15th Amendment, that no African American would represent the South in this House until we enacted and began enforcing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
   Representative Jordan was both a symbol of that new law, and an activist who gave those legal guarantees real meaning. 
   When it came time to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 1975, Representative Jordan sponsored legislation broadening it to include Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Thanks to her efforts, the Voting Rights Act now protects the rights of voters with limited English proficiency. 
   Always a tireless fighter for social justice, Barbara Jordan was known for her passion and her eloquence. In 1976, she became the first African American to deliver the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. 
   For her outstanding contributions to this nation, Barbara Jordan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994. 
   A legal scholar, a skilled legislator, an educator, and a fighter for social justice, Barbara Jordan's name belongs on the Voting Rights Act. 
   William C. Velasquez, another Texan, and another Presidential Medal of Freedom honoree, founded the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, the nation's largest voter registration project aimed at the Hispanic community. 
   Under his leadership, the SVREP launched hundreds of successful get-out-the-vote and voter registration drives throughout the Southwest, greatly expanding the number of registered Latino voters and increasing Hispanic participation in the political process. 
   Mr. Velasquez, who was also a leader in the United Farm Workers and helped found the Mexican American Youth Organization, and la Raza Unida, helped others believe as he did that ``Su voto es su voz''--your vote is your voice. 
   When President Clinton posthumously awarded Mr. Velasquez the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995, he was only the second Latino to receive the nation's highest civilian honor. 
   His contributions make it more than appropriate for us to add his name to the Voting Rights Act. 
   Dr. Hector P. Garcia was a decorated veteran of World War II, a physician, and the founder of American GI Forum. 
   Organized by Dr. Garcia in a Corpus Christi elementary school classroom one evening in March, 1948, the GI Forum ultimately spread across the United States and became a leading civil rights organization. 
   World War II was very much a watershed in opening up new opportunities for Texas Mexicans. But civil rights between 1945 and the late 1950s did not come to Mexican Americans automatically. 
   Many housing developments, restaurants, movies, swimming pools, and even hospitals were considered off-limits to Mexican-Americans. Police and other law enforcement agencies, such as the Texas Rangers and the Border Patrol, all too often reminded Tejanos of their second-class citizenship through disparagement or intimidation. Employment opportunities diminished quickly. 
   Politically, Texas Mexicans had to pay the poll tax, and cope with other voting and office-holding restrictions. Mexican American farm laborers, like those in a labor camp in nearby Mathis, Texas, endured inhuman living conditions. 
   Disabled Mexican American veterans were left starving or sick when a dilatory Veteran's Administration failed to send financial and medical benefits. Local school officials blithely admitted on the radio that Mexican American children were segregated. This was the Texas that Dr. Hector Garcia returned to after World War II. 
   In 1966, through the efforts of the Forum and other groups, the Texas poll tax was repealed. The Forum also undertook a march on the Texas State Capitol to protest the low wages of Mexican agricultural laborers. 
   In 1967, President Johnson appointed Dr. Garcia alternate ambassador to the United Nations. He was tasked with the improvement of relations with Latin American nations. 
   Dr. Garcia made history when, on October 26, he became the first United States representative to speak before the U.N. in a language other than English. President Johnson also appointed him to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 
   In 1972, Garcia was arrested at a sit-in protest of the de facto segregation in Corpus Christi school district. In 1987, he became involved in the struggle against the campaign to name English the official language of the United States. His final project was to improve the standard of living in the colonias in the Rio Grande Valley along the United States-Mexico border. 
   A fighter for this nation in combat, a distinguished physician, a courageous leader in the struggle for equality and freedom, it is fitting for us to add Dr. Garcia's name to the Voting Rights Act. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   I believe that it is important for Congress to recognize the contributions of our constituents to the overall development of our communities. I commend Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, a distinguished Member of the Judiciary Committee from Texas, who introduced this legislation for highlighting the contributions of Judge Jefferson. It is vitally important that we all remember the many courageous leaders whose achievements make possible the work we do today. 
   Judge Jefferson is a noted legal scholar and institution of legal education in the Eighteenth Congressional District of Houston, Texas. His experience ranges from service in the Judge Advocate General corps in the United States Army Reserve to labor relations. He has been appointed and elected to the Texas state courts and nominated for a seat on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In addition to serving both the bar and bench, Judge Jefferson has participated in the life of the Houston community and has been honored by numerous organizations, ranging from the Anti-Defamation League to the League of United Latin American Citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008. This bill provides tax relief to America's heroic servicemembers. As a veteran of the Korean war, it is imperative that we assist the brave men and women who put their lives at risk in defending our Nation in any way we can. 
   H.R. 6081 will improve tax benefits to members of the armed services. For example, today's legislation permanently extends the Earned Income Tax Credit for combat pay, allows for penalty-free withdrawal from servicemember pension plans, allows access for funds in Flexible Savings Accounts, and lets military death benefits to roll over into a Roth IRA or Education Savings Account. Given the crisis in the housing market, I am particularly heartened that H.R. 6081 permanently establishes mortgage bonds used to finance home purchases by veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill also extends the Economic Stimulus rebates that are being delivered as we speak today. H.R. 6081 humanely permits servicemembers who are married to foreigners to receive the full value of their rebate. 
   Lastly, the bill will restrict government contractors who move offshore to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare benefits. It is shocking that government contractors receive millions, or even billions, of taxpayer dollars and then try to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. 
   We have put our Nation's finest men and women in a senseless war without an end. The least we can do is allow their families to enjoy the same benefits as their neighbors. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (INTERNATIONAL FOOD CRISIS AND HAITI -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of the Congress and to the American people the plight the western hemisphere's second oldest republic, Haiti. The Haitian people are being negatively affected by market forces out of their control that have driven food prices up drastically. Haiti, where about 4 out of 5 people live at or below poverty, is an island nation that consists of approximately 8.7 million people. To put this in perspective, imagine the city of New York; now imagine that same city with 80 percent of its citizens in poverty. 
   The American people and Congress have already assisted Haiti with the HOPE and HOPE II (Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement) Acts. HOPE was the tip of the iceberg. It provided jobs to allow Haitians to overcome poverty. HOPE II will create even more gainful employment and more sustainable jobs for Haitians and create a self-sustaining infrastructure. These acts will provide jobs needed to help more Haitian citizens emerge from poverty and gain employment which will lead to a more prosperous Haiti. 
   However, there is much more work to be done Madam Speaker. Right now the World Food Program is in need of $755 million to meet immediate demands and USAID also needs an additional $240 million. Increases in these programs will ensure that school food programs in the developing world are not eliminated due to current food price inflation. The food price escalation is also affecting the region as a whole. 
   Due to escalating market prices, in rural El Salvador, with the same amount of money today, people can purchase 50 percent less food than they did 18 months ago. This means that, in principle, their nutritional intake, on an already poor diet, is being cut by half. 
   In Nicaragua the price of tortilla went up 54 percent between January 2007 and January 2008. 
   We cannot let our neighbors suffer due to circumstances out of their control. We have taken small steps but now the government of the United States must be an active agent in the development of the third world. We must follow the lead of our philanthropic and non-profit sectors. 
   Too often those in government see aid to developing nations as a waste of money, throwing taxpayers dollars down a well. India is a great example of the benefits of foreign aid. In the 1960s American dollars funded fertilizer subsidies and high yield seed varieties led India out of poverty and famine into self-subsistence. India is now entering the developing world, so much so that their demand for processed foods is now decreasing the supply of food aid available to countries such as Haiti. 
   This can happen in Haiti if the United States focuses on delivering basic goods to the hemisphere's poorest people. By increasing vaccines, textbooks, water pipes, and medical care we will not make countries dependent, we will be giving Haitians the basic inputs they need to improve their lives. We must invest in high-yield, proven, and scalable strategies to empower the Haitian people and those suffering throughout the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (JUSTIN BAILEY VETERANS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 5554, the ``Justin Bailey Veterans Substance Use Disorders Prevention and Treatment Act of  2008.'' This legislation grants to our veterans access to a comprehensive continuum of substance abuse treatment services provided by Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. The bill also requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to inform veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom about the availability of such care. 
   Madam Speaker, we have sent thousands of otherwise healthy young men and women to Iraq and Afghanistan to fight. Many of those who were lucky enough to escape unscathed physically, are suffering agonizing symptoms emotionally. Depression, anxiety, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder plague countless veterans returning from the battlefield. Without proper treatment, our veterans turn to self-medicating these psychiatric symptoms by abusing alcohol and other substances. 
   It would be negligent, if not hypocritical, of us not to offer comprehensive substance abuse treatment for all returning veterans. This legislation ensures that a ``continuum'' of services, including screening for substance use disorders, detoxification and stabilization services, intensive outpatient services, relapse prevention services, counseling services, and other necessary services, are offered to our returning veterans. 
   Of course, these services require funding. H.R. 5554 ensures that funding for a full continuum of substance abuse treatment is made available to veterans seeking such care. Although H.R. 5554 authorizes a pilot program for Internet-based substance use disorder treatment, let us not sell our veterans short by cutting corners on care. More funding is needed to ensure that enough psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists, and social workers are available to care for our returning veterans. As well, more research funding is required in order to better understand and treat disorders of substance abuse and dependence which plague our veterans. 
   Madam Speaker, I find it appalling that we ask our young men and women in the Armed Forces to sacrifice life and limb overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet when those very soldiers return home, we deny them vital mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Let us begin to right this wrong by supporting H.R. 5554, and improve substance abuse treatment services available to our veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (NICS IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The legislation before us today makes important changes to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System designed to help States identify and prevent convicted felons and other dangerous individuals from owning firearms. 
   As it currently stands, millions of criminal records are not accessible by the instant check system. Millions of additional records fall through the cracks as a result of backlogs and other problems. 
   The measure before us now will help cure these problems by providing the resources and incentives needed to modernize the system and ensure that the records are up to date. 
   Instant check improvements legislation has passed through the Judiciary Committee and this House each of the last two Congresses, only to die in the other body, and was on our agenda for the 110th Congress as well. 
   The need to move legislation was recently highlighted by the tragic Virginia Tech shootings. At the end of that fateful day in April, the alleged gunman, Cho Seung-Hui, had taken a total of 32 lives, wounded an additional 26 individuals. In addition, countless numbers of family members and loved ones of these students and teachers lives were forever changed. 
   By improving and enhancing the instant check system, the idea is that we will be able to prevent future tragedies where we know the individual should not own a gun. 
   In order to move the legislation to the floor, it was necessary to make some accommodations to incorporate the concerns of gun owners. The dean of the Congress, among other things, led this effort. Among the things that were changed is section 105 of the bill, which requires all States to adopt a procedure allowing those individuals who have been determined to suffer from a mental illness with an opportunity to purchase or possess a firearm at some point later in life. That's a pretty serious matter. 
   Section 101 of the bill automatically restores the gun rights of military personnel who have been previously diagnosed with a mental illness, provided they are no longer undergoing any treatment or monitoring. 
   I have a concern, as you may be able to tell, that these changes to current law may inadvertently permit certain individuals who should not own guns the opportunity to purchase them. As a result, I will be closely monitoring these sections to ascertain if they do, indeed, create an unnecessary loophole. 
   If they do, I will be the first one back on this floor asking the Congress to remedy the situation. 
   I thank Carolyn McCarthy of New York; the dean of the Congress, John Dingell of Michigan, for their extraordinary work in this matter. I know that they are busy on their own committees, and I appreciate them helping the Committee on the Judiciary figure out how to do this. 
   The time to provide their input on this matter, which falls squarely within the Committee on the Judiciary's jurisdiction, is appreciated. It is truly tragic that violent felons, and even madmen, are able to evade the legal system and acquire guns which do us harm. 
   Anything which helps update the instant check system is a step forward in our fight against needless and senseless gun violence. I hope that that's what this measure does, and I urge my colleagues' support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. As an elected official tasked with the tremendous responsibility of protecting the taxpayers' interests and money, I cannot in good conscience support this fundamentally flawed legislation before us today. 
   As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I am often required to engage in oversight of the enforcement of our nation's antitrust laws, the statutes which ensure the competitive balance of our free market economy. One of the important things I have learned during my tenure is that the free market serves America best when it keeps prices low for the people on Main Street and doesn't cater to the titans of Wall Street. The only way this properly functioning market can be realized, is when no corporation or bank is allowed to become too big or too powerful to fail. Otherwise, corporations grow too bold, and begin to take more risks than a prudent business afraid of bankruptcy should. 
   For the last 8 years, President Bush has governed from the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street; leaving Main Street behind. Desperately needed priorities like children's health insurance and heating fuel for the poor have gone unfulfilled, while the top one tenth of one percent have benefited from dramatic cuts to the capital gains and income taxes. During this same time, President Bush's Justice Department sat by as the financial juggernauts grew larger and larger and their financial wheeling and dealing grew more and more reckless. 
   Now, President Bush has proposed a $700 billion dollar bailout of Wall Street. And why is the Congress held hostage? Because financial institutions and investment banks are too big to be allowed to fail. Unless the American tax payer foots the bill for Wall Street's risky behavior, credit will freeze, investment will cease, and the economy will crash and burn. 
   Or so the President's former Goldman Sachs executive, Treasury Secretary Paulson, would have us believe. I am not sure, considering the source here. 
   True, buying the worthless mortgage backed securities from these firms and banks would likely improve their ability to lend. I'm sure it's just a coincidence that this approach also magically turns institutions on the verge of collapse back into profitable business ventures. 
   If injecting credit into our financial industry is the solution to the current supposed credit squeeze, why hasn't this body been given the option to vote for other proposals, like giving tax payers a no-risk equity stake in the bailout recipients or supporting the direct injection of capitol into the financial industry, as we did during the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s? The likely reason is because Wall Street would have to give up a piece of its wealth; something this crony-capitalist Administration is loathe to do. 
   Although the President's radical proposal has gradually been improved over the last week by the Leadership, the fundamental structure and capital delivery method remains flawed. No number of federal loan modifications or oversight boards will alter that. 
   People all over the country are up in arms over this bailout, not because it's not necessary, but because it is just more of the same. The American people can't take another transfer of wealth from the working class to the upper crust. I encourage my colleagues to vote today to scrap this deal so that we can put together a real plan that addresses the credit crunch by directly injecting capital into the markets, updating our outdated regulatory structure, helping people who are struggling to stay in their homes, legitimately providing for the recoupment of taxpayer dollars, and restoring the competitive balance of the free market by ensuring that no firm is too big to fail.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ARMY SPECIALIST JOSEPH P. MICKS FEDERAL FLAG CODE AMENDMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan, Bart Stupak, for all that he has done with our committee, and with the Republicans on the subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee who worked so well on this. 
   I rise of course in support of H.R. 692 to honor fallen men and women who gave their lives to our Nation while on duty in the armed services. 
   As a veteran myself, I can appreciate this bill as much as anyone in the House. This 22-year-old soldier for whom the bill was named came from Bart Stupak's district, and gave his life on July 8, 2006. He was killed by an improvised explosive device that detonated near his vehicle during combat operations in Iraq. 
   This measure before us simply amends current law to add heroes like Specialist Micks to the list of persons in whose honor the flag may be flown at half-staff. It specifies that a Governor's proclamation ordering the flag to be flown at half-staff, consistent with this measure, would apply to all Federal installations and facilities in the State. 
   Over the last 4 years, at least 10 soldiers from Mr. Stupak's district have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet the national flags on some Federal buildings were not lowered in their honor, to the dismay of the family members and friends of these brave soldiers. 
   So the measure ensures that our Nation's fallen military heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our Nation are appropriately honored and acknowledged.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 102 cosponsors, including a dozen members of the House Judiciary Committee, in supporting this legislation. 
   During the 1990s, the crime rate for all categories of crime and in all parts of the United States fell dramatically. For example, homicide rates in 2001 plunged 43 percent from their peak in 1991, reaching their lowest level in 35 years. 
   Now, there are many potential explanations offered regarding the dramatic and unexpected drop in the rate of violent crime during the 1990s. One popular explanation is the Nation's sustained economic growth during the days of the Clinton administration. 
   But researchers often point to one other explanation: the creation of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services in 1994, the COPS bill; and the subsequent infusion of more than $7.6 billion in grants into State and local law enforcement communities to hire police officers and promote community policing as an effective strategy to prevent crime. The bill before us reinvigorates the COPS crime fighting program in several important respects. 
   First, it establishes hiring grants for community policing officers, anti-terror officers, and school resource officers. It also reauthorizes ``Troops-to-COPS'' grants to hire former members of the Armed Forces in particular as career law enforcement officers. And it also authorizes a ``Community Prosecutors Program'' to pay for community prosecuting programs, including those that assign prosecutors to handle cases from specific geographic areas or to address counter-terrorism and related problems. 
   Finally, it authorizes ``Technology Grants'' to State and local law enforcement agencies to help them refocus some of their activities from reacting to crime to preventing it. Crime prevention has now come back into vogue. 
   So this legislation, because of its long and successful prior experience, has been endorsed by key law enforcement groups: the National Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the National League of Cities. 
   I am proud to indicate their strong support for this measure, and I urge my colleagues to lend their support to a bill whose restoration is more than deserved. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I am proud to join with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes) and rise in strong support of H.R. 916 because our Nation's criminal justice system depends on the hard work and commitment of the men and women who serve as prosecutors and defenders; yet the ability of the public sector to attract qualified individuals and to retain experienced attorneys is increasingly becoming more compromised. 
   As many of us know, recent law school graduates are often burdened with overwhelming student education loans. The amount of their debt can effectively preclude a young attorney from choosing to practice in the public sector, and with the median salary for an associate in private practice now many times the median salary of a State prosecutor, public-spirited attorneys who owe extensive student loans have a very hard time deciding that they can afford to work in our criminal justice system. 
   In Wayne County, Michigan, our county prosecutor Ms. Kym Worthy, a veteran trial lawyer before she assumed the position, has come to me repeatedly asking for help in this area. 
   So this measure addresses the critical problem by directing the Attorney General to establish a loan repayment assistance program for an individual who agrees to remain employed for at least 3 years as either a State or local criminal prosecutor or as a State, local or Federal public defender for criminal cases. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I would bring to the attention of our membership a communication from the National Conference of Chief Justices at the State level in support of Federal legislation to create incentives to law students to participate in public service occupations after graduations. 
   The 109th Congress considered legislation designed to encourage qualified individuals to enter in and continue employment for at least 3 years as criminal prosecutors and public defenders by means of providing the United States Government payment of a portion of that individual student loan for each year of such employment. 
   Whereas the 110th Congress is also likely to consider legislation to assist the repayment of student loans of qualified individuals who commit to employment as prosecutors and public defenders, therefore, the Association of American Law Schools, Equal Justice Works, the National Legal Aid & Defender Association, and the American Bar Association have expressed support for the above-described legislation, and the lawyers to engage in civil and legal services to enhance access by justice, by low-income persons rendered valuable public service that is comparable to that provided by criminal prosecutors and public defenders. 
   Therefore, be it resolved that the Conference of Chief Justices hereby urges the Congress to adopt legislation to give financial incentives to law school graduates to commit to sustained public service as prosecutors and public defenders. 
   Therefore, the conference additionally encourages Congress to develop and adopt separate legislation providing similar relief for qualified individuals who engage in employment as civil, legal aid attorneys, adopted as proposed by the Government Affairs Committee and the Professionalism and Competence Committee of the Conference of Chief Justices on February 7 in the year 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, if there is one message that was abundantly clear based on the results of last year's election results, it was that the American people want us to end the culture of corruption that has enveloped the legislative process. 
   For far too long, Americans have seen business as usual where time and time again special interests trump the public interest.     
   So we've heard that message loud and clear. For the past several months, the House and the Senate have diligently worked together to fuse a legislative response that combines the best of the measures passed by both Houses earlier this year. 
   The measure that we consider today will go a long way toward bringing back accountability to the Congress and to restoring the trust of the American people in their government. S. 1 accomplishes these critical goals in four ways. 
   First, S. 1 puts an end to the K Street Project, an insidious effort that employed threats and intimidation to control the legislative process. S. 1 ensures that such efforts will no longer be permitted. It specifically prohibits Members and senior staff from influencing hiring decisions or practices of private entities for partisan political gain. 
   Second, S. 1 shines a disinfecting spotlight on lobbying activities by mandating full and enhanced public disclosure on these activities. Pursuant to this measure, lobbyists will have to file reports on their lobbying activities twice as often each year. They will be required to disclose their contacts with Congress. They must certify that they did not give a gift or pay for travel in violation of the rules and, for the first time, file these reports electronically in a public, searchable database so that anyone can review them. 
   Third, S. 1 closes loopholes in the current law that have been exploited to avoid the clear intent of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. It does this by mandating the disclosure of contributions in excess of $5,000 by businesses or organizations that actively lobby through certain coalitions and associations. And, it also requires the disclosure of the past executive and congressional employment of registered lobbyists. 
   Importantly, S. 1 prohibits a Member's spouse who becomes a lobbyist after the Member's election from making direct lobbying contacts to the Member or the Member's office. 
   In addition, the bill addresses the process by which political contributions are bundled by campaign committees. It requires each committee to disclose to the Federal Election Commission, on a semiannual basis, specified information for each currently registered lobbyist who has either forwarded or been credited for raising contributions totaling at least $15,000 during the reporting period. 
   Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, S. 1 puts real teeth into enforcement. It increases the penalties for violations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act to deter and punish corrupt activity. It substantially increases civil penalties from the current level of $50,000, to four times as much, to $200,000 and provides for the imposition of criminal penalties of up to 5 years for knowing and corrupt violations of the Act. 
   These are some of the major reforms that S. 1 offers. This bill recognizes the importance of lobbying to responsive and effective congressional and executive decision-making. And these reforms will help strengthen the sound foundation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act and go a long way toward restoring the trust of the American people in our system of government. 
   I want to respectfully point out the contributions from the other side, particularly the ranking member of Judiciary, Lamar Smith, in this endeavor, and so I urge my colleagues all to join me in supporting the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I thank my colleague for his examination of the bill. We've worked on this bill together. I think we're in support of it, and I hope to enjoy the gentleman's continued success and cooperation in the matter. 
   It's very important that we understand that we are ending the pay-to-play K Street Project which, under this bill before us, now prohibits Members and their staff from influencing hiring decisions of private organizations on the sole basis of partisan political gain. 
   It subjects those who violate this provision to a fine and imprisonment of up to 15 years. 
   We prohibit lobbyists from providing gifts or travel to Members of Congress who have knowledge that the gift or travel is in violation of the Senate or the House rules. 
   We require now lobbyist disclosure filings to be filed twice as often by decreasing the time from filing from semiannually to quarterly. 
   We require lobbyist disclosures in both the Senate and the House to be filed electronically and creates a public and searchable Internet database of such information. 
   We increase civil penalties for knowing and willful violations of the Lobby Disclosure Act. We increase them by four times as much, from $50,000 to $200,000, and imposes a criminal penalty up to 5 years for knowing and corrupt failure to comply with the Act. 
   We require the GAO to audit annually lobbyists' compliance with these disclosure rules and, further, require lobbyists to certify that they've not been given gifts or travel that would violate either Senate or House rules. 
   We require the disclosure of businesses or organizations that contribute in excess of $5,000 and actively participate in lobbying activities by certain coalitions and associations. 
   We're requiring disclosure to the Federal Election Commission when lobbyists bundle over $15,000 semiannually in campaign contributions for any federally elected official, including the Senate, the House or presidential, or leadership PACs. 
   We require lobbyists to disclose to the Secretary of the Senate and the House Clerk their campaign contributions and payments to presidential libraries, inaugural committees or entities controlled by the name for or honoring Members of Congress.     
   Ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely difficult and new way of controlling lobby operations. I think we are restoring the trust of the American people and our system of government, and I think we are living up to the title of this measure, honest leadership and open government.

The Lobbying and Ethics Reform bill is not over with with today's work. Our job continues, and I will be looking forward for these constructive comments that they will be bringing to our attention. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record a letter from the Campaign Legal Center and others that support this legislation, and I would like you to know that the organizations' authors that signed this are among the most watchful and effective critics of the subject of ethics and lobbying that we have in the country. 
   The letter was signed by the U.S. PIRG, the Public Citizen, the League of Women Voters, Democracy 21, Common Cause, the Campaign Legal Center, all who have said that: 
   Our organizations strongly urge you to vote for the lobbying and ethics reform legislation when it is considered by the House on the Suspension Calendar. 
   The legislation being presented to the House constitutes landmark reform of the Nation's lobbying disclosure laws and landmark reform of the Senate ethics rules. It is designed to help address the worst congressional corruption scandals in 30 years that were revealed during the last Congress. 
   Under the legislation, for the first time citizens will be provided with a wealth of information about the multiple ways in which lobbyists and lobbyist organizations provide financial support to assist Members. For the first time, candidate campaign committees, leadership PACs, and political party committees will be required to disclose the bundled contributions raised for them by lobbyists and lobbying organizations. The legislation also includes fundamental reforms of the Senate ethics rules very similar to the landmark House ethic reforms adopted at the beginning of the year.  
   July 30, 2007.  Re Vote for the lobbying and ethics reform bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007. Colleagues, I wish that I did not have to stand here today; I wish that we did not have to have this debate. However, in reversing decades of precedent and placing new limits on the ability of victims of pay discrimination to pursue their claims, the Supreme Court's May 29 decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear makes our debate here today critically necessary to ensuring a better America for all of our citizens. 
   Some on the other side of the aisle have complained that this legislation will dismantle the statute of limitations established by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. They maintain that this legislation will allow an employee to sue for pay discrimination resulting from an alleged discriminatory act that might have occurred 5, 10, 20, or even 30 or more years earlier and that under H.R. 2831 a worker or retiree could seek damages against a company run by employees and executives that had nothing to do with the initial act of alleged discrimination that occurred dozens of years ago. 
   These arguments represent nothing more than an attempt to muddy the waters. The reality is that Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act does nothing to disturb the current law's 180-day charge-filing period and employees continue to be subject to these time limits. Instead, the bill merely clarifies the conduct that triggers the running of the 180-day clock. Under the legislation, if an employee wants to challenge discriminatory pay, he or she must file within 180 days of the discriminatory conduct, such as the payment of a discriminatory wage. If the employee waits longer than 180 days after the discriminatory conduct, the 180-day clock will run out and a charge will become untimely. 
   The fact of the matter is that pay discriminatory is often difficult to discover and takes place over many years. Many employers have policies explicitly forbidding employees from talking to one another about their pay. Workplace norms also discourage employees from asking each other about their pay. Additionally, discriminatory pay tends to have a cumulative effect--what may seem like a minor discrepancy at first builds up over time. By the time the discrimination is noticed, it would be too late to file a charge under the Supreme Court's ruling. These facts were undoubtedly the reason why a jury of her peers originally awarded Lilly Ledbetter more than $3.5 million; finding ``more likely than not'' that sex discrimination during her 19-year career led to her being paid substantially less than her male counterparts. 
   By passing this legislation here today, Congress will be heeding Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's call to stand up and ensure that no American's income should be determined by race, sex, creed, color, or sexuality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the measure before us today has been introduced by the gentleman from California, a ranking member of the committee and a subcommittee Chair, HOWARD BERMAN. It is intended to restore the historical checks and balances to the process by which interim U.S. Attorneys are appointed. It will repair a breach in the law that has been a major contributing factor in the recent termination of eight able and experienced United States Attorneys and their replacement with interim appointments. It has gathered much attention across this Nation, and not just in government and legal circles. 
   The full circumstances surrounding these terminations are still coming to light, but what we know is already very troubling. The reports about these terminations are particularly troubling in that the United States Attorneys are among the most powerful government officials we have. They have the power to seek convictions and bring the full weight of the United States Government against any citizen or company that they deem important and eligible for prosecution. They can negotiate plea agreements. They can send people to prison for years and years. And frequently, the mere disclosure of a criminal investigation can destroy reputations and careers. 
   These are awesome powers. And so we on the Judiciary Committee consider it absolutely essential that the American people have full confidence in those entrusted to exercise these powers and that they do so with complete integrity and free from political influence of any kind. 
   The committee's investigation into these troubling circumstances is continuing. The longer time goes on, the more we know; and the more we know, the more we are troubled about what has been going on in the Department of Justice. It has already become abundantly clear that the gaping vulnerability in the law, which has placed the independence and integrity of our prosecutorial system in jeopardy, needs to be repaired as quickly as possible; and that is what we are here to do today. 
   What helped bring these troubling circumstances about, what helped make it possible for high-level Justice Department and White House officials to even entertain the notion that they could, as appears to be the case, target certain U.S. Attorneys for an unprecedented mid-course purge was an obscure provision adequately and anonymously slipped into the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act conference report in March of 2006. Without any debate, let alone the benefit of a single hearing in either body, this provision, added at the behest of the Justice Department's top political appointees to significantly enhance the power to appoint interim U.S. Attorneys without having to subject their appointments to customary safeguard of Senate confirmation. It was a middle-of-the-night insertion, and we are here to correct that. 
   Indeed, the administration's plan to exploit the new provision to bypass the Senate confirmation process is now well documented. As bluntly explained  by internal e-mails we received, and they now number in the hundreds, although we get them late on Friday nights, by the Attorney General's then-chief of staff, for example, discussing their plan to install the former Republican National Committee political operative, the new provision would enable them to ``give far less deference to home State Senators and thereby get our preferred person appointed and do it far faster and more efficiently at less political cost to the White House.'' 
   This is outrageous. The Senate has already acted. The time is now. We need to move as rapidly as we can to correct this very serious error that casts a question upon the integrity of a very, very important part of our government, the Department of Justice.  
   Speaker, the bill before us today, introduced by my friend Howard Berman, will restore the historical checks and balances to the process by which interim U.S. Attorneys are appointed. It will repair a breach in the law that has been a major contributing factor in the recent termination of eight able and experienced United States Attorneys and their replacement with interim appointments. 
   The full circumstances surrounding these terminations are still coming to light, but what we know already is very troubling. 
   In one instance, the primary apparent qualification for the President's chosen replacement was that he had been an aggressive political operative at the Republican National Committee, thereby putting himself on Karl Rove's A list. In several other instances, the U.S. Attorney was in the midst of a sensitive public corruption investigation, and there were reportedly complaints from Republicans that the investigation was being pursued too aggressively against a fellow Republican, or was not being pursued aggressively enough against a Democrat. 
   The reports about these terminations are particularly troubling in that U.S. Attorneys are among our most powerful government officials. They not only have power to seek convictions and negotiate plea agreements that can send people to prison for years. The mere disclosure of a criminal investigation can destroy reputations and careers. 
   These are awesome powers, and it is absolutely essential that the American people can have full confidence those entrusted to exercise these powers do so with complete integrity and free from improper political influence. 
   The Committee's investigation into these troubling circumstances is continuing, and we will know more, and we will leave extended discussion of them for another day. But it has already become abundantly clear that the gaping vulnerability in the law, which has placed the independence and integrity of our prosecutorial system in jeopardy, needs to be repaired as quickly as possible. And that is what we are here to do today. 
   What helped bring these troubling circumstances about--what helped make it possible for high-level Justice Department and White House officials to even entertain the notion that they could, as appears to be the case, target certain U.S. Attorneys for an unprecedented mid-course purge--was an obscure provision quietly and anonymously slipped into the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act conference report in March 2006. 
   Without any I debate, let alone the benefit of a single hearing in either body, this provision was added at the behest of the Justice Department's top political appointees, to significantly enhance their power to appoint interim U.S. Attorneys, without having to subject the appointments to the customary safeguard of Senate confirmation. 
   Indeed, the Administration's deliberate plan to exploit the new provision to bypass the Senate confirmation process is now well documented. As bluntly explained in an internal e-mail by the Attorney General's then chief of staff, for example, discussing their plan to install the former RNC political operative, the new provision would enable them to ``give far less deference to home-State Senators and thereby get (1) our preferred person appointed and (2) do it far faster and more efficiently, at less political cost to the White House.'' 
   Traditionally--since the Civil War--whenever a U.S. Attorney left office, and until the Senate could confirm a replacement, the local federal district court has appointed someone to fill the position on an interim basis. This was a neutral means of ensuring that permanent appointments remained the shared responsibility of the President and the Senate--to encourage the President to send a nomination to the Senate promptly, and to encourage the Senate to act promptly on the nomination. 
    In 1986, at the request of Attorney General Ed Meese, the law was modified to authorize the Attorney General to make short-term interim U.S. Attorney appointments, for up to 120 days. But if a permanent U.S. Attorney had not been confirmed by the end of that 120 days, the district court retained authority to make the appointment for the remainder of the interim period. This procedure, codified in 28 U.S.C. &#167;546, preserved the incentives on the Executive and Legislative Branches to work together on the nomination and confirmation of a permanent replacement. 
   That balanced approach was unceremoniously jettisoned a year ago, and with it respect for the Senate's role in ensuring that the President's power to hire and fire U.S. Attorneys at will was not abused at the expense of prosecutorial integrity. 
   The stealth provision in the 2006 USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act completely removed the district court as a backstop in the interim appointment process, turning over sole power to the Attorney General, to unilaterally make interim appointments, for an unlimited time, with no obligation to involve the Senate, or the Judicial Branch, or anyone else. 
   H.R. 580 will restore the checks and balances that have historically provided a critical safeguard against politicization of U.S. Attorneys. First, it repeals the 2006 change to section 546, keeping the Attorney General's interim appointment role, but limiting it to 120 days, as it was before. 
   Second, the bill clarifies that section 546 is the only way to make interim U.S. Attorney appointments. This additional change has become necessary in light of indications, documented by the Congressional Research Service, that the Justice Department has used, and could again use, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to evade the intent of a tightened section 546. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step in restoring legal safeguards against abuse of Executive power to politicize core government functions that need to be above political calculations in their execution. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (INTERIM APPOINTMENT OF UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds only to say, Mr. HOWARD COBLE, I recognize you as a sincere and experienced and valued member of this committee, and I appreciate the circumstances that you are in this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the subcommittee chairwoman, LINDA SANCHEZ of California, and I thank her for the excellent job that she has done. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 580, a bill to revoke the Attorney General's unfettered authority to appoint U.S. Attorneys indefinitely. 
   This legislation would repeal a small provision, with enormous repercussions, that was placed into the USA PATRIOT Reauthorization Act conference report. The provision, which removed the 120-day limit for interim appointment of U.S. Attorneys, allows interim appointees to serve indefinitely and without Senate confirmation. 
   We now know that the provision was inserted into the conference report at the request of a Justice Department official. Clearly, the Justice Department's effort to insert this provision was just one part of the Bush administration's coordinated plan to purge U.S. Attorneys across the country for political reasons. 
   My suspicions about the role of this provision in the firing of at least eight U.S. Attorneys have been confirmed after reading the documents turned over by the Justice Department. We learned, for example, that in an e-mail to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers, former Attorney General Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson wrote: ``I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration policy we utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the Attorney General to make U.S. Attorney appointments.'' 
   The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan entity, has completed a report finding that these firings are unprecedented. Prior to the forced resignation of eight U.S. Attorneys in recent months, and outside the normal turnover of U.S. Attorneys that occurs with a new administration, only 10 U.S. Attorneys were forced to resign in the last 25 years. The 10 U.S. Attorneys cited in the CRS report were all fired for cause, most under a cloud of scandal. 
   H.R. 580, legislation offered by my friend and colleague from California, Representative HOWARD BERMAN, provides the necessary legislative response to restore checks and balances in the U.S. Attorney appointment process by reinstating the 120-day limit on all interim appointments. 
   The bill also closes other potential loopholes through which Senate confirmation could be bypassed. It clarifies that section 546 of title 28 of the United States Code is the exclusive means of appointing interim U.S. Attorneys. 
   Additionally, the bill would apply retroactively to all U.S. Attorneys currently serving in an interim capacity. This would ensure that interim U.S. Attorneys appointed since the purge scheme was hatched are not permitted to serve indefinitely and without Senate confirmation. 
   At a legislative hearing on H.R. 580 before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law on March 6, this bill received strong support from the president of the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys, as well as a former Republican-appointed U.S. Attorney. It is also important to note that the Attorney General himself has expressed that he is not opposed to rolling back this provision of the PATRIOT Act. And if the Attorney General's claim that he was not aware of the Justice Department efforts to quietly insert this provision are true, it would seem he never wanted the PATRIOT Act changes to the U.S. Attorney selection process in the first place. 
   Additionally, the corresponding bill in the Senate received strong bipartisan support and passed by an overwhelming margin of 94-2. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must begin to restore the independence of U.S. Attorneys across the country and return to the bedrock principle of our court system that justice must be served objectively and without fear or favor.     
   While the consideration of H.R. 580 will not end the Judiciary Committee's ongoing investigation of the U.S. Attorney purge scheme, the passage of this legislation is a critical step in this process to close the loophole in the PATRIOT Act that this administration has improperly exploited for political purposes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the American people must have full confidence in the integrity and the independence of the United States Attorneys in charge of Federal prosecutions throughout the country, in every State. While they owe the President their appointments, once they are in their jobs their enforcement decisions must be unquestionably above politics; and that is why we are here today.  
   Senate confirmation is required for each one of them in an open and public process, and it is a critical safeguard against politicization of our prosecutorial system. This safeguard has been severely compromised by the secret change that has been referred to, and this bill restores the safeguards.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, to subcommittee Chairman Bobby Scott we owe a debt of gratitude, as well as to subcommittee Ranking Member Coble and, of course, the author of this bill, Elton Gallegly, who through the years has persevered to make us finally come to this day. I guess we should also thank about 303 Members of the House of Representatives that have stuck with us and supported this legislation all this time. My congratulations to all of you. I never thought that a measure that was not considered as grave and large as some of the issues that come before the House Judiciary Committee would meet with so much encouragement and support to get us to this day. I congratulate the House of Representatives and the leadership on both sides. 
   I join, of course, in this measure and would like to make this point: this legislation includes a special provision clarifying the fact that it only supersedes State law in the case of a direct or irreconcilable conflict. The Humane Society is with us. The American Veterinary Medical Association is with us. The National Association of Sheriffs is with us, and hundreds and hundreds of local law enforcement agencies in every State of the Union have all come out in support of this basic, commonsense, long overdue legislation. 
   I thank those who have worked so tirelessly across the years to bring us to this day where this bill has now come before the floor.  
   I'm pleased to join the growing list of supporters, including the 30 or so Members of the Judiciary Committee, that have decided to lend their support to this measure. 
   For far too long, the sponsors of abusive animal fighting events (including cockfight and dog fight promoters) have been permitted to freely engage in such activities without any real fear of prosecution. Fortunately, the bill before us seeks to change that. 
   First, the legislation provides up to the three years in jail for people who transport animals in interstate commerce with the purpose of participating in an animal fighting venture. Current law only treats such offenses as a mere misdemeanor. However, research has shown us that simple misdemeanor criminal penalties  don't provide enough of a meaningful deterrent, especially when thousands of dollars are wagered on a single dog or cock fight. 
   Second, the legislation makes it unlawful to sell or ship instruments in interstate commerce that are designed to be attached to the leg of a bird for use in an animal fighting venture. Razor sharp knives, commonly known as ``slashers'', are oftentimes attached to the legs of a bird to make cockfights even more violent. This provision would prohibit such activity, and subject any violators to a term of imprisonment of up to three years in jail. 
   Finally, the legislation includes a special provision clarifying that this measure only supersedes state law in the case of a direct or irreconcilable conflict. 
   The Humane Society, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Sheriffs Association, and nearly 400 local law enforcement agencies covering all 50 states have all come out in support of this legislation. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to lend their support to this bipartisan, commonsense measure as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, the temporary FISA law we enacted in haste as a stopgap last August expires Saturday. We want to replace that law with a well-considered one which appropriately addresses both our security needs and our constitutional values. 
   The House passed a version of that well-considered law in my view in November, the RESTORE Act. We have been waiting for the Senate to pass its version so that we could compare it with ours and decide together on the best course of action. We have also been waiting on access to classified documents regarding what telecom companies may have done in recent years to assist our government with surveillance on United States citizens outside the bounds of law at that time. 
   The 15-day extension we passed 2 weeks ago was intended to give us time to consider the Senate bill, thought to be on the verge of passing, and to review the classified documents. Unfortunately, it has turned out not to be enough time. 
   The Judiciary Committee members, 38 in number, have not all seen the documents. We have only had clearance for 19 of those members to gain that access to the classified documents that we have been asking for for over 1 year. The review process is unavoidably somewhat cumbersome and inefficient. Even today, as I stated in my letter to the White House, we still do not have access to numerous critical legal documents. In addition, those documents that we have reviewed have left many of our questions unanswered and, as a matter of fact, raised a number of new ones. 
   Moreover, the Senate has just passed its version of a long-term surveillance law. It differs from the House version in ways that may have major ramifications on the freedoms that we cherish. 
   So we need a bit more time. The measure before us will give us 3 weeks, 21 days, not much time in the view of some, but enough, I believe, to permit us to reach an appropriate resolution on this matter of utmost importance. Therefore, your Committee on the Judiciary comes before you to urge support for this short-term extension. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise disappointed that the President of the United States is attempting to short-circuit the legislative process and force Congress into an impulsive decision by vowing to veto this short-term extension before us now that would permit us to legislate responsibly. 
   It is beyond me how the Chief Executive of this country who truly wants an effective FISA reform, who truly cares about enacting sound legislation to protect Americans' lives and liberty, who truly respects the prerogatives of Congress in shaping that legislation, could seriously threaten us with the prospect of vetoing this legislation. 
   It is especially disturbing to think that he might refuse to accept a brief extension of his own surveillance program in order to ramrod a decision his way on telecom immunity before we can know what it is we are giving immunity to. 
   I am also disappointed that some of my friends, Members of the minority, whom I have always considered to be responsible legislators, have spoken today in support of the President's attempt to once again bludgeon us to enact sweeping new wiretapping powers for the executive branch without giving the legislative branch the time to ensure that the way it is done holds true to our most cherished American values. 
   I hope that these few observations do not reflect widely shared sentiments in the minority, and I would hope that we would not lend credence to the President's veto threat. I don't think we should have to legislate under that kind of intimidation. It amounts to a demand that we abandon and abdicate our sworn constitutional duty. 
   I hope that we would all agree that we need to consider FISA reform responsibly with the care it deserves, with the importance that every American attaches to it, and to preserve the prerogatives of the House to have our voice heard. 
   This demand that we act irresponsibly reflects no credit upon the process. We should instead remind him that we are the legislative branch and remind him that he must show some patience and allow the Congress to responsibly work its will. 
   If the President were to veto this brief extension of his own surveillance program and if that in any way compromises our national security, no amount of political blustering would change the fact that it would be him who has put our Nation at risk by refusing to participate responsibly in the legislative process. 
   Now, I can't truly imagine that happening. I hope that with a strong bipartisan vote for this commonsense, temporary measure, we can convince our President to help us take this responsible step to ensure that Americans are appropriately protected against threats to their liberty as well as threats to their security. I hope that the result of this discussion will turn into a sound bipartisan vote in support of this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I would grant myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the discussion that we're engaging in, but at this point I rise to make the case that this is not a debate exclusively about immunity. There are other key differences that we should and, I think, want to consider. 
   For example, the Senate bill, which we've just examined, does not contain sufficient provisions to guard against reverse targeting of United States citizens. I think that's an important matter that needs our continued consideration. 
   The Senate bill permits surveillance to commence without judicial approval of the essential procedures that will be used to ensure that there's no surveillance of United States persons without appropriate individualized warrants. I think that's pretty important. 
   The Senate bill further does not require the Inspector General or the Justice Department to investigate the President's warrantless surveillance program. The House bill requires this investigation. 
   And so I don't think we need to be stampeded into a vote by threats from the executive or from the mathematical perfection of the other side in suggesting where the majorities ally in this body. The 21 signers of the letter are entitled to get some answers to these questions just as everyone else that didn't sign the letter are. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the Record at this point from cnn.com, ``Phone companies cut FBI wiretaps due to unpaid bills.''

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I would begin by yielding myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, after delaying consideration of the House-passed RESTORE Act for months, just last night the other body has passed a very troubling FISA bill. Their action comes only 3 days before the expiration of the temporary bill which expires this Saturday, and we have a number of problems with the legislation coming from the other side. 
   First, it provides blanket retroactive amnesty for telecom companies that took part in warrantless surveillance programs. Now I have never heard, in my legal experience, that retroactive immunity, or immunity of any kind, can be given when you don't know what it is being given for, and that presents quite a large problem. Then there is no FISA Court review of certain authorizations generally referred to as ``basket warrants'' until after the wiretapping starts. It creates a problem that we would use the additional 21 days that we are asking for, I think that would come under very close examination. 
   And then there are much weaker provisions on stopping other warrantless wiretapping, for example, reverse targeting of U.S. citizens and the question of sufficient congressional oversight. 
   So based on the documents that have been provided so far, and they are far from complete, I have letters of requests in great detail, the case for amnesty has really not been made. 
   The administration's bluster and fear-mongering don't do any of us very well. That doesn't serve the purpose of our legislative function and our relationship with the several branches of government. And it should be understood as perhaps another attempt to use national security for partisan ends. 
   The administration's view is that the President, as Commander in Chief, can spy on Americans in the United States without a warrant, a proposition that is very seriously contested by many of our constitutional and civil liberties authorities. Congress is committed to providing the executive branch the tools it needs. But we need to do so to make sure that the power to spy on Americans is not subject to abuse or misuse. All of us in this body think that that is of paramount concern. 
   The administration has requested that the Congress rubber-stamp its proposed legislation but has refused to provide Congress the information that would even purport to support the legislation. It is the administration that has unfortunately played politics with this issue. The administration still hasn't provided us with all of our requested documents. 
   Just yesterday, another letter was sent requesting the same information we have been asking for for so long. The House can't simply be stonewalled or ignored. And it cannot exercise its constitutional responsibility and then be bullied to rubber-stamp complicated and important legislation that impacts on national security. 
   We hope that the measure before us today will be passed resoundingly in a bipartisan way.

   The motion to recommit goes beyond the scope of the bill, and beyond the scope of the Protect America Act the bill temporarily extends, to make permanent changes to the FISA law, including retroactive legal amnesty for telecom companies who may have broken the law in cooperating with earlier surveillance activities. Because it goes beyond the scope of the bill and deals with a different purpose, it is not germane.

   Members of the House, I rise to commend the gentleman from Indiana, Peter Visclosky, for helping us provide more bulletproof vests to policemen. It's kind of amazing that we need to pass a law to get more bulletproof vests for policemen. 
   More than 800,000 police officers put their lives at risk daily to protect our community. Many of them are protected by bullet-resistant armor, but an alarming number of officers are not afforded this protection because of local budget constraints. So this bill created by the gentleman from Indiana tries to take care of this problem. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program was established back in 1998 to assist State and local law enforcement agencies in securing protective equipment necessary to safeguard the lives of officers. And the program administered by the Department of Justice provides up to half of the matching grants--50 percent of the matching grants for the purchase of protective vests. Since then, the program has enabled thousands of jurisdictions across our Nation to purchase more than 1.5 million such vests. 
   It's estimated 3,000 law enforcement officers have survived shootings in part due to their bulletproof vest. In recognition of its vital role in the protection of these officers, the Bulletproof Vest Program has been extended, and it's set to expire at the end of fiscal year 2009 unless we extend it again. 
   Here we reauthorize the program for an additional 3 years so that to help more of our law enforcement officers, and I doubt if there's a Member in this House that isn't in full support of this measure. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (UNITED STATES-INDIA NUCLEAR COOPERATION APPROVAL AND NONPROLIFERATION ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition today to the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. If this body ratifies this agreement today, it will be the first time that a country that is not a member of the Nonproliferation Treaty will have the benefits of nuclear trade without any of the responsibilities associated with possessing unstable, dangerous material on the planet. 
   Earlier this month, the Nuclear Suppliers Group made the ill-fated decision to approve an India-specific waive from its guidelines requiring full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards as a condition for nuclear supply and trade. The decision ends the 34-year global ban on nuclear trade with India, a nation which has defied international norms regarding responsible and acceptable nuclear energy use. 
   Now, the Bush Administration is attempting bilateral deal with India that would exacerbate and codify the NSG's mistake. Under the deal, India would only have to separate its unregulated military and regulated civilian nuclear programs, not cease the pursuit of additional nuclear weapons. Additionally, India is allowed to keep 1,000 bombs worth of nuclear material outside of IAEA safeguards. In other words, by agreeing to provide material to satisfy India's civilian nuclear needs, America would be freeing up unregulated material for use in its military bomb production program. 
   How a deal like this brings India into conformance with international norms of state nonproliferation behavior--something the administration claims--is beyond me. Freeing up more unregulated nuclear material for bomb making doesn't sound like a safety measure. It sounds like a recipe for irresponsible use. 
   The economic benefits of this deal have also been greatly exaggerated by the Bush Administration. Russia and other regional states are already actively negotiating supply deals with India; leaving little opportunity for US energy companies half a world away. 
   However, more important than the potential economic aspects of the deal for our domestic energy production industry, or even the increased ability of India to create nuclear weapons, is the drastic effect the deal would have on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, one of the most sacrosanct and honored multilateral agreements in international law. 
   The NPT is the single most effective bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons materials and technology. The treaty currently has 189 signatories and only four non-signatories. Under the treaty, NPT countries which possess nuclear weapons agree not to share weapon making materials or information. Similarly, NPT countries without weapons agree not to pursue these materials or information. 
   By agreeing to supply a nation that has not agreed to abide by these solemn pledges, this agreement would blow a hole in the NPT. Previously, our government required states to sign the NPT if they wanted to engage in nuclear trade with us. With this deal, the leverage inherent in that tradeoff will be gone. What moral authority will we or the international community have over Iran, or any other NPT signatory for that matter, if it actively seeks nuclear materials in violation of the treaty? 
   In the waning days of an administration that has shredded international law and our credibility around the world, why is this body prepared today to add to this tarnished legacy? Let there be no doubt, a vote for this bill is a vote for a more dangerous world. For the sake of peace and the sanctity of the rule of law, I encourage my colleagues to oppose the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I rise not to oppose this legislation but to raise a very serious concern about a provision in the bill to mandate that the National Institutes of Health, NIH, change its public access policy for journal articles. Under this provision, the current, voluntary program to provide journal articles to NIH will now become a federally mandated requirement that private and nonprofit sector copyright owners provide their materials for posting--free-of-charge--by NIH on its publicly available websites. 
   I sympathize with the laudable goal of widely disseminating the results of publicly-funded research that comprises some of the information contained in these journals. And I am pleased to note that the bill does contain language stating ``that the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law.'' I trust that this provision will mean that the agency must cooperate with journal owners and authors to assure that their rights are fully protected and that they receive just compensation for this use of their works. 
   However, I believe this new mandate will have unintended and negative consequences and will set worrisome precedents that may in the future actually diminish the amount of scientific, technical and medical information available to the public. By severely restricting the scope of protection for a critical class of copyrighted works, this provision could ultimately reduce incentives for publishers to continue to make substantial investments in conducting peer review of research prior to publication. 
   Finally, this provision could send a mixed message to our trading partners about the importance of intellectual property rights, IPR, to our economy. Such a message may make it difficult to advocate strong IPR protection and enforcement abroad, including the U.S. government's efforts to spread respect for IPR abroad and slow the trend in compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents by other nations. 
   Because this provision contains significant implications for IPR, the Committee on the Judiciary should have been given an opportunity to hold a hearing to further explore the complex issues involved.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (NEED-BASED EDUCATIONAL AID ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I support the bill cosponsored by Representative BILL DELAHUNT and Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH. H.R. 1777, the ``Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2007,'' removes the current sunset attached to an exemption in the antitrust laws that permits schools to agree to award financial aid on a need-blind basis and to use common principles of needs analysis in making their determinations. 
   The exemption also allows for agreement on the use of a common aid application form and for the exchange of student financial information through a third party. 
   In 1992, Congress passed a similar temporary exemption, which was first extended in 1994, then again extended in 1997, and once again extended in 2001. The exemption passed in 2001 expires later this year. During the years of its operation, we have been able to witness and evaluate the exemption, and we have found that it seems to be working. 
   The need-based financial aid system makes financial aid available to the broadest number of students solely on the basis of demonstrated need. The schools have been concerned that without this exemption, they would be required to compete--through financial aid awards--for the very top students, which could result in a system in which the very top students receive an excess of the available aid while the rest of the applicant pool receives less or none at all. Ultimately, such a system could undermine the principles of need-based aid and need-blind admissions. 
   Because the exemption has thus far appeared warranted, I support H.R. 1777 and hope that it will continue to protect need-based aid and need-blind admissions, and preserve the opportunity for all students to attend one of the Nation's most prestigious schools.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. I thank the Speaker, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, this Friday, April 4, will mark the 40th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in 1968. 
   I note that, once again, our distinguished colleague from Georgia, JOHN LEWIS, has introduced a bipartisan House Resolution calling upon all Americans, on this anniversary, to pause and remember the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and I'd like to acknowledge the many members of the Judiciary Committee supporting this resolution, LAMAR SMITH, GERALD NADLER, ZOE LOFGREN, BOBBY SCOTT, KEITH ELLISON, STEVE COHEN and others. 
   Dr. King was not only our greatest civil rights leader, but he was also the person that personally has given me the political, philosophical undergirding to attempt to transfer his belief system into some of the objectives of the United States through the Congress. What a leader he was. 
   I shall be in Memphis this Friday celebrating, with the distinguished gentleman from New York, Harry Bellefonte, and many others, the work that he has done in trying to bring justice, understanding, full employment, an economic system, and end the war in this country and in this world. 
   He addressed, on the night before his assassination, the sanitation workers in Memphis at the Mason Temple. And I don't know about you, but it seemed to me that he had a premonition that he was spending the last days of his life on earth in this cause. He seemed to have projected his understanding of how fleeting his life may have been. 
   Of course, I'm also connected to Dr. King by his family, Coretta Scott King and their children, and of course, the unbelievably courageous Mrs. Rosa Parks, who later came to Detroit and honored my office by working there for many, many years. 
   And so I'm very pleased to join in with this re-examination and remembrance of our great leader, to me, one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. And so I'm proud to stand before you as the chairman of the Judiciary to bring this resolution forward. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ARTS REQUIRE TIMELY SERVICE (ARTS) ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, H.R. 1312 is a bipartisan measure intended to address the extended delays in visa processing faced by nonprofit arts organizations when they invite foreign artists to perform in the United States. 
   Hosting a performance by a foreign artist or arts group requires, obviously, a great deal of planning. And the host organization has to calendar the event, advertise it, and sell tickets far in advance. And these efforts are made with the expectation that the visa petitions filed by the guest performers will be adjudicated in time for their arrival in the United States. If their adjudication is delayed, it causes a tremendous disruption and has led some arts organizations in the world to stop engaging foreign artists altogether because they can't risk the expensive canceling of performers. 
   Performances by foreign artists give American audiences the opportunity to experience a variety of arts traditions. And when they're called off, it's not just the host organization and the audience that bears the cost, the cancelled show impacts the local economy as well. 
   Current law requires the Department of Homeland Security to process petitions for O and P visas within 2 weeks of receipt of a completed petition. And the Department has implemented a premium 15-day processing for a $1,000 fee, but when a visa is required to be processed in 14 days, it seems particularly unreasonable to ask a nonprofit entity to pay $1,000 for a 15-day service. So, what we do in this measure is strike a balance by giving the Department 30 days, more than twice the current processing time, and if the visa is not processed in 30 days and the petitioner is a nonprofit organization, the bill requires the Department to provide premium processing for no additional fee. 
   I'm happy to say that my colleagues, the former Judiciary Committee Chair, James Sensenbrenner, and the current ranking member, Lamar Smith of Texas, have tried and worked with us to arrive at a solution similar to the one laid out in this bill. 
   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ESTABLISHING MARCH 2008 AS NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the measure before us calls attention to a critically important issue, the state of our Nation's criminal justice system. We do this by designating March as National Criminal Justice Month, because it will serve to raise awareness of the causes and consequences of crime, as well as our crime prevention efforts. It is a subject and an area that, for too long, we have not paid close attention to, and it is our feeling that this designation will have a great impact upon our work. 
   Millions of Americans have been victimized by crimes, and many millions more pass through our criminal justice system. We have more than 2 million Americans behind bars, I am sad to say. This means that almost one out of every 100 Americans is incarcerated. Among African American men between the ages of 20 and 34, one in nine are behind bars. What a tragedy. What a waste of human life and potential. 
   The New York Times observed, ``We have become a prison nation.''  
   Prison Nation 
   After three decades of explosive growth, the nation's prison population has reached some grim milestones: More than 1 in 100 American adults are behind bars. One in nine black men, ages 20 to 34, are serving time, as are 1 in 36 adult Hispanic men. 
   Nationwide, the prison population hovers at almost 1.6 million, which surpasses all other countries for which there are reliable figures. The 50 states last year spent about $44 billion in tax dollars on corrections, up from nearly $11 billion in 1987. Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan and Oregon devote as much money or more to corrections as they do to higher education. 
   These statistics, contained in a new report from the Pew Center on the States, point to a terrible waste of money and lives. They underscore the urgent challenge facing the federal government and cash-strapped states to reduce their overreliance on incarceration without sacrificing public safety. The key, as some states are learning, is getting smarter about distinguishing between violent criminals and dangerous repeat offenders, who need a prison cell, and low-risk offenders, who can be handled with effective community supervision, electronic monitoring and mandatory drug treatment programs, combined in some cases with shorter sentences. 
   Persuading public officials to adopt a more rational, cost-effective approach to prison policy is a daunting prospect, however, not least because building and running jailhouses has become a major industry. 
   Criminal behavior partly explains the size of the prison population, but incarceration rates have continued to rise while crime rates have fallen. Any effort to reduce the prison population must consider the blunderbuss impact of get-tough sentencing laws adopted across the United States beginning in the 1970's. Many Americans have come to believe, wrongly, that keeping an outsized chunk of the population locked up is essential for sustaining a historic crime drop since the 1990's. 
   In fact, the relationship between imprisonment and crime control is murky. Some portion of the decline is attributable to tough sentencing and release policies. But crime is also affected by things like economic trends and employment and drug-abuse rates. States that lagged behind the national average in rising incarceration rates during the 1990's actually experienced a steeper decline in crime rates than states above the national average, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group. 
   A rising number of states are broadening their criminal sanctions with new options for low-risk offenders that are a lot cheaper than incarceration but still protect the public and hold offenders accountable. In New York, the crime rate has continued to drop despite efforts to reduce the number of nonviolent drug offenders in prison. 
   The Pew report spotlights policy changes in Texas and Kansas that have started to reduce their outsized prison populations and address recidivism by investing in ways to improve the success rates for community supervision, expanding treatment and diversion programs, and increasing use of sanctions other than prison for minor parole and probation violations. Recently, the Supreme Court and the United States Sentencing Commission announced sensible changes in the application of harsh mandatory minimum drug sentences. 
   These are signs that the country may finally be waking up to the fiscal and moral costs of bulging prisons.  
   Each year, we on all of our criminal justice systems spend more than $200 billion. The Pew Center Report states that Connecticut, Delaware, my own State of Michigan, Oregon, and Vermont spend as much or more money on corrections as they do on higher education. I think this is a disgraceful circumstance, and the policies of simply incarcerating increasing numbers of Americans without real opportunities for rehabilitation fail those who go through the criminal justice system, but, more than that, it hurts and diminishes every American. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I only have a little bit more to add, and so I yield myself a little more time. 
   This measure is a good one even though it comes a little late. Some may have noticed that this is for a celebration in March, and this is April. The reason is that we couldn't get it on the schedule before now, but there were many celebrations in connection with this matter that occurred. 
   I want to commend the judge and distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee from Texas who is managing the bill for his personal comments that he has brought to this matter today. I can imagine the kinds of things that not only him but members of the judiciary across this country are seeing, heartbreaking incidents, circumstances and experiences. 
   There are so many people that are incarcerated, they are in prison because of nonviolent offenses, of sentencing procedures that are really out of the hands of the court. People think of the unlimited powers of the judiciary. Many times they are restricted in terms of what it is they can do and how they can handle the matters that come before their courts. 
   I am impressed that our colleague would tell us of some of the things that move him in his experience in the judiciary. Now I don't want to think that he was driven from the judiciary to the Congress because that is like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire; but I am happy that he serves on the committee with great distinction, and we always are pleased to be able to work together on these kinds of matters. 
   In that spirit, I urge the support of H. Res. 945.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of the life of David Ray Ritcheson. I met David when he testified last April before the Judiciary Committee at a legislative hearing on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. He had the courage to come forward and testify about the need for that legislation and the impact of hate crimes on communities and families. He spoke from the heart and from experience. 
   David survived a horrific attack last year that required him to endure countless operations to restore his appearance and body. He was the voice for all who could not speak and did an admirable job. I believe that his story served as a I inspiration that led the House to pass the Hate Crime Prevention Act on May 3 of this year. 
   It is a tragedy that David will not see the fruit of his labor. The psychological wounds from the crimes inflicted upon him finally caused David to take his life on July 1, 2007. 
   I hope that this resolution will convey to his family and community the heartfelt condolences of this House. 
   It is also my hope that the brutal attack that he survived will not define his life. David Ritcheson should be remembered in his community as a friend, a classmate, a football player and a son. 
   House Resolution 535 is a fitting tribute to David Ray Ritcheson. It honors David as someone unafraid to stand and speak for the victims of hate crimes, so that we could act to protect other communities in the future. He will be remembered and missed. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this well-deserved resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act. After the longest period since the enactment of this law without an increase--over 9 years--America's poorest working families must get the raise they need and deserve. During this period in which Congress has failed to act to raise the wage of America's poorest workers, CEO and top executive pay has soared: the average annual compensation for a CEO at a Standard & Poor's 500 company rose from $3.7 to $9.1 million. Meanwhile, 28 States have seen the light and raised their State minimum wage to a level higher than the current Federal minimum wage of $5.15. 
   A full-time minimum wage worker in 2006 earns only $10,712 before taxes--nearly $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a family of three. This situation is unacceptable and immoral, as the wealth of our Nation, the richest in the world, continues to be built on the backs of the working poor. Working families in America are struggling to meet the rising costs of health care, gas, and housing, and $5.15 an hour is simply not enough. 
   It's time for Congress to stop turning a blind eye to the plight of those workers making minimum wage and to address their needs. That is why I supported increasing the minimum wage in the 109th Congress, and that is why I am an original co-sponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act in this the 110th Congress. 
   H.R. 2 will increase the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour in three steps over 2 years. Sixty days after enactment of this legislation, the wage would rise from the current $5.15 per hour to $5.85 per hour. One year later, it would rise to $6.55. And a year after that, it would finally rise to $7.25 per hour. 
   The minimum wage needs to be raised not just for the goods and services it enables a person to buy but for the self-esteem and self-worth if affords. Wages must be adequate for workers to provide for themselves and their families with dignity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call for the passage of H.R. 4156, the ``Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Act.'' The war in Iraq cannot be won through the use of military force or another troop surge. The majority of the American people do not support the war in Iraq; a recent study stated that nearly 7 in 10 Americans oppose the war. Since the war began in 2003, 3,859 brave U.S. troops have died in Iraq. In 2007 the death toll has already reached 860 soldiers who have lost their lives, making it the worst year yet for the American military in Iraq. Currently, 28,400 soldiers have been wounded in Iraq since the war began with 12,750 suffering injuries so serious they were prevented from returning to duty. 
   President Bush's failed Iraq policies offer a war with no end in sight. There is no progress on political reconciliation between Shiites and Sunnis in the Iraqi government. Just this week, it was reported that the U.S. effort to organize nearly 70,000 local Sunni fighters to solidify security gains in Iraq is facing severe political and logistical challenges as the central government resists in incorporating them into the Iraqi police and army. Last month, the Shiite political alliance of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called the U.S. military to halt the recruitments of Sunnis. 
   The bill in the house tonight will require the start of the redeployment of U.S. forces within 30 days of enactment, with a goal completion of redeployment by December 15, 2008. It will require a transition in the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq from primarily combat to force protection and diplomatic protection; limited support to Iraqi security forces; and targeted counterterrorism operations. H.R. 4156 will prohibit deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq who are not fully trained and fully equipped. The legislation also calls for an extension to all U.S. Government agencies and personnel of the current prohibitions in the Army Field Manual against torture. The bill will also provide to meet the immediate need of our troops, but defers consideration of the remainder of the President's nearly $200 billion request. At the current rate of expenditure, the additional funds will last 4 months. 
   Many insist that American troops cannot leave Iraq until we have achieved victory; and democracy has been established. History has shown us that civil wars and insurgencies are ended only through rigorous diplomacy, economic development, and national reconciliation between former enemies; not by a troop surge and an endless war. Diplomacy works, and now more then ever is the time to implement the recommendations of the Baker Hamilton Commission, and call for a regional peace summit in the Middle East. 
   Let's bring all parties who are involved in the conflict to the peace table, so they can begin to resolve their differences. If international diplomacy ended the intractable conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Balkans, the conflict between Israel and Egypt, and Rwanda; then international diplomacy can work in Iraq. Once we begin the strategic withdrawal of U.S. troops out of Iraq, and show the Iraqi people we do not wish to occupy their country, then and only then can we begin the real possibility of having an effective international peace conference.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, Head Start has been the premiere early childhood education program in the United States since 1965. Since that time, it has benefited 20 million children and families and has become one of the cornerstones of this country's efforts to close the achievement gap, combat poverty, and provide all Americans with the opportunity to thrive. By passing the conference report to H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007, we will reinvigorate Head Start and help more children arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed. 
   The fact is that quality education and early engagement, from both parents and teachers, are essential for our kids' success. Recent findings from the congressionally mandated impact study found that after less than 1 year, Head Start narrowed the achievement gap by 45 percent in pre-reading skills and 28 percent in prewriting skills. Another large study found that Head Start graduates continue to gain ground after they leave the program. Furthermore, Head Start graduates are less likely to need special education services, to be left back a grade or to get into trouble with the law. They are more likely to go on to college and to have professional careers. 
   This bipartisan reauthorization improves teacher and classroom quality, strengthens Head Start's focus on school readiness, expands access to Head Start for more children, ensures that centers are well-run, boosts coordination between Head Start and State and local programs, and improves comprehensive services that help children by helping their families. 
   I commend and thank Congressmen KILDEE, CASTLE, and Chairman MILLER for their leadership on this critical legislation. Head Start has proven its self as a strong and effective program. The growth and success of millions of American children and families is living proof. We have a responsibility to embrace their success, support it, and strengthen it for years to come. I know that my colleagues will join me in sending this critical reauthorization to ensure the Head Start program meets its full potential.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to passing a funding bill that has a positive economic impact on our Nation, none is more important than the fiscal year appropriation for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development. 
   America's transportation system is being stretched beyond its capacity. Both public and private usage of highways, transit, and aviation systems are increasing at rates far outpacing infrastructure investment. A decaying surface transportation system costs the U.S. economy $78 billion annually in lost time and fuel while congestion adds significant pollution to the air, and substandard roads claim thousands of lives every year. 
   By investing $40 billion in the Nation's highway system for construction of new roads, repairs and improvements and $1 billion to address deficient bridges across America, H.R. 3074 honors the commitments to capital investment in highway and public transportation infrastructure made by Congress in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and will not increase the Federal budget deficit. 
   This bill also addresses many of our Nation's pressing housing needs, at a time when we are facing a housing crisis that has directly impacted millions of American homeowners and millions more as the effects have rippled through the U.S. and world economy. National estimates indicate that as many as 2.5 million mortgages will reset to higher interest rates in the near future. 
   The fiscal year 2008 appropriation for the Department of Housing and Urban Development also addresses the plight of homeless veterans. According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, one out of every three homeless men who is sleeping in a doorway, alley or box in our cities and rural communities has put on a uniform and served this country. By providing $75 million in housing vouchers to homeless veterans, we are beginning to address this problem by providing safe, affordable, permanent housing access to 7,500 of our homeless veterans. 
   Another housing program strongly supported by my constituents that this bill funds is the Section 8 Project Based Vouchers. If passed the conference report will allocate $6.4 billion, $405 million above 2007 and $568 million above the President's request, to provide affordable housing to 1.3 million low- and very low-income families and individuals, two-thirds of whom are elderly or disabled. 
   When we pass this bill today and send it to the President, the House of Representatives will be addressing the important challenges of keeping our Nation's transportation system safe and strong, ensuring that every American has adequate shelter, and doing so in a way that strengthens the economy.

   Mr. CONYERS. I also want everyone to know that the gentleman from Georgia's resolution, JOHN LEWIS, Members will be able to join on it up until the time that we have a recorded vote in case there are Members coming back that may not be aware of this. 
   Today we have joined so many others in the Nation in honoring, in my judgment, our greatest American, Martin Luther King, Jr.     
   As the original author of the bill 4 days after his assassination, and one who worked on it for 15 years until it was passed in 1983, I am delighted to support and endorse the resolution of another supporter and one who worked closely with Dr. King, the gentleman from Georgia, JOHN LEWIS. 
   It was an interesting time for me yesterday. Not only did City Year, a national service movement that has young people pledging to work in schools, parks, and neighborhoods full-time for 10 months, headed by their president, Penny Bailey, in which I delivered my remarks about Dr. King, but I was also at Central Methodist Church in downtown Detroit, where Dr. King frequently came for his Easter or the Friday before Easter addresses, and where I was honored on his last visit to be supported by his actual endorsement. 
   And so I come here doubly proud of the fact that I was able to work with Dr. King as a young lawyer, but also to enjoy his support. Much of it came, of course, from Rosa Parks, who left Alabama and came to Detroit when she couldn't get work anymore. And she was a seamstress. And I was very happy to welcome her to my congressional office, where she worked for more than two decades. And her and Dr. King's fame and recognition kept growing and growing as she was called around the world to receive tributes. 
   And I remember Dr. King's very important receiving of the Nobel Prize. And it was about the question of peace. And it was not just racial discrimination. Dr. King was not a one-note person. He was a visionary. Jobs, justice, economic justice, political justice, and peace. 
   And we find ourselves wrapped up in these same considerations even today as we begin the third week of the 110th Congress. We need voter integrity. We need protection for those who seek the ballot. But more than anything else, I am reminded of the fact that we need to find a way out of the war in Iraq, an unnecessary, sad occasion in our history. 
   And you keep thinking, what would King have said? And I remember that one thing he said is that those who fail to talk about what is important really miss their chance in history to do something that is significant. 
   Madam Speaker, because we have so many speakers, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank the Members that have participated in this activity. We will have 5 days to continue to introduce our comments into the Congressional Record, and I also remind those that would like to join in the cosponsorship of Congressman Lewis' resolution, they still have an opportunity to do so. 
   Madam Speaker, I will introduce into the RECORD five articles dealing with Dr. King. One is from the Washington Post entitled, ``From Dr. King, a reminder on Iraq.'' Another from the same source, ``The quest to keep King's legacy alive.'' Another, ``Walking just like King did.'' Another, ``Democrats hail civil rights leader King.'' Finally, the last one, ``Martin Luther King papers go on display.'' 
   Madam Speaker, what I would conclude with is the pleasure that I have in seeing this holiday increasingly observed from year-to-year. Martin Luther King's birthday is not a shopping day. It is not a day off. It is not a day that you worry about getting some things done around the house. There are untold thousands of celebrations, some large, some small, some in churches, some signified by marches. There are so many different ways that he is being observed. 
   I was so pleased yesterday to be at the church that Dr. Martin Luther King had the privilege of addressing on numerous occasions. Then earlier I was with some very young people who were just learning about Dr. King, and they were taking a day on instead of a day off. They are working with schools and other youngsters in parks and recreation, in the City Year agency led by Penny Bailey. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the Congress under the leadership of the gentleman from Georgia would have this resolution brought to the floor today.  
   The Quest To Keep King's Legacy Alive  
   On Monday, the country honors the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who would have been 78 years old. The civil rights leader, who was assassinated in 1968 at the age of 39, launched many of his efforts from the pulpit. To mark his birthday, religious leaders were asked: Is King's legacy of social activism still alive in the faith community today? 
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder of the Rainbow/Push Coalition: ``The activist black churches are still the conscience of our nation. . . . I was with Dr. King on his last birthday. We must remember that a lot of churches didn't support King then. He was expelled from the National Baptist Convention. Our mission today is to green line a red-lined America. It is good to talk about raising the minimum wage in Congress, but for those who don't have jobs, the issue doesn't touch them. We need to continue to work on an urban agenda.'' 
   Rabbi Marla J. Feldman, director of the Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism: ``Dr. King's legacy is very much still alive and his legacy continues to inspire the faith community across the country. I know that . . . reformed congregations around the country will do something special for the King holiday to honor his legacy. . . . There will be congregations all over the country involved in social activist enterprises, including in the Washington, D.C., area. All of the rabbis that I know will be preaching about Dr. King and the issues that we are wrestling with today, such as economic justice and the war in Iraq.'' 
   The Rev. Artie L. Polk, assistant pastor of Mount Gilead Baptist Church in the District and founder of the Martin Luther King memorial breakfast celebration in Prince George's County: ``It is a real challenge to keep the King legacy alive, especially in light of this new prosperity gospel where preachers are talking about name it and claim it. Too many people are focused today on themselves instead of keeping alive King's legacy of service and commitment to the least of these.'' 
   Mohammed Shameem, a broadcast engineer from Bowie who volunteers at the Prince George's Muslim Association in Lanham: ``More so than ever before, people of the faith community should adhere to Dr. King's principles in terms of equality and unity in the community because our civil rights are being eroded today, and the civil rights of Muslims are being trampled upon. Social activism calls for pointing out injustice. Hardworking and innocent Muslims are being profiled just because of their faith. A group of imams were stopped in the airport because they were being profiled.'' 
   Bishop Adam Jefferson Richardson, prelate of the 2nd Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church: ``The movement is still regarded as effective for that time, but that style has changed. The frightful part is that in the old days, there was a theological mandate to do social activism, now among Generation Next, there is an emphasis on acquisition and materialism, much to the exclusion as to what is good for the whole community. There is nothing wrong with a prosperity message, but you have to guide people to understand the whole gospel, which also includes helping others; it can't be selfcentered, it has to be others-oriented.'' 
   Rabbi Douglas Heifetz of the Oseh Shalom Congregation in Laurel: ``Yes! King's legacy is alive today. It needs to be spread far and near. For example, the Jewish community has been extremely active in working with a coalition of other groups to call for an end to the genocide in Darfur because this is massive human rights abuse on a wide scale. We are called to follow King's legacy because the Hebrew Bible calls for ongoing social transformation to affect the lives of people, paying special attention to the lives of those who are most in need.'' 
   Auxiliary Bishop Martin D. Holley of the Archdiocese of Washington: ``King's dream is very much alive today. It is very prophetic, especially his letter from the Birmingham jail. Here was a man who believed so much in the dignity of the human person that he was willing to go to jail for it He led by example. He went beyond making statements. He paid a heavy price. He gave his life for all people.'' 
   Cain Hope Felder, professor at the Howard University School of Divinity and founder of the Biblical Institute for Social Change: ``I am sick and tired of hearing Dr. King's 'I Have a Dream' speech when the daily reality is that for an increasing number of Americans, and the African American poor in particular, living is a nightmare. Dr. King's legacy is barely alive today. There needs to be a vigorous effort for religious leaders to be far more proactive than they have been in the past two decades of co-optation.''   
   From Dr. King, A Reminder on Iraq  
   Forty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom the nation will honor on Monday, took to the pulpit of Riverside Church in New York City at a meeting organized by Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam. The date was April 4, 1967, one year before his assassination in Memphis. 
   King said he was in New York because his conscience had left him no choice. In his speech, ``Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence,'' King declared: ``That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.'' 
   King acknowledged the reluctance of some people to speak out on Vietnam--the same hesitation some Americans may have today over voicing their concerns about Iraq. People, he explained, ``do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war.'' 
   But King concluded that too much was at stake. He and the other religious and lay leaders were moved by what the conflict in Vietnam was doing to the United States. Vietnam, King said, was consuming American troops and money like ``some demonic, destructive suction tube'' even as that war was laying waste to the Vietnamese people and to America's standing in the world. 
   And on this Martin Luther King Jr. Day, in 2007. 
   More than 3,000 Americans have been killed in Iraq, while 22,000 others have been wounded. Billions of dollars that could have been invested here at home have been spent there, a lot of it wasted, some of it stolen, plenty of it unaccounted for. And Iraqis in Baghdad, who cowered for decades under a brutal dictator, have been living in the midst of violence almost continuously since Saddam Hussein was deposed. 
   ``We are creating enemies faster than we can kill them'' read a bumper sticker in Washington this week. 
   Now enter George W. Bush--the president who got America into this debacle through a series of misjudgments that would make Alfred E. Neuman look brilliant. This week  Bush announced plans to plop down thousands of additional troops in the middle of a sectarian war and to shell out billions of additional dollars to pacify a war-weary Iraqi population that, truth be told, wants America gone. 
   Why trust this administration? 
   Contrary to what Bush and his allies said: 
   There were no weapons of mass destruction poised to strike America and her allies. 
   A quick defeat of Hussein did not lead to chocolates and flowers in the streets of Baghdad. 
   An American invasion did not produce a unified, nonsectarian and Western-oriented Iraq or spark a desire for U.S.-style governance throughout the Arab world. 
   De-Baathification and the imposition of a market economy at gunpoint did not usher in a period of tranquility or the flowering of capitalism. 
   The Bush administration struck first because it had the power to strike and the arrogance to think, foolishly, that it could win and dominate the conquered on the cheap. 
   King spoke in '67 about ``the Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them.'' Witness the Bush team in Iraq. 
   Today they have a bloodbath on their hands to show for their labors, and Iran is on the verge of getting an Iraqi neighbor beyond its wildest dreams. 
   Yet even now, neoconservatives inside and outside of government are counseling Bush to remain in Iraq for years to prevent the Shiite-dominated regime from collapsing. They also are encouraging him to prepare for battle with Iran and Syria if those countries start meddling in Iraq--as if they aren't now. With what exactly and for how long we are supposed to do battle with Tehran and Damascus, the militaristic neocon noncombatants in Washington don't say. But then again, they have a tolerance for risk and cost that exceeds that of those who actually do the fighting and dying. 
   Forty years ago at Riverside Church, people of conscience declared that ``a time comes when silence is betrayal.'' They went beyond using their voices and votes when they agreed to break their silence. They responded, as King had urged, by matching their words with actions. ``We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest,'' King preached that day. 
   Yes, this is a different time and a different world. Global terrorism is a sobering reality. And America is on the right side in that war. To not fight back is tantamount to indulging a death wish. 
   But the first blow in Iraq, which was not a battleground for terrorism, was struck by Bush. He now, stubbornly and in the face of legitimate opposition, proposes to make matters worse. 
   Remember King and the words: ``A time comes when silence is betrayal.''   
   Martin Luther King Papers Go on Display  
   Atlanta.--The legacy of Coretta Scott King loomed large Monday over the first observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day since her death, with tributes at the church where her husband preached and visits to the tomb where both civil rights activists are now buried. 
   ``It is in her memory and her honor that we must carry this program on,'' said her sister-in-law, Christine King Farris, at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church. ``This is as she would have it.'' 
   Mayor Shirley Franklin urged the congregation not to pay tribute to King's message of peace and justice on his birthday and then contradict it the next. 
   ``Millions can't find jobs, have no health insurance and struggle to make ends meet, working minimum-wage jobs. What's going on?'' Franklin said, repeating a refrain from soul singer Marvin Gaye. 
   As King condemned the war in Vietnam 40 years ago, Ebenezer's senior pastor, the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, denounced the war in Iraq. 
   ``The real danger is not that America may lose the war,'' Warnock said. ``The real danger is that America may well lose its soul.'' 
   Not far from the church, visitors also paid homage to the Kings at their tomb. 
   ``They're together at last,'' said Daphne Johnson, who was baptized by King at Ebenezer. 
   Coretta Scott King died last year on Jan. 31 at age 78. An activist in her own right, she also fought to shape and preserve her husband's legacy after his death, and founded what would become the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. 
   Crowds lined up early at the Atlanta History Center to see the first exhibition of King's collected papers since they were returned to his hometown. The papers brought back difficult memories for some. 
   ``I remember a lot that I don't care to say,'' said Bertis Post, 70, of Atlanta, who marched with King in Alabama and Atlanta. ``I always wanted to see the papers in person--just to be here and be around what you believe.'' 
   The exhibit includes King's letter from the Birmingham jail, an early draft of his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize and more than 600 other personal documents. 
   In California, Stanford University released some of King's earliest sermons and other writings Monday, a decade after the documents were discovered in a moldy cardboard box in an Atlanta basement. 
   The texts include sermons written when King was a 19-year-old seminary student in 1948 until 1963. 
   In a 1949 sermon, King asked God to ``help us work with renewed vigor for a warless world, a better distribution of wealth and a brotherhood that transcends race or color.'' 
   Elsewhere, thousands observed the holiday by volunteering. Organizers expected about 50,000 people to participate in about 600 projects, said Todd Bernstein of the group MLK Day of Service. 
   President Bush, in an unannounced stop at a high school near the White House, said people should honor King by finding ways to give back to their communities. Classes were not in session but volunteers were sprucing up the school. 
   ``I encourage people all around the country to seize any opportunity they can to help somebody in need,'' Bush said. ``And by helping somebody in need you're honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King.'' 
   A historical marker was unveiled commemorating the site in Rocky Mount, N.C., where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered one of the earliest versions of his ``I Have A Dream'' speech. Hundreds of people attended a ceremony and march held near the high school where King spoke in November 1962. 
   Several hundred people gathered in West Columbia, S.C., for a breakfast prayer service, where the Rev. Brenda Kneece said King set the standard for sacrifice and vision. 
   King's ``vision became even more powerful because he understood the risks he was taking,'' said Kneece, executive minister of the South Carolina Christian Action Council. ``It's very important for our children to know that his sacrifice didn't win the war. We still have to keep at it'' 
   At Michigan State University, officials presented a one-day civil rights exhibit that displayed slave shackles, a document from King's voting rights march in Alabama and a fingerprint card for Rosa Parks made after her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man. 
   Marchers commemorating King Day in Troy, Ohio, were heckled by a group of seven neo-Nazi protesters shouting white power slogans and carrying signs, police said. There were no arrests. 
   And in North Carolina, 400 workers walked off the job or refused to show up at a huge Smithfield Foods Inc. hog slaughtering plant in Tar Heel after managers refused to grant the King holiday as a paid day off. 
   The company said a union request last week for the day off came too late for a change of work plans. 
   King, who would have turned 78 this year, was assassinated April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of a hotel in Memphis, Tenn. His confessed killer, James Earl Ray, was arrested two months later in London.   
   Walking Just Like King Did  
   The opening song was No. 540 in the hymnal, but most people at the Covenant Baptist Church tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. yesterday already knew the words well. 
 Lift ev'ry voice and sing, Til earth and heaven ring....... Stony the road we trod, Bitter the chast'ning rod.......  
   Inside the venerable Washington church, which was the destination for hundreds participating in the city's Martin Luther King Peace Walk, the throng sang the verses to James Weldon Johnson's civil rights anthem with gusto. 
 Yet with a steady beat, Have not our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed?  
   It seemed a fitting climax to the 18-block walk honoring King's birthday, which was led by DC Mayor Adrian M. Fenty and wound along Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE to the church on South Capitol Street. 
   It was one of numerous tributes across the region to the slain civil rights leader, who would have turned 78 yesterday. King was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968. 
   The peace walk began about 10 a.m. at V Street SE in Anacostia after speeches by the mayor and other officials, clergy members and civic leaders. Crowding the sidewalk for blocks, the marchers enjoyed balmy January weather as they strode south on the avenue, chanting slogans and carrying banners. 
   ``Today we're blessed. The weather is not a problem,'' said Denise Rolark Barnes, one of the walk's organizers. Over the years, King birthday commemorations have been affected by harsh winter weather, she noted. 
   While an official King Day parade in the District is scheduled for April 7, Barnes said many people believed King's birthday needed to be observed, too. ``Many of us who work and live along the avenue just felt as though there was something that we should do....... We said, `Rain, snow, sleet or hail, we would be out here,' and fortunately it doesn't look like we're going to get any of that.'' 
   Fenty (D) said the walk would be a simple statement ``We're going to just go out and put one foot in front of the other, and tell people that, although we made a lot of progress, we've got a long way to go.'' 
   He said it could be especially instructive for the children participating. 
   ``It won't be hard to explain to the kids how Martin Luther King was able to make so much progress just by walking when they're  going to do it themselves,'' Fenty said. ``I think they'll appreciate the hours and hours and months and months [spent walking] in the South to get civil rights advancements if we do a little bit of walking here ourselves.'' 
   Residents watched from front porches and windows as the march proceeded and a recording of one of King's speeches drifted from a passing car, along with the thump of pop music from another. 
   Past the avenue's multitude of churches the marchers went, past the nail salons and convenience stores. One house on the route was adorned with the images of King and fellow civil rights champion Malcolm X arrayed on its front steps. There were black marchers and white marchers, people in sneakers and others wearing cuff links. 
   One marcher, Keith Day, 45, who works at a drug addiction prevention agency, said: ``I came down here to keep the legacy of Dr. King alive. If it wasn't for him, none of this would be happening. It took a man like him to stand up for peace.'' 
   Elsewhere yesterday, more than 300 people gathered at the La Fontaine Bleu banquet facility in Lanham for the 13th Annual Martin Luther King memorial breakfast sponsored by the Ebony Scholarship Society. There, Bishop Adam Jefferson Richardson Jr. of the Second Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church challenged those gathered to go beyond just remembering King. 
   ``From memorial to movement, let the movement begin anew,'' Richardson said. ``It is right for us to be told Dr. King's words, to hear what the words mean in the context of 2007. At a time when we are waging war like swatting flies, it would be refreshing to hear King's words that violence is a poor teacher.'' 
   Maryland Del. Carolyn J.B. Howard (D-Prince George's), who attended the event, said that although such programs have become common since King's death, ``we still need to remember what he did.'' 
   ``It is easy to stay away, but we need to come out,'' she said. ``There needs to be a new sense of activism today.''   
   Democrats Hail Civil Rights Leader King  
   Columbia, S.C.--Democratic presidential hopeful Joseph Biden said Monday he thinks the Confederate flag should be kept off South Carolina's Statehouse grounds. 
   The comments by the U.S. senator from Delaware on a day of events celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy came as a potential Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Barack Obama, evoked the memory of the slain civil rights leader. 
   ``As I recall, Dr. King wasn't hanging out in Manhattan, Dr. King wasn't hanging out in Beverly Hills,'' Obama, D-Ill., told a King remembrance service in an economically depressed south Chicago suburb. 
   Introducing Obama, the Rev. Jesse Jackson told a crowd at the annual King scholarship breakfast, ``it's a long, nonstop line between the march in Selma in 1965 and the inauguration in Washington in 2009.'' 
   Screaming admirers managed to get Obama's autograph after he advocated removing troops from Iraq, rebuilding struggling areas such as the suburb of Harvey where he was speaking and increasing civic activism and calling on people, especially fathers, to be better parents. 
   In San Francisco, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reminded more than 1,000 people attending a union-sponsored breakfast honoring King that the slain civil rights leader spoke out against the Vietnam War because he saw domestic and national security issues as inexorably intertwined. 
   Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats would counter President Bush's proposal to send more troops to Iraq with a plan changing the U.S. mission there ``from combat to training, to fighting terrorism, to protecting our forces. 
   ``The nation is spending ``two billion a week in Iraq--think of what we could do a week, a month, a day with that money,'' Pelosi said, adding that the nation also has paid too great a cost in casualties, its international reputation and military readiness at home. 
   In Columbia, S.C., more than six years after the Confederate flag was taken down from the Capitol dome, its location in front of the Statehouse remains an issue. 
   ``If I were a state legislator, I'd vote for it to move off the grounds--out of the state,'' Biden said at an NAACP march and rally at the Statehouse. 
   Jim Hanks stood across from the South Carolina Statehouse with about 35 Confederate flag supporters. ``We love this flag. We love our heritage,'' said Hanks, of Lexington. 
   Some carried signs saying, ``South Carolina does not want Chris Dodd,'' referring to the Connecticut senator who, along with Biden, attended the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People rally at the Statehouse. 
   On Sunday, Dodd told The Associated Press at a King remembrance service in Greenville that the Confederate flag belongs in a museum. 
   ``I don't think it belongs on the Capitol grounds,'' Dodd said. 
   In 2000, as the NAACP began a South Carolina tourism boycott, the flag was flying on the Capitol dome and in House and Senate chambers. Legislators agreed to take the flag down that year, but raised the banner outside the Statehouse beside a Confederate soldiers monument. 
   Biden expects legislators here will eventually move the flag. Pointing to his heart, he said, ``as people become more and more aware of what it means to African-Americans here, this is only a matter of time.''   
   Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
   On April 4, 1968, the day of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, the doctor who examined his body estimated that, after years of sit-ins, marches, long nights and inspiring speeches, Dr. King, 39, had the heart of a 60-year-old. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, America honors not only Dr. King's accomplishments, though they are profound; his oration, though it is lyrical; and his dream, though it lives on; but also the tireless devotion with which he pursued them. 
   For too many Americans, however, the holiday has become little more than an excuse to skip work and sleep in. 
   Enter the Corporation for National and Community Service, the government agency that administers the AmeriCorps program. It wants to make the King holiday a time of service rather than sloth, and it is organizing community projects and events across the country to do it The agency is particularly eager to make the Washington area a model of civic participation and service on Dr. King's birthday. Its spokesmen boast that it has assembled an event schedule including a kickoff at Howard University and 80 community service projects around the District. Organizers from the Corporation for National and Community Service expect 10,000 volunteers to contribute time and effort across the region today. 
   We hope even more show up. We can think of little more fitting than celebrating the values of service and self-sacrifice on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Though ground has been broken on a long-awaited memorial to Dr. King on the Mall, words etched in stone, however grand, cannot honor his legacy as emulating his example can. Visit http://www.mlkday.gov. find a project in your area, and paint a school or clean up a sidewalk today.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This is an historic moment indeed. I am honored to lead the floor management of a bill that we have been waiting so long to debate and hopefully move forward from the House of Representatives. 
   This is an important moment in American history. We must now act to discontinue the disenfranchisement of citizens in the Nation's Capital. We must act to complete the important unfinished business of our democracy. 
   All of you here are all too familiar with the struggle for D.C. voting rights. I remember Chairman Emanuel Celler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, when the House gave the District a vote in 1967. I remember Delegate Walter Fauntroy's and Senator Ed Brooke's pursuit of the District's representation in 1978. I have now had the privilege of working with the distinguished gentlewoman, the Delegate from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a tireless, relentless, brilliant advocate of the effort that brings us here today. 
   Right now we are attempting to resolve what could not be resolved before, through the bipartisan efforts of so many. Mr. Davis of Virginia, Mr. Cannon of Utah, Mr. Matheson and Mr. Bishop have gotten us this far today, but I would be remiss if I did not name the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, JIM SENSENBRENNER, who helped bring us so close to passage of this legislation in the last Congress. I thank all of you for the important work that has led us to this great and wonderful day. 
   Now, the bill before us today has a novel proposal, but it is one that we have seen before. We are now here today to finish the important work on this measure that we almost completed when we adjourned the last Congress. We are here today to finish the job. 
   As the only democracy in the world where citizens living in the capital city are denied their representation in the National Legislature, we come here to repair this obvious defect. Nearly 600,000 people who call the District of Columbia home, who pay taxes, who fight and die in the military, do not have a vote in the Congress. They do not have a vote in the Congress. That is what brings us here today. I am talking about people like one of its citizens, Andy Shallal, a local business owner and an Iraqi American. 
   Thousands of American soldiers, including District residents, have given their lives in fighting for democracy in Iraq. Because of their sacrifice, Andy can vote for the national legislature in Iraq but is denied a vote for his own Member of Congress in Washington, District of Columbia. 
   So District residents like Andy and all those who share the responsibilities of U.S. citizenship deserve voting representation in this Congress, and I believe that most in this body agree with me. I believe that H.R. 1433 is a sound policy response to this inequity. While some have raised questions and we have debated, we have had constitutional scholars from across the country join us in analyzing the way that we have put this measure together. I am totally and confidently satisfied that we have a bill that passes constitutional muster. We have a bill that can finally end the disenfranchisement of District residents. 
   The legislation relies obviously on Article I, section 8, clause 17, which provides Congress with the authority to give the District a vote. The Supreme Court has held that Congress's exclusive authority over the District is ``national in the highest sense.'' The D.C. Circuit Court has held that the Congress has ``extraordinary and plenary power'' over the District. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has found the District Clause to be ``sweeping and inclusive in character.'' 
   Distinguished conservatives, we emphasize that this is not a partisan measure. Thoughtful scholars like Viet Dinh, judges and scholars like Ken Starr, whom I have never cited or quoted before now, and our former colleague Jack Kemp, just to name a few, agree that the Congress has the power through simple legislation to give the District of Columbia a vote. 
   We have used the District Clause to treat the District like a State repeatedly: for diversity jurisdiction, for 11th amendment immunity, for alcohol regulation, for interstate transportation, for apprentice labor, for the collection  of State income taxes, the list goes on and on. Surely, we cannot say that we cannot give them, the District residents, a vote in the same way that we have handled so many other matters. 
   I am confident that we can pair the District of Columbia with Utah and give Utah an at-large seat. Article I, section 4 gives Congress ultimate authority over Federal elections. The one person, one vote principle will be left intact. No vote will be compromised or diluted. None of their vote will be lost, nor will it be expanded. Utah voters will be given an equal opportunity to elect an at-large Representative on a temporary basis and a District Representative. 
   This fight has been long, 200 years too long. We can debate this issue to no end, but at the end of the day, if District residents remain disenfranchised, we ought to be ashamed. We have a sound, bipartisan proposal before us, and I am happy to entertain the discussion on both sides of the aisle that will proceed at this time. 
   I want to thank those of our Republican colleagues in the House who have already seen fit to make it clear that they, too, will be joining with us to make this a bipartisan solution to an old problem. I am proud to think and hope that D.C. disenfranchisement will come to an end. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The court held that D.C. was a State for purposes of the Constitution's second amendment.

   Madam Speaker, we have had a lot of predictions from Members of the Congress who may be on the Supreme Court someday. They predicted unconstitutionality and constitutionality. Let's leave it up to the Court. But, remember, those challenging on the basis of unconstitutionality have the burden.

   Mr. CONYERS. This is the most startling double hypocrisy I have ever heard of on a bill of this magnitude. Very clever, whoever dreamed this up. The motion to recommit would deny everyone in this House the right to vote on whether citizens would gain the right to vote, and at the same time arm them with military-type weaponry that is being used in Iraq right now to destroy aircraft and bring down helicopters. 
   We would also repeal the District's strong ban on handgun ammunition that can pierce body armor worn by police officers and other law enforcement officials at a time when security has become a top priority in the District, making military-style assault weapons readily available. 
   Now, the most important person I have ever met in my life, with due respect to all the great people I have had the honor of working with as a Member of Congress, is Martin Luther King, Jr. If he is looking down on us now to see if we are working for justice and peace in our country, in our Capital and throughout the world, I am sure he would be as dismayed as I am by putting a gun control vote up for a motion to recommit.

This was voted out of the committee. For example: 
   The decision to fire or retain some U.S. attorneys may have been based in part on whether or not their offices were pursuing or not pursuing public corruption or vote fraud cases based on partisan political factors; 
   Department officials appear to have made false or misleading statements to Congress, many of which sought to minimize the role of White House personnel in the U.S. Attorney firings;

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2776. Every day we see the effects of global warming and it is imperative the Congress act on this critical issue. It is important that we continue to improve our environment as we strive to fight the effects of global warming. H.R. 2776 would implement tax incentives to encourage the production of renewable resources and other energy efficient programs, necessary measures towards fighting global warming. There are many groups, businesses and trade organizations who join me in supporting this bill including Greenpeace, General Electric, Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, and Whirlpool. 
   H.R. 2776 will use tax credits and incentives to increase the use of renewable and alternative fuels. It will extend the renewable energy tax credit for those who choose to use renewable energy sources such as wind facilities, hydropower, and marine renewable energies. The bill will also continue providing the solar energy and fuel cell investment credit by extending a 30 percent investment tax credit for 8 years. Finally, this bill will provide tax incentives for renewable fuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel, celloslosic alcohol. 
   In addition, this legislation promotes the use of energy-efficient products to reduce the Nation's consumption of energy. It provides tax incentives for consumers to purchase energy efficient products such as hybrid vehicles and to outfit workplaces with energy efficient products. Manufacturers are also granted tax incentives encouraging them to create energy efficient products. H.R. 2776 builds a partnership between Federal, State, and local governments that would provide local authorities the ability to raise interest free funds for energy conservation programs in mass transit and green buildings. 
   Furthermore, H.R. 2776 will increase funding to encourage the research and development of renewable energy. This bill provides billions to States to give low interest loan programs to working families to purchase energy-efficient appliances and energy-efficient home improvements such as solar panels, insulation or geothermal heat pumps. These energy saving improvements will dramatically reduce energy consumption. This legislation also grants interest free loans for research facilities and research grants for the development of celloslosic ethanol, cleaner carbon dioxide, and automobile battery technologies. 
   H.R. 2776 also repeals a tax loophole. The bill limits the ability of oil and gas companies  to claim foreign tax credits, while leaving significant tax breaks untouched. Yet, this provision has no impact on oil and gas production in the United States, providing additional revenue to the U.S. treasury. 
   Mr. Speaker, Southeast Michigan has been hit hard due to the Bush administration's misguided trade policy. Governor Granholm unveiled a 21st century job initiative where billions of dollars will be invested in developing new technologies and emerging industries. In my hometown of Detroit, Next Energy, a 501 (c)3 organization that promotes renewable energy, will directly benefit from these tax breaks because they have made impressive strides in automotive and electric power. 
   I believe, this piece of legislation will directly contribute to providing jobs to my constituents, end America's addiction to oil, and hopefully transform the automotive industry. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2776.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Now, he's been on both committees, so he knows that the FISA experts call reverse targeting the ability of the Attorney General to conduct surveillance on every American's calls with people abroad, with or without probable cause or warrant just by characterizing the surveillance as concerning persons abroad.

   But what is in the bill at section 105(a) is, nothing in the definition of electronic surveillance under section 101(f) shall be construed to encompass surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States. 
   There is your reverse targeting that is in this bill. They didn't name it that way, but I think we can read the English language sufficiently.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   This measure fails because it allows targeting under section 105(a). This measure fails because it contains no guidelines that are missing in 105(b).  
   MR. KUCINICH., Mr. Speaker, I wish to make clear my opposition to H.R. 3356, the Improving Foreign Intelligence Surveillance to Defend the Nation and the Constitution Act of 2007, and S. 1927, both of which I proudly voted against. 
   This legislation must be opposed because the Bush administration cannot be trusted with  any additional surveillance powers. This administration has actively violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by engaging in surveillance of Americans without warrants. And the administration violated our Constitution by hiding this fact from Congress and the American public. 
   The only legislation that should come to the floor in this Congress is legislation that would limit the powers of this rogue presidency. Democrats must challenge the President and take back the power granted to Congress by the Constitution. 
   Instead this Congress has given into the fear tactics of the administration. Those who use fear to gain power are themselves subverting democracy. This Congress must not accept this false choice and defend Americans and their Constitution from the politics of fear. 
   The Democrats cannot shrink from this fight. We must demand that the President cease his attacks on our civil liberties. 
   For these reasons Mr. Speaker I opposed this legislation and I will oppose all future attempts by this body to pass gratuitous, fear provoking legislation that sanctions oppression against the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3221, The New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act. This landmark Energy Independence legislation will help make our nation more secure by reducing our dependence on foreign oil; reduce costs to consumers by promoting greater efficiency and smarter technology; create new American jobs; and make our Nation a leader in reducing global warming. 
   H.R. 3221 reduces our dependence on foreign oil in a number of important ways. It makes the largest investment in history to improve how we grow, produce, transport, and store biofuels that will fuel our cars and trucks. It provides a plug-in hybrid vehicle tax credit for individuals and encourages the domestic development and production of advanced technology vehicles and the next generation of plug-in hybrid vehicles. The initiative also includes tax incentives for biking to work, encourages people to take mass transit, and promotes cleaner buses, ferries, and trains. In addition, H.R. 3221 repeals subsidies and tax giveaways to Big Oil. 
   The New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act contains a number of provisions to lower energy costs to consumers, including landmark energy efficiency provisions that would save consumers and businesses at least $300 billion through 2030. It would reduce energy costs to consumers through more energy efficient appliances, such as dishwashers, clothes washers, refrigerators and freezers and assist consumers with improving efficiency of existing homes, as well as building energy efficient new homes. H.R. 3221 also extends existing tax credits for the production of renewable energy, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro, landfill gas and trash combustion, as well as creating new incentives for the use and production of renewable energy. 
   The major investments in renewable energy technologies included in this bill have the potential to create 3 million new American jobs over 10 years. The bill creates an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program to train a quality workforce for ``green'' jobs. To spur innovation, H.R. 3221 creates an Energy Department agency to coordinate high-risk, high-payoff energy technology research and development that private industry is not likely to pursue on its own. The bill increases loan limits to help small business develop energy efficient technologies and purchases; provides information and assistance to small business to reduce energy costs; and increases investment in small firms that are developing renewable energy solutions. 
   Finally, H.R. 3221 takes major steps to reduce global warming. Its energy efficiency provisions will not only save consumers and businesses money, but will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 10.4 billion tons through 2030, more than the annual emissions of all of the cars on the road in America today. This initiative calls on the U.S. to re-engage and lead the global effort on a binding global warming agreement, with commitments from all the major emitters including China, India, and Brazil. Because the federal government is the largest energy consumer in the United States, the bill promotes federal leadership on reducing global warming by requiring federal government operations to be carbon-neutral by 2050. These provisions will save taxpayers $7.5 billion through 2030. Finally, this initiative takes aggressive steps on carbon capture and sequestration to come up with a cleaner way to use coal. The United States must lead the way in developing this critical technology to reduce global warming throughout the world. 
   I would also like to address the important amendment to this bill offered by Repesentatives UDALL and PLATTS, which I will support. The Udall/Platts amendment creates a national renewable energy standard (RES) requiring electric utilities to provide a gradually increasing amount of their electricity through the use of renewable energy resources. A national RES would save consumers billions of dollars from lower energy bills and create tens of thousands of new jobs. 
   The amendment's initial requirement, in year 2010, is 2.75 percent of a utility's electricity. This gradually increases to 15 percent by 2020. The amendment permits utilities to meet up to 27 percent of their targeted requirement through energy efficiency savings (the equivalent of up to 4 percent of the 15 percent requirement). It gives credit for existing renewables. In addition, utilities get credit for all actions taken pursuant to a state portfolio standard associated with renewable electric generation. I believe this gradual, flexible approach is a reasonable way to provide the right incentives and market signals to diversify our electricity supply with clean, renewable energy sources that will help keep our air and water clean and start us down a path that will combat global warming.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, colleagues, appropriations bills are moral statements. They document the direction that we as a Congress desire our Nation to go. With our vote on H.R. 3043 today, we once again have an opportunity to show Americans that the 110th Congress is committed to taking our Nation in a New Direction--putting the needs of the American people first and making long-delayed investments in our future. 
   Unfortunately, this commitment to improving the lives of our soldiers, veterans and ordinary Americans seems not to be shared by the President. The Administration apparently feels that while it is necessary to spend $12 billion a month in Iraq, the Federal Year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill is just $9.8 billion too expensive and needs to be vetoed. He believes that an extra $10 billion to provide grants to low-income children for after school programs, increasing the purchasing power of Pell Grants, fund job training programs for dislocated workers and helping families facing rising energy prices with the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is just wasteful spending. 
   The President, in an attempt to burnish his credentials as a bona fide fiscal conservative, now seems to know the cost of everything and the value of nothing. I wonder where this conservatism was from 2001 through 2006, when the Republican-led Congress went on a deficit financed spending spree with our national treasury taking the United States from a $5.6 trillion, 10-year surplus to a $2 trillion, 10-year deficit. 
   By passing H.R. 3043, which combines the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education FY 08 Appropriations bill and the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs FY 08 Appropriations bill, we will be making the largest investment in veterans' health care in history and making long overdue investments in education, worker safety and health care for our citizens. 
   If the President is truly concerned with how his legacy will read, I urge him to listen to the overwhelming bi-partisan majority in Congress that supports H.R. 3043. Mr. Bush, help us reverse the sharp rise in college costs that continue to be a barrier to millions of low- and middle-income students by increasing the Pell Grant from $4,050 to $4,435. Help us increase access to Head Start programs so that more disadvantaged children have access to preschool. Provide a 10.1 percent increase for community health centers, an increase that will serve an additional 1 million uninsured people. Stand with the strong bipartisan majority that passed both these bills this summer. Mr. President, approve this bill and help us make America stronger.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EXTENDING PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 4848, the extension of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA). This legislation would extend MHPA for 1 year, maintaining the current provisions for parity in the application of certain limits to mental health benefits. 
   For group plans that choose to offer mental health benefits, the MHPA requires those plans to provide benefits for mental health treatment subject to the same annual and lifetime dollar limits as their coverage of physical illnesses. Unfortunately, insurance plans may still limit the amount and type of mental health treatment covered. For example, an insurance company can cap the number of times a patient may visit the doctor's office, not only annually, but over the course of a lifetime. 
   ``Partial parity'' is an oxymoron. Rather than rely on stop-gap measures and patch-work fixes, the need for true mental health insurance parity must be recognized and acted upon. I strongly encourage my fellow members to quickly pass H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, which puts mental health coverage on an equal footing with medical and surgical coverage. 
   The inequity of coverage with regard to mental health and substance abuse treatment benefits is tantamount to discrimination against the mentally ill. It is built upon the insurance companies' strategy of denying rather than providing care in order to maximize profits. The notion that an insurance company can limit medical care based on cost is immoral. Only medical professionals should dictate the amount and type of care a patient receives. H.R. 676, the United States National Health Insurance Act, would provide health care coverage for all, including coverage of mental health and substance abuse treatment. 
   Madam Speaker, it is our duty to end this intolerable discrimination against the mentally ill, and provide timely, appropriate, and adequate health care for all, free of the loopholes, pitfalls, and entanglements which exist under the current fragmented, non-system of care.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. 
   We continue to fight to end the war in Iraq. However, in the meantime, we must ensure that our troops are provided with the time to return home, rest, recuperate and train before they return to battle. Our troops have risked their lives and Congress has a responsibility to stand up for them. 
   The legislation we are considering today strengthens the American military by mandating minimum periods of rest and recuperation for units and members of regular and reserve components of our Armed Forces between deployments. The bill states that if a unit or member of a regular component of the Armed Forces deploys to Iraq, they will have an equivalent amount of time at home before they are redeployed. 
   The legislation will help alleviate a significant military readiness crisis. When the Bush Administration took office in 2001, all active duty Army divisions were rated at the highest readiness levels and were fully manned, equipped, and trained. Now, the Administration's failed policies in Iraq have depleted our military and put a tremendous strain on our troops. Already, an estimated 250,000 soldiers in the Army and Marine Corps have served more than one tour in Iraq and each one of the Army's available active duty combat brigades has served at least a 12-month tour in Iraq or Afghanistan. And this spring, the Defense Secretary announced that all active duty Army soldiers would have their tours in Iraq extended from 12 to 15 months. 
   The war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for our Armed Forces and our troops. By reducing the stress on our men and women in uniform and ensuring they get the training they need to stay safe, this legislation makes support for the troops into more than an empty slogan.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2176, BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. ALCEE HASTINGS, I salute you for bringing this bill to the floor from the Rules Committee. I support the rule, without qualification. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, why do so many people approve this bill if it has so many problems? Well, because it's a bit like a wolf in sheep's clothing; you don't know what's underneath it. And so reciting all of these folks--starting with the Governor of my State--don't know what's underneath this bill. When H.L. Mencken says it's not about the money, you can bet it's about the money. And when I hear my colleagues say--and I'm going to count the times that it will happen today--``It's not about casinos. This is not about casinos, folks.'' 
   Oh, no, that's what it's about. Okay? 
   Let's start off with something that we should try to get clear. The assertion that this is about getting justice for two tribes who have waited for all these many years to get justice and we finally were able to get it to the Congress. How charming. How disingenuous. 
   This so-called land claim--and we spent a good amount of time on it--to the extent there really was ever a land claim, arose in the 19th century. It didn't have anything whatsoever to do with the tribe's historical lands or any treaty with the U.S. Government. The Charlotte Beach land in question apparently was a private gift to the tribe--and in those days it was one tribe--by individual members of the  tribe who had brought it. And rather than deed the land directly over to the tribe, the members evidently deeded it over to the Governor of Michigan--neither of the two that have been mentioned--to hold in trust for the tribe. That was back in the 1850s. It's not clear if the previous owner tribal members or anyone else ever told the tribe or the Governor about the gift. In any event, the lands were totally neglected by the tribe. About 30 years later, they were sold off by the State for a long-standing property tax delinquency. 
   The so-called land claim lay moribund and forgotten for 100 years, as best we can tell. And in 1982 one of these tribes, the Sault, asked the Interior Department to review and pursue a claim for the loss of the Charlotte Beach land. The Interior Department declined, saying the case had no merit. They renewed the request in 1983 and in 1992, getting the same answer each time. The Interior closed the files on the matter, and that was the end of it. 
   Then one day an enterprising lawyer, a member of the bar doing land research, looking for an Indian land claim he could help engineer and do the authorization to build a new casino outside the established legal process, came across a record of the delinquency sale.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. I thank my colleague. 
   By that time, the tribe had divided. 
   There were two possible candidates for reasserting the claim. The first tribe he contacted, the Sioux, was not interested. But the other one, Bay Mills, was very interested. And so this wonderful lawyer began preparing a case to file based on the delinquency sale he had uncovered and its connection to the tribe he had interest in. 
   A bare week before the lawsuit was filed, another enterprising gentleman purchased some land within the Charlotte Beach claim area. Coincidental. And within a few months, he had entered into a so-called settlement with the tribe regarding the so-called land claim in which he agreed to give the tribe a parcel of land he already owned near Detroit. 
   Now, all the other off-reservation casinos are 10 miles away, 20 miles away, not 350 miles away.  
   He also agreed to sell the tribe some additional land adjacent to the parcel. Enough land for a new casino--and not too far from Detroit. 
   But the settlement was conditioned on the Interior Department taking the land into trust, a necessary step to its being eligible for an Indian casino. 
   That part didn't work out like they'd planned, so that settlement was eventually scrapped in favor of Plan B, back to the courts in an attempt to get a favorable court ruling to take to Interior. 
   As we know, Plan B also failed. So then came Plan C, which brings us here today. 
   But the three plans are not that different. They all share the same objective. The difference is just means to an end. Apparently, any means. 
   And who was backing Mr. Golden? The details are still somewhat shrouded in mystery. 
   But we do know that the principal stakeholders in this off-reservation Indian casino venture are Michael Malik and Marian Illich, wealthy casino developers from the State of Michigan, who have opened casinos from coast to coast and in Hawaii, bankrolling legislation and referenda as needed to open the way. 
   And they have also been quite active politically in Washington in recent years as well. I won't go into the details of that now, but I think you get the idea. 
   Many of the facts I have just recited are in the public record. The essence of the rest were laid out in testimony by one of the two tribes, the Sioux Tribe, the tribe that initially wouldn't take the bait, back before they were persuaded to go after their own short-cut to getting an off-reservation casino. 
   That statement can be found in the printed hearing of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, held on October 10, 2002, on the bill S. 2986, a precursor bill to the one we are considering today. 
   That was 5 long years ago, of course. And the chairman, or chief, of that tribe at the time, Bernard Bouschor, who gave that testimony, who had held that elected position for 17 years at the time he testified, no longer holds that position. 
   And his tribe, who now stands to gain an off-reservation casino that could take in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, is now busy doing what they can to disown his testimony. 
   But if my colleagues find Chief Bouschor's testimony credible, as I do, it certainly lays out the course of events in a way that some were quite likely not aware of before. And any assertion that this is a legitimate Indian land claim just won't stand up to those facts.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, could I bring the temperature down somewhat from the speakers by pointing out to my good friend from Alaska that this matter is within the Judiciary Committee because the Parliamentarian said so? So for the gentleman to make this assertion that we have no claim of jurisdiction here is one of the errors that he has made in his presentation. 
   Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm so proud that nobody has mentioned casinos yet, because that means the casinos are not an issue, of course, in this matter. Or you mentioned gaming. Okay. Chairman Rahall concedes that he did mention gaming. 
   Well, let me tell you something. This is just like H.L. Mencken. When they say this is not about money, Mencken says that means it's about money. 
   Now, it just so happens that, on three occasions, these tribes have tried to get the Department of Interior, which is where this goes--and as for this business about its being in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress, we don't sit around here, ruling on this business. We can override the established procedures if we want to, and here, we want to because the Department of Interior has turned down these claims three different times--in 1982, 1983, and 1992. They said ``no.'' The reason was they weren't meritorious. 
   And then an enterprising member of the bar--and I hate to tell you that that was his profession--said, Ah, I've got an idea. Wait until you see the charts that show how far Sault Ste. Marie and Bay Mills are from where they want to locate the casinos. 
   I said it was 350 miles away. It's 348 miles away. I'm sorry. So let's come clean, okay? 
   Now, the lady I supported for Governor, Governor Granholm, overrode the State legislature to send you that letter, and it's not going by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission rules or her own State's rules. The people in Michigan have voted down casinos already. And, the former Governor Engler, wow. He tried to stick it in bills coming over here. He never would have done what we are doing here today but for the same reasons of concern that those proponents of the bill have reason to be concerned right now. 
   So that's the story, folks. If you want to start a run on forum shopping for casinos, this is going to be the first bill that does it.  
   It is no joy for me to be before you opposing legislation reported by the Natural Resources Committee and my friend Nick Rahall, and supported so strongly by my friends John Dingell and Bart Stupak. 
   But this is bad legislation. I regret that the House is having to consider it. And I must strongly oppose it. 
   Those pushing this legislation on the House do not always like to emphasize the fact that it is about legalizing casino gambling where it would not otherwise be legal--pure and simple. 
   And not just in two corners of Michigan. This is not a local Michigan issue--leaving  aside that the Michigan delegation is sharply divided itself. 
   This would create a national blueprint for casino forum shopping, where no corner of the country would be safe from the designs of any developer or casino operator, working in league with any far-off Indian tribe. 
   They say it does not set a precedent--says so right in the bill: ``don't look for a precedent here.'' Who are they trying to kid? 
   This legislation is highly controversial, and with good reason. Earlier today I discussed the dubious origins of this supposed Indian land claim. Let me now turn to other major flaws in this proposal. 
   To begin with, it spurns every single procedure Congress established under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to balance the sovereign rights of Indian tribes to conduct their own affairs, on their own lands, with the legitimate concerns many of our citizens have with the potential spread of casino gaming into their communities. 
   It simply declares the process to be completed, and the two tribes to have succeeded. 
   The bill's proponents will tell you that the bill complies fully with the process set out in IGRA. But it does not; it simply jumps to the finish line and arbitrarily deems the process to be satisfied. 
   Section 102(a)(1) orders the Interior Department to take the lands into trust. 
   Section 102(a)(2) directs that the lands become part of the tribe's reservation. 
   Section 102(b) declares that the process complies fully with all the requirements of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act for purposes of legalizing a casino on the new lands. 
   What could be simpler? Or more manipulative? 
   Let's not kid ourselves. That's not complying with process; that's doing a preemptive end run around it. 
   This bill shows absolutely no regard for the established process. 
   No regard for the usual review in the Interior Department, who opposes this bill. 
   Don't be fooled by rumors of some high-level private go-ahead. The Interior Department has testified against this legislation--publicly--twice in the last 5 months--before the Resources Committee, and before the Judiciary Committee. 
   No regard for Michigan voters, who passed a referendum in 2004 restricting the expansion of casino gambling in their State. The bill does an end run around that process as well. 
   The proponents claim that there is an exemption in the referendum for casinos on Tribal lands. 
   Well, of course there is. That's required by tribal sovereignty under Federal law. That would be the case whether the referendum said so or not. 
   But no one in their wildest dreams ever imagined that someone would try to twist the common-sense concept of ``Tribal lands'' to sweep in lands 350 miles from the Tribe's ancestral homelands. 
   This bill does not honor the referendum. It blows a gaping hole through it, and utterly violates the spirit of the voters' decision to limit the spread of casinos in their State. 
   No regard for the other Indian tribes in Michigan, all of whom signed compacts in 1994 solemnly pledging, as a means of curtailing the impulse to build new casinos far and wide, that revenues from any off-reservation casino any of them built would be shared among them all. 
   This bill simply blesses a superseding compact for these two tribes that lets them off the hook, without going through any of the established process for negotiating and approving a new compact. 
   The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act rightly disfavors off-reservation casino gaming. 
   And as set forth in greater detail in the Interior Department guidelines, the greater the distance involved, the greater the risk of harm to tribal welfare, and the more tenuous the benefits. 
   The distance involved here--350 miles from the reservation--is a whole new order of magnitude. And the tribes involved have no known historical connection whatsoever to the lands they would acquire. 
   The proponents say there is a precedent. But what they are referring to is no precedent at all. 
   The Torres-Martinez case was brought by the Interior Department on behalf of the tribe, for reservation land that an irrigation district had placed under water. 
   Under the settlement, the tribe was allowed to acquire land in trust within 10 miles of its existing reservation--that land also had to be within its historical territory. 
   The tribe has not built a casino on that land, and has no plans to. 
   Furthermore, the land claims here being enlisted in the service of obtaining these off-reservation casinos have already been rejected by the courts. 
   And they are not even claims involving the United States. They are strictly private claims, against the State of Michigan, bearing no relation whatsoever to the kind of claims that could legally be settled under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
   This legislation is supported by exactly two tribes in Michigan--the two who expect to get off-reservation casinos they could not hope to obtain under established legal process. 
   It is opposed by other Michigan tribes, who are joined by over 60 tribes across the country. 
   Not because they oppose Indian gaming. They all have their own interest in preserving their rights to build casinos on their own lands. 
   What they are opposed to is the free-for-all that would predictably ensue if this unprecedented effort to circumvent the law--a law they have all lived under for 20 years--were to pass. 
   This legislation is also opposed by the NAACP because of its lack of basic procedural fairness, due process, or any respect for voters in communities across the country who may understandably have concerns about casinos being built in their neighborhoods. 
   Let me also say a word about the view of organized labor. And I say this as someone who has a labor voting record in Congress, over almost 44 years, that is second to no one's. 
   This bill is supported by some in labor; it is opposed by others. 
   Labor is not united. And why would they be? If this legislation has any direct effect on jobs, it will be only to move them from one casino in Michigan to another. 
   For these and other reasons, the House Judiciary Committee, which received a sequential referral of this legislation, voted unanimously to oppose it. 
   By passing legislation favoring the narrow interests of the Bay Mills and Sault Ste. Marie tribes and their private-sector allies, Congress would set a dangerous precedent for side-stepping the established review process for land claims, and create a shortcut for spreading casino gambling into every corner of the country. 
   We should not start down that path. The tribes should pursue whatever claims they may have through the normal procedures--and succeed or fail on the merits. 
   And so I strongly oppose this bill, and urge everyone else in this body to do likewise.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker and members of the committee, the only reason we are here today, and I admire all of the devoted people to the cause of our Native Americans, is that these two casinos are located not 5 miles or 10 miles away but 345 miles and 348 miles away. That's why we are here. And by rationalizing that, guess what's going to happen? We are going to have the biggest casino forum shopping this country has ever known because we will have done it here listening to people explain to me about Abramoff's role and how important this is, so compelling. 
   So, please, vote ``no.''

   It is a pleasure to join the Education and Labor Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   This measure raises some very interesting questions from the point of view of the Judiciary Committee. I begin by noting that the chairman emeritus of the Judiciary Committee, Jim Sensenbrenner, had always had a very abiding interest in this matter. But we have a curious problem. Somebody is going to ask, how could a United States Supreme Court--a bill passed overwhelmingly bipartisan in 1990--and then in 1999 simultaneously give not one or two, but three decisions slamming some very fundamental interests that we had when the bill was passed? There wasn't anything complicated or ambiguous about the bill that was passed in this Congress in 1990. And we are now here fixing the three problems that these decisions brought forward. 
   ``We prohibit the consideration of measures that might lessen the impact of an impairment--medication, insulin, a hearing aid.'' 
   What kind of persons are on the Supreme Court of the United States that have some difficulty understanding that if you have to use a hearing aid, that does not lessen the nature of the disability? That's earlier than first year law school. I mean, what was going on in the majority of the members' minds? 
   Second, ``substantially limits'' they've transferred to mean ``materially restricts'' and instructs the court that these words must be interpreted broadly and not restrictively. 
   Now the history of civil rights and voter rights law in this Congress in the 20th and 21st century deals with the understood directive that the law in these cases is to be interpreted generally and liberally, and here they did just the opposite. This disability law is essentially a civil rights matter, and they chose to ignore that. And so we had to correct it. We had to say, Supreme Court, your attention, please. This is civil rights law, and so it's not to be interpreted as narrowly as you can, but as liberally as you can. 
   And then the third thing we chose to correct was the entire notion that the disability law covers anyone who either experiences discrimination because someone believes them to be disabled, whether they are not or whether they actually are. It doesn't make any difference. In other words, it is to be liberally interpreted. 
   And so we go into a very challenging period of American history with an election coming up, and we've got a Supreme Court that we have to constantly remind how to interpret civil rights laws. This is not a comforting circumstance for your chairman of Judiciary--I don't think for the ranking member of Judiciary either, if I might add. 
   There are those writing about the Supreme Court these days, and one such commentator, Professor Rosen of Georgetown--``Today, however, there are no economic populists on the Court, even on the liberal wing. Ever since John Roberts was appointed Chief Justice in 2005, the Court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns. Forty percent of the cases the Court heard last term involved business interests, up from around 30 percent in recent years.''

   The closing example: 
   ``While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year on average, the Roberts Court has heard seven antitrust cases in the first two terms, and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants.''  
   Now, look. They must know that some people over here read and review their decisions. It means that we have to be even more alert on the questions that have brought this measure before the House today for its disposal. 
   I'm very proud of the bipartisan aspect. I don't want to give too much praise to the chairman emeritus of the committee, but he did a very good job in this regard.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the middle class is hurting. They are facing tough decisions over rising gas, food, and health care prices. Adding to their economic dilemma, the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, may reach many of them this coming year. Today, we will vote on H.R. 6275, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, which would provide relief to middle class taxpayers by avoiding the AMT. 
   The original intent behind the AMT was to guarantee that the wealthiest Americans paid their fair share of taxes. However, the AMT was not adjusted for inflation and hard-working Americans were lumped into this tax. Today, the Congress must act to prevent 25.6 million middle income Americans being liable for paying thousands of dollars in additional taxes. 
   Restructuring the tax code will more fairly distribute the tax burden. H.R. 6275 will tax private equity managers, who actually pay lower taxes on carried interest and repeal unnecessary Government subsidies for the big five oil companies reaping record profits and on multinational corporations who offshore their businesses for the express purpose of tax avoidance. It is unconscionable that our tax code allows these corporations to avoid taxes while hard-working Americans get hit with a stern tax and pay extremely high gas prices at the pump. This legislation closes these major tax loopholes. 
   H.R. 6275 restores America's tradition of giving a helping hand to those in need. We need to stop the giveaways to Big Oil and Wall Street brokers and begin to focus on the needs of average working Americans. This is a commonsense piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3, the DeGette-Castle stem cell research bill. Our Nation's top scientists agree that embryonic stem cell research has the potential to unlock the doors to treatments and cures to numerous diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, ALS, multiple sclerosis and cancer. Tens of millions of Americans and their families stand to benefit from this life-saving research. 
   Current policy allows Federal funds to be used for research only on those stem cell lines that existed when President Bush issued an executive order on August 9, 2001. However, few of the stem cell lines authorized by President Bush are now useful for research. According to the National Institutes of Health, of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for Federal funding in the President's executive order of August 2001, only about 22 lines are now still available for researchers; and, many of these 22 ``available'' stem cell lines are contaminated with ``mouse feeder'' cells, making their therapeutic use for humans uncertain. 
   H.R. 3 authorizes government support of research involving embryonic stem cells that  meet certain criteria, regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from an embryo. The bill creates an ethical framework for this research. It prohibits funding for research unless the cell lines were derived from excess embryos that were created for reproductive purposes and would otherwise be discarded. It also requires voluntary informed consent from the couples donating the excess embryos and prohibits any financial inducements. 
   H.R. 3 represents real hope to the tens of millions Americans suffering from devastating illnesses, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, and her partner from California for the great work that they have done here. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I call your attention in this discussion tonight to what happened on Page 1 of the New York Times. And I read this to you for your consideration: 
   ``Inviting a Battle on Capitol Hill. In making the effort to step up the American military presence in Iraq, President Bush invites an epic clash with the Democrats who run Capitol Hill, whose leader promised to force a vote on his plan. While Congress cannot force a change in the White House plan, Mr. Bush's initiative shows that he is ignoring the results of the November elections, rejecting the central thrust of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and flouting some of the advice of his own generals.  
   ``The move is in essence a calculated gamble that no matter how much hue and cry his new strategy may provoke, in the end the American people will give Mr. Bush more time to turn around the war in Iraq.'' 
   Well, ladies and gentlemen, my suggestion is that, after last night's performance, he is not going to be given more time by the American people and that, from a popularity rating at an all time low of 26, my prediction is that he will have fallen even lower as a result of last night's performance. 
   So I think that this is quickly turning into the President's war. There are those on all sides around him, including within the Republican Party, Members that will not go along any further. We have run out of steam. We have run out of illogic. We have looked through the exaggerations. So I conclude my remarks by just letting you hear about the editorial in the New York Times: 
   ``We have argued that the United States has a moral obligation to stay in Iraq as long as there is a chance to mitigate the damage that a quick withdrawal might cause.'' This is the editorial. ``We have called for an effort to secure Baghdad, but as part of the sort of comprehensive political solution utterly lacking in Mr. Bush's speech. This war has reached the point that merely prolonging it could make a bad ending even worse. Without a real plan to bring it to a close, there is no point in talking about jobs programs and military offenses. There is nothing ahead but even greater disaster in Iraq.'' This is the media talking now. 
   It is time that the Executive branch recognize that the majority of the American people, most of the Congress, the media itself are all telling him that President Bush's private war is not going to go anywhere, and to deliberately refuse to accept the decision and determination of the American people on November 7 means that he is now stepping beyond the democratic process. 
   Madam leader, Ms. Waters, I thank you so much for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we finally come to the point in time where we consider the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments, and I am delighted to bring this measure to the floor. 
   I begin by observing that there are few rights that are more fundamental to our democracy than the right to have protections against unreasonable search and seizure, and there are few responsibilities that are more important than the government's protecting us from foreign threats. I submit that the measure before us does both of those and regards them as the two most important acts that we can pursue as responsible Members of the Congress. That conflict or tension goes to the very core of who we are as a Nation. 
   Now, for more than 30 years, we have relied on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to strike the appropriate balance between the government's need to protect our rights from foreign attack and our citizens' right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have freedom of speech. The heart of that bargain was that the government could indeed use its awesome power of surveillance but only through independent court review. That's FISA since 1978. 
   Now, a few years ago, the administration unilaterally chose to engage in warrantless surveillance of American citizens without court review. And last August, when this scheme appeared to be breaking down, this administration pushed through a law that it had caused to be drafted that essentially transferred the power of independent review from the courts to the Attorney General of the United States. Today, we will be voting on legislation to restore that proper balance. 
   And so we present to you an uncomplicated consideration of a measure that has three titles. The first allows the government to obtain a single court order to approve surveillance against all members of any known terrorist group. It includes important safeguards to make sure that this power is not used to target innocent Americans.     
   The chairman of the Intelligence Committee has a lot more to say about that. 
   The second title deals with the difficult issue of how we make sure that those telecom carriers who assisted the government in the aftermath of the September 11 tragedy are not placed in a position where they cannot defend themselves in court. 
   And then, finally, the last title provides an accounting of the highly controversial warrantless surveillance program. The administration tells us they have nothing to hide and the program was lawful in their program or its implementation. If that is the case, they should have nothing to fear from this blue ribbon commission that will be created by the enactment of the provision before us. 
   Now, we learned only yesterday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was continuing to misuse the authorities that we granted it under the PATRIOT Act 6 years ago to unlawfully obtain information about law-abiding Americans. Just yesterday. We learned 4 days ago that the National Security Agency was using its massive power to create a nationwide database of American citizens. Four days ago. 
   And so that's why I believe it important that we include the civil liberties safeguards set forth in the legislation today. We have been working very closely with the American Civil Liberties Union in that regard, and we have a half dozen other organizations that have fully endorsed the bill. 
   The legislation before us gives the administration and the agencies every tool they need to protect our Nation against terrorism, while at the same time protecting our own citizens' civil rights and liberties. I urge that we carefully examine the proposition before us. 
   And I will reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3162, the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act (CHAMP Act). This legislation will reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, ensuring  that millions of children receive the care they need, and will protect Medicare for America's seniors. 
   Even though I support this legislation, I rise today with a heavy heart. It is nothing short of a disgrace that here, in the wealthiest country on earth, eight million children lack health insurance coverage. We ought to be ashamed that we are having this debate at all. 
   I am absolutely stunned that Congressional Republicans and the President are opposing this legislation, particularly in light of the fact that the President used CHIP as part of his campaign platform in 2004. Talk about shock and awe! I am shocked beyond belief that they can stand before the American people with straight faces and refuse health care for children. I am in awe of the gall required to base the denial of these vital, life-saving services on an ideological talking point. Madam Speaker, the ideology of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle has not provided health care for these children yet. It is impossible for any serious person to believe that if this legislation is defeated the Republican ideology will suddenly start working its magic and provide health care for these children whose parents can't afford to buy it in the open market. 
   In my years fighting for universal health care, we have often said, ``Covering children is easy. How could anyone publicly refuse to support coverage for children?'' It was coverage for adults that was always perceived as the real challenge. 
   But today, the Republicans have stooped lower than even I thought was possible. Not only are they saying ``We can't afford to give our children health care.'' This is the same party, by the way, that finds money for tax cuts for the rich, that finds money to fund a disaster of a war. Many times more money than what is needed to cover these children, in fact. 
   Not only are the Republicans admitting that they prioritize tax cuts for the wealthy and feeding the military industrial complex over insuring our children. They are now standing before the American people and saying ``It is not our job to guarantee health insurance coverage for America's children.'' They are refusing to make that promise. Instead, they propose that our children's health should be subject to the ups and downs of the stock market, that it should depend on their parents' employment status, or how much they have in a bank account. It is utterly beyond conception how the Republicans can possibly think these ideas will be accepted by the American people. But I will leave my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to face the repercussions of this folly next November. 
   Let me move on to a more positive subject: the bill under consideration today, which we will pass over these shameful objections. The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, also known as the CHAMP Act, reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and protects coverage for 6 million children, including 89,257 in Michigan, while extending health care coverage to another 5 million low-income children. All told, this bill will ensure essential health care coverage for 11 million of our most vulnerable children. 
   The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act also makes needed fixes to the Medicare program. It stops a 10 percent payment cut to doctors, thereby ensuring that I, we seniors will continue to have access to the doctors of their choice. It encourages seniors to seek preventive health benefits by eliminating co-payments and deductibles for these services. The bill protects low-income seniors by expanding and improving programs that help keep Medicare affordable for those with lower incomes. It stops overpayments to HMOs that are draining money away from health care and into their profit margins. And it also shores up Medicare's finances by extending the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by two years. 
   Failing to pass this legislation would have real consequences for children and seniors. If the State Children's Health Insurance Program is not reauthorized by September 30th, 2007, millions of children could lose their health insurance. Seniors will lose access to their doctors and pay higher Medicare premiums to subsidize overpayments to HMOs. I find it quite interesting that we haven't heard these so-called fiscally responsible Republicans lamenting the fact that their friends in the HMO industry are overbilling our government to line their pockets. It seems that fiscal responsibility only applies when poor children are on the receiving end. 
   Let's defeat the sham S-CHIP bill offered by Representatives Barton, Shimkus and Blackburn that would leave millions of children without health care while slashing Medicare and harming our seniors. Let's tell the White House and Congressional Republicans that it's time to stop playing political games. Let's tell them it's time to work together to ensure more children across the country have the high-quality medical care they deserve and strengthen Medicare for our seniors. They might not be able to understand that it's the right thing to do, but the American people certainly will.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of passage of H.R. 1427, ``The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act.'' 
   I believe this legislation is one of the most cost effective ways to provide cities across the country with desperately needed federal funding so they can construct, or renovate housing stock for working families on public housing waiting lists, homeless veterans, homeless Katrina victims, and homeless working families. 
   I believe that passage of this legislation is a ``historic'' moment in this Congress, and makes me proud to be a member of this body. 
   In Detroit, there are thousands of working individuals and families living in homeless shelters or staying with friends and extended family members because they can not afford the skyrocketing costs of private market housing. 
   We have a homeless shelter in Detroit where hundreds of veterans live each year, and most are working minimum wage jobs, or work in low to moderate wage employment. 
   It is a moral outrage that soldiers who have fought in wars and served their country honorably come home to cities like Detroit, only to find out that they can not afford an apartment or a home. 
   This bill will help reduce these problems, and provide decent affordable housing to more veterans and working families without raising taxes. 
   It will also help victims of Katrina who are currently living in hotels or homeless shelters in other cities to return to the Gulf Coast, or remain where they are, because there will be expanded housing opportunities due to passage of H.R. 1427. 
   Passage of ``The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act'' will provide billions of dollars to cash starved cities across the Nation to successfully build new affordable housing units for working families by utilizing existing non-profit housing developers, public housing agencies, and for-profit housing developers. 
   Passage of H.R. 1427 will help hundreds of thousands of Americans across this Nation who are currently on waiting lists for public housing to be able to get out of homeless shelters and into homes or apartments, since there will now be more federal funding for affordable housing production. 
   Passage of ``The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act'' will provide $600 million per year to cash starved cities across the Nation and could create approximately 8,000 new affordable housing units for working families by utilizing existing non-profit housing developers, public housing agencies, and for-profit housing developers. 
   If America is ever to be a great nation, we must ensure that all Americans, as a basic human right, have decent and affordable housing. Passage of H.R. 1427 will get our Nation on the road to having a real national affordable housing policy; which we currently do not have. 
   The United States, the wealthiest country in the world, shamefully has one million homeless children, and over 40% of those living in homeless shelters are working in jobs. Our current affordable housing problem is building more homeless shelters where there is a lack of affordable housing. 
   I ask this question, Mr. Chairman. How many Members of Congress would want to come home after a hard day's work, and sleep in a homeless shelter? Probably nobody! We need affordable housing for all now. 
   I urge this body to pass H.R. 1427 with all deliberate speed.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day. After years of rising deficits and draconian Republican budgets, the vote on the Budget Conference Report finally puts us on the right course. The Democratic budget will take America in a new direction by funding national priorities such as health care services, educational programs, and veterans services while providing middle class tax assistance. The Democratic budget rejects the Administration's attempts to cut funding to many social programs that support American children and families such as State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP), Pell grants, Medicare, and Medicaid. This forward looking budget will help all Americans progress towards social and economic security. 
   The Democratic budget will also provide tax relief for middle-income workers and will extend popular tax credits such as the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and more deductions for state and local sales taxes. 
   After our troops have defended our great country, we need to give our servicemen and veterans the best possible health care. The budget provides sufficient funds to treat traumatic injuries and improve health care facilities for veterans, as well as to treat the more than twenty-six thousand service members who have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. Funding measures to veterans healthcare is a well deserved and necessary expense providing $3.6 billion above the President's proposal. 
   Mr. Speaker, many Americans have economic concerns, and are seeking leadership from us, the people's House, the United States Congress. After six years of misplaced priorities, the Democratic budget resolution seeks to provide services and support that are essential to the well-being of the American people; millions who are hard working tax paying citizens that deserve some well justified and reasonable assistance. This legislation is clearly the people's budget.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The consumer bankruptcy overhaul signed into law 3 years ago adds a means test that presumes a debtor is abusing the law if he or she has income that exceeds a modest threshold, and thereby forces the debtor into a multiyear repayment plan. 
   This bill, S. 3197, excepts qualifying National Guard and Reserve members from that presumption of abuse. We have the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) to thank for this. 
   With half a million members of the National Guard and Reserve called to Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11, many serving multiple tours of duty, the financial toll on their families has been severe.     
   It's estimated that up to 26 percent of National Guard members deployed experience money problems as a direct result. And so the measure before us makes an exception-to-the-means test presumption of abuse for National Guard and Reserve members who serve 90 days since September 11, 2001, and for a year and a half after they leave service. I'm heartened to know that we now have the opportunity to provide this modest but important relief to these brave men and women in the service. 
   I also commend Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH of Texas who has helped make this a bipartisan endeavor. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to remind our Members that the measure before us reauthorizes funding for the National Crime Victims Law Institute, which supports critical crime victims' legal assistance programs that help crime victims enforce their legal rights in a number of vital respects.     
   Many of these programs provide financial assistance directly to crime victims. Others help victims receive proper notification of case developments, and still other assistance may come in the form of providing staff for victims' rights organizations and legal assistance to victims. Some of these victims are elderly, some are poor, and some are people that just can't afford any legal costs at all. 
   Violent crime victims may be emotionally and physically traumatized and therefore unable to assert their rights effectively, and victims of identity theft may be financially devastated as a result of loss of savings or destroyed credit. 
   So I am very pleased to bring this measure to the floor, and I urge support for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the hate crimes bill, H.R. 1592, will provide assistance to State and local enforcement agencies and amend Federal law to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of violent, bias-motivated crimes. 
   Last Congress, this legislation passed with a bipartisan vote, and it also passed in the 108th Congress and the 106th Congress. So we have the same bill before us that we had in the 109th Congress. 
   This legislation has attracted the support of over 211 civil rights organizations, educational institutions, religious organizations, civic groups; and importantly, virtually every major law enforcement organization in the country has endorsed the bill, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Sheriffs Association, the Police Executive Research Forum and 26 State attorneys general. 
   Hate crimes are disturbingly prevalent and pose a significant threat to the full participation of all Americans in our democratic society. It just so happens that we documented 113,000 hate crimes by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and in the year 2005, the most current data available, the FBI compiled reports on law enforcement agencies across the country, identifying 7,163 bias-motivated criminal incidents. 
   The fact of the matter that is known to law enforcement is that hate crime incidents are notoriously underreported; and so we come here today to take the civil rights laws that we have passed across the years to the last, final extent, to crimes of violence based on the hate of the individual, intended to intimidate the class or group that that individual comes from. 
   We have a strong bill. We have more supporters than ever in the Congress and in the national community, and we know that the current law limits Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes against individuals on the basis of race, religion, color or national origin, but only when the victim is targeted because he or she is engaged in a Federal protected activity, such as voting. 
   Further, the existing statutes do not permit Federal involvement in a range of cases where the crimes are motivated by bias against the victims' actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. 
   This legislation, identical to the version approved in the 109th Congress, will strengthen existing Federal law in the same way that the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 helped Federal prosecutors combat church arson, by addressing the rigid jurisdictional requirements under Federal law and expand the jurisdiction to crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability. 
   This bill only applies to bias-motivated crimes of violence. It does not impinge on public speech or writing in any way. In fact, the measure improves two explicit first amendment free speech protections for the accused, and we want you to know that there are no first amendment disabilities about this measure in any way. As a personal advocate of the first amendment, I can assure you that that would be the last thing that would be allowed to be in this bill. 
   What we are saying now is that a vote for this bill is not a vote in favor of any particular sexual belief or characteristic. It is a vote, rather, to provide basic rights for and protection for individuals so that they are protected from assaults based on their sexual orientation. 
   But the majority of incidents reported on racially motivated crimes, 54 percent, are based on racially motivated crimes, 17 percent on religious bias, and 14 percent on sexual orientation bias. 
   The time has come for the Congress to finally deal with this whole subject  of hate crimes. It is a blot on our constitutional understanding of what democracy is all about, and it is so important that today we debate and pass finally the hate crimes law that has been here and approved in three different Congresses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the motion to recommit, which would not operate as a simple amendment, but, listen to me, would instead send the bill back to the Committee on the Judiciary, in essence killing the bill for the remainder of the Congress. 
   The categories of individuals included in the amendment, seniors and members of the armed services, are entitled to protection under the law, and in point of fact they have protection under the law at both Federal and State levels. I note that it is already a Federal crime to kill or attempt to kill any member of the armed services under 18 U.S.C. 1114. 
   We also have programs in the law to provide assistance to prosecutors and law enforcement in the enforcement of crimes against elders, as well as a variety of senior services that will help them in their homes, safety and elder care. 
   The purpose of the bill is to protect classes of individuals who have been and are the group-wide victims of systemic violence: hanging a man because of his race, dragging someone to death because they are disabled. These are crimes that are designed to target and intimidate entire groups of individuals, and we all know it. That is why they are labeled hate crimes and why this legislation is before us. 
   As much as any Member here, I believe we can and should do more to protect other members of society. That is why our Committee on the Judiciary approved a COPS bill yesterday, reauthorizing a program to provide for 100,000 local police on the beat and other safety officials. That is why I have in the past pushed for an Elder Justice Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1868, The Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. H.R. 1868 authorizes appropriations for scientific and technical research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, strengthens and improves the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) initiative, and establishes the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) to assist U.S. businesses and institutions of higher education to accelerate development and application of challenging, high-risk technologies that promise widespread economic benefits. 
   H.R. 1868 authorizes $365 million for MEP, a highly successful program that helps small and medium domestic manufacturers compete more effectively in the international marketplace. The goal of MEP is not only to maintain current manufacturing jobs, but also to nurture growth in the manufacturing sector to create additional jobs for American workers. The bill provides for an 8 percent increase per year in MEP appropriations, which would double program funding in 10 years. 
   The Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007 also amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to establish an MEP board. The current national MEP board is established by the Secretary of Commerce, and has been woefully neglected for 3 years, not meeting at all in 2005 and 2006. NIST recently reconstituted the board, but most members are now from academia, not industry. H.R. 1868 would establish the MEP advisory board in statute, rather than at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, and would require majority representation from industry. 
   My district and others across the country will benefit from funding research at National Institutes of Standards and Technology, strengthening the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and establishing the Technology Innovation Program, and I am pleased to be able to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the committee, H.R. 4120, the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act, addresses a truly unfortunate and, in my view, wrongly decided decision by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of United States v. Schaefer. 
   Now, while the defendant was found to be in the possession of child pornography, the court nevertheless reversed his conviction because it concluded that the statute required, and the government had failed to prove, that the contraband had actually crossed State lines. This statute in question makes it illegal to possess child pornography ``in commerce.''  
   The court held that this phrase, ``in commerce,'' meant that Congress intended that the contraband had to actually cross State lines. Had the statute instead used the phrase ``in or affecting interstate commerce,'' the court held, the conviction would have been upheld, as that phrase is well understood as reflecting Congress' intent to use the full reach of its constitutional commerce clause power. 
   H.R. 4120 makes clear that the Congress intends that the prohibitions against child pornography reach the full extent of its constitutional authority. And as hearings in the Judiciary Committee hearing demonstrated, the child pornography business is no respecter of national or international borders. Even conduct that may appear to be wholly localized in its manifestation can nevertheless have an unmistakable effect in interstate commerce. 
   So let there be no mistake that Congress intends to use its full commerce clause authority to reach activities concluded by this odious business. And we want to make it so clear that even the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals cannot be mistaken by that. 
   And so I urge my colleagues to fully support this bill, as I expect that they will. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, as the prison population has grown over the past two decades, so has the number of prisoners completing their sentencing and returning to the general population. More than half a million, some 650,000 men and women, are leaving the Federal and State prisons each year. While the vast majority of the prisoners are committed to abiding by the law and becoming productive members of society, they often encounter the same pressures, the same environment, the same temptations that they faced before prison, and with insufficient resources to assist them in dealing with those pressures and temptations, sometimes, despite their best intentions at the time of release, too many of them commit new crimes and end up back in prison. More than two-thirds of them are arrested for new crimes within 3 years of their release. This exacts a terrible cost in financial terms as well as in human terms. 
   Congress has been very active over the years in strengthening our criminal laws and our investigative and prosecutorial tools against crime. The bipartisan legislation we are considering today, aptly named the Second Chance Act, complements those efforts by helping give ex-offenders the tools they need to stay out of trouble. It's a very commonsense piece of legislation and it recognizes that too many ex-offenders lack the education, job skills and stable living arrangements, the substance abuse treatment and health services that they need to successfully reintegrate into our society. 
   Many have trouble finding a job and some have trouble holding a job. Many move straight from their prison cell to a homeless shelter. Many entered prison with alcohol and drug habits, and the pull remains hard to resist once they reemerge in our society. Many are physically or mentally disabled. Some have chronic disease; others need psychological treatment. Many left spouses and young children behind when they entered prison. While these family relationships can be of tremendous value in helping an ex-offender build a stable life outside prison, it can be very difficult to rekindle these ties after a long and painful absence. 
   The Second Chance Act will help provide these men and women with the education, training, counseling and other support needed to help them obtain and hold steady jobs; to kick their drug and alcohol habits, if they have one; address medical and dental needs; rebuild their families; and deal with the many other challenges that they face in their efforts to successfully rejoin society. These kinds of programs have been tested on a smaller scale, to be sure, where they have already made a measurable difference in reducing recidivism. The Second Chance Act builds on these efforts in a measured but significant way to reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and help ex-offenders lead productive and law-abiding lives. 
   We have the support of current and former chairmen and ranking members of the Judiciary Committee and the crime subcommittee, chaired by Bobby Scott of Virginia, as well as a wide range of national, State and local law enforcement and rehabilitative organizations.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, here we are the day after Veterans Day. We come back in comity and goodwill. We are trying to finish off the last week before the Thanksgiving recess. And I want Judge Louie Gohmert, my dear friend from Texas, to understand as much as I can explain to him about the reservations that he has raised thus far. 
   I want him to know this is not a partisan bill at all and that the changes that have been made to the bill were made before Friday when you examined it. So if you were examining this measure on Friday, that is the last, that is all she wrote, because we haven't been in since then. 
   So, please understand that, first of all, this is a bipartisan bill. We had the hearings. We had a markup in which you participated rather actively. We had a record vote. We went to the Rules Committee. Everything is working I think very smoothly, according to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Bobby Scott, and the author of this bill for three Congresses, Congressman Danny Davis of Illinois. 
   Please know that we have been working on this bill. You are right, it has been through a lot of changes. The changes started before you graced us with your presence in the Judiciary Committee as a very important member of it. We have been working on this all the time. We think it is in an improved state. 
   I would just like you to know that we have 212 organizations, and because we are on a rather fast schedule here this afternoon, I won't bother you with them, but none of them are political. They are all community organizations. They are all organizations concerned with the reentry of people who have served their time and are now coming out. 
   We are trying to deal, Judge Gohmert, with this huge problem of people returning from their terms in prison. They come out and sometimes in my State, I hate to say this, they don't even have a bus ticket or a suit of new clothing to get to where they are supposed to be going. Many of them don't know where they are going. It is that dislocation that creates the situation of so many of them returning back. 
   One of the most distressing things I ever heard when I was visiting one of these places is that the guard tells the exiting prisoner, former prisoner who serves his term, ``I'll see you when you get back.'' Nothing tells the story more than I know there is nothing for you out in society. You're not trained for anything, you're not fit for anything, there are no jobs for you, so you're going to go back into your old ways and we're going to get you back in our clutches again. What we are trying to do, Judge Gohmert, is to change that. I know in your court you have seen your share of this kind of process even in Texas. 
   So I urge you to join with us in trying to be as constructive as you normally are, to help make everybody understand that we are trying to make  rehabilitation mean something besides just the phrase used in the criminal justice system.

   Mr. CONYERS. I'm hoping that the discussion and the presentation by my good friend, Mr. Goodlatte, does not indicate that he is opposed to the substance of this measure and that his remarks were generated around the process, the procedure, because I'm sure he worked on the Adam Walsh bill, and here, to me, is another important step forward on that. And so we look forward to his continued support. 
   Now, with reference to process, that's a little bit more sensitive issue, because, you know me, I don't like to bring up things that sound partisan. But you guys avoided more process in the Judiciary Committee than we ever have in the 110th Congress. So I've got a long record of it. 
   But we don't want to get off the track here. This isn't about process. But I've got some not-complimentary statistics about the way we've operated in the past. And I've had good relationships with all the Republican, it almost seems like forever, chairmen of the Judiciary Committee that have preceded us for this last 12 years. 
   But what our floor manager DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ is talking about now is something for which there can be no disagreement. We've got to get these Internet sex predators out of business. And that's what this measure does. It does it well. I don't know how much more benefited anybody would be if we had gone any different direction. 
   We're under a little duress now. We've got measures on top of measures. The scheduling is getting horrific. But I commend the gentlelady and the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle that have worked with her in pursuance of this legislation to get it to the floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, there are many ways to address criminal behavior on the Internet as reflected by the measures that we have already passed this afternoon. Without question, it is critical that Internet sex offenders be identified, arrested, prosecuted and punished as the law provides. 
   Nevertheless, Internet safety must begin with prevention, especially with our children. They must be taught how to use the Internet safely and how to avoid Internet behavior that puts them at risk. So H.R. 4134 authorizes that the Department of Justice administer grants for the purpose of teaching our children Internet safety. 
   This is an excellent measure that deserves our support. I commend the chairman of our fifth committee in Judiciary, LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ of California, for her leadership on this very critical issue, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased now to recognize the chairman of our subcommittee and the author of this measure, LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ of California, for as much time as she may consume. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his support of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4134, the Internet Crime Prevention Education Program Act. This bill will authorize funding for the i-SAFE program for 5 years and create a new grant competition to provide funds for like-minded Internet safety and crime prevention programs. This new grant program will support and enhance the efforts of schools, law enforcement agencies and parents to give children the skills they need to avoid potential criminal activity on the Internet. By bringing this bill to the floor today, the leadership of the House on both sides of the aisle has demonstrated that it recognizes that our children are in danger from cyberbullying, identity theft, cyberstalking and harassment and other potential cybercrimes. 
   These are very real threats and they demand real action, and I am proud that we are united in this effort. Although adults, even those with children, don't always realize it, children face a myriad of online dangers whenever they use chat rooms, instant messages and e-mail. They could come across predators, financial scams, or inappropriate content when they go online to do things as innocent as research for school assignments. 
   The Internet is a powerful tool for progress that is transforming the way our society obtains and shares information. But unfortunately the Internet also carries risks when misused as an avenue for predators, bullies and thieves. Last year, one in five children received a sexual solicitation or were inappropriately approached via the Internet. Unfortunately, numerous  children have already become victims of unspeakable physical harm or have suffered irreparable mental injuries from online predators. 
   Sexual predators are not the only danger facing youth online. As bizarre as it may seem to those of us old enough that we didn't have these technologies when we were in school, bullies are using their cell phones and the Internet to torment their peers. This literally means that kids can be bullied any hour of the day or night and even within their own homes. And because it is not face to face, cyberbullying can be much crueler and present a whole new set of dangers. 
   Cyberbullying can have serious consequences and inflict lasting wounds on young people. Studies have found that bullying can negatively impact the academic performance, self-esteem, and mental and physical health of children. Whenever I discuss bullying, I inevitably hear one person ask, ``What is wrong with a little bullying? It makes you stronger. It builds character.'' Builds character? Really? It is important to realize that students who are bullied are more likely to be depressed and commit suicide. 
   So many of the horrifying school shootings in recent years have been linked to bullying that it can no longer be viewed as a rite of passage. Bullying and harassment must be treated as the violent and damaging behaviors that they are. 
   This bill, the Internet Crime Prevention Education Program Act, is just one part of a package of bills that I have introduced to keep our kids safe by tackling bullying and harassment. 
   i-SAFE is the perfect example of an organization that shares this goal. i-SAFE, Incorporated is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to protecting the online experience of youth by incorporating classroom curriculum with community outreach to make the Internet a safer place. 
   The i-SAFE program is free for schools, school districts, law enforcement, communities, and parents in large part because of the congressional funding it has received on a bipartisan basis since 2002. i-SAFE has provided over 3 million children in 50 States with the tools to protect themselves on the Internet. 
   After participating in the i-SAFE program, 91 percent of students say that they will make better choices about where they go on the Internet, 87 percent say they will be more careful about sharing personal information in chat rooms, and 75 percent say they are less likely to meet someone from the Internet in person. 
   Law enforcement, which deserves praise for pursuing cybercriminals needs the help of programs like i-SAFE, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Crime Prevention Council, Web Wise Kids, Netsmartz, and Teen Angels, to help reduce online crimes through prevention. 
   When used the right way, the Internet can be a valuable educational resource and allow for extended social networks. It is our responsibility to ensure that children are able to enjoy all of the benefits of the Internet armed with the knowledge of how to stay safe. I therefore urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4134.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, H.R. 719, the KIDS Act, addresses the problems of convicted sex offenders infiltrating the Internet to contact and prey on minors. 
   You've heard about this problem before under the measure that has just passed the House. We are all familiar with the problem. There is not a parent who is not concerned that through the Internet a sex offender may attempt to contact a child for criminal, vicious sex purposes. 
   The KIDS Act addresses this problem in three ways: It authorizes funding for the Federal Probation and Pretrial Office to enhance the agency's ability to monitor the computer use by convicted Federal sex offenders. In particular, it authorizes funding to evaluate and purchase Internet filtering and monitoring systems to better enable probation officers to monitor the computer use of sex offenders. This is very important. This should help ensure that if an offender violates the terms of release as to Internet use, the violation will be discovered so the offender's release can be promptly revoked. 
   The next thing we do here is codify the current practice of some sentencing judges by specifically authorizing a court to require as a condition of probation that a convicted sex offender cooperate with the installation of Internet filtering and monitoring systems. 
   Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to consider increased penalties for sex crimes committed over the Internet where the defendant lied about his age or concealed identity as a sex offender. 
   This measure before us now adds a new criminal provision to reach those who set up ``virtual money systems'' to facilitate the trafficking of child pornography over the Internet. There's no simple way of keeping the Internet out of the hands of those who would use it for these and other sinister purposes. Nonetheless, the KIDS Act goes a long way toward addressing the problem of Internet sex predation by enhancing supervision of convicted sex offenders and increasing penalties for these crimes. 
   I can't imagine anyone in this House on either side of the aisle not supporting a measure such as this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for the hard work that he has put in on this measure. We appreciate the cooperation that we've had in the course of this. And of course we yield to no one in recognizing him as the Congress' foremost expert on the Internet, and thus his being involved in this kind of legislation for quite a few years. 
   Earlier versions of this bill required registration of online identifiers of sex offenders. And as the gentleman knows, a sex offender can change his user name and IP address in about two seconds, so we didn't feel that was particularly helpful. We thought monitoring sex offenders before they ever got on the Internet was a better way to go, and we're glad that we've been able to reach some closure with him on that subject. 
   Now, on the criminal provisions, I want to tactfully suggest that we've got a better way here in this bill, and I think most of the lawyers and those who followed this shall agree with us. There is no point in overburdening prosecutors. What we've done with reference to criminal provisions is that the practice of grooming, where sex predators lie about their age on the Internet to entice minors into sexual activity, obviously is horrific and widespread, but the other approach would have required prosecutors to prove a new and separate offense in order to get a higher sentence for offenses involving grooming. We didn't think that would be the better way to proceed. 
   Under the minority approach, a prosecutor would have had to prove all the elements of this new crime beyond a reasonable doubt. This is, I think, unnecessary and probably a very high burden to reach, given that there exists in criminal law a law against enticement that covers grooming activity. And so the approach we finally settled on directs the sentencing commission to provide tougher sentences for predatory behavior that involves grooming.  And you don't get the chairman of this committee talking about tougher sentencing on very many things around here; this is one that I can support without qualification. 
   So what we've done is deal with a serious problem of grooming and get to the same place as other approaches that have been suggested to us in what we believe, from a criminal justice point of view, is far more efficient. And with the new provisions that would fight financial facilitation of child pornography, we think we've got a bill. And we thank Mr. Pomeroy for helping us get there. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4136, the Enhancing the Effective Prosecution of Child Pornography Act, addresses two gaps in the criminal statutes that punish those who trade in, profit from, and create the market for child pornography. First, the bill provides that those who launder proceeds from the business of child pornography may be charged with money laundering. This is obviously common sense, and a provision supported by the Department of Justice. 
   Then, it clarifies the definition of possession in the child pornography laws so that knowingly accessing child pornography on the Internet with intent to view it constitutes possession, even if the user does not download or otherwise save the images. Some defendants have claimed that they did not intend to possess the images, even when they clearly intended to view them, and some courts have said the reach of the statute is unclear in this regard. This measure removes any ambiguity from the law. 
   We are grateful to CHRIS CARNEY, our colleague from Pennsylvania, who has authored this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (MEJA EXPANSION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we have never fought a war in which private contractors not only outnumber United States troops, as they do in Iraq, but perform many tasks that are very similar to those historically performed by our troops. A critical difference, however, is that these contractors, unlike our troops, are not subject to the requirements of military discipline and United States law governing the conduct of warfare. Further, they are also immune from Iraqi law. 
   As we know, last month contractors working for Blackwater allegedly opened fire in a Baghdad neighborhood, killing at least 11 Iraqi civilians. A witness told a CNN reporter, ``Each of their four vehicles opened heavy fire in all directions. They shot and killed everyone in cars facing them and people standing on the street.'' Another witness, whose youngest son was killed during the attack, likened the event to ``hell, like a scene from a movie.'' 
   This latest incident unfortunately evidences the fact that some of these contractors are abusing their power with impunity, subject to no law whatsoever, domestic or foreign. H.R. 2740 corrects this serious gap in current law. 
   Specifically, it amends the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, known as MEJA, in three critical respects: First, it closes the legal gap in current law by making all contractors accountable for their actions. MEJA currently only extends U.S. Federal criminal jurisdiction to felony crimes committed overseas by contractors working on behalf of the Defense Department.     
   This measure specifies that the act would apply to all contractors, regardless of the agency for which they provide services. 
   Second, this measure requires that the Inspector General of the Justice Department examine and report on the Department's efforts to investigate and prosecute allegations of misconduct committed by contractors overseas. 
   Since the Iraq war started, the Department has failed to commence a single prosecution against a contractor under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. Sadly, last month's Blackwater incident was not the first time contractors have acted abusively without any accountability. 
   On Monday, we learned that Blackwater was involved in at least 195 shooting incidents in Iraq since the year 2005. And Blackwater isn't the only culpable company. In 2005, armed contractors from the Zapata contracting firm allegedly fired indiscriminately not only at Iraqi civilians, but also at United States Marines. In 2006, employees of Aegis, another security firm, posted a trophy video on the Internet that showed them shooting civilians. And employees of Triple Canopy, yet another contractor, were fired after alleging that a supervisor engaged in a ``joyride shooting'' of Iraqi civilians. These cases, and all like them, should be appropriately investigated and prosecuted, if warranted. 
   Third, H.R. 2740 establishes ground units of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate allegations of  criminal misconduct by contractors. Notwithstanding the fact that more than 180,000 contractors are currently operating in Iraq, there is not a single investigative unit located in that country. 
   Pursuant to a directive of the administration, FBI agents are belatedly being sent to investigate the Blackwater crime scene in many instances where the evidence has long disappeared. Without a mandated investigating unit, the Justice Department lacks the ability or the incentive to respond effectively. And so, to our colleague from North Carolina, David Price, the author of H.R. 2740, we fixed that shortcoming. And I acknowledge the sponsor for his sustained leadership on this important issue of ensuring that those acting in our name will be held legally accountable for their conduct. 
   This legislation is widely supported, including the Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, the International Peace Operations Association, and Amnesty International. 
   The need for us remedying the problem described is extremely urgent. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of its swift passage. 
   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I rise to make three commonsense changes to clarify and improve the bill that has been under discussion, and I hope that it addresses my friend from Virginia's comments about tightening the bill and making it more clear and more specific. 
   First of all, we clarify that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is to investigate those fatalities resulting from the potentially unlawful use of force by contractors in war zones. This will help make it easier for an initial examination to confirm claims of self-defense by contractors without the need for a protracted and costly investigation when it may, in fact, not be warranted. 
   Secondly, in response to a suggestion from the minority and the administration, the amendment clarifies that the Attorney General is authorized to request assistance from other Federal agencies when assigning personnel and resources to the FBI investigative units on the ground. This would enable the Attorney General to draw on the expertise of the Department of Defense, among others, when appropriate in undertaking and moving forward with investigations and prosecutions. 
   And finally, we require that the FBI look only to the Secretary of Defense for any additional security assistance that the FBI investigative units may  need in a war zone. We would not want to have the FBI relying on private contractors for security while investigating their conduct. 
   And so I thank the chairman of the Crime Subcommittee, BOBBY SCOTT; the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, RANDY FORBES; along with the bill's creator, DAVID PRICE; and finally, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Carney) for working with me to craft this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I urge support for my amendment to provide the Inspector General of the Department of Justice the power to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by attorneys in that department. 
   And so I put forward to the committee a commonsense proposal that merely gives the Inspector General the tools that he or she may need to root out and report on waste, fraud and abuse. Whether we have a Democratic or Republican administration, I believe we should have strong and vigorous oversight of the Department of Justice. At present, however, the Department of Justice Inspector General is limited in his ability to investigate allegations of misconduct. 
   Instead, present law, to the surprise of many, requires that all allegations of wrongdoing by the Department of Justice attorneys be investigated not by the Inspector General but by the department's Office of Professional Responsibility. The department's Inspector General should have the same power Inspectors General have throughout the government to investigate without limitation any and all allegations of wrongdoing that arise in that department. 
   The Office of Professional Responsibility is supervised by the Attorney General. It is absolutely contrary to human experience to believe that the counsel to the Office of Professional Responsibility can aggressively investigate them. It is vital that investigations of these officials, and other high-level officials in the department, be conducted by the statutorily independent Inspector General who is required to be confirmed by the United States Senate. That is the thrust of the idea I propose in this first amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I want all the Members to make sure they understand that the Office of Professional Responsibility is accountable to the Attorney General, and when we are investigating the U.S. assistant attorneys or attorneys in the Department of Justice, he is investigating his own shop. 
   The second point is that their inspection, their investigations, are confidential. The Inspector General, the IG, requires a public disclosure of what he found. So this isn't a matter of trying to justify anything about the U.S. Attorneys action. 
   I would like my good friend from Ohio to know that this is something that has been discussed. The Inspector General for DOJ, Glenn Fine, has testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and made it very clear that these matters of public interest that require reports that are institutional should by all means go through this route rather than be shunted off to a private investigatory committee inside the Department of Justice.     
   It is an anomaly that we hope to correct. It doesn't reflect poorly on anybody. As a matter of fact, this will be for future Departments of Justice. We are not going to go back over anything that we have covered before. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge that the membership support this very modest amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC, as it celebrates 50 years of promoting non-violent action as a means to achieve social, economic, and political justice. The opportunity to serve as the first African-American Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is a tribute to the efforts of the SCLC to promote equal opportunity and equal justice. 
   Without the courage and sacrifice of members of the SCLC, namely its first President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and those Presidents that followed--Ralph Abernathy, Joseph Lowery, and Martin Luther King III, we simply would not be where we are today. And while we have much work to do, we are living the legacy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference everyday. 
   This August will be the 50th anniversary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The SCLC traces its roots to the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, which began with the quiet yet courageous efforts of one woman: Rosa Parks. I had the privilege of working with Rosa Parks for over 20 years when she agreed to join my staff after I was elected to Congress in 1964. The Montgomery Bus Boycott brought together two local ministers, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ralph Abernathy, who established the Montgomery Improvement Association to lead the boycott efforts. As the movement to desegregate public transportation spread beyond Montgomery County into surrounding States, it was clear that the organization needed to expand, both in size and in scope. 
   Following the success of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a group of 60 organizers from 10 States met in Atlanta, Georgia to plan the next steps. The result was the founding of the Southern Leadership Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration. The organization's title was shortened to its current name, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during its first convention, held in Montgomery in August 1957. Next week, the SCLC will be hosting its 49th annual convention in Atlanta, GA. 
   Leading the efforts of the SCLC to end segregation was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man I am honored to have been able to call a friend and confidant. In fact, it was Dr. King that endorsed me for Congress when I first ran and was elected to serve in 1964. Significantly, Dr. King personally awarded me with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  Award in 1967. Having walked alongside Dr. King, a fearless leader who challenged continued racial segregation and believed that ``oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever,'' I am committed to continuing the legacy of Dr. King and the SCLC. 
   Under the helm of President Joseph Lowery for much of its existence--from 1977 until 1997, the SCLC advanced Dr. King's dream for an America--a society united behind the banner of equality and freedom. Today, the SCLC remains strong under the leadership of Dr. Charles Steele, Jr., promoting a number of programs in the areas of economic empowerment, health advocacy, education, and criminal justice. The SCLC has also established the Martin Luther King, Jr., Conflict Resolution Center, an international initiative to promote Dr. King's principle of nonviolence as a means to resolving conflicts throughout the world. 
   We've come a long ways over the last 50 years, and the work of the SCLC continues to be of critical importance. It is to the credit of Dr. King and other leaders of the SCLC that today the torch of the civil rights movement is carried by many hands. One of those hands is Dr. King's son, Martin III, who headed the SCLC from 1997 until 2003 and remains committed to the organization's vision. So following the lead of Martin III, Joseph Lowery, Ralph Abernathy, and of course Dr. King, let us continue the work and legacy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on its 50th anniversary.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (OUR WORSENING HEALTH CARE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of the ``Cover the Uninsured Week,'' and I rise to remind the Chamber of the worsening health care crisis that we face as a Nation, and propose a solution to one of the biggest challenges of the 21st Century facing us. 
   Lack of health insurance often denies necessary medical care. Forty seven million Americans are uninsured. This problem is not limited to the poor or the unemployed. Researchers have estimated that about four-fifths of the uninsured are either employed or members of a family with an employed adult. 
   As well, there are an additional 50 million Americans who are underinsured; that is, they have coverage that would not protect them from catastrophic medical expenses. Simply put, an increasing number of Americans lack adequate health insurance because they and their employers simply cannot afford it. 
   Despite the challenges of the war in Iraq and the slumping economy, we all agree that the uninsured need to be covered. Even the health insurance companies have their own plan for covering the uninsured. I'm glad that we're on the same page, after all these years. 
   The real question we face is, how do we go about covering the uninsured? And how do we ensure that every American has access to quality medical care when they need it? 
   I strongly believe in a single-payer national health insurance, an approach that has been too often marginalized in debates on this issue, even though it has been successfully employed in almost every industrial nation except our own. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time for Congress to consider single-payer, not only as a viable option to cover the uninsured, but as the preferred solution to fix our broken health care system. And make no mistake about it, it is in very bad shape. 
   According to a January 2007 article in the Journal of Health Affairs, France, Japan and Australia rated best, and the United States worst in new rankings focusing on preventable deaths due to treatable conditions, in 19 leading industrialized nations. 
   The article revealed that if the United States health care system performed as well as those top three countries, there'd be 101,000 fewer deaths in the United States each year. 
   Equally disturbing, the Institute of Medicine reports that 20,000 Americans die each year as a direct result of having no health insurance. How can we, in the Congress, who receive fairly decent health care, tell 47 million uninsured Americans that they cannot have access to health care? 
   With the knowledge that 20,000 Americans die each year without health insurance, how can we, in Congress, who do have health insurance, not place universal health care as a front burner issue in this chamber? 
   This is a moral challenge that we all must pick up. And incrementalism will not work. Expanding a broken system or fixing parts of it will not work. We must approach the health care solution the same way a physician approaches the treatment of disease. Doctors do not employ treatments only because they are easy or feasible. They choose evidence-based solutions based upon peer-reviewed research in order to employ the most state-of-the-art care available. And so I propose we take the same approach to crafting a universal health care plan. 
   So today, I ask the following question: What further disaster must befall us before we face the crisis of the uninsured and the underinsured? 
   How many more people must die due to the inability to receive care in the world's healthiest Nation before we, in Congress, take action and create a truly universal health care system? 
   For those who believe that we are not ready to have a universal health care system, and must delay the formation of a comprehensive, national health insurance program, I ask you to consider the following evidence that demonstrates why we can ill afford delaying action on a universal health care system. 
   Health care horror stories are cases in which the result is so tragic that it shocks the conscience. We hear about them almost every day, in the newspapers, magazines, the Internet, television, radio, personal encounters with our friends and neighbors. 
   In the movie ``Sicko'' we, as a Nation, saw firsthand how even those with health insurance suffer under the current, for profit, employer-based private health insurance system. 
   In my office, I receive scores of health care horror stories each month, and have binders in my office of health care tragedies that we have collected over the last 8 years. In fact, when Michael Moore was doing research for ``Sicko'' he received 25,000 health care horror stories himself, after he made an appeal for those horror stories on his website. 
   I'd like to read a health care horror story sent to us by Adrienne Campbell from Michigan, a story, that, unfortunately, millions of Americans who are underinsured or uninsured can relate to. Here's her story. 
   My sister, who is 22 years old right now, was diagnosed with cervical cancer, the same cancer I had at the same age. She graduated from college back in December, so she is off my dad's insurance. 
   Jobs are hard to find here in Michigan, so she's working two part-time jobs, and neither of them provide insurance for part-time workers. 
   She has to go through what I did, but instead of actually being able to get medical treatment right away, then having to pay for it, she has to put off until she and the hospital can work out a payment plan. They told her the soonest they might be able to perform the surgery will be in April. 
   We've been calling around seeking other options. She's at Stage 4. I was at Stage 2, when I went through my ordeal, so she's in much worse condition than I was; 
   which worries me. 
   This is unacceptable. It's like I am living my horror all over again, only this is my sister. This is why we have  to fight. We have to shake things up this election year. 
   There's nothing you can do for my sister at this point, except keep her in your prayers, and I hope that she can get surgery soon. But, for those women who may get cervical cancer down the road, let's fight for universal health care so they don't have to go through the money worries. 
   I love my sister, Victoria, or as my daughter calls her, Aunt Gickie, because she can't say Vickie. 
   Please, just keep her in your prayers and thoughts. Thanks for letting me vent. I love her too much to see this happen to her. 
   Mr. Speaker, we do not have a health care system in this country. What exists is a fragmented, nonsystem of health care. It's a wasteful and inefficient patchwork of different plans and schemes that allow too many people to fall between the cracks. 
   The complexity of this nonsystem is what makes it unsustainable. Private health insurers are in the business to make a profit. Make no mistake about it. In fact, the real problem is that insurance companies are not as much in the business to provide care as they are in the business to deny care. They keep profits up by avoiding high risk patients, limiting the coverage of those they do insure, and passing costs back to patients through copayments and deductibles. 
   They deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, including such costly diseases as athletes foot and yeast infections. 
   They employ an army of adjusters who go through mountains of paperwork, all mostly working to figure out a way to deny a claim. We have the story of insurance company whistleblower, Dr. Linda Pino, who tells us she was paid a bonus on how many claims that she could deny, and threatened with demotion if she authorized payment on more claims than her peers. 
   These practices are harmful. They're expensive. All those adjusters and paperwork cost a lot of money. Add to that insurance costs the insurance company's spending on advertising, huge executive salaries, and profits for shareholders, and the result is an average overhead of 15 cents on the dollar. Compare that with Medicare's overhead which is between 2 and 3 cents. 
   The complexity of this nonsystem not only leads to gaps in coverage and navigating nightmares, but it's underscored by the duplicity and waste created by the multitude of health insurance companies. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased now to recognize the gentleman from Ohio, who's been on this plan for--several Congresses ago he was and is the original co-founder and original signer with me to this bill. He's worked relentlessly in the Congress and across the country in making it clear that we're working on a system that some day is going to bring so much joy and benefit to the millions of Americans in this country. He's a fearless, dedicated, articulate leader, and I would now yield to my colleague, Dennis Kucinich.

We're up somewhere about 90 now and growing every week, every month. More and more people are joining us.

   Mr. CONYERS. In addition, we are creating a system of preventive health care. We are creating a system in which people, when they initially get sick, can go to a doctor instead of being forced to go to emergency rooms where they get temporary treatment, and then they're back at home or on the streets again. We will make the country healthier. And national health care is an ambition that is very much related to national security. So I'm pleased that all of these things can occur with the consideration of House Resolution 676. 
   In the last 10 years, the cost of health care to businesses has increased 140 percent. We need an efficient universal health care system that protects American businesses from skyrocketing health care costs so that, as a Nation, we can remain competitive in the global marketplace. 
   The rising cost of health care in this country has played a significant role in the current economic climate, specifically with regard to the outsourcing of labor to foreign countries. Between 2000 and 2007, United States health premiums have risen 98 percent, while wages have only increased by 23 percent. The average family health insurance plan now costs more than the earnings of a full-time minimum wage worker. 
   Our fractured non-system of health care is crippling our economy. But don't take my word for it, just ask the United Automobile Workers and the AFL-CIO, or even the automobile makers themselves. Health care has become such a central issue for General Motors that Economists magazine only partly  in jest called the company a pension hedge fund wand health insurance business that happens to make cars. 
   Ford and General Motors pay nearly $1,500 in health care costs for each vehicle they produce, while BMW pays $450 in Germany, and Honda only $150 per vehicle in Japan.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressmen Al Green and Frank Pallone for arranging this Special Order hour. Today I rise to register my concern about the conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and to show my support and dedication to increasing the quality of health care services, for our veterans as well as our men and women in uniform. 
   The Nation has been horrified by the Washington Post's recent reports of the appalling conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Thanks to the diligent investigative reporting of Dana Priest and Anne Hull, we now know that our soldiers recovering in outpatient units are being forced to confront cockroaches, mice droppings and toxic black mold as they heal. Even worse, many become lost in an uncaring military bureaucracy that subjects them to long waits just to get their most basic needs addressed. 
   The administration is now scrambling to control the damage from this scathing expos&#233; of its neglect of our wounded warriors. Almost as distressing as the conditions at Walter Reed is the fact that it took a report from the Washington Post to get the administration to address this unacceptable situation. We now know that our wounded warriors have been complaining about these problems for years, not just at Walter Reed but at military hospitals and outpatient facilities across the country. Their pleas, however, seem to have fallen on deaf ears. We owe a debt of gratitude to the reporters and editors at the Washington Post for uncovering this abominable situation and forcing this administration to act. 
   Time and again, when those of us who oppose America's involvement in Iraq stand up and question why our brave men and women in uniform must fight and die in a war of choice, we are accused of ``not supporting the troops.'' But, Madam Speaker, supporting the troops is about more than lip service. The hypocrisy and irony of the situation at Walter Reed is scandalous and immoral. The same administration that hides behind the troops to avoid changing its policy in Iraq is guilty of abandoning the very men and women who must make the sacrifices required to carry out this failed policy. 
   The sheer audacity of the administration's rhetoric in comparison with its actions is staggering. The administration trumpets its support for the troops but then, in the next moment, sends them into battle without the proper training and equipment. The administration says it supports the troops, but then falls short in providing them with a safe environment to heal the wounds they received while fighting so valiantly and selflessly for our country. 
   Thousands of our brave men and women serving the administration's failed policy in Iraq have paid a heavy price. Since March of 2003, 23,677 service members have been wounded in Iraq. Our military and VA health care systems are ih crisis, apparently unprepared for the influx of casualties that war unavoidably creates. These health systems have been overwhelmed by troops returning from battle seeking health care and, in many instances, are unable to provide these men and women with the services they so desperately need. It is estimated that in the coming years 
   over 700,000 veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will enter the military and veterans health care system. Yet, because of Republican budget cuts, many of our brave soldiers are returning home with mental health ailments to discover that they will receive a third fewer psychiatric visits than they would have just 10 years ago. 
   The number of soldiers navigating the bureaucracy of Walter Reed since 2001 has nearly doubled, yet the administration continues to move forward with the planned closing of the hospital. The president's budget continues to shortchange veterans' health care, providing an increase in fiscal year 2008 but then cutting the budget in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to below the 2008 level and freezing the funding level thereafter. The administration's lack of planning for the war seems to include a total disregard for the service members who are returning home bearing the scars of the conflict. 
   Mr. Speaker, our soldiers have done their duty. Now we must truly support them, not by blindly continuing a failed policy, but by getting them out of harm's way. We will continue to insist that our service members receive the health care they deserve. We will continue to hold oversight hearings about the conditions faced by our wounded service members and veterans at Walter Reed as well as at other military and veterans health facilities across the country. But the best way to support these brave young men and women is to begin a fully-funded withdrawal. Let's really support our troops by giving them the equipment and supplies they need to get out of Iraq safely in the next 6 months.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CONDEMNATION OF NOOSE INTIMIDATION -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and members of the committee, I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of House Resolution 826, a resolution condemning the hanging of nooses for the purpose of intimidation, violence, and other criminal purposes. 
   Unfortunately, consideration of this resolution comes at a critical time for our Nation. Many of us had thought the hanging of a noose, a symbol of racial violence, hate, and intimidation down through history was a practice relegated to our past. Since September, however, there have been reports of approximately 50 noose-hanging incidents across this country. It's no coincidence that these disturbing incidents follow in the shadow of the Jena Six case, which documents continuing racial inequity in our Nation even into this century. 
   As we all know, a hanging noose symbolizes lynching, one of the most shameful, terror-ridden, racial crimes in our history and which, sadly, can be traced back to the very founding time of the United States. 
   First used to punish African slaves as early as the 17th century, the practice of lynching was commonplace until, I'm sorry to report, as late as 1968. Between 1882 and 1962, nearly 5,000 people, most of them African Americans, were lynched in our country. 
   There appears to be a resurgence in the hanging of nooses for intimidation or other racist purposes. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for example, has filed more than 30 lawsuits for hanging nooses in the workplace since the year 2001. The commission observed ``a disturbing national trend of increased racial harassment cases involving hangman's nooses in the workplace.'' 
   In October, a noose was found hanging, of all places, in the Nassau County New York police headquarters locker room. Last month, hanging ropes were found in the United States Coast Guard Academy in the bag of an African American cadet and in the office of a diversity trainer.     
   Noose incidents are also occurring with disturbing frequency in schools throughout our country. At Louisiana's Jena High School, nooses were hung from a tree that white students had regarded as their exclusive domain for socializing after African Americans sat under the tree. This sparked similar incidents in schools across our Nation. In New York City, an African American professor at Columbia University found a noose hanging on her office door. In North Carolina, four nooses were found hanging at various locations at High Point Andrews High School. Universities in Maryland, Delaware and Indiana have reported noose incidents in recent months. In my own State of Michigan, nooses were hung on the Central Michigan University campus weeks after anti-Muslim pamphlets had been distributed. 
   As this resolution calls upon Federal authorities to investigate noose incidents, I am heartened to note the Justice Department's efforts to address this problem. At an oversight hearing on the Jena 6 incident held earlier by the Judiciary Committee, the Department stated it viewed such noose hangings as possible violations of Federal civil rights law. 
   I commend my colleague from the State of Texas, our new Member, Al Green, who for his leadership on this issue should be really commended as an important contribution that he has made. And I would like to acknowledge the Judiciary Committee's members on both sides of the aisle who helped advance this resolution with their active support. The Committee on the Constitution chairman, Jerrold Nadler; the Crime Committee chairman, Bobby Scott; also our stellar members from North Carolina, Mel Watt; and from Texas, Sheila Jackson-Lee; from California, Maxine Waters; Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin; Georgia, Hank Johnson; Tennessee, Steve Cohen; Wisconsin, James Sensenbrenner; and Texas, Louie Gohmert. These and many others have been very helpful in laying the groundwork for us to come together to hearten not just the people in this country but our law enforcement agencies, particularly the Department of Justice, in trying to reduce and indeed eliminate this unfortunate system of hate that is spreading, unfortunately, in our country. 
   I think we can head it off, and I hope with the passage of House Resolution 826 that will be, in fact, accomplished. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (GENOCIDE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and members of the committee, the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948. It was in response to Nazi Germany's policy of systematic murder. The Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, established genocide as an international crime which signatory nations undertake to prevent and punish. It's the duty that we address in the Genocide Accountability Act before us at this moment. 
   We must remember that genocide affects all humanity, not just the direct victims, and not just the perpetrators, but all those who stand by and by their inaction allow those horrible acts to take place. These are the lessons of the Holocaust, of Cambodia, of Bosnia and, more recently, of Rwanda. In Rwanda, we shrugged our shoulders and waited until 800,000 people were killed before we were willing to call that atrocity by its rightful name, genocide. 
   Sadly, even after Rwanda, the world has mostly stood by while yet another genocide has unfolded before our eyes. The genocide in Darfur has thus far claimed 200,000 lives, and maybe going up to as many as 400,000 lives. Two and a half million people have been displaced as a result of the conflict in Darfur. Both President Bush and Congress have correctly described the situation in Darfur as genocide. 
   As history repeats itself in Darfur, it seems that we have to learn to say the right things about these atrocities, but too often we cannot seem to muster the consensus and strength of will in the United States and the international community to make our deeds match our words. Along with an increased United Nations peacekeeping force, and a long-term political agreement among its many factions, we need to explore every avenue available to stop this massacre from continuing and prevent similar ones in the future. 
   The Genocide Accountability Act is an effort to ensure that our United States laws provide adequate authority to prosecute acts of genocide. We should not have a situation where perpetrators of genocide are allowed to enter the United States and use this country as a safe haven from prosecution. What an untenable thought. 
   But under current law, genocide is only a crime if it's committed within the United States or by a United States national outside of the United States. In contrast, the laws of torture, material support for terrorism, terrorism financing, hostage taking, and many other Federal crimes allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction for crimes committed outside the United States by non-United States nationals. 
   So there's a gap in the law. This has led to real-life consequences. I understand that the Justice Department has identified individuals who have participated in the Rwandan and the Bosnian genocides and who have entered the United States under false pretenses. Under current law, these individuals can be deported but they can't be arrested or prosecuted for committing genocide. 
   And so we bring to you on the floor today a measure to allow us to do more than send them off to another country, not knowing whether they will ever be prosecuted. This measure will allow us to bring them to justice. Amending our laws to allow for vigorous prosecution of genocide is a first, a small, but very, very important step toward ending the impunity under which those who commit genocide currently operate. 
   I am so proud of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who have worked with us on this: Lamar Smith; the floor manager for the Republicans, Mr. Forbes; and many others. We must remember that it cannot be the last step, this measure. If we are going to fulfill our role as the beacon in the world for basic human rights and freedom from persecution, we must continue to develop the humble legislative beginning that we have begun today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, this measure, H.R. 3791, called the SAFE Act, will improve the ability of our law enforcement officers to investigate offenses involving child pornography and the exploitation of children by the Internet. 
   Under current law, Internet service providers are required to file a report to the cyber tip line of the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children when the provider learns of child pornography. The center serves as a clearinghouse for leads and sends the reports to law enforcement agencies around the United States and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
   Unfortunately though, many Internet companies are unaware of these obligations, and the law is unclear as to the precise information that is required to be reported to the center. This bill addresses the aforementioned problems. 
   First, it facilitates the reporting of child pornography from Internet service providers to the center by clarifying the information that must be reported. Then it specifies the data that must be maintained by the reporting company for law enforcement purposes. And finally, it provides certain liability waivers for the center and Internet service providers for their roles in dealing with child pornography as required by law. Therefore, H.R. 3791 makes clear the precise reporting obligations of Internet providers and, in this way, will facilitate the investigation and prosecution of child pornography and other crimes against children that involve the Internet. I think this is an important measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, according to the United States Fire Administration, arson is the leading cause of fire in the United States and annually results in over 2,000 injuries, more than 400 deaths, and $1.5 billion in property damage. Even more problematic is the fact that arson is one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute. Only 16 percent of intentionally set fires result in arrests, and only 2 percent result in conviction. 
   Although arson causes significant losses in lives and property each year, there is no national registry requiring convicted arsonists to notify law enforcement of their residence, place of employment, or other information that would aid law enforcement in identifying offenders with a demonstrated disposition for committing arson offenses, and that's precisely what H.R. 1759 does. We respond to several aspects of the serious concerns presented by arson. 
   To aid law enforcement in identifying criminal activity related to arson, we established the National Arson Registry, a comprehensive nationwide network of registry databases developed by the Attorney General that tracks convicted arsonists. 
   The bill also requires jurisdictions to create arson registries and mandates that convicted arsonists register in each jurisdiction in which he or she resides, is an employee, or is a student at an educational institution. 
   And finally, the bill requires the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to coordinate the various databases through the National Arson Registry and make the information available to law enforcement agencies. Armed with this information, law enforcement authorities will be able to solve many more arson crimes than they are able to now. Knowing that they're registered with and known to local authorities may deter convicted arsonists from committing new arson. 
   This bill rightly enjoys broad bipartisan support. I commend my colleagues in the Judiciary Committee,  LAMAR SMITH and the floor manager of the bill, and urge that we support legislation whose time has come.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1338, ``The Paycheck Fairness Act.'' This legislation will help our Nation take the final steps in its long journey towards ensuring that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. The Congress first committed itself to remedying the scourge of pay discrimination in 1963, when it passed the Equal Pay Act. At that time, full-time working women were paid on average 59 cents on the dollar earned by their male counterparts. In the ensuring 43 years, the wage gap between men and women has narrowed. In 2008, women earn about 77 percent of what men earn. While this is a dramatic improvement, the 23 cent gap that exists still exemplifies that gender discrimination is a real and contemporary problem in our labor market. 
   H.R. 1338 would attack this problem in a comprehensive manner. It builds on many of the innovative policies found in the original EPA and adds provisions specifically crafted to address the realities of 21st century offices. H.R. 1338 will: 
   Strengthen the EPA by making it unlawful for an employer to pay unequal wages to men and women who have substantially similar jobs that are performed under similar working conditions within the same physical location of business. Under the original EPA, employers can justify unequal pay if it is based on: Seniority; merit; quality or quantity of production; or ``any factor other than sex.'' This legislation clarifies the ``any factor other than sex'' defense, so that an employer trying to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show that the disparity is not sex-based, is job related, and is necessary for the business; 
   Prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose salary information with their co-workers. However, employees such as HR personnel who have access to payroll information as part of their job would not be protected if they disclose the salaries of other workers; 
   Strengthen the remedies available to include punitive and compensatory damages. Under the EPA currently, plaintiffs can only recover back pay and in some cases double back pay. The damages would not be capped; 
   Require the Department of Labor to improve outreach and training efforts to work with employers in order to eliminate pay disparities; 
   Enhance the collection of information on women's and men's wages in order to more fully explore the reasons for gender-based wage gap and to assist employers in their efforts to rectify pay disparities; and 
   Create a new grant program to help strengthen the negotiation skills of girls and women.  
   Mr. Chairman, I was shocked when I heard last year about the case of Lilly Ledbetter, the Goodyear Tire plant employee who suffered from pay discrimination for nearly two decades. After learning that she had been victimized by her employer, she brought an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint against Goodyear. Unfortunately, a majority of our anti-worker, pro-corporate Supreme Court denied her claim, ruling that employees can only file a wage-discrimination complaint within 180 days of a discriminatory payroll decision. Ms. Ledbetter, a clear victim of discrimination, was left without recourse in a country founded on a respect for the rule of law. For this, we should be ashamed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that our courts are our last line of defense when it comes to protecting the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution and in our civil rights laws. With our marketplace and court systems unwilling to correct obvious injustices, we need a legislative solution that will ensure that the universal values of fairness, respect, and decency continue to be a part of the American workplace. To this end, I urge my colleagues to step up for ``equal pay for equal work'' and pass H.R. 1388.

   It is with great pleasure that I introduce Bishop Earl J. Wright, Sr. as the guest chaplain for the day. The bishop is very well known in Detroit, and we have known each other since the 1950s, even before Coleman Young became the first African American mayor of our great city. 
   He has a number of responsibilities, but the one that I enjoy bringing to the membership's attention is that he is a founding and supporting pastor of Miller Memorial Church of God in Christ Number 2, located in Haiti. And, of course, we are honored to have his lovely and gracious wife, Dr. Robin L. Wright, who is the senior supervisor of the Church of God in Christ's Japanese Jurisdiction. In addition to being an evangelist, she is also a writer and a great help to the bishop. 
   We have known each other across the years, and I remember coming to him the first time I ran for Congress, and with the late Bishop Bailey, I was able to prevail in my very first election. 
   The bishop has shown himself as a true disciple of Christ, relying heavily on his favorite scripture, Romans 4:21: ``And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.'' He exemplifies service to his fellow man, allowing his words to always bring grace to the hearer. He constantly speaks words of hope, spreading the good news to all. He practices evangelism that reflects Christ-like compassion to reach the world with the gospel. 
   Bishop Earl Wright, Sr. is a wonderful man of God, and I'm happy to know him and to welcome him to the floor of the House of Representatives today as guest chaplain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the S. Con. Res. 70, the conference report to the FY 2009 Budget. 
   Every day, new reports suggest our economy is slowing. It is imperative that the Congress help Americans during these tough economic times. I am supportive of the Democratic budget because it will expand health care for needy Americans, provide tax relief for the middle class, strengthen safety net programs, and reject the President's draconian funding cuts. In effect, S. Con. Res 70 will lead America in a new direction. 
   The Bush budget slashes a half trillion dollars from Medicare and Medicaid over the next decade. The Democratic budget rejects the President's proposed cuts to health care, and instead provides program improvements to State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Last year, the President twice vetoed legislation that would have expanded this essential program. S. Con. Res. 70 will provide $50 billion for SCHIP, which significantly reduces the number of uninsured children. The Democratic budget further helps Americans with the skyrocketing cost of health care by investments in health information technology and research grants in medical technology. 
   The Democratic budget provides tax breaks for low- and middle-income families, including an extension of the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, extension of the 10% individual income tax bracket and an extension of the deduction for state and local sales taxes. S. Con. Res. 70 will also stop the Alternative Minimum Tax from raising taxes on more than 20 million middle-class tax payers. 
   In this era of globalization, it is crucial that we give our youth the best possible education without burdening them with insurmountable debt. The Bush budget would eliminate important educational programs such as the Thurgood Marshall Legal education, Perkins Loans Cancellations, Mental Health Integration and Reading is Fundamental. In contrast, the Democratic budget provides significant increases to vital programs in education, job training, and social service programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, my home state of Michigan is facing serious economic challenges, in part  due to the President's failed policies. The Democratic budget will offer working families a chance at the American dream. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (IN HONOR OF THE 2008 DETROIT RED WINGS AND THEIR STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, it's with great pride that I rise today to congratulate our Detroit Red Wings on winning this year's National Hockey League championship. It has been 6 long years since the Red Wings have last brought the Stanley Cup back to Hockey Town, which is what we call Detroit in our good seasons, but their hard work and their hard-won victory on defeating the Penguins in six games is the epitome of teamwork at its absolute best. If ever a championship fits the personality of a community, this one does.  
   This team was about true sportsmanship and selflessness. Every Red Wing could vie for the Most Valuable Player award because each of them played with remarkable fortitude and consistence. Whether Detroit won because of the stepped up play of goalie Chris Osgood, the excellent leadership of the Captain Nicklas Lidstrom (the first European Captain to hoist the Stanley Cup), Henrik Zetterberg's post-season offense led the way (scoring 13 goals in the playoffs), or the tremendous Red Wings bench. They are a true model of what can be achieved with team work: Success. 
   I am particularly excited that the city of Detroit won this championship at this time. Madam Speaker, during the past few years the Metro Detroit area has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, some of which will never come back to this great city. The Detroit Red Wings winning this championship has brought back hope and a sense of optimism that Detroit desperately needs. The team's success exemplifies the strength and tenacity both of the Red Wings and of the great citizens of Detroit. 
   The moral of this championship is that you never now what you can achieve until you try. Go Red Wings.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, this concurrent resolution makes technical and conforming changes to the Second Chance Act, H.R. 1593, to expedite its proper enrollment. The House passed the Second Chance Act in November on suspension by a vote of 347-62. May I note for the Record that this is the 10th year during three Congresses that this legislation has been worked on, debated, had witnesses, been voted on; and now we come here today to make some technical changes and, with our holiday wishes, send this measure on its way. 
   The Second Chance Act strengthens overall crime-fighting efforts by helping give ex-offenders tools for staying out of trouble, support for job skills, stable living arrangements, substance abuse treatment, health services, and other very basic resources to successfully rejoin society and lead productive and law-abiding lives. It enjoys, clearly, wide bipartisan support. 
   This concurrent resolution expedites the process of finalizing the bill and sending it to the President in this session of Congress by making a few corrections brought to our attention after the bill passed the House last month, such as standardizing certain criteria in the process for three different kinds of grants and clarifying eligibility for a prison pilot program. 
   It is a good measure. The corrections here are technical only. And I am proud to bring it to the attention of my colleagues for passage as urgently as possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Res. 1095) recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the Fair Housing Act) and the 20th anniversary of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 1095 recognizes the 40th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. 
   On April 11, 1968, days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion or national origin. Twenty years later today, the law was expanded by the Fair Housing Amendments Act to include protections against discrimination based also on sexual orientation, familial status, and disability. 
   Many may not recall Dr. King's advocacy for fair housing, but he recognized the tremendous costs our society pays if patterns of segregated living continues, as it has. 
   While there is no question that the Fair Housing Act has become a powerful tool for advancing civil rights, there is much more to be done. For instance, most Americans still live in communities largely divided by race, according to the National Fair Housing Alliance. 
   An estimated 3.7 million people are discriminated against in housing transactions every single year. This number doesn't even include instances of discrimination against persons with disabilities, nor does it reflect discriminatory lending in insurance practices, planning and zoning, or other forms of profiling. We have so much more to do. 
   Enforcement is a key area where we need further improvement. For example, while 27,000 complaints of housing discrimination were filed with the Federal Government last year, Housing and Urban Development issued 31 charges, and the Justice Department filed 35 cases. 
   Landlords, real estate agents, lenders, insurance agents, and others know they face limited risk of prosecution for discrimination. Even those who are prosecuted often pay such a minor penalty that discrimination today becomes just another cost of doing business. It's no surprise that housing providers continue to discriminate and communities across our Nation sadly remain highly segregated. 
   The most recent manifestation of discrimination in housing is the current sub-prime foreclosure crisis, which presents some of the greatest fair housing and civil rights issues facing our Nation today. Fueled by reverse red-lining practices, the sub-prime foreclosure crisis is now causing extreme havoc for minority owners who were targeted for predatory home loans that stripped away their home equity and put their houses at risk of foreclosure. It's also affected financing markets all over the world. 
   If left unchecked, the foreclosure crisis threatens to wipe out many of the advances the country has made in the 40 years since the passage of the Fair Housing Act. 
   To be an effective tool in our fight against discrimination, the Fair Housing Act must be enforced, and we need to augment it with tough anti-predatory lending legislation, which is what I intend to do. 
   We should also enact legislation permitting bankruptcy judges to restructure home mortgages so deserving families can save their homes from foreclosure and, thereby, stem falling housing prices in communities all across our Nation. 
   After centuries of discrimination and denied opportunities, enactment of the Fair Housing Act 40 years ago marked a milestone in our Nation's efforts to achieve equal housing opportunities. 
   And so today, we celebrate the Fair Housing Act's 40th anniversary with, I hope, a renewed commitment to achieving and furthering its goals by supporting this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (RELIGIOUS WORKER VISA EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, this week we are honored by a visit from His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI and are reminded of the good work that people of faith do all around the world. I am pleased to bring before the House at this time the Religious Worker Visa Extension Act of 2008. 
   This measure would reauthorize the Special Immigrant Non-Minister Religious Worker Program, which also allows non-minister religious workers to obtain special immigrant status in the United States so that they may do the work required of their faith. If we don't act, the program will sunset at the end of September of this year. 
   Non-minister religious workers are people of faith who are called to a vocation or who are in traditional religious occupations with a bona fide nonprofit religious organization in the United States. Examples of those called to a vocation include nuns, monks, and sisters. Examples of those in religious occupations include missionaries, counselors, translators, religious instructors, cantors, and other pastoral care providers. 
   The program provides up to 5,000 special immigrant visas per year that religious denominations or organizations in the United States may use to sponsor foreign nationals to perform religious service here. Once granted, this type of visa allows religious workers to immigrate permanently to the United States. 
   Since it was first enacted in 1990, the program has been extended four times, most recently in 2003. Working with the ranking member of our committee, LAMAR SMITH, we're making changes in the program for the first time to address potential fraudulent uses of the program. None other than our Immigration Subcommittee Chair, ZOE LOFGREN of California, has led the way in fashioning these proposals. 
   First, the bill requires that the Department of Homeland Security issue regulations by December 31 of this year to eliminate or reduce any fraud in the program. Then it extends authorization for only 15 months if the Department of Homeland Security fails to issue those regulations. This would enable Congress to better consider other possible avenues to address possible or potential fraud in the program if that proves necessary. If the department does issue the regulations, the authorization is extended for 6 more years, for a total of a little over 7 years. Finally, the bill requires the Inspector General to report on the effectiveness of the regulations by September 30, 2010. 
   With these significant anti-fraud provisions we have worked together with our Republican colleagues to add, I am confident Congress will be equipped with the information it needs to determine whether further action to prevent fraud in the program is warranted. And if it is, we do not hesitate to take such appropriate action. 
   So I hope that we will receive unanimous support on this bipartisan legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference report on H.R. 1591, the Supporting Our Troops and Veterans' Health Care Act. 
   This legislation will support our troops and veterans, hold the Bush Administration and Iraqi government accountable and begin withdrawing our troops from Iraq by October 2007 or sooner. It will also provide emergency funding for critical programs that have suffered from years of neglect. 
   This supplemental appropriations bill provides emergency funding for critical programs that have long been underfunded by the Republicans. It includes $650 million to correct the funding shortfall in the State Children's Health Insurance program so that hundreds of thousands of children will not lose their health care. It provides $6.9 billion for Gulf Coast hurricane relief and recovery. The bill also adds $400 million to LIHEAP (Low Income Heating Assistance), as well as providing $1.8 billion to remedy the unconscionable state of our military and veterans' health care systems. All of these issues are emergencies in their own right and rise to the level of inclusion in this emergency supplemental spending bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 2642, the most recent authorization bill placed before the Congress to fund the continuing occupation of Iraq. Forged in the backrooms of the Capitol by Washington politicians, this bill seeks to strike an uneasy compromise. While it continues to fund overseas conflicts, the bill also includes long-overdue aid for segments of the American public desperate for help. Specifically, the bill provides $52 million for an expanded G.I. Bill, extends unemployment benefits in states, like Michigan, that have been hit the hardest by the current economic downturn, and postpones seven Medicaid reimbursement rate cuts. I support such aid, while rejecting the appropriation of an additional $165 million in war funds. As a responsible legislator and a man of peace, I urge my colleagues to understand that we can have guns or butter, but not both. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's unfortunate that it has taken the consideration of a war-funding bill to address these important domestic priorities. As you know, up until recently, the Administration and the Republican leadership have complained that the inclusion of this domestic funding in a war supplemental smacks of fiscal irresponsibility. To them, spending federal dollars to improve G.I. bill benefits for our battle-weary veterans, to extend unemployment benefits for those left behind by failed trickle-down economic policies, and to safeguard the reimbursement amounts paid to doctors, who provide medical care to the most vulnerable Americans, is spending that this country cannot afford. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a message for this Administration and their congressional allies: Bettering and strengthening the lives of the American people is the purpose of this great institution. Such action is not optional. It is our sworn duty. And if anyone has shown fiscal recklessness, it has been this President. After 6 years of bloody war, this Nation is $592 billion dollars poorer. It is the height of callousness to say that we don't have enough money for our veterans, the unemployed, or our Medicaid doctors; that it is they who are expendable--even as the President burns through billions of taxpayer dollars in Iraq. 
   I suppose that we shouldn't be surprised that this Administration is willing to sacrifice the American people, while its allies at Halliburton, ExxonMobil, and Blackwater continue to make record profits off of this war. After all, this Administration ceased being accountable to the American voter long ago. In a recent interview with ABC News, the Vice President himself admitted as much. When asked whether or not it was significant that two-thirds of the American people now believe that the War in Iraq is no longer worth fighting, Mr. Cheney responded, ``So?'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the President and the Vice-President have forsaken their duty to be responsive to the public. As such, we in the Congress must step in and fill this void. Someone must give the American people a voice, especially when Executive Branch officers act in ways contrary to the public good. 
   Mr. Speaker, setting aside issues of education funding, job aid, and other worthy public policy aims, this body must not ignore the one undeniable reality that dominates everything that we will talk about this day: As of today, we have been at war for 1865 days, with no end in sight. If we approve this war funding, that number will likely climb to over 2000 days. We as a Nation have endured 1865 days of civil war, IEDS, ethnic cleansing, aid-worker beheadings, suicide bombings, sweetheart no-bid contracts, rank government corruption, and solemn vigils over flag draped coffins. Mr. Speaker, this war must end. The American people and the Iraqi people have endured enough. I urge my colleagues to vote against funding this war another day. Tomorrow, we will have been at war for 1866 days. It will be 1866 days too many.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House, in recent years, the press has been under assault as reporters are increasingly being imprisoned, imprisoned for obstruction of justice and other charges. There are many causes of these attacks, including an increasingly consolidated media, abuse of position of power to intimidate members of the press, and a co-opting of the media as an investigative arm of the government. 
   Today, we are here in an attempt to reclaim one of the most fundamental principles enshrined by the Founding Fathers in the first amendment to the Constitution. Freedom of the press is the cornerstone of our democracy. Without it, we cannot have a well-informed electorate and a government that truly represents the will of the people. 
   This measure before us, H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act, helps restore the independence of the press so that it can perform its essential duty of getting information to the public. The bill will ensure that members of the press are free to utilize confidential sources without causing harm to themselves or their sources by providing a qualified privilege that prevents a reporter's source material from being revealed except under certain narrow circumstances. This measure balances the public's right to know against the legitimate and important interests that society has in maintaining public safety. 
   After the hearing and markup of this legislation, the sponsors of the bill worked hard to accommodate the concerns of all that were raised. While several good changes were made, I want to focus my comments today on the issue of national security and why I believe concerns about national security have been very effectively addressed in the bill and in the proposed manager's amendment. 
   The bill provides that disclosure of a source can be compelled where necessary to prevent an act of terrorism or significant specified harm to national security. The manager's amendment that will be offered by our colleagues, Mr. Boucher and Mr. Pence, specifically addresses the Department of Justice and DNI's primary concern, which is that the bill's exception for national security concerns would hinder efforts to investigate and prosecute leakers of classified information. 
   In response to this concern, the manager's amendment provides that disclosure of a source can be compelled in a criminal investigation or prosecution of an unauthorized disclosure of properly classified information when such disclosure will cause significant harm to national security. 
   The bill defines a covered person to exclude foreign powers or agents of foreign powers, so that, for example, a government-controlled newspaper of a foreign nation does not receive the protections of the act. This provision insures that our national security and law enforcement efforts will not be flouted by foreign governments that try to hold themselves out as covered journalists and claim entitlement to the act's protections. 
   The bill makes it clear that any foreign terrorist organization designated by the Secretary of State is excluded from the protections of the act. 
   In addition, the manager's amendment adds three more exceptions to the definition of ``covered person,'' so the privilege does not apply to any person designated as a specially designated global terrorist by the Treasury Department, any person who is specially designated a terrorist under FISA, and any terrorist organization as defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
   Each of these exceptions were proposed by the Department of Justice and accepted by us. So, as you can see, the bill provides broad protection for national security.     
   If the exceptions were any broader, it would swallow up the rule itself. And for those who claim that the national security exception should not also be subject to the balancing test, I have no doubt that if a court finds that the disclosure of the source is necessary to prevent an act of terrorism or other harm to national security, it will also find that disclosure outweighs the public interest in gathering and disseminating the information. 
   So it is our responsibility, Congress's responsibility, to ensure the press is able to perform its job adequately. The Free Flow of Information Act is an important part of fostering the continued growth of a free and independent press in the United States. It will encourage increased dialogue on the issues that face this country; and, in doing so, it will strengthen the foundation of our democracy. 
   This legislation receives wide support. Over 100 editorial boards, a diverse group of over 50 media companies and organizations, including the Newspaper Association of America, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Associated Press, News Corp, the Newspaper Guild, ABC, NBC, and journalist organizations like the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
   Please join with us on both sides of the aisle so that we can support and pass this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by complimenting Mike Pence of Indiana, a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee who has been working on this bill before the 110th Congress. He was a leader in supporting this legislation in the 109th Congress and may have been working on it even before then. So when I listened to my other colleagues on the other side who have been working on and continue to support this legislation, I think it is very easy to perceive that with the working group, with the leaders on both sides of the aisle working with Rick Boucher on this for so long, we have now come to a point where most of the concerns have been addressed; and I deeply thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for the constructive role they played not only in their independent capacity, but in the working group that has been working behind the scenes on this, as well. 
   Now, Members of the House, there has been something said about the importance of national security information. Sometimes it is just as important that the press report on information that the government has tried to hide in the name of national security. Because the problem frequently is that if we keep going after journalists trying to shut them up, trying to put them in jail, or threatening to prosecute them, they will be afraid to report some of the important stories that I am going to relate to you that up until now journalists have had to take it on their own risk to decide what to do. I don't think that is appropriate, nor is it necessary, nor is it contrary to any of our concerns about national security. 
   The history of the American press provides ample evidence of certain stories that would have never been known to the general public without the news media's use of confidential sources. Oftentimes these stories shed light on government misconduct, on corporate waste, fraud and abuse, and other matters of concern. The free flow of information to the public is vitally important to the operation of our democracy and to oversight our most powerful public and private institutions. 
   Now, here are a few examples of issues that were made known to the public through news reports based on confidential source information. Reporters decided that they would honor the confidence of their resources no matter what happened to them. These are courageous people of the media that had to take this on themselves. So this shield law is to take people out of this bind, out of this fear of having to be coerced because we don't know what is going to happen. This draws a very bright line for everybody to understand how we should proceed in the future. 
   Here is a matter that is important: the unsafe and deteriorating conditions at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Here is another public interest matter: the exposure of fertility fraud in Southern California based upon clinical records provided by anonymous sources, reporting more than 250 accounts of fertility fraud and revealed coverups, intimidation of clinical employees and bribery. Because of this reporting, the American Medical Association issued new guidelines for fertility clinics. 
   Here is another story that was of some consequence: a hospital scandal of patient dumping by a Los Angeles County emergency aid program. Reporting that article prompted a government investigation that brought it to an end. Rampant steroid use in Major League Baseball by world-class athletes which, in part, led Major League Baseball and its players union to open up its labor contract and adopt a steroid testing policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, during our negotiations led by the Boucher-Pence team, I would like to bring to the attention of the ranking member and manager of this bill before us an important change that was made in the manager's amendment which may or may not have come to his attention because it was made so late in the day. We now have a manager's amendment that would allow the government to pierce the journalistic shield to prevent a terrorist attack, but also to identify any perpetrators of a terrorist attack. I wanted to make sure that my friend and colleague was aware of this very important change because it was made at the very last minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will submit a number of articles from newspapers, mostly editorials, that deal with the support of the shield law that is before the Congress at this time. 
   We have a contribution from the Post-Standard in Syracuse, New York, entitled, ``The Shield Law Moves Closer to Reality,'' dated 14 October of this year. 
   In the Baltimore Sun, we had an opinion written yesterday in that newspaper, ``In Search of Shield,'' in support of the legislation. 
   We have heard from the Detroit Free Press from today's paper, ``Vote to Pass Law to Shield Reporters,'' in support of this legislation. 
   The Los Angeles Times earlier in May wrote an article: ``Shielding Journalists: Reporters, and the Country, Would Benefit from a Proposed Federal Law to Protect Confidential Sources.'' 
   The Detroit News in May of this year wrote, ``Why a Federal Shield Law is Necessary,'' authored by Christine Tatum. 
   The New York Times in two different instances in September and October of this year, ``A Shield for the Public,'' was the editorial page comment, and in October, ``The Public's Right to Know,'' another important article in support of this legislation.     
   Here's one that the ranking member would be interested in. The San Antonio Express-News: ``Smith's Decision on Shield Law Critical.'' We hope that had come to his attention before today. 
   The Washington Post, in September: ``Protecting Sources.'' 
   Another important contribution: ``A Much-Needed Shield for Reporters,'' written by Theodore B. Olson in The Washington Post in June of this year. 
   Finally, from USA Today: ``Our Views on Prosecutors and the Press: Jailing of Reporters Chills Free Flow of Information.'' 
   These are only a few of a notebook full of materials that we wouldn't dare introduce this many pieces of material into the Congressional Record. I will include for the Record the items that I cited.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time and just want to say that we have not given up on the possibility of winning some modest support from the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. He has negotiated with us in good faith. We continue to work on any improvements. I am very proud of the work that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence) have put forward, and I want to thank Members of the House on both sides. There is apparently a large number of bipartisan supporters for this measure. I want to assure the House that we are moving forward with deliberate speed, and it is in that sense that I continue to urge support for the measure.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted and I congratulate the ranking member for joining us in supporting the Boucher-Pence manager's amendment. We think that we can move even further. Here is an amendment that alters the standard for piercing the shield where national security is involved. Also, it enables law enforcement to obtain an order compelling disclosure of the identity of a source in the course of a leak investigation. 
   So I am very happy about this. I think that it portends that there may be other areas of agreement that we will be able to reach. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.

We think it's thoughtful and appropriate and indicates the kind of rapprochement that we are trying to reach on any other matters of difference that might be outstanding. 
   Allowing a court to take into account national security when considering the balancing test and allowing the court to retain full discretion on whether to consider this information, and it may consider this along with any other information it deems relevant, means that the ranking member's continued commitment to work on this issue is going on even now, and I thank him for his constructive efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, two weeks ago, the House agreed nearly unanimously to pass H.R. 3678, the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act. Most significantly, that bill would extend the Internet tax moratorium and grandfather protections for 4 years, clarify the treatment of gross receipts taxes, and revise the definition of Internet access. 
   As my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Congressman WATT, stated on the floor that day, the House bill was ``an excellent example of what can occur when we work together--on both sides of the aisle--to deal with highly complex issues.'' 
   Our bipartisan legislation was supported by industry groups such as the Don't Tax Our Web Coalition, as well as by various government organizations like the National Governors Association, the Federation of Tax Administrators, the National Conference of Mayors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. It was also supported by a wide range of labor and union groups. And with that broad support, the House passed H.R. 3678 by a vote of 405-2. 
   The Senate has returned the bill to us with some amendments, and so now we are considering it again. There are four changes: 
   First, the Senate version extends the moratorium on State and local taxes on Internet access, with the grandfather protections, for 7 years, until November 1, 2014, rather than the 4 years in the House bill. 
   Second, the Senate version gives 7 months for certain States to adjust to a phase-out of additional grandfather protection they have been claiming. 
   Third, the Senate version expands the definition of Internet access to prohibit taxation of certain services which are fee-based, not packaged with Internet access, and offered from sources other than providers of Internet access. 
   Fourth, the Senate version prohibits a State from reimposing Internet access taxes under a grandfather clause if the State had eliminated those taxes more than 2 years ago. 
   While these lengthier time periods, expanded definitions, and tighter restrictions on the States go beyond where the House drew the line, I believe the new line is within reasonable bounds, and responds to many of the same considerations that motivated the House in crafting the version passed 2 weeks ago. 
   Like the House bill, the Senate version is designed to allow businesses sufficient time to plan, ensure that consumers continue to benefit from tax-free access to the Internet during this period, while enabling Congress to revisit the moratorium in light of developments in the States or in technology--as Congress had done each time it has extended the original moratorium--in 2001, 2004 and in this bill. 
   The Senate version remains true to the essential goals of the House bill, including our refinements to the definition of Internet access and our decision to provide a temporary extension of the moratorium. Like the House bill, it is designed to minimize adverse effects on State and local government revenue, to treat businesses fairly, and to keep Internet access affordable to consumers. 
   Nonetheless, we must be mindful of the potential misinterpretation of the new definition of Internet access. Therefore, I state our intent in revising the definition. H.R. 3678: 
   Alters the current definition of ``Internet access'' by making it clear that the prohibition on State and local taxation extends to that portion of a service that connects a user to the Internet and enables a user to navigate the Internet for the purpose of gaining access to the content, information and services that are available over the Internet (section 1105(5)(A) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act as amended by this bill). This new definition eliminates existing language that could have been interpreted to allow an Internet service provider to bundle content, information, and services that might otherwise be taxable with Internet access and claim that the entire package is exempt. 
   Preserves in subparagraph B of the new definition of Internet access changes made to the definition in the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act (P.L. 108-435) regarding the taxation of certain telecommunications. The language is modified in this bill only as to form to fit the new definition of Internet access as contained in this bill. The provision is intended to insure that all technologies used to access the Internet (e.g. cable, satellite, wireless, DSL, etc.) and the components used to provide the access are subject to the moratorium and protected from taxation by State and local governments. As noted in the Committee Report accompanying the bill that ultimately became Pub. L. No. 108-435 (Senate Report 108-155, 108th Congress, 1st Session, p. 4), the definition ``is not meant to affect States and local taxation of traditional telecommunications services and other services that are not used to provide Internet access. For example, the moratorium does not allow an Internet access provider to claim or to seek immunity from State or local taxes for the provision of other services--such as cable television programming--that are separate from Internet access. Nor does the moratorium exempt telecommunications services provided over the same facilities that are not used to provide Internet access.'' 
   Clarifies in subparagraph C that services incidental to and provided with a connection to the Internet are not taxable. Such services are generally offered for free and provide the user with basic services to make the Internet functional for the user. 
   Addresses in subparagraph D concerns that the existing definition allows goods or services that are used or delivered over the Internet to become subject to the moratorium if they are offered as a package with Internet access. In 2004, concerns about the bundling provision led to a specific exception from the moratorium for voice-over-internet-protocol services. This section defines the VOIP exception of the current law as one of the services that is specifically excluded from Internet access and makes it clear that neither VOIP nor any other good or service that uses the Internet is subject to the moratorium. Since VOIP is specifically excluded from the definition of Internet access, the existing exception for VOIP was removed as redundant. 
   Includes in the new definition in subparagraph E certain services that would be subject to the moratorium under subparagraph C if offered with a service described in subparagraph A, are part of the moratorium even though they are fee-based and offered separately from a service described in subparagraph A. The list of services under this subparagraph is meant to be limited and exhaustive. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3678 as amended by the Senate remains a good, strong bill that provides much needed clarity to the communications and Internet industries, and strikes an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of States and local governments while helping keep Internet access affordable. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this bill as the Senate has sent it back to us.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this common sense piece of legislation offered by my dear friend, Representative Charlie Rangel, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, his bill will marshal the tremendous economic power of our Nation's physical and human capital and direct it towards solving the twin challenges of energy dependence and global warming. Through $20 billion investment in renewable energy tax incentives, carbon mitigation provisions, transportation efficiency tax credits, and energy efficiency incentives, this bill offers a comprehensive strategy that empowers both individual citizens and the private sector. 
   The bill empowers everyday Americans by providing tax credits to green citizens who add energy-efficient improvements to their homes and businesses and purchase plug-in electric cars. The bill helps the private sector push the limits of research and development by encouraging the building of carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects. The bill also creates incentives for the energy production sector to invest in nontraditional cutting edge energy production methods. I am particularly excited that this bill will, for the first time, incentivize investment in technologies that will harness the power of the waves and tides found in our Nation's Great Lakes and oceans. 
   I am also proud of this body's recent efforts to address the global climate change crisis. This bill is a logical and important next step toward this end. For too long, our country lagged behind the rest of the industrialized world in recognizing and taking action to address the climate change crisis. Global warming endangers all of us, but threatens to have the most devastating impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable. By encouraging our Nation's citizens and businesses to act in a carbon-conscious way, we protect not only ourselves, but show compassion for our brothers and sisters around the world. At a time when global public opinion regarding our Nation is at an all-time low, the important positive impact this bill will have on our country's public diplomacy efforts should not be downplayed. 
   Lastly, I believe that this bill serves as a powerful example of the tax policy differences between the 110th Congress and past Congresses. Instead of using the tax code to promote inequality and corporate largess, the American people now know that the tax code can be used to promote personal responsibility, national security, compassion, and global sustainability. I am proud to join with my colleagues here today as we continue to establish a progressive tax policy for the 21st century.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, it is with deep pride that I rise to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the integration of the Armed Forces. As I stand here today, our forces around the world are united in their efforts to preserve our liberty; however, it was not long ago that the men and women of the Armed Forces faced forced division, even while protecting our unity. 
   African Americans have been essential to the creation and preservation of our Nation. These valiant men and women fought abroad for freedom and security in segregated units, while their own families were subject to oppression and inequality on the home front. Despite this, African-American troops still honored the ideals of the United States and courageously defended the country; many of them would go on to earn top military honors. 
   Fortunately the United States military would not remain so divided. On July 26, 1948,  President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981, mandating the equal treatment of all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin. In addition to beginning the process of immigration, Executive Order 9981 also established the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services. While it would take years for the integration of the armed services to be completed, it was Executive Order 9981 which began to pave the path to unity. 
   The Revolutionary War was spurred by a document, the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed, ``All men are created equal''. Many African Americans fought in the Revolution, while experiencing unequal treatment. Another document, Executive Order 9981, authored by President Truman, was able to begin the integration of the armed services, which ended this pervasive inequality and segregation. The signing of Executive Order 9981 was a pivotal moment in our history and I wholeheartedly support its commemoration. 
   I commend my colleagues, Representatives Mike Rogers and Kendrick Meek, for bringing this legislation to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for overriding the President's veto of H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. This important legislation amends titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to extend, for 18 months, expiring provisions under the Medicare program. This bill prevents the implementation of a scheduled 10.6 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements for physicians and other health care professionals,  and extends the 0.5 percent payment update for 2008 and provides a 1.1 percent payment increase for physicians in 2009. 
   In addition to delaying reimbursement cuts, H.R. 6331 speeds up reimbursements for Medicare Part D claims and delays cuts to Medicaid generic prescription drug reimbursement. The bill also includes a delay in the flawed Medicare DMEPOS (durable medical equipment, prosthetics and supplies) competitive bidding program. H.R. 6331 also improves beneficiary access to preventive and mental health services by eliminating discriminatory co-payment rates for Medicare outpatient psychiatric services. 
   The reimbursement cuts that went into effect on July 1 have shaken the Medicare system to its very core. It boggles the mind to think that, with an aging population and a worsening physician shortage, this administration and congressional Republicans have turned their backs on hard-working physicians who care for millions of Medicare patients across the country. 
   I want to reassure Michigan's Medicare doctors that I will never turn my back on those who care for our parents and grandparents. I am proud that, with this vote, the Democratic majority is standing up for Michigan's Medicare doctors--a group of physicians who regularly make financial sacrifices when they accept Medicare patients. Our support stands in sharp contrast to the administration's position. Instead of encouraging our best and brightest doctors to participate in the Medicare program, the administration would encourage doctors to turn needy seniors away from their waiting rooms. 
   Similarly, I will never play politics with health security of those in our society who survived the Great Depression and won two world wars. 
   Madam Speaker, at this time the passage of H.R. 6331 is a simple necessity. We must protect our seniors and Medicare doctors while we work to achieve a comprehensive solution to our Medicare problems. I encourage my colleagues to support this veto override effort.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (INTERNATIONAL SOLID WASTE IMPORTATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 518, the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007. H.R. 518 adds a new section to the Solid Waste Disposal Act requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce the ``notice and consent'' provisions of a bilateral U.S.-Canadian Agreement signed in 1986 to govern the transboundary movement of hazardous waste. This agreement was amended in 1992 to include municipal solid waste, but neither administration since then has made any effort to implement the bilateral agreement. Enforcement legislation promised ``soon'' by the present administration almost 4 years ago has yet to arrive. H.R. 518 provides criteria to ensure that the views of the affected State and local governments are properly taken into account, and it adds the necessary statutory enforcement authority. 
   According to the most recent information for fiscal year 2006, the largest source of waste imported into Michigan continues to be from Canada, with total reported imports to landfills of more than 12 million cubic yards. That is a 23 percent increase from fiscal year 2003. Even more disturbing is that the amount of Canadian waste being disposed of in Michigan has risen by 335 percent since 1996, when Michigan began collecting data. 
   Riverview and other downriver communities in my district have had to cope with hundreds of trucks full of Canadian trash rumbling down their streets on a daily basis for years. These trucks pass through our communities en route from the Ambassador Bridge to traffic dumps to the west. You can imagine the traffic congestion, environmental, and quality-of-life problems these truckloads of trash have created. 
   Local activists like Mr. George Read of Trenton and State Representative Kathleen Law have been working tirelessly alongside our congressional delegation to put an end to this never-ending flow of trash, and I am very pleased that the House today is taking a step toward that goal.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished member of the Rules Committee, and I rise, Madam Speaker, in some shock about the strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill. 
   I had never thought that I would hear a reason to deny a Member of the House of Representatives a vote because of convenience, because of the number of revotes that have occurred and whether or not the switched votes that took place were because of whether Delegates were voting or not. This is an incredible kind of an argument. 
   Today I commend the House leadership for bringing to the floor a small attempt to give our Delegates a voice in the House. This rule allows Congress to be more inclusive and integrated as it pertains to our Delegates. 
   Significantly, the rule brings the Congresswoman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, closer to a House vote for the District, a vote that was almost realized through bipartisan efforts in the 109th Congress. 
   By giving our Delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole, we provide these representatives with the opportunity to greater serve their constituents. I wonder what the rest of the citizens of this country would think would be wrong with such an opportunity for these citizens to have a voting Representative, as our citizens do? 
   Delegates will now have a record that reflects their positions on the measures that come before the House, but ultimately Delegates will be more involved with the work of the Congress, which would, at least in small part, become their Congress. 
   In recognizing our Delegates, Mr. Faleomavaega, Ms. Bordallo, Mrs. Christensen, Mr. Fortu&#241;o and Eleanor Holmes Norton, I point out that their contributions have been much like that of other representatives. Our Delegates already serve and vote on committee business, they serve in caucus and leadership positions, and they diligently represent the interests of their constituents. It is an honor to work alongside these Members. Why shouldn't we help them in this long, arduous struggle toward full membership in the House? 
   For the Delegate from the District of Columbia, I believe that a vote in the Committee of the Whole is a step toward achieving a vote in the House. It is not the final step. Our work to bring democracy to the Nation's Capital will continue after today's, what I hope will be a success. 
   For over 200 years, the District residents have been disenfranchised while assuming the responsibilities of United States citizenship. Like both State and territory residents, District residents serve in the Armed Forces and are currently represented in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries in the world. Like  State residents, but unlike territory residents, citizens of the District pay Federal taxes and vote in Presidential elections.  
   However, the District is alone in that it is denied voting representation in the very entity that controls all aspects of the city's legislative, executive, and judicial functions--the Congress. No other entity--State or territory--lacks this much autonomy. 
   I will continue to support Congresswoman NORTON in her efforts to secure a vote for the District. I pledge to work towards such a vote in the coming weeks. This Congress is capable of a sound, bipartisan response and in fact proved as much last Congress. Let us now address the unfinished business of the 109th Congress and the unfinished business of our democracy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the continuation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Since 1997, this program has served as a safety net for our Nation's low-income uninsured children. Today, the number of uninsured low-income children participating in SCHIP has fallen by more than one-third. The  number of minority children that participate in the program has decreased even more drastically. 
   In 2006, 6.7 million of America's children received health care benefits through SCHIP; of these, 6.2 million came from families whose income was less than $33,200 a year for a family of three. SCHIP working in conjunction with Medicaid through State programs provides necessary preventive, primary and acute health care services for the lowest income children and those with disabilities. Overall, these programs service more than 30 million children. 
   Children living in both rural and urban areas benefit from the SCHIP program. In rural areas, one in three children is covered either through SCHIP or Medicaid. In spite of this statistic, 17 percent of the children living in these areas remain uninsured. In urban areas one in four children has healthcare coverage through SCHIP or Medicaid, but 19 percent continue to be uninsured. 
   SCHIP also helps to reduce the number of uninsured minority children. The percentage of low-income African-American and Hispanic children without insurance decreased between 1996 and 2005 because of this program. Prior to SCHIP's enactment, approximately 30 percent of Latino children, 20 percent of African-American children, and 18 percent of Asian-American and Pacific Islander children were uninsured. By 2004, those numbers had dropped to 21 percent, 12 percent, and 8 percent respectively. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's not undermine the purpose of the SCHIP program. We have a responsibility to our children to provide them with one of the most basic needs in our society, equal access to health care. Let us not ignore the great strides that SCHIP has made in reducing the number of uninsured children. Reauthorize the SCHIP program and keep our children insured.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, when a laser is aimed at an aircraft cockpit, particularly at the critical stage of take-off or landing, it presents an imminent threat to aviation security and passenger safety. This has now been increasingly recognized, and we propose to do something about it today. 
   According to the Federal Aviation Administration, laser illuminations can temporarily disorient or even disable a pilot during critical stages of flight. And in some cases, a laser might also cause permanent physical injury to the pilot. 
   Since 1990 the FAA has reported more than 400 of these kinds of incidents. The rash of incidents involving laser beams is compounded by the concern that the low cost of hand-held laser devices could lead to even more incidents of these kinds happening in the future. 
   So the measure before us today responds to the problem by amending title 18 of our United States Code to impose criminal penalties on someone who knowingly aims a laser pointer at an aircraft or in its flight path within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States. The criminal penalties include imprisonment of up to 5 years and fines. 
   So I again extend a hand of thanks to Chairman BOBBY SCOTT of the Crime Subcommittee for expeditiously moving this bill forward. And I also commend the sponsor of this legislation, Ric Keller, who is floor manager today, the gentleman from Florida, for his leadership on addressing the danger that lasers can pose to aircraft. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

And as has been pointed out, it doesn't matter whether it is a prank or whether it is sabotage, this prospective law gets the word out to everybody that these laser beams are dangerous when being flashed on planes or pilots in the air. The catastrophe is unthinkable.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (PRESERVING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to describe this measure, Senate bill 214, as an important one that will restore historical checks and balances to the process by which interim U.S. attorneys are appointed. It will repair a breach in the law that has been a major contributing factor to the recent termination of at least nine talented and experienced United States attorneys and their replacement with interim appointments. 
   The full circumstances surrounding these terminations are still coming to light. It is a process being given much attention by the Committee on the Judiciary. But much of the information is well known, and is also considerably troubling. One U.S. attorney was fired to make way for a political operative who endeared himself to Mr. Karl Rove doing opposition research in the Republican National Committee. Others were apparently fired because they were not sufficiently partisan in the way they used these powers to investigate and prosecute alleged voting fraud. Now, I don't need to tell anybody in this body how important voting is to the democratic process. 
   These reports are particularly troubling because of the awesome power the United States attorneys, 93 of them in total, are entrusted with. They seek convictions. They negotiate plea agreements. They can send citizens to prison for years. They can tarnish reputations. They can destroy careers with the mere disclosure that a person is under criminal investigation. We, in this country, must have full confidence that these powers are exercised with complete integrity and free from improper political influence. Unfortunately, sometimes this is not the case. 
   These troubling circumstances that have been revealed were made possible by an obscure provision, quietly and secretly slipped into the PATRIOT reauthorization conference report in March of last year at the behest of the Justice Department's top political appointments, to enable them to appoint interim temporary U.S. attorneys without the customary safeguard of Senate confirmation. 
   Mr. Speaker, what this measure does is restore the checks and balances that have historically provided a critical safeguard against politicization of the Department of Justice and the United States attorneys, limiting the Attorney General's interim appointments to 120 days only, then allowing the district court for that district to appoint a U.S. attorney until the vacancy is filled, with Senate confirmation required, as historically has been the case. 
   Now, Members of the House, we have already passed similar legislation. While I would prefer to see our version enacted into law, we are taking up the Senate-passed version in order to expedite the enactment of this important step in restoring legal safeguards against the abuse of executive power to politicize the Federal prosecutorial function in the Department of Justice. 
   I wanted to single out my colleague from California, Howard Berman, a senior member of the committee, for his role in fashioning not only the original version, but the one that we have before you to agree upon. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this point, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that our colleague from the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Artur Davis, would be able to join us in this debate because he worked very diligently with Mr. Berman and Ms. Lofgren. 
   Mr. Speaker, while United States attorneys owe their appointments to the President, once they are appointed, their enforcement decisions must be unquestionably above politics. This is an irony that exists, but it is something that must be zealously complied with if we are to have a law enforcement system that can be regarded as faithful to the Constitution and to the laws of the land and to protect the American people. 
   The Senate confirmation in an open and public process is one way we safeguard against politicizing the prosecutors in the Department of Justice. That safeguard was severely compromised by the secret change in section 546. What we will do now is restore that safeguard and honor the system of checks and balances. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this important consideration.  
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 214, a bill that will revoke the Attorney General's unfettered authority to appoint U.S. Attorneys indefinitely. 
   During the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization conference, Republicans slipped a small provision into the conference report with enormous repercussions. That provision removed the 120-day limit for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, thereby allowing interim appointees to serve indefinitely and without confirmation. 
   After months of investigation by the House Judiciary Committee, we have learned that the Bush administration exploited this newly created loophole to purge high-performing Federal prosecutors while they were in the midst of high-profile public corruption investigations involving Republican officials. And while the administration has insisted it never intended to use this loophole to bypass Senate confirmation for appointing U.S. Attorneys, our investigation has uncovered communications and testimony that suggest otherwise. 
   We also learned, for example, that in an e-mail to former White House Counsel, Harriet Miers, former Attorney General Chief of Staff, Kyle Sampson wrote: ``I strongly recommend that, as a matter of administration policy, we utilize the new statutory provisions that authorize the Attorney General to make U.S. Attorney appointments.'' Mr. Sampson further said that by using the new provision, the Justice Department could ``give far less deference to home-State Senators and thereby get (1) our preferred person appointed and (2) do it far faster and more efficiently, at less political cost to the White House.'' 
   Referring to the new authority to appoint interim U.S. Attorneys indefinitely, Mr. Sampson also said, ``If we don't ever exercise it then what's the point of having it?'' 
   The Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007 provides the necessary legislative response to restore checks and balances in the U.S. Attorney appointment process by reinstating the 120-day limit on the interim appointment. Additionally, the bill would apply retroactively to all U.S. Attorneys currently serving in an interim capacity. This would ensure that interim U.S. Attorneys appointed since the purge scheme was hatched are not permitted to serve indefinitely and without Senate confirmation. 
   This is a common sense solution that has received strong support from the President of the National Association of Former U.S. Attorneys as well as from a former Republican-appointed U.S. Attorney who testified before the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. It is also important to note that the Attorney General himself has expressed that he is not opposed to rolling back this provision of the USA PATRIOT Act. 
   I want to be clear that the consideration of S. 214 will not stop the Judiciary Committee's ongoing investigation of the U.S. Attorney purge scheme and the politicization of the Justice Department. After months of investigations, it is clear that the answers can only be found in the White House. We have spoken to every senior Justice Department official involved in the firing process and we still have not gotten the answers to two critical questions: Who made the decision to mass fire U.S. Attorneys, and why were these particular U.S. Attorneys targeted? 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people need to be assured that political calculations do not determine whether an individual is arrested or prosecuted. We must ensure that the integrity and honor of the Justice Department will be reinstated. I hope my colleagues will join me in the first critical step in this process by closing the loophole in the USA PATRIOT Act that this administration has improperly exploited for political purposes and supporting S. 214.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, gas prices have now reached an all-time record high, topping even the 1981 spike in price that had stood as the record high for 26 years. According to the Energy Information Administration, the nationwide price of unleaded regular gas hit $3.22 a gallon, 11.5 cents higher than last week's price. In Michigan, it is even higher than that. 
   Today's record-breaking price, one in an unending series of continuous price hikes over the past month, is hurting Americans in their pocketbooks, and we have got to do something about it. Retailers across the Nation are saying that soaring gas prices are prompting consumers to cut back on their shopping trips and their purchases. 
   We are told this won't be the end of these skyrocketing price hikes either. The AAA forecasts that more record prices are probably on the way, especially as the summer begins, which is usually the busiest driving season of the year. 
   In Michigan, gas prices have reached their highest levels ever at $3.27 a gallon. Michigan is now the third most expensive State for gasoline in the country, behind California and the State of Illinois. 
   Last week, in an effort to help address this crisis, the House Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Task Force examined the OPEC cartel and its impact on the price of gas. OPEC accounts for two-thirds of the world's oil reserves and more than 40 percent of the world's oil production, but, even more significantly, OPEC oil exports represent 70 percent of all the oil traded internationally. 
   You know what that means. This affords OPEC, obviously, considerable control over the global market. Its net oil export revenues should reach nearly $395 billion in this year alone, and its influence on the oil market is dominant, especially when it decides to increase or reduce the levels of production. 
   For years now, OPEC's price-fixing conspiracy, and that is what I call it, a conspiracy, has unfairly driven up the price and cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed of oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, the administration has done little or nothing to stop this. 
   So now the time has come. It is time for us to do something to point them in the right direction. We have got to get ahold of this economic crisis. The cries are rising up in every congressional district in the Nation, so your Committee on the Judiciary has produced H.R. 2264, with the help of Mr. Chabot and Mr. Keller and other Members, to make clear that the oil cartel nations that are colluding to limit crude oil production as a means of fixing its price is illegal under United States law, just as it would be for any company engaging in the same conduct.     
   It clarifies and reaffirms the law in several critical respects: 
   First, it exempts OPEC and other nations from the provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to the extent those governments are engaged in price fixing and other anticompetitive activities. 
   Second, H.R. 2264 makes clear that the so-called ``act of state'' doctrine does not in any way prevent courts from ruling on antitrust charges brought against foreign governments, and that foreign governments are ``persons'' subject to suit under the antitrust laws. 
   Third, it explicitly authorizes the Department of Justice to bring lawsuits in Federal court against oil cartel members. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we, on behalf of the American people, have had enough. These price rises are not something that we have to merely humbly drive into the gas station and look at the new, increased cost. We don't have to stand by and watch OPEC dictate the price of our gas without any recourse whatsoever. We can do something about it to combat this blatantly anticompetitive, anticonsumer behavior, and we are. 
   I urge Members to carefully consider the legislation that is now being debated on the House floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, may I close with this observation. It was in 1978 that the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers sued OPEC under the Sherman Antitrust Act, but the case was rejected because the Court said that OPEC could not be prosecuted under the Sherman Act due to the foreign sovereign immunity protection clause it claimed for its member states. 
   I'm here to announce on the floor, as modestly as I can, that that decision was in error. Government-owned companies that engage in purely business activities do not warrant sovereign immunity protection according to prevailing legal doctrines, and so what we do in this measure is that we don't start a lawsuit against OPEC. We merely authorize for the first time by law the Department of Justice to, when in their good judgment they choose to be able to do that. 
   These high prices facilitated by OPEC serve to transfer wealth from Western consumers to petroleum producers, and I have this on the very conservative words of the Heritage Foundation itself. I will insert this in the Record at this point.  
   Time for Congress To Lift OPEC's Immunity  
   This week, the House is likely to pass the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007 (NOPEC, H.R. 2264). This bill, sponsored by Representatives John Conyers (D-MI) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), would allow the federal government to sue the Organization for Petroleum Exporting States (OPEC) for antitrust violations. Similar legislation (S. 879) is pending in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Herb Kohl (D-WI) and Arlen Spector (R-PA). At a time when oil prices are climbing to ever-higher levels, fighting OPEC's anticompetitive practices would be a welcome first step towards reestablishing the free market in this strategically important sector. This is long overdue and points the way toward a second step: allowing private antitrust suits against OPEC. 
   The Intolerable Status Quo. Since its inception in 1960, OPEC, which is dominated by Persian Gulf producers, has successfully restricted its member states' petroleum production, artificially distorting the world's oil supply to line its members' pockets. Member states' production quotas are determined at semi-annual meetings of members' petroleum ministers and are at times changed through telephone consultations. Several times, this supply-fixing strategy has brought devastation to the U.S. and global economies: 
   In 1973, OPEC's actions in response to U.S. support for Israel, which was attacked in the Yom Kippur War, resulted in a worldwide economic recession that lasted from 1974 to 1980. 
   In 1980, OPEC's failure to increase production in the face of the Iranian revolution resulted in historically high oil prices of $81 per barrel (in 2005 dollars). 
   In 1990, OPEC refused to increase production sufficiently to keep prices stable as Saddam Hussein occupied Kuwait. 
   Lately, OPEC's resistance to add productive capacity has sent oil prices to $70 a barrel, once again endangering economic growth worldwide. 
   The cartel's operations ensure that its members' oil and gas economies remain insulated from foreign investment flows. Members of OPEC have not worked to enhance the rule of law and property rights and have imposed severe restrictions to prevent foreign investors from owning upstream production assets (oil fields and pipelines). This is a testament to the cartel's de facto monopoly over the petroleum market. Indeed, the only serious challenge to the organization came in 1978 when a U.S. non-profit labor association, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), sued OPEC under the Sherman Antitrust Act, in IAM v. OPEC. But the case was rejected in 1981 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. OPEC, the court affirmed, could not be prosecuted under the Sherman Act due to the foreign sovereign immunity protection it claimed for its member states. 
   That decision was wrong. Government-owned companies that engage in purely business activities do not warrant sovereign immunity protection according to prevailing legal doctrines. 
   High oil prices, which OPEC facilitates, serve to transfer wealth from Western consumers to petroleum producers. This wealth transfer funds terrorism through individual oil wealth and government-controlled ``non-profit'' foundations. It also permits hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent on radical Islamist education in madrassahs (Islamic religious academies). 
   Furthermore, the oil-cash glut in the Gulf states and elsewhere empowers resistance to much-needed economic reform in oil-producing countries. State subsidies for everything from health care to industry to bloated bureaucracy continue unabated, funded by Western consumers. 
   Congress Gets Into Action. Growing concerns over energy prices have prompted Congress to examine the legal hurdles that prevent the United States from defending its economic and national security interests. 
   In the early part of 2005, a group of senators led by Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH) introduced the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act'' (S. 555), known as NOPEC, to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and exporting cartels illegal. 
   The bill has now returned the Senate calendar. The House and Senate now have a unique opportunity to: 
   Join forces in defending American businesses and consumers. NOPEC would send a strong and long-overdue signal to OPEC oil barons that they must stop limiting production and investment access. 
   Allow private suits against OPEC. If OPEC is to be reined in, individuals and companies that it has damaged must also be allowed to bring suits against the cartel. As the International Association of Machinists (IAM) v. OPEC made clear, Congress must amend the Sherman Act to allow these suits. Reform should not begin and with the DeWine-Kohl legislation. 
   Conclusion. The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007 would place much needed pressure on OPEC. It is time for the cartel to cease its monopolistic practices. Otherwise the American People can expect more of the same from OPEC--insufficient production and higher energy bills.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of passage of H.R. 1427, ``The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act.'' 
   I believe this legislation is one of the most cost-effective ways to provide cities across the country with desperately needed federal funding so they can construct or renovate housing stock for working families on public housing waiting lists, homeless veterans, homeless Katrina victims, and homeless working families. 
   I believe that passage of this legislation is a ``historic'' moment in this Congress, and makes me proud to be a member of this body. 
   In Detroit, there are thousands of working individuals and families living in homeless shelters or staying with friends and extended family members because they cannot afford the skyrocketing costs of private market housing. 
   We have a homeless shelter in Detroit where hundreds of veterans live each year, and most are working minimum wage jobs, or work in low to moderate wage employment. 
   It is a moral outrage that soldiers who have fought in wars and served their country honorably come home to cities like Detroit, only to find out that they cannot afford an apartment or a home. 
   This bill will help reduce these problems, and provide decent affordable housing to more veterans and working families without raising taxes. 
   It will also help victims of Katrina who are currently living in hotels or homeless shelters in other cities to return to the Gulf Coast, or remain where they are, because there will be expanded housing opportunities due to passage of H.R. 1427. 
   Passage of ``The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act'' will provide billions of dollars to cash-starved cities across the Nation to successfully build new affordable housing units for working families by utilizing existing non-profit housing developers, public housing agencies, and for-profit housing developers. 
   Passage of H.R. 1427 will help hundreds of thousands of Americans across this Nation who are currently on waiting lists for public housing to be able to get out of homeless shelters and into homes or apartments, since there will now be more federal funding for affordable housing production. 
   If America is ever to be a great Nation, we must ensure that all Americans, as a basic human right, have decent and affordable housing. Passage of H.R. 1427 will get our Nation on the road to having a real national affordable housing policy, which we currently do not have. 
   The United States, the wealthiest country in the world, shamefully has one million homeless children, and over 40 percent of those living in homeless shelters are working in jobs. Our current affordable housing problem is building more homeless shelters where there is a lack of affordable housing. 
   I ask this question Mr. Chairman. How many Members of Congress would want to come home after a hard day's work, and sleep in a homeless shelter? Probably nobody! We need affordable housing for all now. 
   I urge this body to pass H.R. 1427 with all deliberate speed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Software and electronic communications are increasingly being used by criminals to invade individuals and businesses' computers without authorization. These practices undermine consumer confidence in the integrity and security of the Internet itself. Two particularly egregious examples involve the use of spyware and phishing scams. 
   Spyware is a form of software that helps gather information about an individual or organization without their knowledge. It also can be used to take control of someone else's computer and surreptitiously send information stored in that computer, such as the individual's personal information and passwords, to another entity where it can then be redirected for criminal purposes, including fraud, larceny, theft or other cybercrimes. 
   According to a survey last year by the FBI, computer security practitioners say that spyware is among the most critical threats to the security of our Nation's computer systems. 
   Phishing is another form of cybercrime. It is a scheme by which a criminal creates a Web site or sends e-mails that copy a well-known, legitimate business in an attempt to deceive Internet users into revealing personal information. Through phishing, for example, a criminal can trick an Internet user into revealing his bank account numbers or passwords. 
   Pharming is a version of phishing, and that involves the fraudulent use of domain names. In pharming, hijackers hijack a legitimate Web site's domain site and redirect traffic intended for the Web site to their own Web site where users may unknowingly provide personal information to the hacker. 
   This measure before us, H.R. 1525, aims to put a stop to these kinds of crimes that invade our privacy. It amends title 18 of the United States Code to impose criminal penalties, including up to 5 years in prison, on those who intentionally engage in spyware-related behavior in furtherance of other Federal criminal offenses.  
   Another thing the bill does is impose fines and imprisonment up to 2 years for anyone who engages in such practices with the intent to defraud or injure a person. 
   Finally, this measure authorizes $10 million per each fiscal year, 2008 through 2011, to help the Department of Justice combat these crimes. 
   I want to lift up the names of two of our Judiciary Committee members, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California, and of course, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, both of whom have put this legislation together and shepherded it through the hearing and the processes of the Judiciary Committee. I'd like to commend them for hard, effective work in developing and moving this bill on a bipartisan basis. 
   This is a targeted measure, ladies and gentlemen, that protects consumers by providing appropriately strong penalties for egregious behavior. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of it.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for overriding the President's veto of the revised bipartisan SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance Program, bill--H.R. 3963. 
   Overriding this veto will provide healthcare coverage for 10 million children of working families. This bill will preserve coverage for all 6.6 million children currently covered by SCHIP and extend coverage to 3.8 million children who are currently uninsured, including 80,900 in my home State of Michigan, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
   In this weakening economy, more and more American parents are having difficulty finding affordable health insurance for their children. It is estimated that in Michigan, 35,600 additional children will need SCHIP or Medicaid in each year of this economic downturn. Funding the enrollment of children eligible for the SCHIP program is more critical than ever. 
   The bipartisan SCHIP bill is supported by 81 percent of the American people; 64 Senators, including 17 Republicans; 43 Governors, including 16 Republicans; and more than 270 organizations, including the AARP, AMA, Catholic Health Association, and Families USA. 
   House Democrats continue to stand strong to ensure health coverage for all of America's children, while those on the other side of the aisle persist in standing between millions of children and the health care they need. House Republicans should put our children first and override the President's misguided veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for the Mentally III Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation would provide grants for improved  mental health treatment and services provided to offenders with mental illness. 
   Over the course of the past three decades, as our country's mental health infrastructure has deteriorated, many mentally ill individuals have been forced to fend for themselves on the street. Oftentimes, these individuals end up in jail or prison for offenses related to their illness. 
   Unfortunately, our jails and prisons have become the sanatoriums of the 21st century. As mental institutions have closed down, jails and prisons have filled up. In fact, prisons currently hold three times more mentally ill people than do psychiatric hospitals, and prisoners have rates of mental illness that can be as high as four times the rate of the general population. 
   Not surprisingly, the prison system is ill-equipped to deal with the growing number of prisoners requiring psychiatric care. Jails and prisons do not have adequate resources to properly evaluate incarcerated individuals for mental health and substance abuse problems. Police and other law enforcement officials are generally not trained to handle mentally ill offenders. Mental health services may be provided, but they are often underfunded and inadequate. 
   H.R. 3992, the ``Mentally III Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2007,'' addresses this problem by establishing grants for programs training law enforcement officials to better identify prisoners with mental illness and respond to their needs. In addition, H.R. 3992 would authorize funding for developing receiving centers to assess individuals in law enforcement custody for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Such funding would also be used to improve technology to facilitate information sharing among law enforcement and criminal justice personnel, as well as to promote evidence-based mental health care practices in correctional facilities. 
   Madam Speaker, it is our moral responsibility to provide timely, appropriate and adequate health care to those in the custody of our correctional system. The treatment of mental illness should be no exception.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007, legislation to combat abusive practices and improve oversight of the mortgage industry. 
   The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007 will reform mortgage practices in three areas. First, the bill will establish a Federal duty of care, prohibit steering, and call for licensing and registration of mortgage originators, including brokers and bank loan officers. Second, the new legislation will set a minimum standard for all mortgages which states that borrowers must have a reasonable ability to repay. Third, the legislation attaches limited liability to secondary market securitizers who package and sell interest in home mortgage loans outside of these standards. However, individual investors in these securities would not be liable. Finally, the bill expands and enhances consumer protections for ``high-cost loans'' under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act and includes important protections for renters of foreclosed homes. 
   Passage of H.R. 3915 could potentially help hundreds of thousands of homeowners across this Nation who are facing home foreclosures, and need more flexible terms in paying back their mortgages given that we are experiencing increased job layoffs; especially in Detroit and the State of Michigan. According to the Michigan Association of Realtors, the State of Michigan is in deep systematic recession. The auto industry has lost tens of thousands of jobs in the past few years, and there are more cuts to come. 
   In fact, Michigan saw 11,554 new foreclosures filings in February 2007. That put one of every 366 Michigan households at risk of losing a home because of missed mortgage payments. The Wayne County/Detroit area reported 6,653 new foreclosures in January of 2007, more than twice the number reported in December 2007. That amounts to one new filing for every 124 households. H.R. 3915 would create a more progressive and equitable home mortgage loan policy that will help scores of working families across this Nation and Michigan keep their homes; and prevent them from becoming homeless. This legislation will address the ongoing practice of routing unsuspecting borrowers into loans that are not appropriate for their needs and that they can't afford. H.R. 3915 will also stop the practice of creative loan financing by unscrupulous brokers who may unnecessarily increase the fees and costs to write the loan. 
   Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called the housing downtown ``the most significant current risk to the U.S. economy.'' Last week Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the situation will get worse before it gets better. Many believe that faulty mortgage lending practices have precipitated this credit crisis, and that the situation will get worse before it gets better. Therefore, I believe that this legislative remedy is a much needed remedy in a time of crisis. 
   I want to thank my friend Chairman BARNEY FRANK and my Republican colleagues for their bipartisan work to create an outstanding piece of legislation that moves us in a proactive direction. In conclusion, let me say that this comprehensive bill brings sweeping and much-needed changes to the mortgage market. It will reform many of the flaws in the current system that has led to the mortgage foreclosure crisis. The American people have asked us to provide the tools and oversight necessary to address this crisis and we have been able to achieve that goal. I whole heartedly give my complete support to this legislation. It is my belief that this bill reflects the principles of the Democratic Party which historically has ensured that the Federal Government will provide a safety net and protection for working families in a time of need.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, the RESTORE Act dealing with FISA addresses the needs of the intelligence community for flexibility in dealing with modern communications networks.     
   It received the most careful scrutiny and consideration by this Committee on the Judiciary, as well as by the Intelligence Committee, chaired by Chairman Reyes, to ensure that it meets every concern our intelligence agencies have raised, every single one of them, and does so consistent with the rules of law, our Constitution, and our values. 
   Let's begin this discussion this evening by clearing up a few things that the bill will not do. The RESTORE Act will never require our intelligence agencies to stop listening to the bad guys. Never. Special emergency provisions allow us to listen first and get the warrant after the fact, if it's needed. No one will ever have to stop listening to a terrorist plotting an attack. I hope I don't hear that raised on the floor this evening. 
   The RESTORE Act will not make our intelligence agencies have to get thousands of warrants for terrorists outside the country. It will not do that. Instead, a basket authorization will permit surveillance of an entire foreign terrorist organization. This is the most effective way to target Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and other threats to our country and our citizens. 
   The RESTORE Act does not give the government free rein to listen to Americans. As has always been the case under FISA, this bill requires that the government get a warrant to target an American; any American. We have also a manager's amendment, which continues to promote the goals of intelligence flexibility with appropriate oversight, while safeguarding our security and our liberty. It makes clear that the protections of the act will not inhibit gathering intelligence against present dangers, such as Osama bin Laden, or threats to our troops in the field. 
   It does provide guidelines to make it easier to determine when the significant purpose of the surveillance act is to acquire information on a United States person and a FISA warrant is needed. It provides important safeguards on dissemination of information about individual Americans when it's acquired under the RESTORE Act's more flexible structure. Specifically, an SES-level manager will review such dissemination on a particularized basis. 
   Importantly, the RESTORE Act has no retroactive immunity for telecommunications carriers who may have assisted the government in conducting unlawful surveillance on Americans. I am sorry to report to you that the other body has a measure that does give that retroactive immunity. The RESTORE Act now on the floor has no retroactive immunity for telecommunications carriers who may have assisted the government in unlawful surveillance on Americans. 
   Until we receive the information, the data, the letters that we have requested to know what they have done, information we have been waiting for more than 10 months for, we can't even begin to responsibly consider such a request. So as of now, it's out. No retroactive immunity. 
   The legislation that we have before us now is a much-needed start to restoring our system of checks and balances, preserving our liberty, and ensuring that our government has the tools they legitimately need to combat terrorism. We got pressed up against the wall in August. It's not going to happen again. There's a 6-month run on the present measure before us. Before we get pushed up against the holidays, we are saying, Let's do it now. 
   We have had a tremendous working relationship with the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Silvestre Reyes, and his staff and my staff. Majority and minority have been working  closely together to bring to you a commonsense and balanced piece of legislation that does what we set out to do, and that is to preserve our liberties and make sure we have effective security. We want our intelligence agencies strong, but we want to bring the FISA Court back into the picture, and we do in the measure before us.  
   Six years ago, the administration unilaterally chose to engage in warrantless surveillance of American citizens without court review. That decision has--to be charitable--created a legal and political quagmire. Officials resigned, the program was riddled with errors, it was shut down for several weeks, officials rushed to the hospital to ask a sick man to reauthorize it over his deputy's objections, and vital prosecutorial resources were diverted. Most importantly, our own citizens questioned wheher their own government was operating within the confines of the law. 
   Two months ago, when that scheme appeared to be breaking down, the administration forced Congress to accept an equally flawed statute. This new law gutted the power of the FISA court. It granted the administration broad new powers to engage in warrantless searches within the U.S., including physical searches of our homes, computers, offices and medical records. The law contained no meaningful oversight whatsoever. 
   The legislation before us today seeks to once again strike the appropriate balance between needed government authority and our precious rights and liberties. It tells the government they need no warrant when foreign agents communicate with other foreigners. It reiterates that warrants are needed when Americans are being targeted. The bill also allows the interception of communications of foreign targets who may communicate with U.S. persons. However, it insists that procedures be in place--approved by the FISA court--to insure that no American is being targeted, and that his or her privacy is protected. 
   The bill also provides for several critical safeguards. We include periodic audits by the Inspector General, we narrow the scope of the authority to protect against threats to our national security, and we protect the privacy of Americans traveling abroad. We also sunset the legislation in December 2009. 
   The RESTORE Act, which has received careful consideration by the Judiciary Committee and by the Intelligence Committee, addresses the needs of the intelligence community for flexibility and the ability to deal with modern communications networks. 
   It meets every concern that our intelligence agencies have raised and does so consistent with the rule of law, our Constitution, and our values. 
   Let me be clear on a few things this bill will NOT do: 
   The RESTORE Act will never require our intelligence agencies to stop listening to the bad guys. Never. There are emergency provisions and the ability to get a warrant after the fact. No one will ever have to stop listening to a terrorist plotting an attack. 
   It will not make our intelligence agencies get thousands of warrants for terrorists outside of the country. Instead, they can get a basket authorization to surveil the entire foreign terrorist organization. This is the most effective way to target Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and other threats. 
   The RESTORE Act does not give the government free rein to listen in to Americans. As has always been the case under FISA, this bill requires the government to get a warrant if it wants to target an American. 
   The Managers' Amendment also reflects the RESTORE Act's goals of intelligence flexibility and oversight, while ensuring both safety and civil liberties. It makes it clear that the protections of the Act will not inhibit gathering intelligence against present dangers, such as Osama bin Laden or threats to our troops in the field. It provides guidelines to flesh out what should be considered when determining whether a significant purpose of collection is to acquire information about a U.S. person, such that a FISA warrant would be required. 
   The Manager's Amendment also provides important safeguards on dissemination of information about individual Americans when it is acquired under the RESTORE Act's more flexible structure. Dissemination of U.S. person communications acquired under the RESTORE Act's basket authorities can only happen when an SES-Ievel supervisor determines that the identity of that person is needed to understand or assess the importance of the foreign intelligence, and to protect the national security of the United States. This is not a blanket authorization to unmask everyone intercepted, but must be done on a person-by-person basis. 
   Importantly, the bill has no retroactive immunity for telecommunications carriers. Until we receive the underlying documents 
   relating to their conduct from the administration--and we have been waiting for more than ten months--we cannot even begin to consider this request. Sending a small set of the documents to a subcommittee of the other body does not begin to meet this test. 
   There is one of the grave concerns about the Protect America Act that bears mention as we consider the RESTORE Act. The Protect America Act was overbroad in the types of entities from which the government could compel information, reaching into business or medical records or libraries. We have narrowed the scope of the acquisitions in the RESTORE Act to ensure that the government can only seek information under the ``basket authorizations'' from telecommunications service providers and related companies. 
   I share the concern of our library community that believes their mission and the chance to bring knowledge and freedom of expression abroad will be diminished if the U.S. government can indiscriminately monitor American libraries when they serve foreign users. This is not a hypothetical concern in an age of distance learning. While a library certainly is not the same kind of ``communications service provider'' as AOL or AT&T, it may allow patrons to access the internet, to send emails, and to conduct research on-line, so it literally ``provides'' these communications services to patrons. The Judiciary Committee report indicates that these now-standard library services do not make them ``telecommunications service providers'' for a 105B or 105C acquisition, but let me be clear--nothing in the bill is intended to leave libraries outside of the protections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   The legislation before us today is a much needed start to restoring our system of checks and balances, to preserving our precious liberties, and to insuring that our government has all the tools they legitimately need to combat terrorism. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this common sense and balanced legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, it is very important that we understand that Mr. Lungren in his dramatic presentation about the cumbersomeness and the protections that we are affording bin Laden almost begs the question here. 
   We have been on this bill for several times. We have got a carve-out here. Nothing prevents conducting lawful surveillance that is necessary to, one, prevent Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda or any other terrorists, Mr. Lungren, or any ally of those persons from receiving any of these protections.

   The minority has just made it clear that they are not seeking to change the bill; they are seeking to kill the bill. The tactic is getting pretty old in the House of Representatives. If they wanted to vote on their proposal today, they would have used the word, doesn't everybody know it now, ``forthwith,'' as I have suggested. But they have refused under well-established House rules and precedents. 
   Other words do not have that effect, even if they sound like they should. The minority used the word ``promptly.'' It's no accident that they chose that word. The authors of this motion know full well the effect of choosing this word, and so do we. That is why they chose it. They wanted to send the bill back to the graveyard, which is what will happen if this motion is adopted. 
   I would now yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren).

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, today, I rise against H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. Southeast Michigan has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs due to unfair free trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA. Unfortunately, H.R. 3688 follows in the steps of these lopsided trade deals. 
   Advocates of today's legislation will insist that there are strong labor and environmental standards. However, members of the Peruvian Congress were working to pass a robust General Labor Law and now it will be tabled for a substantially weaker labor law issued by President Garcia. Furthermore, given President Bush's track record on lack of enforcement of current U.S. law, I cannot be persuaded that many of the labor provisions will be enforced. Unbalanced trade has led to a race to the bottom which has lowered job quality and wages for U.S. workers and H.R. 3688 will further encourage this push for cheap labor. 
   This bill is also bad for Peruvians. More than three million Peruvians may lose their jobs from U.S. exports and may drive many rural farmers into the illegal cocoa trade. H.R. 3688 will limit Peruvian access to health care. Specifically, by approving this free trade agreement, drug companies will obtain five years of data exclusivity, or monopoly rights for pharmaceutical manufacturers in both countries, which will increase the price of medicine, delay the entry of new drugs, and restrict competition in this market. As a result, millions of Peruvians will be at risk of losing life saving drugs. Furthermore, if Peru chooses to replace its current private Social Security system with its previous public system, then this bill may open the door to allow private foreign investors to file suit at international tribunals. 
   Madam Speaker, a recent poll indicated that the majority of Americans oppose the concept of free trade. It is no surprise that dozens of labor, environment, human rights, and religious organizations have opposed this bill because it is bad for both the United States and Peru. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.

   I'd just like to make a comment about the manager's amendment that I've heard raised in the discussion because, actually, I thank the floor manager of the Rules Committee on the Republican side because we had, I thought, a very good meeting yesterday. 
   It should be known to everyone here that the reason we had the late filing of the manager's amendment is that we were keeping it open for everybody to make their last changes. And most of the requests came from the minority side, which we were happy to accommodate. So it's in that spirit that I refer and make available to everybody here everything that are in manager's amendments, and hope that the fact that this is maybe 80 percent accomplished for almost all the many sides to this debate will carry us through the rule and through the spirit that has moved the committee and the subcommittee and the Judiciary Committee this far.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, I am proud and privileged to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for this historic consideration of the Patent Reform Act of 2007. 
   I can't help but begin by commending those members of Judiciary who were in this battle before I became chairman, namely, Lamar Smith of Texas; namely, Howard Berman of California; namely, Mr. Coble of North Carolina, all who have worked in a remarkable way. Even when the leadership changed in the committees and Smith became ranking and Berman became Chair, the cooperation and bipartisanship continued. I think it is important to lay that groundwork because of the intense cooperation in which we have sought to consult with every conceivable organization, individual, all stakeholders in this matter; and I think it has had a very telling effect on a bill that brings us all together here this afternoon. 
   After all, patent reform is enshrined in the Constitution, isn't it? Article I, section 8. After all, we have had a patent office pursuant to constitutional direction since 1790. So for a couple hundred years, this has been the driving force for American competition, creativity, inventiveness, and a prosperous economy. Thomas Jefferson was the first patent examiner in our American history. So I am humbly standing in the well to tell you that the continued robustness of the patent concept is very important. It has been estimated that the value of intellectual property in the United States amounts to $5 trillion, and much of that is in the value of the patents that come from the legislation produced by this bill. 
   Well, if it is so great, why are we here? Well, because certain things have happened over the course of years that need some re-examination. One of them is the trolling situation in which patents of less than high quality, they have created a whole legal industry, as some will continue to describe here today, in which, with very little pretext or excuse, patents are challenged and create a huge nuisance value. They flood the courts with unnecessary litigation. There are abusive practices that have grown up around the concept of patents, and there are certain inefficiencies where, for example, we use the first-to-invent system of granting patents, while most of the active and creative inventors in other countries use the first-inventor-to-file system, and we harmonize that in this legislation. 
   So there are problems, and they have been addressed with great care, because sometimes they go against the grain or to the detriment of the rest of the people, the stakeholders in this great legal activity of granting patents. 
   So I am here to tell you that we finally closed the circle, and I am proud of this, being from the highly organized State of Michigan, that with our friends in Labor we have been able to work out differences that they had originally had with this measure. All the consumer groups, there are several of them that have now joined with us. The United States Public Interest Research Group has come in. The pharmaceuticals have mostly come in. The Association of Small Inventors has come in. 
   We have done a great job, and we have created a manager's amendment to which we have allotted 20 minutes to discuss separately from the bill itself. I am proud, as you can tell, of the bipartisan nature of this work, because that is what it takes to make some 22 changes in the manager's amendment, more than two dozen changes in the underlying bill; and dealing with the question of damages and post grant opposition are stories that can only be told by the gentleman from California with his appropriate brevity. So it is in this spirit that we begin this final discussion of this measure. 
   I thank all the Members of the Congress not on the Judiciary Committee who have helped us in so many different ways. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of the manager's amendment which is, of course, very bipartisan and which makes further changes to the underlying bill. 
   Now, this is a work in progress. The reason it came up so late in the afternoon yesterday in the Rules Committee is we were making changes to accommodate the minority side, and so even now the manager's amendment is a piece of work that will not be concluded until we come out of conference, and I'm sure Mr. Berman will have some comments to make about that. 
   I want anyone who has not seen the manager's amendment or wants to review it, even as it's discussed on the floor today, to please come to my seat, and I will be happy to provide them with a copy of it. 
   Well, what does it do? We deal with damages, the most controversial provision of the bill, with labor, with the universities, with inequitable conduct, and additional changes that will be made. 
   For workers and inventors, how do we help them? Well, there was concern that in our attempt to simplify the assignment procedures, we cut the inventor out of the process. We've ensured that changes to applications will require inventor involvement. 
   And also, there was a fear about working environment at the PTO. We inquired of the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study of examining work conditions. 
   And finally, the examiners themselves were concerned about the quality submission requirements, that their job would be outsourced. We ensured that that will not happen. 
   Now, damages. We made further changes to explain clearly that a portion that is not mandatory in the calculations of damages can be considered under a similar formula that courts use today. 
   Universities, we spent enormous time, and I have as many universities in Michigan as anybody has in any other State in the Union, and to address their concern, we spent unbelievable amounts of time negotiating with them individually and collectively about the expansion of prior user rights which might reduce the value of their patents and harm their ability to license invention. 
   We've eliminated the expansion. Instead, we're calling for a study of the operation of prior user rights in countries where they already exist to determine their effects. 
   It allows universities to sue in districts where they are located but does not extend that right to universities' associated nonprofit organizations. 
   We deal with inequitable conduct by tightening the standards for pleading and finding inequitable conduct as a defense to infringement. 
   We continue to operate in good faith with additional changes. We've adopted suggestions made by outside groups to improve our post-grant opposition provision, changed the discovery standard to interest of justice and ensured that a patent owner can bring a patent suit, even if a post-grant suit is instituted. 
   So we've addressed every concern that has been brought to our attention. No concern was too small or too technical, and we continue even now to listen to the parties in other ways to continue to enhance the bill. 
   So now is the time for patent reform. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, the African National Congress is a rare example of an oppressed people fighting for their freedom and then leading a successful and peaceful transition to a modern nation. The fight went on for years, underground and in exile, against the morally bankrupt apartheid system in South Africa. And once they prevailed, their response to gaining political power was not retribution and reprisals, but truth and reconciliation. 
   Notwithstanding this peaceful transition, the United States had not gotten around to giving ANC leaders the opportunity to enter this country because certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act currently require us to consider them still as terrorists. 
   After the attacks on 9/11, Congress sought to exclude and remove terrorists from the United States by strengthening the terrorism bars in our immigration laws. In doing so, however, we inadvertently covered groups and individuals whom we did not intend to, including allies and even victims of terrorism. These bars have been used against the brave men and women who fought side by side with United States forces in Southeast Asia. They've been used against those who used armed resistance to defend themselves against brutal and repressive regimes, such as those in Cuba and Burma. They've even been used against women who were raped and enslaved by armed militia in Liberia. And as we recognize today, they've been used against members of the African National Congress, including the great leader, Nelson Mandela. This has had profound effects, preventing us from protecting vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers and resulting in embarrassing denials of visas for Nelson Mandela himself and other foreign heads of state. 
   We all know how Mr. Mandela and other ANC leaders suffered unjust incarceration for decades at the hands of the apartheid regime. We know how the apartheid regime labeled its opponents as terrorists, as communists, and anything else they could invent to accuse them of that was negative in an attempt to deflect criticism of their own institutions of repression and racial separation. And yet these people who steadfastly fought for freedom and chose a path for peace once they came to power are now blocked from entry to the United States. And so that's where this measure comes in. 
   Congress has begun to take corrective action, and last year were removed a number of freedom-fighting groups from treatment as terrorist organizations. Today, we do the same for the ANC and its members. In addition to specifying that the ANC is not on the list of terrorist organizations under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the bill would also give discretionary authority to Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to admit individuals regardless of activities undertaken in opposition to apartheid rule in South Africa. 
   Finally, the bill would require the Secretary of State, in coordination with other agencies, to ensure that government databases are updated so that they are consistent with the exemptions provided in the bill. 
   I'd like to thank committee chairman of the Judiciary, Howard Berman, but also in his capacity as the Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and in memoriam, I'd like to remember the chairman that preceded Mr. Berman, Tom Lantos, for their work on this bill. I would like to insert into the Record at this point an exchange of letters between our two committees. 
   And thanks again to the ranking member from Texas, Lamar Smith, whose bipartisan discussions have enabled us to reach this point. This is a noncontroversial bill that repairs something that should have been taken care of earlier. It closes the books on the evils of apartheid. And so I'm very proud to bring this to the floor with the Members that I have mentioned.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we move to dramatically step up our Nation's intellectual property laws and enforcement efforts. With so much unpleasant economic news in the headlines, the measure before us, H.R. 4279, puts resources towards aiding a sector of the economy that employs an estimated 18 million workers. That is 13 percent of our labor force and accounts for half of all of the United States exports driving 40 percent of the country's growth. 
   As a result of less-than-effective enforcement, however, counterfeiting and piracy cost the United States' economy somewhere in the neighborhood of $250 billion a year and creates the loss of about 750,000 American jobs. 
   And so H.R. 4279 will do these important things: It will prioritize intellectual property protection to the highest level of our government by creating an office in the White House that will be responsible for coordinating the intellectual property efforts of eight diverse agencies and producing a national Joint Strategic Plan for IP enforcement. It will elevate IP enforcement within the Department of Justice and provide more resources for investigating and prosecuting IP crimes. 
   It will make changes to both civil and criminal IP laws to enhance the ability of intellectual property owners to effectively protect their rights, and it will increase penalties for IP violations that endanger public health and safety. 
   Throughout the process of developing this bill, we heard many expressions of support as well as a number of expressions of concern. But we've been able to work out these issues on a bipartisan basis at every step of the process. 
   I congratulate the distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee, both Republicans and Democrats, for their cooperation in this process. And so now as a result, the measure is supported by the Consumer Electronics Association, the Digital Media Association, the Net Coalition, the Internet Commerce Coalition, the Coalition for Consumers' Picture Rights, the Printing Industries Association and more. 
   That is in addition to the support we've already had from the Teamsters, the Directors Guild of America, SEIU, AFTRA, Unite Here, AFM, OPEIU, the Coalition Against Counterfeiting in Piracy, the Motor Equipment Manufacturing Association, the Motion Picture Association of America, PHARMA, and NBC Universal. 
   Intellectual property protection is among the key issues that will determine American competitiveness in the 21st century. The ability to create, innovate, and generate the best artistic, technological, and knowledge-based intellectual property is the formula for continued growth in the global economy and is fundamental to the promotion of human progress. 
   This committee of ours, the Judiciary Committee, has given these items involved in the measure extensive consideration, lots of compromise back and forth, and we feel that this bill will make important contributions to the fight against counterfeiting and piracy.  It was reported by voice with strong bipartisan statements of support, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this is important legislation passed in the House on a strong bipartisan basis to improve the security of Federal judges, other Federal court officers, and their families. It allows judges to redact from their public disclosure forms personal information about their families that could be used to harm them. It provides increased funding for judicial protective services furnished by the United States Marshals and for Federal witness protection programs. It prohibits publishing of personal information about a judge, law enforcement officer or witness with the intent to cause harassment, intimidation or a crime of violence. 
   It enhances prison terms for assaults and other violent acts with intent to intimidate or interfere with judges and other Federal officers in performance of their official duties. 
   The House passed this bill in July by voice vote under suspension. The Senate has now passed it with an amendment that makes a few refinements, all of which should be acceptable to the House. It takes a slightly different approach to the enhanced prison terms for assaults and violent acts against judges and other Federal officers. 
   This legislation has been years in the making, and we are now finally able to send it to the President. 
   I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee, which I am proud to be the chairman of, but particularly Judge LOUIE GOHMERT, the new ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, who introduced this bill originally in a previous Congress. I also send out congratulations to the chairman of the Crime Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia, and committee members RANDY FORBES of Virginia and ANTHONY WEINER of New York. I strongly urge support of this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   The importance of judicial security has been explained by Mr. Gohmert, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime and the floor manager today, and it was underscored by the murders of family members of a Chicago Federal judge in 2005, and then, less than 2 weeks later, the killings of a State judge, a court reporter and a sheriff's deputy in an Atlanta courthouse. These acts of violence, along with numerous others, led to the introduction of this measure before us now, H.R. 660, the Court Security Improvement Act, which, among other things, seeks to improve judicial security, not just for court officers, but to safeguard judges and their families as well. 
   Although the security of all Federal buildings increased in the wake of the 1995 April bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the importance of judicial security was brought more particularly to the Nation's attention by reports of the murders of family members of a Chicago Federal judge and the killings less than 2 weeks later of a State judge, a court reporter, and a sheriff's deputy in an Atlanta courthouse. Another incident occurred in June of 2006 when a sniper shot a State judge in Reno, Nevada through the window of the judge's own office. 
   Supreme Court Justices have also been intended targets of violence and death threats. Last year it was revealed that home-baked cookies infused with poison were mailed to all nine Justices in the year 2005. According to one media report, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was quoted as saying that each one contained enough poison to kill the entire membership of the court. 
   All three branches of the Federal Government play unique roles in helping to ensure the safety of judges and the security of the Federal courts. In this joint effort, the role of Congress is to authorize programs, appropriate funds and provide oversight of judicial security. 
   The Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body of the Federal judiciary, governs the administration of the United States courts. The Conference's Committee on Judicial Security monitors the security of the judiciary, including the protection of court facilities and proceedings, judicial officers, and court staff at Federal court facilities and other locations, and makes policy recommendations to the Conference. As the central support entity for the judicial branch, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts implements Judicial Conference policies, including security measures. 
   By law, the United States Marshals Service within the Department of Justice has primary responsibility for the security of the judiciary, including the safe conduct of court proceedings and the security of Federal judges and court personnel at facilities and off-site as well. They also provide protection details for those who are targets of threats and attacks, and provides other law enforcement services for the Department of Justice. Within the Marshals Service, the Judicial Security Division is specifically responsible for providing security services and staff support to the Federal judiciary, including personal protection for judges and physical security of Federal courthouses. 
   The USMS, the Marshals Service, conducts threat assessments when they are directed against individuals, including Federal judges, but also United States attorneys, court staff and family members, and then determines the level of security that is necessary for developing security plans and assigning the required resources to ensure their safety. A deputy marshal is required to attend any sessions of the court at the request of the presiding judge. A judicial security inspector, a senior level deputy marshal, is assigned to each judicial district to evaluate courthouse security and procedures and to coordinate scheduling, posting and other matters related to court security officers. The inspectors also conduct security surveys at judges' homes and recommend improvements. 
   To enhance its capability to strengthen protection of the judiciary, the Marshals Service established the Office of Protective Intelligence in the year 2004 to review and analyze intelligence information about the security of those under Marshals Service protection. On a daily basis, the OPI issues security advisories, intelligence bulletins and many other things that I, although I would like to go into it, time does not permit the opportunity to explain in further detail. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (EMERGENCY AND DISASTER ASSISTANCE FRAUD PENALTY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the Congress, this important legislation strengthens Federal criminal prohibitions against fraudulent misuse of emergency and disaster relief funds. It passed the Senate earlier this month without opposition. It is a good bill, and one that the House should support. 
   Reports of fraud surfaced almost immediately after the Federal Emergency Management Agency began distributing funds Congress had appropriated for disaster aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and Hurricane Wilma. These reports included allegations that funds had been misused to purchase luxury goods, that noneligible persons had applied for and received benefits, and that criminals had established phony Katrina-related Web sites to swindle those who wished to contribute to legitimate disaster assistance efforts. 
   Last year, the GAO reported that it had identified numerous instances of fraud in connection with Katrina and Rita disaster relief. Although the total amount of cost of these fraud schemes is not yet known, the GAO estimates that it will certainly be in the amounts of billions of dollars. 
   Despite diligent efforts by Federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute these schemes, current criminal laws are not adequate to the task. The Emergency and Disaster Assistance Fraud Penalty Enhancement Act addresses that shortcoming in several respects. 
   The bill creates a new Federal crime that specifically prohibits fraud in connection with any emergency or disaster relief benefit as to both Federal assistance and private charitable giving, with fines up to $250,000 for an individual, and up to $500,000 for an organization, and prison terms up to 30 years. The bill also increases prison terms for engaging in mail or wire fraud in connection with emergency or disaster relief to the same levels as currently apply in cases involving bank fraud. 
   The bill also directs the Sentencing Commission to revise its sentencing guidelines for fraud or theft in connection with a major disaster emergency declaration in light of the new statutory changes. 
   It is a bipartisan measure, and will help ensure that disaster assistance funds are received by their intended recipients and used for their intended purposes. I am proud of the work that the Judiciary Committee has done on both sides of the aisle in this matter, and particularly commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) in his management of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Congressional Black Caucus budget alternative. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have criticized this proposal because they say that it raises taxes and spending. 
   The fact is, our Republican colleagues have different priorities than we do. In these perilous economic times, the Congressional Black Caucus believes our priority should be to help those Americans who are losing their jobs and their homes, who can't afford health care, higher education, and job training, who have to decide between paying the gas bill or paying for prescription drugs. 
   The Republicans want to know where the cuts are in the CBC budget. Their budget slashes Medicare, Medicaid, the Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program and countless other critical social service programs. They think these programs are unnecessary; their priority is to preserve the Bush tax cuts, more than 99 percent of which go to people making more than $225,000 per year. More than 85 percent of the money we lose due to these cuts goes to households with incomes above $500,000 per year; 65 percent goes to households with incomes above $1 million. In fact, $51 billion next year alone will go to tax breaks for millionaires. 
   By rescinding Bush's tax cuts, the Congressional Black Caucus increases funding for needed social programs while reducing the deficit even more than the Republicans do. 
   It would seem the Republicans' concern is not fiscal responsibility, but preserving tax cuts for the rich, even if this grows the national debt. And, of course, we aren't even discussing the President's war today, which spends $12 billion dollars a month, more than most of these social service programs spend in a year, or 5 years, or 10 years. The debate today is clear. It's about priorities. We believe in keeping working Americans in their homes; the Republicans want to make sure the rich can stay in their mansions and yachts. 
   I want to draw particular attention to some of my personal priorities within the CBC budget alternative. I am happy that the CBC accepted my proposal to add $10 million to the National Health Service Corps to help train the next generation of doctors to go into underserved communities without being crippled by educational debt. 
   The CBC budget also includes several of my proposals to increase funding for Department of Justice programs. 
   The highly successful COPS program focuses on local strategies to fight crime and has been praised by federal, state, and local law enforcement and political officials. The President's budget terminates the COPS program. In contrast, the CBC fully funds COPS at $500 million for FY 2009. 
   I also recommended, and the CBC budget includes, increased funding for other vital local law enforcement programs, including Drug Courts and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. In addition, we significantly increase funding for programs serving juveniles who have entered our justice system, in an effort to break the cycle of crime and violence and to help these children to become productive members of our society. 
   It's about priorities, and the choice today is clear. Supporting the CBC budget means prioritizing the basic needs of the American people. Supporting the Republicans' proposal means continuing our current course, where the rich keep getting richer, while the needs of the poor and middle class are neglected.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. I thank the cochair of the caucus for allowing me to make it clear to our friends on the other side of the aisle that the budget, as a document of what it is we believe in, what we put our money down in support of, expresses in some greater way the values of the Nation. And so we come to this 2008 budget consideration in the midst of what some call an economic downturn, others call a recession and other things. 
   Now, what we have done, and if there are parts of the Progressive Caucus budget that are specifically objected to, I would like to invite our friends on the other side to let us know what they are so that we can continue our work on it, because the Progressive Caucus every year always introduces an alternative budget. We've been getting more support on it each year. 
   It's our hope that with your enlightened analysis of it, we will get more support. I'm looking for the day when we get a bipartisan vote on the Progressive Caucus budget. I think it's possible. I think it states our priorities that don't have ``Democratic'' or ``Republican'' stamped on them. What we are saying is let's look at these issues in the budget and point out which ones make your favorite, make the hit list, and which ones don't match the aspirations and viewpoints of the minority. 
   I thank you, Madam Floor Manager.  
   I rise today in support of the budget alternative offered by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, CPC. 
   We often say that the Federal budget is a moral document, expressing the values and priorities of our Nation. 
   During this economic downturn, when more families are facing unemployment, foreclosure and bankruptcy, our top priority should be protecting our most vulnerable citizens and keeping more Americans from falling into poverty. 
   The President, however, seems to have his priorities upside-down. In this final budget proposal of his presidency, he once again sacrifices services for low- and moderate-income families failing to provide adequate funding for health care, housing, child care, job training and a host of other programs. 
   Even though the President cuts these vital programs, his budget still makes the deficit worse, because it continues to give stunningly high tax cuts to the rich. Tax cuts for millionaires alone will cost $51 billion in FY '09. 
   The CPC alternative budget gets our priorities straight. In stark contrast to the President's proposal, the CPC budget puts the needs of the economically vulnerable ahead of the needs of millionaires. 
   The CPC budget proposal is the only one under consideration today that cuts wasteful cold war era defense spending, according to standards recommended by the GAO, so that we can employ our scarce resources to help people, not to keep feeding the military industrial complex for weapons we don't need. 
   I want to draw attention today to the efforts of the Congressional Out of Poverty Caucus, which I co-chair along with my colleagues Ms. LEE, Mr. HONDA, Mr. BACA and Mr. BUTTERFIELD.  
   Under Ms. LEE's leadership, the House recently passed by unanimous consent H. Con. Res. 198, which commits the Congress to cutting poverty in half in the next decade. With the passage of H. Con. Res. 198, the House went on record, with unanimous, bipartisan support, making the alleviation of poverty a priority for this government.  
   For the good of the Nation, it is imperative that we live up to our commitment. The Congress must take action to make good on this promise. 
   The CPC budget promotes policy initiatives that can move us toward this goal by expanding programs with a proven track record of success in reducing poverty, like the Earned Income Tax Credit. We don't need more war and tax breaks for the rich. We need jobs, job training and better access to health care, child care and education. The CPC budget provides these critical tools that can help Americans lift themselves out of poverty. 
   Let's get our priorities straight. Let's pass the CPC budget alternative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the House has passed previously virtually identical legislation, and accordingly I will place my statement in the Record at this time.  
   Mr. Speaker, this bill addresses the growing national security threat of illicit self-propelled submersible vessels. It makes operation of one of these vessels with intent to avoid detection a felony, as well as subject to civil fines. 
   In July, the House passed the part of this bill creating the felony. This Senate version adds the civil penalty, to provide even greater deterrence. 
   Smugglers are operating these vessels with increasing frequency, knowing that there is no effective deterrent. They are designed so that the crew members can readily sink them within scant minutes of being spotted, thereby making efforts by authorities to intercept them exceedingly difficult and highly risky. 
   And smugglers using these vessels are becoming increasingly violent. Two weeks ago, a cocaine smuggler attempted to kill Coast Guard officers who had boarded his vessel in the dark in the Pacific ocean. 
   This extreme risk to our brave Coast Guard officers would not have been necessary if operating that vessel in this evasive manner were itself a crime. 
   I commend the sponsor of the House bill, DAN LUNGREN of California, for his leadership on this initiative. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, this bill imposes a limited, but important, condition on enforcement of foreign defamation judgments in our courts. 
   It prohibits a federal or state court from enforcing a defamation judgment entered in another country for publication involving a matter of public concern, unless the court first determines that the judgment is consistent with the free-speech clause of our Constitution's First Amendment. 
   H.R. 6146 responds to the problem of what is sometimes called ``libel tourism.'' This is the disturbing practice of suing authors for defamation in foreign countries rather than in the United States, so as to avoid the speech-protective features of defamation law enshrined in our Constitution. 
   A much-cited recent example is the lawsuit filed by a Saudi billionaire against an American expert on terrorism, as a result of statements about his activities she made in a book entitled Funding Evil: How Terrorism Is Financed and How to Stop It. 
   The Saudi billionaire sued the American author not in the United States, where the book  was published, but in England, where a mere 23 copies of the book had been sold to on-line buyers. 
   He sued in England to avail himself of English libel law, which denies authors the important free-speech protections of our First Amendment. This kind of end-run on the Constitution poses an obvious threat to free speech rights in our country. 
   H.R. 6146, which was introduced by our colleague, STEVE COHEN of Tennessee, would go a long way toward eliminating this threat. At the same time, it would not interfere with the judicial systems of other countries, or deprive plaintiffs of their choice of forum. 
   It would simply require that anyone who seeks to enforce this specific type of defamation judgment in our courts to establish that the judgment does not offend our First Amendment. Many U.S. courts already impose this condition on the enforcement of foreign defamation judgments. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the author of the measure, STEVE COHEN, the gentleman from Memphis, Tennessee, as much time as he may consume.

   Mr. CONYERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, the Equal Justice for Our Military Act amends the Federal judicial code to allow members of the United States Armed Services to petition for review by the United States Supreme Court in certain cases when they have been denied relief by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. 
   Many Americans would be shocked to learn that soldiers serving their country in uniform are blocked from equal access to the Supreme Court. 
   But the truth is that current law provides virtually no avenue through which active service members who have been convicted by court-martial of certain serious offenses, or who face discharge or dismissal, to ask our Nation's highest court to review their case. 
   Currently, the Supreme Court can only hear cases where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the highest court of the military justice system, has either conducted a review of a court-martial, or has granted a service-member's petition for extraordinary relief. 
   What this means is that when the court of appeals denies review, which it does nearly 90 percent of the time, the Supreme Court is barred from reconsidering the case at the request of the servicemember. 
   Adding insult to injury, while a servicemember is not able to obtain Supreme Court review if he or she loses at the court of appeals, if the court of appeals rules against the government, the Government can seek review in the Supreme Court. 
   And a former servicemember who is tried under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act in civilian court for crimes committed while on active duty also has full right to petition for Supreme Court review. 
   The Equal Justice for Our Military Act corrects this unfair one-sidedness by allowing an active servicemember to file a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court in any case where the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has denied review of a court-marital conviction or has denied a petition for extraordinary relief. 
   I would like to commend the author of this bill, our colleague Susan Davis of California, for her leadership in working to correct this ongoing injustice, so that our active servicemembers have the same fundamental protection that Americans take for granted. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 344 today and applaud the Congress for finally recognizing the serious human, economic, and moral impact the global food crisis has had on the world community. In particular, I want to recognize the author of this bill, the Gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, for her continuing advocacy on behalf of the many millions of hungry people around the world; people whose stories often go untold in our public debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the course of action proposed in this resolution. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon should immediately convene a taskforce, composed of the heads of the United Nations aid agencies and the World Bank, to both address this growing crisis and close the $755,000,000 funding gap for the World Food Programme. The 850,000,000 chronically or acutely malnourished human beings living on this planet demand nothing less. 
   If anything, the heavy toll borne by Haiti and other Caribbean nations during this hurricane season has only added to the urgency of holding such a meeting. Unless the world community crafts a serious, comprehensive aid plan that can be deployed in a quick and effective manner, the lack of access to clean water and food in these nations will lead to an untold and unacceptable loss of human life. 
   I also want to remind my colleagues that the global food price surge is hitting Americans here at home. According to the Department of Labor, prices for staples such as bread, milk, eggs, and flour are rising sharply, surging in the past year at double-digit rates. Milk prices, for example, increased 26 percent over the year. Egg prices jumped 40 percent. Chronic hunger and malnourishment are ailments that affect more than just the citizens of third-world foreign locales; they affect our neighbors, our children, and our parents. 
   In the long-term, our country must confront our contribution to this crisis. Although we have little control over sky-rocketing oil prices, we have the power to re-evaluate and improve our agricultural policy in ways that will ease the pain at the register for food consumers, both here and abroad. In particular, slashing some farm subsidies and ending de facto price controls that mainly benefit massive corporate farms would go along way towards lowering food prices. Our country can only afford to pay our farmers not to produce when prices are low and food is ample. In times like these, such subsidies may be a luxury we cannot afford. 
   In the meantime, I encourage the Congress to speak with one voice and endorse the multilateral engagement proposed in this resolution. While It alone wIll not solve this complex problem, it is a necessary and needed component of a successful and comprehensive strategy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, section 12017 of H.R. 2419, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Among other things, the changes provide that, during periodic renegotiations with USDA's Federal Crop Insurance Corporation regarding the standard reinsurance agreement for the FCIC's crop insurance program, approved insurance companies may consult with each other, and collectively with the FCIC. 
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would like to provide a bit of background, and to sound a cautionary note. 
   For a number of years, insurance companies participating in providing reinsurance to the FCIC--that is, providing back-up insurance to the insurance being provided by the FCIC--did indeed consult with each other, and collectively with the FCIC. This occurred most recently in the 1997 renegotiation. In fact, the insurers apparently used a common agent to negotiate the terms of the agreement on their behalf. 
   I understand that that experience may have led USDA's Risk Management Administration, which runs the FCIC, to begin reconsidering whether joint discussions were a good idea from a competitive standpoint, in achieving the best result with the taxpayers' dollars that the FCIC was spending in the reinsurance marketplace. In any event, the RMA evidently discussed the matter at some length with the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, and came away with the clear conviction that joint negotiations are anticompetitive--as experience under the antitrust laws confirms time and time again. 
   As a result of its new understanding, the RMA restricted the kinds of collaborative consultations it would permit during the 2004 renegotiation. 
   Some may believe that the RMA either went further than it needed to in 2004, or that it may go further in future renegotiations, prohibiting consultation even on aspects of the renegotiation that not only are not competitively sensitive, but where the antitrust laws recognize that cost-saving efficiencies can be gained without harm to competition. To the extent that that has been a concern, the new language being added to the Federal Crop Insurance Act may help clear the way for that kind of competitively benign consultation. 
   I wish to emphasize, however, that the new language does not create an antitrust exemption, or alter the antitrust laws in any way. The Supreme Court has aptly referred to the antitrust laws as the Magna Carta of our free enterprise system, and has said repeatedly that exceptions to those laws are not to be lightly inferred. Therefore, any insurer wishing to engage in consultations pursuant to this new authorization should be careful to do so in compliance with the antitrust laws. 
   Some observers have raised the question whether some of the conduct that could be at issue here might be covered under the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust exemption for the business of insurance, to the extent that such business is regulated by State law. It is far from clear, however, that reinsurance being provided to the USDA's FCIC for its federally administered crop insurance program is in fact regulated by State law. And even if it were, the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not apply to the antitrust prohibitions against boycott, which can all-too-easily be implicated when competing firms start coordinating their negotiation-related activities and strategies. These are serious violations of the law, and those who would seek to avoid the pitfalls here would be well advised to seek appropriate antitrust guidance.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor) who is floor manager for this important bill. 
   And I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for the great work she, and I include the former chairman of the Rules Committee, they have done in trying to bring about reform in the House of Representatives and in the Congress as a whole. I mean it. I was up there yesterday, and I was one of the ones that took exception to calling Mr. Dreier of California's H.R. 4975 a sham bill. It was not a sham bill, and we have taken many of the things out of that bill and have brought them to H.R. 2316 which we're observing. 
   So we think that we all agree on both sides of the aisle that we have one big problem. The Congress has a black eye in terms of ethics, and we want to correct it. We're agreed? Okay. We check that one off. 
   Now, how do we correct it? Well, the one way that you will never correct it in the 110th Congress is to vote down this rule this afternoon, because if you vote down this rule this afternoon, there will be nothing to meet the Senate bill, which has already passed in January. They have been waiting for February, March, April, end of May, and now all of us who are concerned about fighting corruption, fighting for better ethics, fighting for transparency, fighting for basic disclosure now say on that side, let's vote down the rule. And do what I would ask? What do you have in mind that we haven't done now?

   Mr. CONYERS. I thank my friend for helping me out there, because what we will have done, and there are some in the media that are predicting that this is what's going to happen, that we're going to abandon all of the work that we have put into this measure. And I'm looking still after a number of decades for the Member who can concede that he's voted on the perfect bill in the legislative process. 
   But if we abandon this at this course, months behind schedule, we're sending a perfectly obvious message to the American people; namely, that this is the sham that is working on the Congress. 
   We've got to get this rule going. I'm happy that our colleague, the former chairman of Rules, said nothing about the amendments that have been granted by the committee in which he worked so hard over the years. We've got amendments. Some are Republican amendments, some are Democratic amendments, but for goodness sake, let's keep our promises to the American people. 
   We campaigned on this. We said we can improve the transparency and the rules regulating lobbyists, regulating bundling, regulating reporting, increasing the penalties. We've said all of this  and put it in in as perfect form as we can do here.     
   We need now to get something to go to conference. I pledge to be open to suggestions, as I have all along the way. We've got to keep our promises, and the promises start with voting the rule to begin the debate. Now, you may have differences in the debate but certainly not on moving forward from this elementary process. 
   I thank the gentlelady, the floor manager, for allowing me to bring these matters up at this point.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, the moment has come in this very important session of Congress that we examine the lobbying and bundling provisions that have been of such interest and debate for the past several months. 
   This measure, the Lobbying Transparency Act, will more effectively regulate, but does not ban, the practice of registered lobbyists bundling together the large numbers of campaign contributions to candidates for Federal office. This is a practice that has already taken root in Presidential campaigns. 
   In essence, the bill requires a registered lobbyist who bundles two or more contributions made to a candidate to file quarterly reports with the House Clerk and Secretary of the Senate. 
   I want to begin by paying tribute to the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Chris Van Hollen, for the enormous amount of work not only in this Congress but in the previous Congress that he has put forward on behalf of this measure. 
   Under the bill, the bundled contribution is limited to contributions which the lobbyist physically receives and forwards to the candidate, or which are credited to the lobbyist through a specific tracking system put in place by the candidate. In order to better ensure that a registered lobbyist does not inaccurately report contributions involving a candidate, the measure further requires the lobbyist to send the candidate a proposed statement first. This allows the candidate or the political action committee to correct any errors. 
   This legislation reflects considerable input on Members of the House of Representatives both on the Judiciary Committee and off the Judiciary Committee.     
   It reflects the considered judgment of many Members not even on the Judiciary Committee. We've worked with the public interest groups around the clock to craft a workable piece of legislation that provides for the disclosure of large-scale bundling in a way that provides clear and enforceable legal requirements. 
   The American people have been waiting for this. We've talked about this for a considerable period of time, and many people now have realized that the House of Representatives has taken a very important step in moving this measure forward. 
   Most significantly, the measure does not include the provision that would have counted as bundled any contribution arranged by a lobbyist. After careful consideration, we've concluded that as the Senate provision is written, it was too vague to be effectively enforced. 
   And so I rise today to let you know of my firm conviction that we ultimately need to move to assist the public financing of campaigns, and I don't mean somewhere in the nebulous future; I'm talking about as soon as we can. But until we do, I remain persuaded that the legislation today represents an extremely important step forward toward that reform when coupled with the other lobbying reform measure that is before us. 
   This is not the perfect bill. I'm still looking for a Member that has ever passed the perfect piece of legislation. But I draw to my colleagues' attention this measure and ask that they examine it carefully and recognize the importance and significance of this measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It's necessary that we continue to bring sunlight on the workings of the lobbying organizations and the fundraising as it affects the congressional product. 
   It's important, as a part of the promise that we have made to the American people, that we work to restore their confidence in us, and this will be accomplished, in part, by what we do here on the floor of the House of Representatives on this day. I hope we will keep that commitment by passing this very important measure before us, H.R. 2317, the Lobbying Transparency Act of 2007.

   Mr. CONYERS. Members of the House, recommit motions too frequently here have become procedural tactics that are not based on the work that we have done in the committee up until now. And I rise to oppose the provision because it raises conveniently a new issue not discussed in our hearings and not even raised in the markup. I don't think that it is really going to be helpful to the bundling law at all. 
   As I understand this motion to recommit, this is a broad new provision that would make the bill even more complex and difficult to administer. We have had that problem with this measure in the other body, and we certainly don't want to bring that kind of strategy into the measure before us now. It would seem to sweep into its reach entities that are not public or official. 
   This would include political action committees created by the following organization. It would include the National Rifle Association, the Right to Life Organization, even the Congressional Black Caucus. It would include Emily's List. It would seem to me that this would really confuse the bill, and I urge my Members, at this late date, under this strategy, to oppose the amendment. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen).

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act reported out of the Committee on the Judiciary on a bipartisan basis builds on the work of the last Congress to make long-needed reforms to the Lobby Disclosure Act and related rules and law. 
   The legislation before us today, right now, reflects the give and take of the legislative process incorporating proposals of Members on both sides of the aisle, both on and off the Judiciary Committee. At the end of the day, I believe that we have a measure that represents a very significant improvement over current law. 
   By emphasizing increased disclosure and enforcement, the bill is defined to effect practical change in the way that lobbying efforts are reported and monitored. It accomplishes this without infringing upon our first amendment rights as citizens to petition our government for redress of grievances. 
   The measure before us effects important changes in three areas: Prohibition of unethical conduct, increased disclosure, and enhanced penalties. 
   First, it ends the practice of Members attempting to use their power to influence private lobbyist hiring decisions. It does it by prohibiting Members and senior staff from influencing hiring decisions or practices of private entities for partisan political gain. Violations can result in not only fines, but imprisonment for up to 15 years. 
   Second, this measure now under consideration provides for greater disclosure. It requires the disclosure of lobbying activities by many coalitions, as well as the past executive branch and congressional employment of registered lobbyists. It also requires lobbyists to file more detailed reports disclosing their contacts with Congress, as well as certifications that the lobbyist did not give a gift or pay for travel in violation of the rules. These reports are to be filed electronically and more frequently, quarterly rather than semiannually, and they will be made available to the public for free over the Internet in a timely fashion. 
   Finally, the legislation provides for stronger enforcement. This measure significantly increases the penalties for noncompliance with Lobbying Disclosure Act requirements. Civil penalties are increased from the current $50,000 per violation to $100,000, and there are new criminal penalties for knowing, willful and corrupt violations, with potential sentences of imprisonment up to 5 years. 
   The recent round of lobbying scandals demonstrates that fundamental change is needed. The legislation before us today helps to reform the lobbying process and provides us with an opportunity to begin to rebuild confidence in Congress. 
   I believe that this legislation represents a realistic approach that strengthens current law to restore accountability in the Congress. This bill is not about any one Member or any one political party. It is about restoring the American people's trust in all of us. 
   Madam Chairman, it is now time for us to act. We are a few months late in getting around to this measure, but I am sure with the cooperation of Members on both sides of the aisle, we will succeed in our endeavor to raise the integrity of the Congress and restore the American people's trust in all of us. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And in terms of parking issues, that is not involved in this measure because the subject matter does not come to the Judiciary Committee, but it does come to the House Administration Committee, where I think there is important discussion going on about this issue that you raise about parking, even as we speak.

I appreciate both gentlemen from Illinois and California in their exchanges and reflecting back on how we got to where we are. But we are moving forward now, and we are all concerned that this 110th Congress do everything in its power to make up for the lack of transparency and enforcement that may have taken place in an earlier period of time. 
   In the last few months, we have worked to address these concerns and begin to restore the trust in the Congress, as we promised our voters that we would last November. So this is an important bipartisan start. It is not the end of reform in this area. As everyone knows, it really doesn't have an end.

   Members of the House, this is merely a truly technical revision to H.R. 2316. Sometimes technical amendments aren't really only technical. This one is, because all it does is clarify the application of the bill's provisions regarding the posting of financial disclosure forms on the Internet. 
   The amendment makes clear that Members may omit personally identifiable information not required to be disclosed from travel and personal financial disclosure forms before these  forms are submitted to the House Clerk for posting on the Internet. It ensures that the bill's heightened disclosure requirements do not become potential fodder for identity theft or any other inappropriate processes or purposes. It also directs the Clerk to detail the procedures for protecting personally identifiable information to Members. 
   I am indebted to one of our committee members in particular, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. LOUIE GOHMERT, for working with us to ensure that Members receive proper guidance regarding the information that they are required to provide, as well as the information they are not required to provide.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, Members of the House, this is an amendment originally proposed by the gentleman from Hawaii, and it is designed to ensure that the decisions made by government officials aren't tainted by the prospect of private gain after they leave public office. That was one of the very first of our goals in this entire bill, to end the practice of Members attempting to use their power to influence private lobbyists' hiring decisions. 
   This amendment furthers that objective by extending the conflict of interest standards to generals and flag officers of the Armed Forces who serve as top decision-makers in their respective services. It only applies to contracts greater than $50 million in size, and it mandates a cooling-off period for 1 year. 
   Now, we have a huge military budget, a growing one, and unfortunately, many questions have arisen in recent years about the manner in which some of these contracts have been negotiated. Some have even received prison sentences as a result of serious conflicts of interest that occurred during the conduct of these negotiations. 
   Each of these contracts involving military people affect the security of our Nation, the welfare of our men and women in uniform, and the public trust of the taxpayers. The provision of the gentleman from Hawaii will ensure that there is not even the appearance of a conflict. It will provide an assurance that the public's defense dollars are spent on the security of our Nation and the welfare of our troops rather than from private gain from our top military officials. It's a measure that the gentleman from Hawaii has discussed with me in great detail. And I urge its favorable consideration.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, this is a level of hutzpah tonight to have Jack Abramoff's name being brought up by the Republicans, which is why we are on the floor here legislating. This is what brought it all on. I am so delighted that you chose to give it the right name. 
   Now let's be reasonable about this. We have not had the opportunity to even get the vaguest idea of what this recommit motion was about. And I ask my colleague, as one who has worked with the Judiciary Committee Republicans without exception, what is wrong with 5 minutes notice about it? We got no notice, and so we had to waste 435 Members' time until we could find out what was in the motion to recommit. I just ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, particularly the leadership because I don't ascribe this to Lamar Smith, the ranking member, at all. But let's get to the substance. 
   From our brief review of what we could hear and read about this matter, this motion to recommit deals with several issues: The ability of the State and local governments and Indian tribes to make gifts, a new revolving door limitation on former lobbyists, a requirement that lobbyists disclose when they are lobbying on earmarks, and new restrictions on bundling. 
   Now I wish we had time to review the motion in detail. But I have worked hard to make this process bipartisan and will continue to do so. 
   My inclination is to accept this amendment today; and I will tell you why, we have no objection to combining the bundling provisions with the rest of the lobbying disclosures. They do go together. We started out this process, and we thought it would appeal to more Members, but if now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wish to combine them, I find no objection with it. It gives us one bill. We can go into conference and we will work our way there. This chairman has at least a 50 percent chance of becoming the conference chairman. 
   So, without any further ado, we accept the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the first amendment before us, and in strong opposition to the second. 
   It is unfortunate that we have come to this point today. This House has already passed two supplemental war funding bills that would set in motion the change of course in Iraq that the American people have demanded of us. The first was vetoed by the President; the second failed in the Senate. Last week, Democratic leaders met with the President and offered to drop all domestic items in the supplemental if the administration would accept meaningful benchmarks and timelines for ending our involvement in that civil war. He refused. 
   We are now left with the Senate-passed plan, which gives the President the funds he requested, accompanied by a much weaker set of benchmarks than those passed by the House. Some have cited the inclusion of these benchmarks as a step toward ending 6 years of Congressional blank checks for the President's war. While these benchmarks may be a step in the right direction, they are too small of a step. I will vote against the second amendment we are considering today. 
   However, I will support amendment No. 1 to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2206. This measure will provide emergency funding to address critical needs here at home. It includes additional funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program to prevent many thousands of poor children and some of their parents from losing health coverage, as well as increased spending for Gulf Coast hurricane recovery. It also provides more funding for our veterans' health needs, with additional funding set aside specifically to address traumatic brain injury, one of the most common and devastating injuries our soldiers are suffering in Iraq. The amendment also codifies the raise in the minimum wage that the House originally passed during the First 100 Hours of the 110th Congress. The value of the minimum wage is at its lowest level in more than 30 years, and raising it will provide much-needed help to many of America's financially-strapped working families. 
   I find it unconscionable that the President and some Congressional Republicans have derided these provisions as ``pork.'' Each of these issues is an emergency in its own right and rises to the level of inclusion in this emergency spending bill. I am proud to support them. 
   In September, as these funds expire, the Congress will once again have to decide what course of action to take on this war. The rule we passed for consideration of this bill requires that before we vote on another supplemental bill in the fall, we must vote on whether the funds appropriated therein be limited to the safe redeployment of our troops on a responsible timetable. It is my hope that when these votes occur in September, many more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will have come to their senses and realized that the civil war in Iraq cannot be ended by further American military involvement. I am confident that if the American people continue to voice their strong opposition to the President's failed policy in Iraq, enough Republicans will join with us to override future vetoes and end this misbegotten war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. This important legislation amends titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to extend, for 18 months, expiring provisions under the Medicare Program. This critical bill prevents the implementation of a scheduled 10.6 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements for physicians and other health care professionals, and extends the 0.5 percent payment update for 2008 and provides a 1.1 percent payment increase for physicians in 2009. 
   Cutting funds to Medicare, in any way, threatens to up heave the very system that millions of Americans rely upon to provide life saving medical care and services. It boggles the mind to think that, with an aging population and a worsening physician shortage, we would even consider cutting reimbursement rates to our hard-working physicians who care for millions of Medicare patients across the country. If these cuts were allowed to go into effect, many physicians would opt out of accepting Medicare, and would therefore be unable to provide necessary medical services to our seniors. 
    Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a bona fide health care crisis. One-in-three Americans either have either no health insurance whatsoever, or have insurance that is so inadequate that it can potentially lead to financial ruin. For those lucky enough to have survived these misadventures in our fragmented non-system of care, Medicare and Medicaid is their singular saving grace. 
   Allowing Medicare to unravel before our eyes is unacceptable. It, along with Medicaid, represents a lone island in a sea of broken services representative of our fragmented, non-system of health care. We must not only keep Medicare afloat, but improve and expand its ideals and principals if we are to ever truly provide quality health care to all. 
    Mr. Speaker, passage of H.R. 6331 is simply a necessity. However, we as a Congress must confront head-on the looming health care crisis and make the difficult decisions our constituents expect us to make. Revising the Sustained Growth Rate Formula, which is used to set Medicare's physician payment rate, represents only a portion of reforms which are needed to ensure that our seniors are cared for in the sunset of their lives. Patch-work fixes and temporary solutions are no substitution for real answers to difficult problems. After all, what we put off today must be dealt with tomorrow.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this vitally important appropriations bill that addresses a wide range of our nation's critical needs. H.R. 3093, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008 provides local communities with the help they need to keep our streets safe; makes significant increases into scientific research to keep our Nation's economic preeminence in the world; and bans civil rights and privatization abuses furthered by the Bush administration. 
   Last year, the FBI reported that violent crime had its biggest increase in over a decade. Under Republican control from 2001 to 2006, funding for state and local law enforcement grants was cut from $4.4 billion to $2.5 billion--a 43 percent decrease. This bill reverses those trends, making major investments into restoring state and local law enforcements grants. It appropriates $725 million for Community Oriented Policing Services (the COPS program)--$693 million over the President's request and $183 million above 2007--to support local law enforcement agencies, including $100 million for the ``COPS on the Beat'' hiring program, not funded since 2005. The Congressional Research Service estimates that 2,800 new police officers can be put on America's streets with these funds. The President's budget would have cut these grants by 94 percent. 
   H.R. 3093 also funds the Office on Violence Against Women at $430 million, $60 million above the President's request and $48 million above 2007, to reduce violence against women, and to strengthen services to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It provides $1.3 billion for the Office of Justice Programs for grants to state and local organizations to fund activities like crime prevention, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Drug Courts and Byrne Grants. It also appropriates $400 million for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for state and local grants to address the problems surrounding juvenile offenders, including $100 million for a competitive youth mentoring grants program. 
   To keep our Nation's economic preeminence in the world we need to stay on the cutting edge of science and technology. To that end, H.R. 3093 makes significant investments in scientific research at the country's top agencies devoted to science. It provides $28 billion, $2 billion above 2007 and $1 billion above the President's request, for science and science education as part of the Innovation Agenda to keep America competitive in the global market. The bill also tackles the enormous challenge of global climate change, with $1.86 billion for research and development projects to study what is happening, what could happen, and what we can do about it. 
   The bill also funds other essential federal programs including the Legal Services Corporation, for civil legal assistance to people who are unable to afford it, allowing an additional 31,000 low-income client cases to be concluded. The program was funded at $400 million in 1995 and has been cut repeatedly since. A 2005 study found that for every eligible person served, another was turned away due to lack of resources. This bill provides $377 million for that program, $28 million above 2007 and $66 million above the President's request. H.R. 3093 also appropriates $333 million for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to reduce the backlog of pending cases--projected to increase 70 percent from 2006 to 2008 under the President's request--and requires that all complaint calls be handled by EEOC employees, cancelling the outsourcing of this service. 
   Finally, the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill prohibits administration policies that have infringed on our civil rights and curbs privatization policies that have led to waste, fraud and abuse. H.R. 3093 bars the FBI from authorizing National Security Letters in contravention of the law, a practice that we  have examined in the Judiciary Committee. The Justice Department's Inspector General has found multiple instances of FBI abuses and misuses of its authority in issuing these letters. The bill also prohibits the privatization of work performed by employees of the Bureau of Prisons or of Federal Prison Industries, Inc. It also allows federal employees the same appeals rights as contractors after decisions are made on public-private competitions. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this bill because it gets us back on the right track after six years of misguided cuts whose disastrous effects are now becoming apparent with the FBI's latest crime statistics. This legislation deals literally with life and death issues that need to be given adequate resources. H.R. 3093 will put more police on our streets, aid crime victims, help juvenile offenders get their lives back on track, and provide critical legal services to those who can't afford it. It also makes vitally important investments in our Nation's economic future by encouraging scientific research. Finally, it protects us from government and contractor abuses. The New Direction Congress is once again working to align the priorities of the Federal Government with the needs of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the passage of H.R. 3524, the ``HOPE VI Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2007.'' This bipartisan bill allows public housing agencies to continue to improve the lives of families in public housing through the revitalization of severely distressed public housing. Throughout America, there are tens of thousands of working families who are in desperate need of affordable housing, but are unable to obtain it, due to a shortage of sufficient public housing units. Passage of H.R. 3524 will dramatically improve the lives of those from low and moderate incomes who are having difficulty finding decent and affordable housing. 
   In Detroit, there are scores of families who are on the public housing waiting list, and are in dire need of affordable housing. Many of these families are forced to stay in homeless shelters, sleep in expensive hotels, or stay with friends and relatives until they can find permanent housing. This bill will provide direct assistance to low-income individuals and families in Detroit who will now have access to more affordable housing units, given that cities and towns across America will have increased federal funding to construct affordable housing units. 
   H.R. 3524 also ensures that the HOPE VI program does not contribute to the loss of public housing. It requires public housing agencies replace any demolished public housing unit with another comparable unit. Furthermore, the legislation gives agencies flexibility in the location of replacement housing by allowing replacement units to be provided in on- site mixed-income housing developments; and in other areas where the public housing agency has jurisdiction. 
   One of the most important benefits of H.R. 3524 is that more Americans will receive expanded housing opportunities through ensuring that families are able to move back into replacement housing units by prohibiting unreasonably stringent rescreening policies and making residents who are otherwise eligible for public housing also eligible for a HOPE VI unit. 
   The bill also encourages resident involvement in the redevelopment planning phases for new affordable housing. This is a critically important provision because it will help ensure that communities impacted by housing redevelopment will have a say in where they are going to live. Also, H.R. 3524 requires the monitoring and tracking of displaced residents by requiring housing authorities to maintain current contact information for each affected household while the mixed-income community is being developed. It is also a progressive bill, in that it implements green building standards in order to provide long-term energy efficiency and savings.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 194, which is bipartisan legislation apologizing for the enslavement and the continued racial segregation of African Americans. For numerous Congresses past, similar resolutions have been introduced, but none have made it to the floor for consideration by the full House. So I salute my colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee, a member of the Judiciary Committee, the Honorable STEVE COHEN, for his leadership and indefatigable energy in bringing us to this point in support of this resolution which he has created. 
   While much progress has been made since the civil rights era, the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is still at the root of many critical issues facing the African American community today; educational opportunities, health care access, business capital, they are still victimized by crime, and many other socioeconomic considerations. 
   Our friend the former President, Bill Clinton, expressed his regrets over the Nation's role in the slave trade. The current President, George W. Bush, described it as ``one of the greatest crimes of history.'' A number of States, Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and New Jersey, have made moving apologies in their own ways. Now, with an official United States Government apology before us, this measure will take us another step forward toward the national healing, atonement and continued progress that must be made along these lines. 
   The discussion of race is a sensitive, difficult issue even today in our society. And, of course, the apology is not the end of the story, but it does reaffirm our national commitment to understanding and addressing, in the words of the resolution, how to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against African Americans under slavery and Jim Crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future. 
   So I am proud to join the many Members on both sides of the aisle that have helped us bring this suspension forward today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Born of war hysteria and racial prejudice, Executive Order 9066 would come to represent a stain on America's reputation for fairness and justice. 
   128,000 Japanese Americans were ordered to leave behind their entire lives and property and bring only the bare necessities to an unknown place with an unknown future, and they spent 3 long years in internment camps in Arizona, Northern and Central California, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and Arkansas. At the conclusion of World War II, they attempted to return home, but many found that their houses were looted and destroyed. They could not find jobs to feed and shelter their property. And, sadly, it took our government nearly 50 years to formally apologize for this serious Constitutional mistake and offer compensation to those who suffered through internment. 
   On February 19, 1976, President Ford rescinded Executive Order 9066. On July 21, 1980, Congress established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to investigate the internment of World War II. A few years later the Commission reported its finding and recommendations, and on August 10, 1988, the Civil Liberties Act was signed into law authorizing reparations to each person wrongfully interned. 
   Although there is hardly anything that can replace 3 years lost to internment, an official apology and compensation provided some solace to those who suffered, and helped heal a Nation stained by this terrible mistake made during the Second World War. One of the leaders in that effort was the late Robert Matsui of California.     
   And so it is today that this resolution introduced by his widow, DORIS MATSUI, we have come to recognize the significance of the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Liberties Act and how America came to admit and remedy past mistakes. Let's hope that will help the Nation remember this mistake and to prevent similar occurrences like that from happening in the future. 
   We remember others who suffered similar internment or forced deportation in exchange for United States citizens held by axis countries. In its review, the commission also found our government financed relocation to the United States and internment of 2,300 Latin Americans of Japanese descent for the purpose of exchanging Latin Americans of Japanese descent for United States citizens held by axis countries. 
   I commend XAVIER BECERRA, our distinguished colleague from California, for working to bring this matter also before us today. 
   In addition, serious allegations have been made that our government also interned German Americans and Italian Americans during World War II. Our distinguished colleague on Judiciary, ROBERT WEXLER of Florida, has worked for years to bring to light this forgotten group of people who also suffered the plight of internment. 
   This resolution also resolves that Congress will review these claims to determine whether they too should receive and be eligible for similar reparations and apology. 
   I, of course, urge strongly the support of this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6083, a measure that will fund a National Training Program for State and local prosecutors. 
   Since 1998, the Attorney General has provided funds to the National District Attorneys Association to offer specialized training for approximately 3,000 State and local prosecutors each year. 
   This valuable training improves the ability of prosecutors to investigate and try difficult crimes, such as child and elder abuse, identity theft, and gang-related activities. It also provides the latest guidance on complex evidentiary issues, such as the use of DNA in criminal investigations. 
   While this is a crucial initiative that our communities can ill afford to lose, funding shortages in recent years unfortunately place its future in doubt. Traditional funding sources, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Grants, have been severely cut over the past several years. 
   The National District Attorneys Association recently submitted a grant application for the program, but it appears that it will again, at best, receive diminished funding. As a result, there have been significant staff reductions, jeopardizing the program's future. 
   H.R. 6083 addresses this problem by authorizing $4.75 million for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for the Attorney General to fund a national non-profit organization such as NDAA to train State and local prosecutors. 
   I commend John Spratt of South Carolina for his leadership on this very important measure. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) be given the ability to manage the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   There probably is no Member in this body who has a greater concern about civil rights and civil liberties than this Member. It is a cause I have worked on for all of my years in this body, and it is one that goes to the very heart of the protections provided under the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. 
   I am equally sensitive to the need to protect our Nation from terrorism and terrorists. I have chaired recently three classified briefings on this matter in the last week and have spent the last period of time seeking to forge common ground on this issue. 
   That is why we are here today, to ensure that our government has the tools it needs to respond to the threat of terrorism, while at the same time respecting our citizens' right to privacy. 
   That is why the bill before us permits the Attorney General to apply to the FISA court to obtain a basket of warrants for the surveillance aimed outside of the United States. That is why we provide an emergency exception. That is why we specify that foreign-to-foreign communications do not require a court order. These are all changes to current law that will help our Nation respond to the threat of terrorism. 
   At the same time, however, the legislation is respectful of our civil liberties. That is why we sunset the bill in 4 months, to see if this stop gap approach is working, how it is working, and allow us to gather further information. That is why we require that the court approve international surveillance procedures. That is why we insist on periodic audits. None of these safeguards exist under the current law, and all will serve to protect our precious rights and liberties. 
   The bill before us today responds to each and every concern raised by the distinguished Director of National Intelligence in our negotiations. In particular, yesterday he asked us to make three changes: expanding the bill to cover foreign intelligence; allowing the administration to approve guidelines for recurring communications; and allowing additional foreign targets to be added to the warrant by the court. I was concerned that some of these changes may have gone too far, but in the spirit of accommodation we made all three changes. Sometimes people simply don't want to accept ``yes'' for an answer. 
   I urge every Member in this body to support this important and balanced measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record today's New York Times editorial entitled ``Stampeding Congress, Again.''  
   Stampeding Congress, Again 
   Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration has repeatedly demonstrated that it does not feel bound by the law or the Constitution when it comes to the war on terror. It cannot even be trusted to properly use the enhanced powers it was legally granted after the attacks. 
   Yet, once again, President Bush has been trying to stampede Congress into a completely unnecessary expansion of his power to spy on Americans. And, hard as it is to believe, Congressional Republicans seem bent on collaborating, while Democrats (who can still be cowed by the White House's with-us-or-against-us baiting) aren't doing enough to stop it. 
   The fight is over the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires the government to obtain a warrant before eavesdropping on electronic communications that involve someone in the United States. The test is whether there is probably cause  to believe that the person being communicated with is an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist. 
   Mr. Bush decided after 9/11 that he was no longer going to obey that law. He authorized the National Security Agency to intercept international telephone calls and e-mail messages of Americans and other residents of this country without a court order. He told the public nothing and Congress next to nothing about what he was doing, until The Times disclosed the spying in December 2005. 
   Ever since, the White House has tried to pressure Congress into legalizing Mr. Bush's rogue operation. Most recently, it seized on a secret court ruling that spotlighted a technical way in which the 1978 law has not kept pace with the Internet era. 
   The government may freely monitor communications when both parties are outside the United States, but must get a warrant aimed at a specific person for communications that originate or end in his country. The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that the court that issues such warrants recently ruled that the law also requires that the government seek such an individualized warrant for purely foreign communications that, nevertheless, move through American data networks. 
   Instead of asking Congress to address this anachronism, as it should, the White House sought to use it to destroy the 1978 spying law. It proposed giving the attorney general carte blanche to order eavesdropping on any international telephone calls or e-mail messages if he decided on his own that there was a ``reasonable belief'' that the target of the surveillance was outside the United States. The attorney general's decision would not be subject to court approval or any supervision. 
   The White House, of course, insisted that Congress must do this right away, before the August recess that begins on Monday--the same false urgency it used to manipulate Congress into passing the Patriot Act without reading it and approving the appalling Military Commissions Act of 2006. 
   Senator Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered a sensible alternative law, as did his fellow Democrat, Senator Russ Feingold. In either case, the attorney general would be able to get a broad warrant to intercept foreign communications routed through American networks for a limited period. Then, he would have to justify the spying in court. This fix would have an expiration date so Congress could then dispassionately consider what permanent changes might be needed to FISA. 
   Congress was debating this issue yesterday, and the final outcome was unclear. But there are very clear lines that must not be crossed. 
   First, all electronic surveillance of communication that originates or ends in the United States must be subject to approval and review by the FISA court under the 1978 law. (That court, by the way, has rejected only one warrant in the last two years.) 
   Second, any measure Congress approves now must have a firm expiration date. Closed-door-meetings under the pressure of a looming vacation are no place for such serious business. 
   The administration and its Republican supporters in Congress argue that American intelligence is blinded by FISA and have seized on neatly timed warnings of heightened terrorist activity to scare everyone. It is vital for Americans, especially law-makers, to resist that argument. It is pure propaganda. 
   This is not, and has never been, a debate over whether the United States should conduct effective surveillance of terrorists and their supporters. It is over whether we are a nation ruled by law, or the whims of men in power. Mr. Bush faced that choice and made the wrong one. Congress must not follow him off the cliff.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago the administration unilaterally chose to engage in warrantless surveillance of American citizens without court review. That decision created a legal and political quagmire. To fight terrorism and prevent another 9/11, we need to have an effective and legal system of intelligence gathering. That is what we are here to do today. 
   When that old scheme broke down, the administration then forced Congress to accept an equally flawed statute in August, the Protect America Act. The Protect America Act granted broad, new powers to engage in warrantless searches within the United States, including physical searches of our homes, computers, offices, libraries and medical records. There was a valiant fight against it, but we did not prevail. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I want to acknowledge the great work of the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Silvestre Reyes, for what he did, and on the Judiciary Committee I am quite proud of Jerry Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, and Sheila Jackson-Lee, the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas. Also the chairman of the Crime subcommittee, Bobby Scott of Virginia. 
   The PATRIOT Act granted broad new powers to engage in warrantless searches within the United States. It included, as I said, physical searches of our homes, of our computers, offices, libraries, and even medical records. The law contained no meaningful oversight whatsoever and went around the FISA Court. It should not be made permanent. That is why we are here today with the RESTORE Act, to create a framework for legal surveillance that includes the FISA Court. 
   Careful consideration by the Judiciary and by the Intelligence Committees addresses the need for flexibility in intelligence gathering and delivers the ability to deal with the modern communications networks. More importantly, it is consistent with the rule of law, the Constitution, and our democratic values. 
   Let's be clear about how the RESTORE Act's ``basket'' court orders work. These orders are not individual warrants for Osama bin Laden or other terrorists. They allow surveillance of an entire terrorist group or other foreign power through a flexible court process. This act prohibits reverse targeting to engage in warrantless spying on Americans. In approving the order, the court must also approve the guidelines and procedures that will be used to protect the rights of Americans under the Constitution and under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   When the intelligence community turns its attention to Americans at home, they will have to get a warrant. That isn't just good policy; this is the critically important fourth amendment in action. So RESTORE even brings the court into the emergency provisions. NSA must notify the court when they start emergency acquisition, and they must seek a court order within seven days. This is not a secret process. The court knows when it is started and is awaiting the application. 
   Mr. Speaker, the phone company can't even turn on the switch unless it has a certification from the government that they are actively seeking that court order. If the application is turned down, the surveillance shuts off, unless the court specifically stays their ruling, pending appeal. That appeal must be resolved within 45 days. These emergency authorizations are not a backdoor way to avoid court review. In fact, the court will be looking at the emergency from the very first day. 
   The bill also provides other critical safeguards: periodic audits by the inspector general; narrow scope of authority to security threats, not just anything. It protects privacy of Americans traveling abroad and, most important, sunsets the legislation in December of the year 2009 so that we can review it one more time. 
   Importantly, the bill has no retroactive immunity for telecommunications carriers whatsoever. Why? Because we have been refused the documents to determine whether retroactive immunity has any place or not. Interestingly enough, that was delivered to the Senate. They have the documents. We, begging, pleading, screaming, we don't have the documents. So no retroactive immunity. Until we receive these underlying documents, there is no way we can begin any consideration of that request. So the legislation before us today is a very, very important start-over improving the measure, the Protect America Act, that still exists. 
   Please join with me in a careful consideration of everything in this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Act is a part of the idea of improving the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention Act signed into law by President Bush 3 years ago. It effectuated a comprehensive overhaul of bankruptcy, especially with regards to consumers. These consumer bankruptcy amendments included the establishment of a means testing mechanism to determine a debtor's ability to repay debts. Under this test, a chapter 7 bankruptcy case is presumed to be an abuse if it appears that a debtor has income in excess of certain thresholds. 
   The measure before us today would exempt certain qualifying National Guard members and Reserve members from the means test presumption of abuse. Come to think of it, I would like to exempt some other people as well. 
   But this legislation addresses the issue of fundamental fairness. Those who find themselves in financial difficulty as a result of service in the National Guard or being activated into it or the aftermath of their service, particularly overseas, should not face the additional burden of the means test. 
   Since September 11, 2001, almost one-half million members of the National Guard and Reserves have been called to Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of them have even served multiple tours of duty. And so it is easy to understand that these unanticipated deployments disrupt their lives and their family members and leads to financial hardship. So we are happy for the gentlelady from Chicago, Illinois, Jan Schakowsky, who has included an effort that has attracted our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am very happy to report this from the Judiciary Committee. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I think that this bill might appropriately be renamed the Schakowsky-Rohrabacher provision because of the hard work that our colleague has done on the matter. I appreciate the fully bipartisan spirit that this committee, the Judiciary Committee, had in much evidence when we took this measure up. 
   And I close by asking my friends, the Blue Dogs on this side of the aisle and most of the Republicans, my Republican colleagues on the other side, that we might want to take a look at this means test which presumes you did something wrong if you are broke and in trouble. I mean, it occurs to me that under the economic circumstances we find ourselves in as a nation, anybody could flunk the means test and then be presumed to be irresponsible or not upstanding citizens. Credit ratings would be damaged profusely.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I am so pleased to bring this resolution from the Judiciary Committee to remember the deaths of those three great civil rights workers. And I, of course, begin my comments by thanking and commending our greatest civil rights champion in the House of Representatives, John Lewis of Georgia, who was a leader in the civil rights movement, worked with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, and with Dr. Martin Luther King, and with other civil rights organizations. He was also at the great march on Washington in 1963, and we all met. 
   It was a stirring moment in American history, and these three young men paid with their lives for their dedication to ensure that we could end segregation and secure the right to vote for all people in America. 
   A number of Judiciary Committee members have joined with me as cosponsors of this measure: the gentleman from New York, Jerrold Nadler; Steve Cohen, Tennessee; Bobby Scott of Virginia; Sheila Jackson-Lee, Texas; Adam Schiff, California; Linda S&#225;nchez, California; Betty Sutton, Ohio; and a number of others. 
   You remember the summer of 1964? Goodman, a student at New York's Queens College; James Chaney of Mississippi; Michael Schwerner, 24 years old of New York, were all working with the CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality. And they left the Meridian, Mississippi, office for the town of Philadelphia 25 miles away. They were stopped by the Klan, and the rest is history. 
   We still work against the backdrop of this activity. It was out of their sacrifices that the movement and understanding of not only the citizens of the country but the leaders of the country and Washington understood what we had to accomplish. And we passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Dr. Martin Luther King's inspiring rhetoric kept us together for so, so long, and I'm happy that we're doing what we've done. I'm sure the Senate, the other body, will follow very rapidly. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the committee, I rise to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Ladies and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, although we passed  the constitutional amendment against slavery in 1865, slavery still exists, not just in the world, but in the United States of America. And so we begin an examination of H.R. 3887, commending the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Republicans and Democrats, and commending those members of the House Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats, that have come together today to pass under suspension H.R. 3887. 
   Slavery is a social, ugly circumstance that still controls and guides the destiny of so many people in this country. It is important that the 13th amendment's guarantee of freedom operates, whether it involves forced prostitution, whether it operates in farms or sweat shops, or in domestic service. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you could have heard the powerful testimony that was given by our witnesses on this bill. It shocked me. People were forced to live and work under conditions of fear and terror that was extended to their parents. A young woman, who couldn't even use her real name in the committee, told about the trafficking of human beings inside of America, in the City of Detroit, where this club was using her to commit all kinds of acts and raise huge amounts of money at the same time. As one of the television shows on NBC showed yesterday morning, guess what? There is more money being taken out of prostitution in America than in the drug industry. Drugs come number two to prostitution and involuntary servitude. 
   This is what brings all of us to the floor today. I am very proud of these two committees in the House that are dealing with new enforcement tools to combat modern-day slavery, whether the exploitation is by unscrupulous labor recruiters, by diplomats who abuse their services, or by brutal street pimps who coerce and keep under their domain these women, young women, at that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to just take a moment here to respond to concerns to that an aspect of this bill, that it will somehow federalize prostitution. That is not the case. That is not what we are trying to do. The sex slavery offense, renamed ``aggravated sex trafficking,'' still captures cases of coercion that implicate the 13th amendment. The new ``sex trafficking offenses'' improves the Mann Act to allow prosecution of pimps who affect commerce but don't actually cross State lines. 
   This new tool should not diminish other anti-slavery efforts or the fight against child exploitation. We expect it to be used consistently with the principles of Federal prosecution that defer to local authority as appropriate. We want the States to control the prosecution of this offense.  
   There is no place in today's America for slavery. And for that reason, H.R. 3887 is critically important, because it puts new potency in the Thirteenth Amendment's guarantee of freedom: whether on farms or sweatshops, in domestic service or forced prostitution. 
   In a recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, we heard moving and powerful testimony from a young woman who has further inspired us to work together to bring this bill to the floor, to draw the line against modern slavery. 
   The bravery of that young woman, her story, and her willingness to speak on behalf of all victims of human trafficking, are an example for all of us, and a call to action for us to meet again our Nation's ongoing mission to deliver on the promise of freedom that has been enshrined in our Constitution since the Civil War. 
   The Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude and slavery is as important and basic a civil right today as it was at the time of Emancipation. Its promise of freedom is a sacred trust, written in the suffering of all of those who have been held in bondage. As a country, we owe it to them to never stop fighting for freedom. 
   This bill is named in honor of William Wilberforce, the famous English antislavery legislator of the Nineteenth Century. 
   It will equip our law enforcers with tough new enforcement tools to combat modern slavery, whether the exploitation is by unscrupulous labor recruiters, by diplomats who abuse their servants, or by brutal pimps. 
   It will protect immigrants and U.S. citizens alike within our country, and provide law enforcement training and victim protections overseas as well. 
   I would like to take a minute to respond to concerns that aspects of the bill could somehow ``federalize'' all prostitution and pimping. This is not the case. 
   The servitude offense--which the bill renames ``aggravated sex trafficking''--still captures only those prostitution offenses that implicate a liberty interest under the 13th amendment because they involve coercion. 
   The new ``compelled service'' crime allows more flexibility in proving enslavement. 
   And the crime entitled ``sex trafficking'' improves the Mann Act to allow prosecution of pimps whose activities affect interstate commerce, not just those who actually cross a State line. 
   It is not our intent to redirect resources away from child exploitation, terrorism, or other important law enforcement, or to depart from the principles of federal prosecution that defer to local prosecutions where possible and serve as a ``backstop'' to catch the worst of the worst. 
   This approach maintains the structure and definitions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, and builds upon the good work of the Civil Rights Division and its antitrafficking task forces around the country. As was noted in yesterday's New York Times, these Federal and State task forces are vigorously confronting modern slavery in forced prostitution and forced labor alike. 
   We expect those efforts to continue, and now to intensify with these additional enforcement tools. This bill brings law enforcement officials and service providers together, to punish traffickers and to protect victims and their families. And it provides critical immigration mechanisms to protect children and other vulnerable people. 
   In the 1800s, escaped slaves such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth spoke out against chattel slavery. Their voices, and the voices and efforts of many others, led to a constitutional commitment that everyone in this country would be forevermore free from slavery and involuntary servitude. 
   The young woman who testified before our committee did not allow her enslavement and incarceration to silence her either. She became a voice not only for herself, but for other victims of slavery in its various forms, many of whom remain in bondage. 
   We owe it to her, and to the millions who continue under the oppression of modern slavery and involuntary servitude, to support this bill.

We expect these efforts to continue, and we will monitor them with great scrutiny. 
   In the 1800s, escaped slaves such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, who came out of this brutal experience in America, spoke out against chattel slavery. Their voices and the voices of many others led to a constitutional commitment that everyone in this country would be forevermore free from bondage. 
   The young lady who testified with an assumed name before the Judiciary Committee did not allow her suffering to silence her. And neither will our voices be silenced. We urge that this bill pass, hopefully unanimously, from the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2237, the legislation offered by Mr. McGovern that would provide for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq. 
   H.R. 2237 would significantly reduce the U.S. military presence in Iraq over a 9-month period. It requires that the Department of Defense begin redeployment of armed forces and military contractors no later than 90 days after the date of enactment, allowing the Department the time necessary to plan, prepare and execute the process of drawing down troops. The redeployment would be completed within 6 months, at which point further funding for an increased presence in Iraq would be prohibited. 
   H.R. 2237 respects the decision-making powers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. military commanders in the field. It specifically leaves decisions about where U.S. troops should be redeployed in the hands of the Pentagon. Troops drawn down from Iraq may be redeployed to neighboring countries, to Afghanistan, to other U.S. bases abroad, or back to the United States in support of homeland security and other national needs. 
   This legislation also recognizes and respects Iraqi sovereignty by ensuring that the present conflict will not provide for the establishment of permanent American military bases in Iraq. H.R. 2237 provides for the orderly transfer of bases and facilities constructed or occupied by the U.S. military to Iraqi control. Nothing in this bill precludes the United States from negotiating base rights or shared use in the future, as is our practice with other sovereign nations. 
   H.R. 2237 provides strong support for the Iraqi people by continuing assistance for social, political and diplomatic reconstruction. Additionally, aid is permitted, at the request of the Iraqi government, for assistance or equipment to the Iraqi Security Forces or multinational forces providing security or training in Iraq. U.S. military forces would be authorized to remain in Iraq to complete the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, pursue foreign terrorist networks operating inside Iraq, and provide protection to U.S. citizens and embassy and diplomatic personnel. 
   Recent news reports indicate that two days ago, a majority of Iraqi parliamentarians signed a petition calling on the United States to establish a timeline for our military to withdraw from their country. Poll after poll indicates that a large majority of Iraqis believe the large-scale presence of U.S. military forces inside Iraq is fueling, rather than abating, both the Iraqi insurgency and an increasing presence of foreign jihadists. Reducing our footprint in Iraq provides that country, its neighbors, and the international community with a new opportunity and a new environment in which to pursue reconciliation and a political solution to the violence currently devastating Iraqi society. 
   I applaud Speaker Pelosi for allowing this bill to come to the floor, and join with members of the Out of Iraq and Progressive Caucuses in supporting it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2206, the U.S. Troops Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007. The revised Iraq Accountability Act supports our troops while holding President Bush and the Iraqi Government accountable. 
   After vetoing the April supplemental bill that was supported by a majority of the American people, President Bush is once more asking for a blank check to continue his escalation of our military involvement in Iraq. Once again, the President has chosen confrontation over cooperation by threatening to veto the bill we are considering today. After a meeting during which lawmakers from his own party told him he had lost the confidence of the American people, the President issued a statement claiming to support ``benchmarks'' for progress in Iraq. But, unlike congressional Republicans, the President will not support consequences for failure to meet those benchmarks. It should be obvious to all that benchmarks without consequences are nothing but meaningless window dressing. 
   This Congress will not provide the President the blank check that he has requested. In last November's election, the American people demanded a new direction in Iraq, and we will continue to fight to responsibly wind down this war. Our revised bill will fully fund the troops, honor our commitment to veterans, hold the Iraqi Government accountable, and continue to press the President to change course and stop the bloodshed in Iraq. It also provides funding for urgent domestic needs that are emergencies in their own right and appropriate to include in this emergency supplemental legislation. These include a minimum wage/small business tax relief package, $6.8 billion for Hurricane Katrina recovery, $3.5 billion more  than the President's request, $400 million for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and $396 million for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP. 
   I voted earlier today in favor of Congressman MCGOVERN's bill providing for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and American defense contractors from Iraq. That measure was defeated, but attracted far more support than many observers had predicted, indicating a growing momentum inside Congress for redeployment. I remain confident that as the tragedy in Iraq wears on, even more Members of Congress will join in demanding withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and prohibiting the further use of funds to continue President Bush's war. In the meantime, however, I will join with my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus to send the President a supplemental funding bill that demands accountability and guarantees further congressional consideration of war funding in just a few short months. 
   H.R. 2206 fully funds the troops over the next 2 to 3 months, ensuring that they have everything they need to conduct their mission. The bill also includes additional funding for the troops not requested by the President, including increased funding for military health care and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, vehicles in Iraq. It includes funds to improve military readiness as well as $1.8 billion to meet our veterans' health care needs. 
   The bill would fence off $52.8 billion of the $95.5 billion provided to the Defense Department until it is released by subsequent legislation. It requires the President to submit a report to Congress by July 13 of this year regarding the success of the Iraqi Government in meeting key security and political benchmarks. Within 7 legislative days of receipt of the report, Congress would have the opportunity to evaluate the situation in Iraq and vote on whether or not to continue to fund the war. Expedited procedures are included in the bill to guarantee that this vote will take place in both the House and Senate by the end of July. 
   I would have preferred not to be taking this vote today, but the President has brought us to this point with his stubborn refusal to accept the will of the American people. I will continue to support any Iraq-related legislation that holds the President's feet to the fire. The inferno raging in Iraq is one of his own making, and he should be forced to feel the heat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin the debate on this measure by yielding myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this past Monday on April 16, Emancipation Day, District of Columbia residents and others gathered by the thousands at Freedom Plaza and marched to the Capitol, calling on Congress to ``demand the vote.'' 
   On that day in 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, freeing approximately 3,100 men, women and children who were held in bondage. That was several months before, of course, President Lincoln's issue of the Emancipation Proclamation on New Year's Day, 1863. 
   I stand before my colleagues in the House today and cannot help but note that the District of Columbia was the starting point for the Emancipation President, as he was called, but it still does not have the full voting franchise that is at the heart of U.S. citizenship. This hardly seems right, and we have come today, assembled again to correct this. 
   Monday's marchers sent a message to Congress: District residents have had enough of ``taxation without representation.'' That is a message that all Americans and all students of American history should understand. District residents just want what Americans elsewhere enjoy: a full share in American democracy. 
   This simple but compelling message has reached Congress, and today we are acting on it. Today we will do our part to correct a 200-year-old injustice. We have a constitutionally sound, bipartisan, politically balanced response that will give, at last, citizens of the District of Columbia full representation in the House. 
   The United States is the only democracy in the world, ladies and gentlemen, where citizens living in the capital city are denied representation in their legislature. Almost 600,000 people who call the District of Columbia home, who pay taxes, go off to war, and observe the other responsibilities of citizenship still do not have a vote in the Congress. 
   At Monday's march, we heard from a District of Columbia veteran who was one of the first soldiers sent to Iraq in March, 2003, and as a dual citizen of the United States and Iraq, he can participate fully in the Iraqi democratic process which includes electing voting members of the Iraqi National Legislature, but as a resident of the District of Columbia, his rights as a U.S. citizen are limited. 
   Well, his day has come, as well as for that of all of the citizens of this great District of Columbia. I hope that we can move this debate through as efficiently and as effectively as possible, and move toward a finish of a job that we have undertaken in more than one Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time remaining on our side. 
   I begin by commending my colleagues in the Congress on the debate that has occurred today. It has been civil, it has been honest, and the disagreements, both constitutionally and otherwise, have been very clearly spread upon the record. 
   And why is that so? Well, because we had the same debate 27 days ago. That is why. We have all been through this for every argument, for every constitutional expert opinion that is regularly volunteered. 
   And, look, I have articulated my belief that a measure that we are debating is unconstitutional as frequently as anybody on the other side. I don't know what our collective batting averages of being accurate are, but that is for the courts to decide, and I think that we all agree to that. 
   The District of Columbia residents want no more than what the Founding Fathers wanted. And, by the way, for those who wonder why we didn't make them a State right off the bat, at that time there may have been 150 people living in this swampy area that is now known as D.C. We didn't have anybody to make citizens. 
   So join me, join us in this historic moment and pass the bill. It is high time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to commend my friend from Texas (Mr. Smith). His arguments are cogent and our relationship on the committee is excellent. 
   But I must comment as to the argument that our bill allows the District of Columbia to have both a Representative and a Delegate. We fully intend to  repeal the Delegate part of it by separate statute as soon as we get the bill that will allow the District to have a Representative. 
   We have had lots of debate, and he has quoted Professor Turley, who has made the most extreme statement, his personal beliefs. And we invited him as a panelist, but he has been profoundly in the minority on a number of other issues as well. So I do not regard his opinion as having any more or less importance or significance than any of the other constitutional experts that we heard. 
   Now, here is the problem. We would, if this motion to recommit were passed, provide for two things: expedited review of this matter and standing to all Members of Congress to challenge the constitutionality of the bill before us. Four hundred thirty-five Members would be granted standing. Why? Are there not enough constitutional lawyers and supporters and opponents on both sides to take care of this matter, rather than to have the Supreme Court filled with Members of Congress wanting to vent probably very repetitious views? 
   This is a motion based on an amendment which has been debated and defeated in the Judiciary Committee when we considered an earlier version of this bill only weeks ago. 
   Now, I recognize and appreciate that the motion is being offered in good faith to amend the bill. However, as I have stated before, it is my concern that this recommit motion will do far more harm than it could ever cause good. 
   I am concerned that the motion puts Congress down on record as believing that the bill is constitutionally weak. It is not, and therefore, I cannot support a motion to recommit that would make this concession. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   We have had hearings on top of hearings from everyone who claimed to be a constitutional expert on this subject anywhere in the Judiciary Committee. We have heard from everybody on both sides of the aisle over the last several Congresses, and based on the record, there is ample precedent for the Congress, using the District clause as authority for this legislation as they have for taxes, for diversity, for labor and numerous other matters. Clearly, this bill falls within the general line of authority. 
   Now, concerning expedited judicial review in this motion, the courts are perfectly capable of handling the issue. There are judicial standards for dealing with expedited review, namely, when there is a showing of irreparable harm. Nobody has mentioned that as a reason for having expedited review. Irreparable harm coming and giving the Delegate of this District the right to vote? We have statutes on the books that cover this very issue already. 
   We did not provide expedited review of such controversial laws as the PATRIOT Act, parts of which have actually been held, subsequently, unconstitutional. Yet, the issue was readily dealt with by the courts. 
   The courts will readily deal with this issue as well. And I am strongly opposed to the idea of Congress passing laws that confer unique standing on themselves or special rights to intervene in pending lawsuits. 
   You can always become amicus curiae, and so for those reasons and others, I urge that this motion to recommit be turned down.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 281 celebrates the birth of Abraham Lincoln and recognizes the prominence the Declaration of Independence played in the development of his beliefs. 
   I am honored and pleased to stand with my friends in the Illinois delegation as we honor our 16th President on his 199th birthday and kick off the nationwide bicentennial celebration of his birth. 
   Abraham Lincoln has achieved universal recognition as one of the greatest Presidents in American history. Today we recognize the life and legacy of the man who had the moral courage and political acumen to end the abominable practice of slavery in America and to save an imperiled Union from secession and civil war. 
   We also emphasize the prominent role the Declaration of Independence played in President Lincoln's political philosophy. President Lincoln often cited the Declaration of Independence as a basis for his opposition to slavery and as his inspiration for saving the Union. On his inaugural journey to Washington, President Lincoln stopped in Philadelphia at the site where the Declaration of Independence had been signed and declared, ``I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.'' In the Gettysburg Address, he defined the end of the war as a rededication to the ideals of that founding document. 
   H. Con. Res. 281 calls upon the President to issue an annual proclamation recognizing  the anniversary of the birth of our 16th President. It recognizes the activities of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which initiates two years of commemorations beginning on February 12, 2008. It also encourages local governments and schools to spend sufficient time studying President Lincoln and his devotion to the Declaration of Independence.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (COMMEMORATING THE COURAGE OF THE HAITIAN SOLDIERS THAT FOUGHT FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE IN THE ``SIEGE OF SAVANNAH'' -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H. Res. 909 ``Commemorating the Courage of the Haitian Soldiers That Fought for American Independence in the Siege of Savannah and for Haiti's Independence and Renunciation of Slavery.'' 
   This resolution highlights the heroism displayed by 900 Haitian soldiers in Savannah during the American Revolutionary War and is a source of great inspiration and pride for all Haitians. I am not surprised by the indomitable spirit of these Haitian soldiers who so courageously defended America's fight for independence. 
   On October 9, 1779, the soldiers of Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint Domingue, Haiti, served as the largest unit of soldiers of African descent to fight in the Siege of Savannah alongside American and French forces. The monument in Savannah serves as a tribute to the hundreds of Haitian volunteers who took great risk and traveled by sea to fight for American freedom during the Revolutionary War. Today, I heartily applaud the Haitian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for our country.  
   MR. FALEOMAVAEGA. I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (COURT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, our Nation's judiciary has been the repeated targets of death threats and sometimes even violent acts. In 2005, for example, the family members of a Federal judge in Chicago were murdered. Two weeks later, a State judge, court reporter, and a sheriff's deputy were killed in an Atlanta courthouse. And so it is these acts of violence in the judiciary that bring us together. 
   Along with others, we have begun on the Judiciary Committee to realize the need for legislation that will perhaps try to deal more effectively with these concerns of safety in the courts. So I am pleased that the gentleman from Virginia, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, BOBBY SCOTT; and Judge LOUIE GOHMERT of Texas, a distinguished member of the committee, have joined with me in this effort. 
   What we seek to do is improve the security for court officers and the safeguards of judges and their families. We achieve this objective by making several revisions in the current law. 
   First, we make the current redaction authority of Federal judges under the Ethics and Government Act permanent. What this provision will do is prevent would-be aggrieved litigants and others who might use a Federal judge's personal information to determine how they might threaten him or her or a family member of the court. 
   Another thing we do in this legislation is authorize an additional $120 million for the United States Marshals Service over the course of the next 6 years. These monies will enable the service to increase ongoing investigations and expand protective services that are currently provided to the Federal judiciary. This is a long overdue item, and we were glad that we reached authorizing agreement on it. 
   The bill also makes it a Federal offense to publish the personal information of a judge, law enforcement officer, or witness with the intent to cause some act of intimidation or harassment, or to commit a crime of violence. This measure authorizes $100 million over the course of the next 5 fiscal years to create and expand the witness protection programs to assist witnesses and victims of crime. 
   It has taken a couple years to put these various pieces together in the bill, and we think that time for its passage is immediate, if not overdue, and I urge my colleagues to give favorable consideration to this very commonsense proposal. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (INTERSTATE RECOGNITION OF NOTARIZATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, this measure is a commonsense requirement with respect to the process of notarizing documents that occur in every State, every city, every county. And what we do in H.R. 1979 is simply to require Federal and State courts to recognize documents lawfully notarized in any State of the Union when interstate commerce is, in fact, involved. 
   As we all know, notary publics play a critical role in ensuring that the signer of a document is, indeed, who he or she claims to be and that the person has willingly and without coercion signed the document. By performing these two tasks, the notary public serves as an indispensable first line of defense against fraudulent acts and other manipulations of contracts and other documents.  
   Although the purpose of notarizations is the same across our Nation, each State has, in the course of time, established its own laws governing the recognition of notarized documents. And some things are required in some places, and other things are required in others. And so the lack of consistent technical rules and the resultant formalities make it unnecessarily difficult for courts to recognize out-of-State notarizations. Some places impose certain technical requirements, such as dictating that the ink seals must be used, while others require embossers. Some States demand very particular language in the acknowledgment certificate and will, accordingly, reject out-of-State notarizations that lack the same language that they require in their State. And there are many other little details that create snafus, create problems in accepting documents that have been notarized and may be different in some small technical way. These inconsistencies, of course, do not further the goals of notarization. In fact, this problem has led to the bill that we have before us. And I'm very pleased to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt) and Mr. ARTUR DAVIS, also of Alabama, Mr. Braley of Iowa, who have all together introduced this measure. And so what we're seeing here is that we propose to grant relief to these kinds of snafus that occur in accepting out-of-State notarizations. 
   H.R. 1979 is supported by the National Notary Association, countless numbers of notary publics in many States, the academics that follow this arcane area of the law, and we think that they are correct, that we're making an important revision in how notarized documents are recognized by the courts, all courts. And it's in that spirit that I introduce or urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1979. 
   I'll reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, for reasons enumerated elsewhere, I strongly support this bill. It is essential that Congress take this prudent step to provide a short-term bridge loan to help preserve a viable domestic auto industry, and its far-reaching contributions to the overall long-term health of our economy, while appropriately safeguarding the interests of American taxpayers. 
   The bill we are considering today contains a provision creating a limited antitrust exemption for certain consultations in which a U.S. automaker may be asked to engage with its employees, dealers, suppliers, and other creditors for the purpose of reaching agreement on a restructuring plan for the automaker under the bill. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I would like to emphasize a few points regarding that provision. 
   The antitrust laws are the fundamental legal protector of our free market system--the Supreme Court has aptly referred to them as the Magna Carta of the free enterprise system. Exemptions from the antitrust laws can be very harmful and destructive of the basic economic freedom we cherish as Americans. 
   For that reason, any proposed antitrust exemption should be very carefully considered as to its need. And even if a need can be clearly demonstrated, the exemption should be carefully focused and of limited duration. 
   In keeping with those considerations, this exemption is temporary and very focused. It is designed to give greater assurance to the various ``interested parties''--the employees, retirees, dealers, suppliers, shareholders, and creditors of a U.S. automaker covered by this bill, listed in section 6(a)(1)(B)--who will be consulting and negotiating with the automaker in an effort to reach agreement on a long-term restructuring plan for the automaker pursuant to the bill. 
   Some of these interested parties are reportedly uncertain as to how their participation in these consultations might raise issues under the antitrust laws. With the urgent need to move quickly on this legislation, it has not been possible to sit down with them and understand the precise nature of their concerns. Based on similar concerns that are raised from time to time in various quarters, the concerns may well be misplaced, reflecting a lack of understanding about the antitrust laws, which prohibit only conduct that harms competition, permitting the wide range of conduct that does not harm competition. 
   While these concerns may be misplaced, however, they appear to be genuine and held in good faith, and could therefore have the effect of discouraging the kinds of participation that is needed from all interested parties in order to enable the restructuring plans to succeed. To help avert this risk, this antitrust exemption has been carefully crafted to provide sufficient reassurance and guidance to interested parties, while avoiding the risk of shielding truly anticompetitive conduct from effective antitrust enforcement. 
   First, the limited exemption covers only the discussions, consultations, and meetings among an eligible auto manufacturer and its own interested parties. It does not cover joint activity among two or more automakers, which could create more risk of harm to competition. It also does not cover action taking place outside those discussions, consultations, and meetings. 
   Second, the limited exemption fully preserves the authority of the Federal antitrust agencies to bring enforcement action for injunctive relief to stop anticompetitive conduct should it occur. Merger enforcement authority is also preserved. 
   Similarly, the so-called ``per se'' offenses, such as price fixing, market allocation, and boycott, remain fully subject to antitrust enforcement. These are not kinds of conduct that someone innocently stumbles into. They are intentional schemes to subvert competition, and can be extremely harmful to the free market system and the economy. 
   Third, in the event that the discussions, consultations, and meetings continue for an extended period, the exemption sunsets after 3 years. In all likelihood, the exemption will quickly prove unnecessary. If not, and if the negotiations are still ongoing as the end of the 3-year period approaches, Congress can always consider extending the sunset if the exemption is truly warranted. The sunset is consistent with the recommendation of the Antitrust Modernization Commission that any antitrust exemption should be temporary. 
   Finally, in order to encourage whatever further guidance may be appropriate, the provision requires that, to the extent practicable, the Federal antitrust enforcement agencies be given reasonable advance notice of any discussion, consultation, or meeting covered by the provision, and the opportunity to participate. 
   As carefully crafted, this provision should provide whatever guidance and reassurance the interested parties may need that their good-faith efforts to cooperate in achieving the bill's important objectives for this important bedrock American industry will not inadvertently create antitrust problems, while at the same time taking appropriate care not to inadvertently immunize truly anticompetitive conduct that could severely harm the long-term health of this industry, the many economic sectors it touches, and the American economy itself.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7321. With this vote today, the Congress is acting decisively to protect American auto workers and dealers in every Congressional district in the country and sets Detroit on the path to near-term and long-term economic viability. 
   We cannot forget that the auto industry is the backbone of our domestic manufacturing sector--the very sector which drives our economy. Additionally, should one or more of the Big Three automakers fail, it would mean the loss of more than 100,000 jobs directly associated with the industry in my home state of Michigan and more than 3 million jobs around the country indirectly associated with the industry, such as auto dealers and auto part suppliers. 
   At the same time, I and my fellow Members in the Congress are wary of bailing out or rewarding companies that have so often pursued their own interests at the expense of the public good. Whether it was fighting to undermine more demanding fuel efficiency standards or dragging their feel when it came to developing electric car and hybrid technology, the Big 3 are in a large way responsible for the predicament they find themselves in today. 
   Now, the executives of Big 3 have come to Capitol Hill, not as titans of industry, but as caretakers of uncompetitive behemoths on the verge of collapse. They are in no position to make demands of the American people and the aid offered by the Congress today reflects that reality. 
   I believe that the aid package offered to the Big 3 here today extracts real, tangible, expansive reforms from the industry. With this bill we are sending a clear message to Detroit: If you are to survive, you must dramatically alter your business models, slim your corporate structure, spin off unprofitable lines, invest in the technologies of the future, and, above all else, cease producing the gas-guzzling steel chariots of the past. There is no alternative to these reforms. This bridge loan will only work if it truly serves as a bridge to the future and not as a cushion slowing inevitable decline. 
   Over the last month, there has been much discussion about the need for a strong central figure to oversee the dramatic changes being undertaken by the auto industry. I called for the creation of such a position and I am heartened to see that an auto czar-type position is established with this legislation. 
   If Detroit does its part, the Congress can and will do much to make the American auto industry the world and industry leader it once was. The $25 billion authorized in the 2007 Energy Bill and appropriated by the Congress to retrofit the Big 3's aging factories was a step in the right direction. It was my hope that this money would be left untouched during the current debate, so that it could continue to further the original purposes the Congress intended. I remain hopeful that the $15 billion appropriated for the auto companies in this Act will be refunded when we return in January with a larger Democratic majority and a change-minded new President. 
   Let me be clear--this bill is far from perfect. I would have preferred that a provision that mandates that bridge loan recipients withdraw from their suit against California's higher tailpipe emission standards remain in the bill. Stripping this provision will accomplish little. As my colleagues in the upper body, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Bill Nelson of Florida, have noted, GM and Ford have laid out business plans indicating that they intend to outperform the California fuel economy standards within a few years anyway. The fact that blocking these suits would have absolutely no effect on the Big 3's bottom lines makes these taxpayer subsidized lawsuits even more outrageous. 
   I also think we must acknowledge the failures in leadership which have contributed to the dire straits the Big 3 find themselves in at this time. The New York Times and others have called for the resignation of the Big 3's CEOs, citing their complicity in the current crisis and their lack of foresight and competitive instincts. I support this call because even now, there is tremendous evidence that the leadership of the Big 3 just doesn't get it. 
   Just today, in an interview on Fox News Channel, GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz stated that Americans want more sports utility vehicles and large pickup trucks and that small vehicles are a bad investment. 
   I strongly encourage the ``Auto Czar,'' or ``President's Designee'' as it is referred to in this legislation, to push for the removal of any and all executives at the Big 3 who stand in the way of a greener, more fuel efficient auto industry. 
   Finally, it should not go unnoticed that during the final legislative debate overseen by the 43rd President of the United States, the current Administration chose to fight tooth and nail against strong measures aimed at furthering the fight against global warming and promoting energy independence. We are only here today because Treasury Secretary Paulson could find $300 billion to invest in Wall Street financiers who manipulated securities and other financial tools for a living, but couldn't find $15 billion to help working men and women who create products made and consumed here in the United States of America. Instead of gracefully acknowledging the will of the American people, this lame duck President yet again fought against progress. It is a fitting reminder of the politics that we leave behind with this vote today and, hopefully, of the brighter days that await us. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the middle class is the economic backbone of America. But they are increasingly under pressure due to rising costs in housing, healthcare, and education. To make matters worse, the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, will reach a significant percentage of them this coming fiscal year. The Congress needs to act. Today, we will vote on H.R. 3996, the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007, which would ensure that no additional taxpayers pay the AMT this year while also extending popular tax credits and deductions that expire at the end of the year. 
   The Congress created the AMT in 1969 to ensure that the wealthiest were not finding loopholes in the tax code and thus avoiding paying any taxes at all. However, because the AMT was not adjusted for inflation and the tax itself has significantly grown in recent years, it will affect a large percentage of the middle class. Unless the bill is enacted, 23 million middle income Americans, who were never intended to be subjected to this tax, will be taxed at a higher rate than before. 
   I am pleased to support my friend, Representative Charles Rangel, who wrote this revenue neutral bill. H.R. 3996 will extend and expand many popular tax credits and deductions such as the mortgage insurance deduction, the child tax credit, small business investment write-offs, a deduction for teachers who use their own money to buy classroom materials, and the additional property tax deduction, which will benefit at least 30 million Americans. Furthermore, it will exclude phantom income deduction from discharged home mortgages, and will also prevent the Internal Revenue Service from entering into private debt collection contracts. 
   Of course, any large tax reform necessarily entails some hard choices. Recent economic growth has been enjoyed disproportionately by the top one percent of Americans, who also continue to benefit from loopholes in the tax code. This bill will take a step towards ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share by increasing taxes on private equity managers, who actually pay lower taxes on carried interest, and on multinational corporations who offshore their businesses for the express purpose of tax avoidance. 
   It is simply unfair for 23 million hard-working middle income Americans to pay additional taxes while many wealthy private equity and hedge fund managers enjoy a much lower rate of taxation. H.R. 3996, restores America's tradition of progressive taxation. What we are doing here today is a fair and reasonable tax increase on the highest income earners in the country, who can easily afford it, to benefit millions of working families.

Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1285, I call up the bill (H.R. 6304) to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. 
   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the House, several months ago on October 16, 2007, to be exact, the House passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act legislation, known as the RESTORE Act. In the view of this Member, the RESTORE Act was a reasonable and balanced one giving the administration the power it needs to combat terrorism while protecting our precious rights and liberties. 
   The legislation before us today, which I concede includes significant improvements over the Senate legislation, goes beyond what I think was a reasonable bottom line in the form of the RESTORE Act. 
   Title I of the bill continues the House approach by providing mechanisms to ensure that FISA's longstanding exclusivity is crystal clear. It states only a new statute directly addressing the executive branch's foreign intelligence surveillance authority can modify FISA. Secondly, it provides sunshine by requiring that the government requests to private parties for surveillance assistance must actually cite the statutory authority under which they're issued. 
   Now in earlier versions of FISA reform, the administration claimed that prior court approval of procedures for overseas surveillance would hurt national security. This matter is now laid to rest with the consensus that upfront court review is indeed appropriate. The requirement for individual warrants and probable cause determinations for Americans overseas is an improvement over even the original FISA legislation. There is a provision in the legislation that permits the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to begin surveillance prior to seeking court approval for the necessary procedures in exigent circumstances. This is intended to be used rarely, if at all, and was included upon assurances from the administration that agrees that it shall not be used routinely. 
   The measure before us further requires extensive oversight by Congress and the independent Inspectors General to prevent abuse. It mandates guidelines for targeting minimization and to prevent reverse targeting and tasks the Inspector General to monitor compliance with those protections. 
   Now title II of the legislation concerning telecom liability raises the most serious concerns in my view. In the past, I have said I would be open to developing a set of procedures that allow both plaintiffs and defendants to make their case. Unfortunately, this bill goes well beyond that and changes the substantive standard for legal liability by the telecom community, by the telecom companies and does so on a retroactive basis, retroactive immunity. And so I appreciate that the final bill does not send the matter to a new secret court and does grant the court a meaningful role in the determination. Unfortunately, these improvements do not redeem the overall provision. 
   Title III of the bill will also ask the Inspector General to conduct independent investigations into the President's warrantless wiretapping program. This inquiry will help uncover the truth for the American people, hopefully, about the President's activities. And then there is a part in here about an emergency provision any U.S. citizen can be wiretapped. And I strenuously object to that.  
   Six years ago, the Administration unilaterally chose to engage in warrantless surveillance of American citizens without court review. We are now restoring the balance through enhanced Congressional oversight, Inspector General investigations, and procedures to ensure that FISA remains the exclusive means for authorizing electronic surveillance. 
   This bill continues the House approach by providing mechanisms to ensure that FISA's longstanding exclusivity is crystal clear. First, it states that only a new statute directly addressing the executive branch's foreign intelligence surveillance authority can modify FISA. Secondly, it provides sunshine by requiring requests for assistance to cite the statutory authority under which they are issued. A conforming amendment to Title 18 Section 2511(2)(a) is meant to underscore the need to specify the specific statutory language being relied on, and must be read in conjunction with the entirety of Sec. 102 of the legislation. It should not be read to imply that assistance may be sought for electronic surveillance, as defined in the statute, which is not specifically authorized by statute. 
   In earlier versions of FISA reform, the Administration claimed that prior court approval of procedures for overseas surveillance would hurt national security. This matter is now laid to rest, with a consensus that up-front court review is in fact appropriate. The requirement for individual warrants and probable cause determinations for Americans overseas is an improvement over even the original FISA legislation. 
   There is a provision in the legislation that permits the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence to begin a surveillance prior to seeking court approval for the necessary procedures in ``exigent circumstances.'' This is intended to be used rarely, if at all. In the normal course of events the DNI will have ample time to submit such procedures to the FISA court for its approval before initiating a particular surveillance. 
   The Congress provided this authority at the request of the DNI to meet unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances, and the Administration agrees that it may not be used routinely. The Administration understands that the Congress expects its use to be very rare if it is used at all.  
   The oversight committees will be informed of any use of the exigent circumstances provision and are committed to effective oversight to insure that it is not used to avoid the requirement to secure court approval of the procedures in advance in all but the most extreme circumstances. The exception must not swallow the rule. 
   The bill requires extensive oversight by Congress and the independent Inspectors General to prevent abuse. It mandates guidelines for targeting, minimization, and to prevent reverse targeting, and tasks the Inspectors General to monitor compliance with those protections. 
   ``Reverse targeting'' is specifically prohibited in Section 702(b)(2). The Intelligence Community agrees that this language prohibits the targeting of one or more persons overseas for the purpose of acquiring the communications of a specific is person reasonably believed to be in the United States. Thus, Section 702(f) requires the government to adopt guidelines to insure that this abuse does not occur and the FISA court must review and approve these guidelines and assure that they are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. The oversight committees of the Congress intend to conduct rigorous oversight to insure that these provisions are faithfully observed. In this connection the Committee attaches particular importance to the required annual review and the reporting in that review of the number of disseminated reports which contain a reference to the identity of a US person. 
   There is currently ongoing multi-District litigation in which a federal District Court is conducting a review of the telecom carriers' activities and the lawfulness of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. This bill does not strip jurisdiction on that Court and provide blanket immunity, as many wanted. 
   Instead, in cases where the program was actually designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack, the Court will assess an Attorney General certification that can assert--among other reasons for dismissal--that the carriers got certain requests and directives from the Administration. The Court will look to see if the 
   Attorney General's certification is backed up with substantial evidence. That means not only the underlying directives and requests, but supplemental materials as well. And in cases where the Government claims that the company did not provide the alleged assistance, a bald assertion is not ``substantial evidence''--the Government will have to back up its claims to the Court's satisfaction. 
   That Title II of this bill provides procedures for assessing lawsuits relating to warrantless surveillance since 9/11 does not imply that such surveillance was lawful or that the Congress as a whole believes that the service providers acted lawfully in providing assistance. Nor can the provision remove the power of the courts hearing the cases to determine if this provision is constitutional. 
   No company or private citizen asked by the executive branch to provide assistance in securing the private information of Americans without authority of law should read this language as implying that Congress will act in the future to provide such a grounds for dismissing a lawsuit. On the contrary, companies should be on notice that the Congress is very reluctantly providing this defense as a one-time action in an extremely unusual circumstance. It expects private citizens and companies to provide assistance only when specifically authorized by law. 
   For over 30 years we have mandated that telecommunications carriers not be a merely unquestioning partner to surveillance activities. This bill provides many ways for the companies to question or challenge directives or requests for assistance, and we expect these to be used any time there is something unusual or novel being requested. 
   Today's compromise will give the District Court direction and procedures for handling the pending lawsuits. However, it is important to note that the question of whether FISA's existing security procedures at 50 U.S.C. 1806(f) preempt the state secrets privilege is still being litigated in the courts in a case against the Government. Nothing in this bill is intended to affect that litigation, or any litigation against the Government or Government employees. 
   Today's vote is not the end of the matter. The bill provides for a 4-year sunset, but this doesn't mean we cannot or should not revisit these issues in the next congressional session. We will conduct vigorous oversight, and will be monitoring the program through the reports and audits. We will be keeping a close eye on the development and implementation of reverse targeting, minimization, and targeting procedures, in order to not only make sure that they are followed, but to inform us as we consider what improvements need to be made to this legislation.  
   On that note, I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, today the House votes yet again on legislation that never should have been a subject of controversy: a bill that provides health care for our Nation's children. When we debated overriding the President's veto of the original SCHIP bill last week, most House Republicans offered excuses for denying children health care based on a series of misrepresentations and distortions of the facts. Today the bill's opponents have no more excuses to hide behind. We have consulted with Republicans who want to support this bill and have amended it to address their concerns. It should now be clear to all that the real reason some continue to oppose SCHIP is because they oppose universal health care for all Americans. 
   Republicans voting no on last week's veto override offered four reasons for their unwillingness to support health coverage for America's children. These concerns had, in fact, already been addressed in the original bill, but now we have dealt with them even more explicitly. 
   Republicans argued that the bill did not focus enough on covering poor children. I find this particular objection rather ironic, since the same Republicans who used this argument rarely support legislation designed to help the poor. But, it is not surprising that they would use disingenuous tactics to block health care for children. For them, anything goes when it comes to stopping Americans from getting the radical idea that the government should guarantee this basic human right. This revised bill addresses those arguments by mandating that SCHIP eligibility will be capped at families earning 300 percent of the federal poverty level, around $60,000 for a family of four, and by offering bonus payments to States for enrolling the lowest income children into Medicaid. 
   Opponents of health care for children contended that the original bill provided coverage to illegal immigrants. In reality, this bill denied coverage to all immigrants, even legal ones, explicitly stating that illegal immigrants were ineligible. But these facts did not hinder the Republicans from making their false claim. We have now clarified our intent that illegal immigrants will not be covered by requiring that applicants for SCHIP provide their Social Security number, which must be verified by the Social Security Administration. 
   Republicans opposed the original bill because it allowed States to use the funding to cover adults. For them, a person's right to health care ends at age 18. I would disagree, but in 
   any case this bill now phases out any adults covered under SCHIP over a 1-year period, instead of the 2-year period under the original bill. 
   Finally, further changes have been made to clarify that this legislation is designed to minimize children moving from private insurance to SCHIP, also known as ``crowd-out.'' I am a critic of private health insurance, with its costly and unnecessary administrative, waste, advertising and profits, but this bill should allay any concern that a government health plan, with its much lower overhead costs and more comprehensive coverage, would diminish the role of private insurance companies. We will actually allow States to subsidize people to buy private coverage under this bill to prevent them from moving to government coverage. 
   The President and his supporters are now left with only one argument for opposing this bill: that it costs too much. The original House-passed version authorized an additional $50 billion for SCHIP over 5 years; our compromise with the Senate brought the total down to $35 billion. This additional funding will ensure that SCHIP will cover 10 million children who otherwise would not have access to health care. The President began this debate by offering to add only $5 billion, which would have resulted in 800,000 children currently covered by SCHIP losing their coverage. He is now saying that he's willing to go to up to $20 billion, but no more. I would like the President to explain to the American people how he can afford $12 billion for a single month in Iraq but can't seem to find $35 billion over 5 years to give our children health care. Supporters of the contention that we can't afford this bill either care more about war than children, or are simply not serious. 
   Now that the Republicans' stated reasons for opposing this legislation have been addressed, one wonders what is actually motivating those who will continue to vote no. I believe that the President and his supporters continue to oppose this legislation because they are afraid. They are afraid of SCHIP because it demonstrates that health care guaranteed by the government is workable, it is affordable, and it is popular. They worry that if SCHIP is expanded, even more Americans will begin to demand that the government guarantee health care to all our citizens, not just to poor children. After all, every other industrialized nation does so, while spending less than we do and while achieving better health outcomes for its citizens. These Republicans apparently intend to use every means at their disposal to ensure that health care in this country remains a privilege for those who can afford it, rather than a right guaranteed to all. 
   Madam Speaker, today's vote raises a moral question. Simply put: will we, as a nation, take responsibility for ensuring that our children have the health care they need? Any other issue raised in this debate, particularly given the revisions to the bill, is an obfuscation meant to hide the fact that the party claiming the mantle of ``family values'' is in fact unwilling to back that slogan with substance. There is only one vote today that truly supports America's families. It is a vote in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act. The bill authorizes $6.4 billion for school construction projects for fiscal year 2009, and ensures that school districts will quickly receive funds for school modernization, renovation, and repairs. A majority of these funds must be used for projects that meet green building standards for energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. 
   This important bill will improve the health of our Nation on a variety of levels. As an economic stimulus, it will create jobs all across the Nation as local citizens join together to build and repair schools. The bill also improves the teaching and learning climate in America's schools by combating overcrowding, decreasing student and teacher sick days, and improving school air quality for our nation's 60 million school children. This legislation also improves energy efficiency by mandating the use of renewable resources in our schools. These same energy efficiencies will also play a positive role in combating global climate change by limiting the carbon emissions emitted by school buildings. Finally, the inclusion of Davis-Bacon protections ensures that workers will receive a fair and prevailing wage. 
   At a time when our economy is reeling, with unemployment and inflation on the rise, this bill will infuse our faltering job market with the resources it needs to flourish. This $6.4 billion investment in our Nation's infrastructure will create 100,000 new design and construction jobs--4,041 of which will be located in Michigan. Citizens working in other sectors will also see an improvement in their financial stability, as property values improve in communities with these new schools. 
   The bill will also dramatically improve the teaching and learning climate for America's school children. We all know that children can't learn if they're sick. The average American school was built half a century ago. As a result, too many of our children attend overcrowded schools housed in buildings with leaky roofs, faulty electrical systems, and outdated technology. This tremendous investment in physical facilities would help alleviate these problems by repairing and removing infrastructure rife will black mold and asbestos. 
   Some may decry the spending associated with this bill. I however, see it as a smart investment that will pay out cost-saving dividends in the very near future. Green schools created by this bill will cost, on average, 2% more than conventional schools but provide financial benefits that are 20 times as large. This is enough savings to hire two additional full-time teachers in most communities. 
   Although not obvious at first, the bill will also play a substantial role in our nation's multifaceted response to the threat posed by global climate change. When one thinks about the causes of global warming, images of exhaust spewing SUVs and coal plants billowing out black smoke spring to mind. In fact, 39 percent of all green house gas emissions come from buildings--including many of our country's school buildings. The energy efficiency improvements that will be built into our schools will have an immediate impact on this front. Each green and energy efficient school will lead to annual emission reductions of 585,000 pounds of carbon dioxide. 
   Finally, I am happy to see that the bill will include Davis-Bacon protections to all grants for school modernization, renovation, and repair projects. The inclusion of these protections exemplifies the tremendous differences between the two major parties on issues of worker's rights. I am continually reminded that during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, our President attempted to rescind Davis-Bacon protections at a time when local workers could least afford to have their living standards depressed. In contrast, with this bill, this Democratic Congress emphasizes its commitment to  the belief that the government has a responsibility to provide workers with a living wage as they work to improve their communities. 
   I applaud Representative Chandler and the rest of the Leadership for this bill. As I noted two weeks ago in the Congressional Record, one of the hallmarks of this Congress has been its attempt to provide comprehensive solutions to complicated problems. I believe that this bill is a proud example of this trend. In a bill aimed at decreasing class sizes, the Congress has also chosen to attack climate change, promote worker's rights, and improve air quality. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill and send a clear message to the American people: This Congress is committed to smart solutions to the real problems that this country will face in the 21st Century.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SOUND RECORDING AND FILM PRESERVATION PROGRAMS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow our cultural, historical or visually significant treasures to disappear into the fog of time. That is why I fully support both reauthorizations contained within H.R. 5893. 
   Our written traditions have libraries which archive and preserve them. The program we reauthorize today provides a mechanism for similar archiving for sound and visual arts, encouraging their preservation and accessibility for ourselves and for future generations despite rapid changes in visual and sound recording media. 
   H.R. 5893 would reauthorize the sound recording and film preservation programs of the Library of Congress and make a few small changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the programs such as by encouraging more active participation by board members. 
   I am particularly interested in the progress of the Library of Congress on its study and report on sound recordings. In speaking with members of the artist community, it has become clear to me that art forms such as jazz are not being archived, preserved, and restored to the extent necessary to prevent the disappearance of some of the older recordings. This reauthorization will enable the Library of Congress to continue the study and report on ways the National Recording Preservation Board can better ensure the continued availability of seminal pieces of historical jazz and other forms of music. 
   This country, indeed the world, recently lost a music great, a pioneer who helped lead rhythm and blues into rock and roll, an artist of the highest esteem, ``Bo Diddley.'' Through the continuation of these important archive programs, we can help make sure that Bo Diddley and others will be long remembered for their special contributions to our culture. Though we may mourn the passing of the musician, we need never mourn the loss of the music.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for overriding the President's veto of the State Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization. This bipartisan legislation would provide health coverage for 10 million of our most vulnerable children. It is supported by over 80 percent of the American public, as well as bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate and 43 of our Nation's Governors. 
   The fact that the President and the House Republican leadership continue to oppose this critical, life-saving legislation is difficult to comprehend. All of the excuses that they have trotted out for blocking this bill--that it would cover the rich, or illegal aliens, or that it would institute ``socialized'' medicine--have been exposed as false. This bipartisan program puts poor kids first, as reflected in the fact that 90 percent of families covered by SCHIP live under 200 percent of the poverty level. It bars coverage of illegal immigrants, as is spelled out clearly in the bill's text. In fact, the bill does not even cover legal immigrants. Finally, the SCHIP reauthorization does not institute ``socialized'' medicine. Seventy-seven percent of children in the SCHIP program are covered by private insurance companies, and the American Association of Health Insurance Plans, as well as the American Medical Association and PhRMA, all support this bill. The Republicans' other excuse for opposing this bill--that we can't afford it--is disingenuous. This legislation is fully paid for with a tobacco tax. I also find it interesting that those who raise the cry of ``fiscal responsibility'' when it comes to a few billion dollars for poor children do not seem to have any objections to providing hundreds of billions for the President's disastrous war. 
   Having revealed that the Republicans' stated reasons for opposing this legislation are patently false, one is forced to wonder what is actually motivating them. I believe that the President and his supporters are blocking this legislation because they are afraid. They are afraid of SCHIP because it demonstrates that health care guaranteed by the government is workable, it is affordable, and it is popular. They worry that if SCHIP is expanded, even more Americans will begin to demand that the government guarantee health care to all our citizens, not just to poor children. After all, every other industrialized nation does so, while spending less than we do and while achieving better health outcomes for its citizens. The Republicans will apparently use every means at their disposal to ensure that health care in this country remains a privilege for those who can afford it, rather than a right guaranteed to all. 
   Madam Speaker, today's vote raises a moral question. Simply put: will we, as a nation, take responsibility for ensuring that all our children have necessary health coverage? All other issues raised in this debate are obfuscations meant to hide the fact that the party claiming the mantle of ``family values'' is in fact unwilling to back that slogan with substance. There is only one vote today that truly supports America's families. It is a vote to override this shameful veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 890, The Student Loan Sunshine Act of 2007. Over the last few decades the costs of a postsecondary education in our country has increased exponentially. Now, more than ever our nation's students and families are relying on student loans to help pay for a college degree and yet, thanks in large part to the investigative reporting New York Times, we now know that egregious conflicts of interest and corrupt practices among lenders, schools, and public officials are undermining the student loan programs on which millions of borrowers depend. This is unacceptable, and I am pleased that the Education and Labor Chairman George Miller has decided to address this situation so promptly. 
   The Student Loan Sunshine Act cleans up the student loan industry and ensures that students and families will encounter a more trust-worthy student aid system in the future by requiring institutions and lenders to adopt strict codes of conduct that adhere to specific guidelines, banning all gifts, participation on advisory boards, and revenue-sharing agreements between lenders and schools, mandating institutions disclose all relationships with lenders, only allowing ``preferred lender lists'' on campuses with strict assurances that the list was created with the students' best interest in mind, ensuring that students have access to all lenders of their choice (including those not on the preferred lender lists), prohibiting staffing of school financial aid offices. 
   We need to pass this legislation here and now to send a message to all stock holders that Congress and the American public will not abide abusive lending practices and that we are entitled to transparency in student loan programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of ``H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2008.'' One of our greatest responsibilities is the protection and security of our citizens and they deserve a vigorous and accountable homeland security policy. H.R. 1684 will now provide just such a policy that will allow us to address the weaknesses that were apparent in the administration's previous attempts at providing Homeland Security. 
   This legislation, which was developed through bipartisan support, is a proactive step in making our country a much safer place to live, work and play. The bill authorizes $39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year 2008--which is $2.1 billion more than President Bush requested in his budget and funds many much needed programs to keep America safe. 
   The bill restores funding to the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which supports first responders in their mission to prevent, prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism. This bill also restores the President's 55-percent cut in firefighter assistance grants and restores the elimination of the Local Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. H.R. 1684 will also provide funding for vital first responder programs and provide resources for a number of other critical homeland security activities that were reduced in the President's budget. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has been faced with management and oversight  issues since its inception. A July 27, 2006 article by the Washington Post stated that, ``The multibillion-dollar surge in Federal contracting to bolster the Nation's domestic defenses in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks has been marred by extensive waste and misspent funds, according to a new bipartisan congressional report.'' This bill will help to refocus and provide the necessary training and resources to help the Agency achieve its goals and address mismanagement issues. H.R. 1684 will require the Department of Homeland Security to consider past performance of a firm before deciding whether to award a new contract. As a part of a contract bid, each firm seeking the contract must submit information regarding its past performance of Federal, State, local, and private sector contracts. 
   I am committed to ensuring that we are prepared to protect our families, our homes, and our Nation against any and all terrorist threats. So, I am honored to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, which would allow the government to negotiate prescription drug prices on behalf of our senior and disabled citizens. 
   Aside from the bipartisan group of Members, an overwhelming majority of Americans favor allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices for the Medicare program. Eight-five percent of the 1,867 adults polled in a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation this past week, revealed they were in favor of such negotiations, including majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents. 
   I along with many of my Democratic colleagues promised to repeal this provision in the 2003 Medicare drug benefit law that prevents the government from engaging in drug price negotiations. Our time has come to do so. 
   The administration refused to take action on behalf our citizens desperately in need of affordable health care, offering them little hope for quality health care. Requiring the government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of our citizens requires some more details which can easily be sorted out through the experts at HHS. 
   Under the current Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program, which enrolled 22.5 million people this year, dozens of private insurers offer Medicare drug plans in every state, competing on monthly premiums, choice of drugs and access to pharmacies. This has placed tremendous financial pressure on insurers, through their pharmacy benefit managers, to negotiate the best prices they can with drug companies and pharmacies, a fact confirmed by experts within the system. 
   There is no reason why the government cannot sort out difficulties, to mimic the few programs that are providing affordable drugs through pre-negotiated drug prices, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. This department by law receives a mandatory discount on drugs, and also negotiates effectively to secure better prices for the 4.4 million veterans who use its drug benefit. With as many as 43 million beneficiaries, Medicare will have the ability to do the same. 
   Therefore I strongly support H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, H.R. 4137. In passing this reauthorization today, the 110th Congress is once again demonstrating its commitment to strengthening America's economy by increasing access to higher education.  
   In the lead-up to the 2006 election Democrats made a pledge to make increased access to a quality education a priority in the 110th Congress. The passage of this reauthorization today is just the latest example of our making good on this promise. 
   Titled the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, H.R. 4137 reauthorizes one of President Lyndon Baines Johnson's key Great Society programs, the Higher Education Act of 1965. The purpose of this legislation from the outset always has been to strengthen the educational resources of our colleges and universities and to provide financial assistance for students in postsecondary and higher education. H.R 4137 builds on this strong foundation. 
   A college education continues to be the best path to enter the middle class. But ever-increasing tuition costs and other obstacles are putting a college degree further out of reach for America's students. In addition to rising tuition, students and their families face an overly complex federal student aid application process and a student loan industry tainted by conflicts of interest and mired in corrupt lending practices. H.R. 4137 addresses these problems by encouraging colleges to rein in price increases, ensuring that states maintain their commitments to higher education funding, and providing students and families with consumer-friendly information on college pricing and the factors driving tuition increases. 
   The legislation strengthens provisions previously approved by the House to avoid conflicts of interest in the student loan programs. The bill's new provisions also include requiring better consumer disclosures and protections on private student loans. 
   In the first 50 legislative hours of the 110th Congress, the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act, which cut the interest rates in half on certain subsidized student loans over the next five years. In July 2007 we passed H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act, the single largest increase in college aid since the GI bill. Today, with H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, we build on these efforts and once again demonstrate that the 110th Congress is building a better future for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (SECTION 8 VOUCHER REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairman, I regret that I will be unable to vote ``yes'' tonight for passage of H.R. 1851. I was scheduled to be in Detroit in order to receive the NAACP's most prestigious award, the ``Spingarn award.'' I applaud the vision, courage and compassion of Representative MAXINE WATERS for introducing the ``Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, H.R. 1851.'' I strongly support the legislation, because it expands Section 8 vouchers for working families in America who are in desperate need of affordable housing by creating 20,000 incremental Section 8 vouchers in each of the next 5 years for a total of 100,000 new vouchers. 
   In a nation where affordable housing is scarce, and family homeless shelters continue to be built across the nation, passage of H.R. 1851 is a vitally important step in having the Federal Government take the lead in expanding affordable housing for deserving families and children in America. There are approximately 16,000 individuals and families who are currently on the Detroit Public Housing Waiting List. H.R. 1851 will help reduce the affordable housing crisis in Detroit, by increasing the availability of housing units through the expansion of Section 8 housing. It clearly does not make sense, nor is it fair, to have apartments available for rent in Detroit, but not enough citizens to move into them, only because there have not been a sufficient supply of Section 8 vouchers in the past. 
   H.R. 1851 also changes rent calculation, recertification, and inspection rules for the voucher, public housing, and project based Section 8 programs, to reduce costs and compliance burdens for public housing agencies, landlords, and families. These changes are made while maintaining rules that target scarce resources to those families most in need and while maintaining rent calculation rules that ensure rents are affordable. This will mean that Section 8 apartments will now become more affordable due to changes in rent calculation formulas mandated in H.R. 1851. 
   H.R. 1851 also permits public housing agencies across this country to allow families in need of affordable housing to use a Section 8 housing voucher as a down payment on a first time home purchase. Passage of this legislation means scores of working families in Detroit, many who have saved and sacrificed the entire lives to buy a home, will be now able to do so. 
   The ``Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2007, H.R. 1851.'' Is a critically important piece of legislation because it reforms HUD Section 8 guidelines to ensure that the approximately $1.4 billion in unused Section 8 funds will now be spent. This legislation mandates reforms in the Section 8 program that will eliminate inefficiencies, streamline paper work, and provide more incentives for public housing agencies to assist more families who qualify for Section 8 housing. 
   Having an additional $1.4 billion dollars to be used for Section 8 housing vouchers means that there will be a substantial increase in families in Detroit who will live in safe and decent affordable housing. There are too many working families in Detroit, and across this nation, who are living in homeless shelters, expensive inner city hotels, and staying with friends and relatives until they can locate housing. This is a moral outrage. All Americans deserve safe, decent, and affordable permanent housing. 
   Under the leadership of Representative MAXINE WATERS, passage of H.R. 1851 shows how we as Democrats have always had a historical commitment to expanding affordable housing to working families, and will continue to do so. 
   If we are to be a truly compassionate and moral nation, all individuals and families, regardless of income, race, or employment status must have as a fundamental human and civil right safe, decent, and affordable housing. Passage of H.R. 1851 is a critically important piece of legislation that will move America closer to this goal. Now, 100,000 additional Americans will have the opportunity to either become home owners, or move into an apartment, something that we can all agree on should be one of the highest priorities of this Nation.

   Unfortunately, I was unable to attend due to the fact that I was given the high honor of receiving the NAACP Spingarn Award. However, this is an extremely important piece of legislation. One of our greatest responsibilities is the protection of our soldiers. The Democrats are determined to end this war and bring our young men and women back home. H.R. 2956 will now provide such a policy that will allow us to meet our national security interests in Iraq and the broader Middle East region by maintaining a minimal force. The Administration has provided a failed policy and it is time for a new direction. We understand that this transition must be well thought out and handled responsibly; with a view toward an enduring national security interest in the region. 
   This legislation, acknowledges that our military has accomplished the mission they were given in the original 2002 authorization to use force and that Iraq must now take leadership for its own future. For years Democrats have advocated for the responsible redeployment of American forces from Iraq. The relocation and redistribution of our soldiers is long overdue and enough American lives have been sacrificed for a failed policy. Democrats have argued that the Iraqis must take primary accountability for their country and their security. American presence in Iraq must be re-focused away from playing referee in a civil war. We must focus and limit our efforts to military missions such as counter-terrorism, training Iraqi security forces and protecting American personnel at the embassy. 
   The bill requires American forces to begin redeploying within 120 days and to complete the transition to a limited presence by April 1, 2008. The bill also requires a comprehensive strategy by January 1, 2008 for U.S. policy in Iraq, including a discussion of American national security interests in Iraq and the broader region, the specific missions remaining forces would undertake, and minimum force levels required to accomplish them. Finally, it requires the President to submit updates on the use of and need for any forces remaining in Iraq every 90 days starting on July 1, 2008. The President has been given ample time to bring our soldiers home. It is now time for us to act on their behalf. 
   I am committed to the homecoming of our brave men and women who have so valiantly completed their mission. So, I am honored to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Madam Speaker, today we recognize the ongoing loss of life occurring in Darfur. I would like to restate my unconditional support and commitment to advancing peace and security for the people of Darfur. I implore my colleagues in Congress to join me in urging the Sudanese government to take decisive action to address this tragedy. This quite simply is a matter of Life and Death and as the destruction of hope and possibilities continues to erode away at a people who are calling out for help. These atrocities continue to mount in the Sudan as our Administration continues to pump billions of dollars into Iraq and redirects greatly needed resources away from this unnecessary tragedy. The conflict in Sudan began as a genocide against tribes of small farmers in its Darfur region over five years ago. Militia groups have slaughtered an estimated 400,000 people and driven 2.5 million people from their homes. There has been an increase in civilian killings and large scale attacks in Darfur. The rape and torture of women and children remains a constant concern on a daily basis. Thousands have moved to displacement camps which contain their own level of violence with guns being readily available and tensions in Darfur continuing to grow every day. The African Union peace keeping troops who have put up a courageous fight have lacked the proper resources and manpower needed to contain the growing threat. Equipped only with light weapons, they are no match for the heavily armed rebels. They are undermanned and outgunned and in desperate need of advanced weapons and helicopters to properly engage with the Militia. 
   In May, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Weisel called Darfur ``the capital of suffering.'' He called on all of us to ``tell the victims they are not alone.'' Violence continues in Darfur, as the Sudanese government attacked two internally displaced camps in the past week. On October 19, the Militia attacked the Kalma refugee camp, the largest in Darfur. Additionally, on Oct. 22, the Hamidiya camp near the town of Zalengei was attacked in a series of clashes between government troops and rebel groups. The killings of African Union peacekeepers and World Food Programme contract drivers combined with detentions of humanitarian workers in the conflict-ridden Darfur region of western Sudan are just a few examples of a deteriorating situation, which is prompting increased anxiety by those affected by the ongoing crisis, as well as by those responding to the emergency. From June until late August, the United Nations reported, an estimated 55,000 new persons had been displaced in the region--bringing the total number of those uprooted this year to some 250,000. In all, the UN estimates, 2.2 million of Darfur's 6.4 million people have been displaced, and four million are now dependent on some form of humanitarian assistance. 
   While almost everyone involved in Darfur policy agrees that an African Union peacekeeping force of just 7,000 troops is not up to the task, the United States has refused to send troops and, despite promises of reinforcements, has yet to secure many additional troops from other countries. At the same time, it has been unable to broker a diplomatic resolution that might ease the violence. There is no doubt that what is taking place in Darfur is genocide, and the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility. Congress and the Administration must support legislation to address this most pressing human rights issue. We must move beyond the rhetoric and take action to save the lives of the people who are struggling each day with this horrific conflict. We must leave politics aside and support legislation such as H. Res. 573, which recognizes and commends the efforts of U.S. advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening crisis in Darfur; We must also support H. Res. 740, which condemns the brutal attack on African Union peacekeepers that occurred in Haskanita, Darfur one month ago today. This violent act, carried out by rebels, took the lives of 10 peacekeepers--seven Nigerians and three other soldiers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana; and finally H. Res. 726, a resolution calling on the President and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against the most innocent of Darfur's victims--young girls and women. 
   We must continue to provide security and support for the courageous humanitarian workers, who risk their lives daily. Their commitment to this struggle has been exemplarily in the face of danger. We must also take this opportunity to unite and stop these crimes against humanity. We can not allow our past failures to identify genocide in places such as in Rwanda, Bosnia, and elsewhere to exist ever again.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, tonight members of the Congressional Black Caucus stand with the American people to tell the President once more: it is time to end the war in Iraq. As co-chairs of the Out of Iraq Caucus, two of my fellow CBC members, Representatives Maxine Waters and Barbara Lee, are among the preeminent leaders in Congress in the fight to end this misbegotten war. I want to thank them for their leadership and for their tireless efforts to bring our troops home. 
   Last week's much-anticipated testimony, report and ``new plan'' were just more of the same. Once again refusing to heed the facts on the ground and the wishes of the American people, President Bush simply reiterated his  stubborn commitment to continue his failed policy in Iraq. 
   The ``progress'' reported by the Administration is arguable. But what is not subject to debate is this: there is no such thing as ``winning'' an occupation. We cannot have a military ``victory'' in Iraq. The only way out of this quagmire is a political solution. And after more than four years, there has been no political progress in Iraq. The President seems to believe that another 10 years of occupation, to the tune of trillions of dollars and thousands more American lives, is worth wagering on this disastrous conflict. The American people and the Congressional Black Caucus disagree. 
   The White House and its emissaries continue to urge the Congress and the American people to view the disastrous conflict in Iraq through rose-colored glasses. But we know better. No independent assessment of the situation in Iraq aligns with the picture presented by the White House. The Government Accountability Office reports that the Iraqi government has failed to meet 15 of the 18 benchmarks for success in Iraq as articulated by the President himself. The Jones Commission concludes that the Iraqi National Police force that we have spent millions of dollars training and equipping is `dysfunctional,' riddled with sectarianism, corruption and inefficiency, and should be disbanded altogether. The consensus of the nation's intelligence community, in the latest National Intelligence Estimate, is that the `level of overall violence, including attacks on and casualties among civilians remains high' and `Iraq's sectarian groups remain unreconciled.' 
   Furthermore, the Administration's use of statistics to reinforce its claims of success is problematic. According to a report in the Washington Post, U.S. military leaders and the White House are `cherry-picking' data to bolster their claims that the President's failed war strategy is working. In order to support this claim, military and Administration calculations are based on a system of categorizing and excluding statistics that `selectively ignored negative trends' and `puzzled' senior intelligence officials and the nation's chief auditor and head of the Government Accountability Office. For example, people who were killed by a shot to the back of the head are included as `sectarian' casualties, but those killed by a shot to the front of the head are not counted because they are assumed to be dead from `criminal' activity, according to an intelligence analyst quoted in the article. 
   In fact, the death toll in Iraq is rising. The Associated Press reports that while the President's escalation has succeeded in bringing violence in Baghdad down from peak levels, the death toll from sectarian attacks around the country is running nearly double the pace from a year ago. The AP counted 1,809 civilian deaths in August, making it the highest monthly total this year. Though the administration continually cites a reduction in violence in Anbar province as evidence of the surge's success, in fact, the Marines had already established ties to local Sunni leaders long before the `surge' strategy was even announced. June, July and August 2007 marked the bloodiest summer so far for U.S. troops in Iraq, with 264 soldiers killed. 
   This grim picture is further reflected in Iraqi public opinion. A BBC/ABC News poll conducted in August concludes that Iraqi opinion is at its gloomiest since the polls began in February 2004. According to this latest poll, between 67 and 70 percent of Iraqis say the escalation has made things worse in the key areas of security, the conditions for political dialogue, reconstruction and economic development. A majority (57 percent) of Iraqis believe that attacks on coalition forces are acceptable, including 93 percent of Sunnis and 50 percent of Shia. 
   The token drawdown of troops proposed by General Petraeus and endorsed by the President, in which nearly a year would pass before troop strength returns to pre-escalation levels, is neither a political compromise nor a ``new plan.'' In fact, this drawdown has been scheduled to take place since the beginning of the ``surge,'' because to do otherwise would stretch our military beyond the breaking point. So, in effect, the President is offering nothing at all in response to the demand of the American people and the Congress to bring our troops home--except another 10 years of war and occupation. 
   The President continues to ask our troops to referee a civil war whose outcome depends entirely on the actions of politicians in Baghdad. As General Petraeus himself has pointed out, the conflict in Iraq cannot be solved militarily; only a political settlement by Iraq's leaders can bring this conflict to an end. Yet, despite the fact that Iraqi politicians have made virtually no progress toward this goal in four years, the President insists on a continuing American military involvement, with no end in sight. The American people understand that this policy has failed, and this Congress will continue to fight to bring an end to this disaster and to bring our troops home.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CBC DISCUSSES SCHIP AND THE JENA SIX -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, in the 21st century, there are some things that I had hoped we would have put behind us as a society. As we move to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ``Little Rock Nine,'' there are things that I had hoped today's children would not need to suffer. But as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I know that we are still in search of equal justice across this Nation. There are still places where the progress of the civil rights era have not fully taken hold. 
   The tragedy of the Jena-6, which is unfolding right now before the eyes of the Nation, shows us that we still have some distance to travel before putting the demons of the past behind us. The controversy dates back to August 2006 when black students at Jena High School attempted to sit under a tree where white students socialized exclusively. The following day, three white students, who would later be punished only with suspensions, hung nooses from the tree. A series of racially charged episodes involving off-campus violence soon followed the noose incident. In one instance, black student Robert Bailey would be attacked in a white part of town at gun-point. The white student who attacked Bailey would face only simple battery and probation. The white man who pulled the gun on Bailey, however, would face no consequence. Ultimately, Bailey would be charged with theft of a firearm for wrestling the gun away. 
   Later, racial taunting directed at black students in the high school cafeteria would lead to a fight in which a white student would be injured and sent to the hospital. These injuries, however, would not prevent the student from attending a high school event that same evening. The five of the Black teens involved in the fight--Mychal Bell, Robert Bailey, Carwin Jones, Bryant Purvis, and Theo Shaw were charged as adults with attempted second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, sentences that carry up to 80 years in prison. The sixth teen will be tried as a juvenile and faces undisclosed charges. 
   One would have hoped that the elders of Jena would have intervened in a way that led to healing in the community. Sadly, this was not the case. Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct have been directed at LaSalle Parish District Attorney Reed Walters, who told Black students at a school assembly in response to the noose incident that ``I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With a stroke of my pen, I can make your lives disappear.'' This statement was proven true when Mychal Bell was convicted in June of aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy by an all-white jury. The court-appointed attorney who represented Bell called no witnesses and presented no evidence in his defense. 
   The families of Jena have not, however, faced this struggle alone. Just as happened in the 1960's, students, activists, and other concerned citizens from across the Nation have organized, rallied, and raised money on behalf of the Jena-6. Most recently, on September 9, 2007, Reverend Jesse Jackson met with families of the Jena-6 and called upon Jena officials to reconsider the charges. Major rallies were held in Jena and around the country on September 20, the day Bell's sentencing was scheduled to occur. Tens of thousands traveled to Jena from across the country to show their support. 
   This show of activism has had some effect. This month, charges against Jones, Shaw and Bailey were reduced to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy, although Purvis still faces charges of attempted murder and conspiracy. A judge also granted a motion to overturn Bell's conspiracy conviction, stating that the case should have been tried in juvenile court. In addition, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's remaining aggravated second-degree battery conviction, also on the grounds that it should have been tried in juvenile court. 
   At the Federal, we cannot remain silent. Indeed, the Community Relations Service of the Department of Justice has been in Jena for months to assist with conciliation efforts. Investigation units of the Department have also apparently reviewed the situation. It is important for members of Congress to maintain careful oversight of Federal actions to ensure that all the resources of the Justice Department are employed to protect the rights of the local community. 
   To that end, I will convene a panel at the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference to address, the plight of the Jena-6. The forum will be held on Friday, September 28, at 3 p.m. in Room 209c of the Washington Convention Center. The panel will feature: Prof Charles Ogletree, Harvard University Law School; Tory Pegram, Louisiana Affiliate, ACLU; Family Members of Robert Bailey--Jena 6; Rep. Elijah Cummings (MD-7th); Michael Baisden, Radio Personality; Louis Granderson Scott, Attorney of Michael Bell (Jena-6); and Rev. Al Sharpton, Civil Rights Activist. 
   Ultimately, I believe that a Judiciary Committee oversight hearing may be warranted, as the Department of Justice has intervened with little success. The Department investigated the noose incident, but concluded that a hate crime had not been committed. However, we should explore whether the apparently hostile racial climate at the local high school opens federal jurisdiction under other civil rights statutes. Similarly, the activities of CRS should be reviewed to determine their effectiveness at dispute resolution. 
   We have reached a point in history where this kind of situation is no longer tolerable. I commend everyone across the country for participating in rallies, sending your support and letting these students and the rest of the country know that we, as a Nation, will not stand for this kind of injustice.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (CBC DISCUSSES SCHIP AND THE JENA SIX -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the bipartisan, bicameral plan to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, which the House will consider later this week. This crucial legislation will ensure that millions of our children receive the vital health services they need. 
   Even though I support this legislation, I rise today with a heavy heart. It is nothing short of a disgrace that here, in the wealthiest country  on earth, eight million children lack health insurance coverage. We ought to be ashamed that we are having this debate at all. 
   I am absolutely stunned that some Congressional Republicans and the President continue to oppose this legislation, particularly in light of the fact that the President used SCHIP as part of his campaign platform in 2004. Talk about shock and awe! I am shocked beyond belief that they can stand before the American people with straight faces and refuse health care for our children. I am in awe of the gall required to base the denial of these vital, life-saving services on an ideological talking point. Madam Speaker, the ideology of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle has not provided health care for these children yet. It is impossible for any serious person to believe that if this legislation is defeated the Republican ideology will suddenly start working its magic and provide health care for these children whose parents can't afford to buy it in the open market. 
   In my years fighting for universal health care, we have often said, ``Covering children is easy. How could anyone refuse to support coverage for children?'' It was coverage for adults that was always perceived as the real challenge. 
   But today, the Republicans have stooped lower than even I thought was possible. Not only are they saying ``We can't afford to give our children health care.'' This is the same party, by the way, that finds money for tax cuts for the rich, that finds money to fund a disaster of a war. Many times more money than what is needed to cover these children, in fact. 
   Not only are the Republicans admitting that they prioritize tax cuts for the wealthy and feeding the military industrial complex over insuring our children. They are now standing before the American people and saying ``It is not our job to guarantee health insurance coverage for America's children.'' They are refusing to make that promise. 
   Instead, they propose that our children's health should be subject to the ups and downs of the stock market, that it should depend on their parents' employment status, or how much they have in a bank account. It is utterly beyond conception how the Republicans can possibly think these concepts will be accepted by the American people. But I will leave my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to face the repercussions of this folly next November. 
   Let me move on to a more positive subject: the compromise SCHIP bill, which we will pass over these shameful objections. While I would have preferred the original House-passed bill to the more modest bicameral compromise, the House-Senate agreement is a major improvement over the President's proposal, which would result in 840,000 children currently enrolled in SCHIP losing their coverage. 
   The House-Senate agreement invests $35 billion in new funding for SCHIP over five years to strengthen the program's financing, increase health insurance coverage for low-income children, and improve the quality of health care children receive. It will provide health coverage to millions of low-income children who are currently uninsured and ensures that the 6.6 million children who currently participate in CHIP continue to receive health coverage. Pending final Congressional Budget Office estimates, the reduction in the number of uninsured children will approach 4 million children. 
   Under the agreement, quality dental coverage will be provided to all children enrolled in CHIP. The agreement also ensures states will offer mental health services on par with medical and surgical benefits covered under CHIP. The agreement provides states with incentives to lower the rate of uninsured low income children. It replaces the flawed CMS August 17th letter to states with a more thoughtful and appropriate approach. In place of the CMS letter, the agreement gives states time and assistance in developing and implementing their own best practices to address crowd-out. 
   The compromise proposal improves outreach tools to simplify and streamline enrollment of eligible children, providing $100 million in grants for new outreach activities to states, local governments, schools, community-based organizations, safety-net providers and others. It also establishes a new quality child health initiative to develop and implement quality measures and improve state reporting of quality data. These measures are critical to ensuring that all our nation's children get the health care they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's tell the White House and the Congressional Republicans still standing with it that it's time to stop playing political games. Let's tell them it's time to work together to ensure more children across the country have the high-quality medical care they deserve. The President might not be able to understand that it's the right thing to do, but the American people certainly will.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONYERS. (RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 25, 1957, DESEGREGATION OF LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL BY THE LITTLE ROCK NINE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I am pleased to join the entire Arkansas congressional delegation, Representatives VIC SNYDER, MARION BERRY, MIKE ROSS, JOHN BOOZMAN, all in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the integration of the Little Rock Central High School by the Little Rock Nine. I would like also to recognize the distinguished members of the House Judiciary Committee, Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH and former chairman, JIM SENSENBRENNER, who have joined me in the introduction of this resolution. 
   Fifty years ago, on September 25, 1957, the Little Rock Nine, as they were called, successfully challenged the status quo of ``separate but equal.'' Three years earlier, we all recall the momentous Supreme Court decision of 1954 that ruled the 14th amendment's guarantee of equal protection prohibited segregation in the public schools. This landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision struck down the notorious State-sanctioned Jim Crow in the realm of education once and for all. 
   Unfortunately, this critical determination would not easily be accepted. It would take nine young strong and determined African American students to begin actually implementing the new laws of the land. These nine students, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls, implemented the promise of Brown v. The Board. In the footsteps of Rosa Parks, these students, too, started a movement to dismantle years of segregation and inequalities in our public school systems. 
   On the shoulders of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., these brave young nine boys and girls faced a hatred and a violence that is embarrassing to recall, and they faced it with nonviolent resistance. They were peaceful. Dr. King himself said ``to meet physical force with soul force.'' And that is what they did. Dr. King asked the students to think of the big picture as they moved forward, for they were going to be the frame for that picture. 
   So on September 25, 1957, the students who came to be known as the Little Rock Nine integrated Little Rock Central High School, and history was forever changed. Escorted by 1,000 members of the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army, the Little Rock Nine claimed the fair and equal education that they were entitled to. 
   It took close to a month to secure this access and opportunity, but these young men and women persevered in their mission of school integration. Defying Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, segregationists and other protestors, the Little Rock Nine were victorious in ending segregated education. 
   The Little Rock Nine's first attempt to attend Central High School was on September 4, 1957; but the Arkansas Governor called in the National Guard of his State to keep them out. On September 23, the Little Rock Nine, armed with a Federal court order, again tried to attend Central High School, but protests and violence forced the group of students out of the school. It was not until Federal protection was provided that the students would be able to safely attend school on September 25. This Federal protection would remain until the end of the school year, enabling African American senior Ernest Green to graduate. But, sadly, this year of progress would be tainted by the Arkansas Governor's decision to close all of the high schools the following year. 
   The Little Rock Nine would remain champions of education and school integration despite the fierce opposition. After the schools reopened in 1959, three more of the Little Rock Nine would go on to graduate from Central High. All of them would become productive, contributive members of our society. From social work to education to government, the Little Rock Nine were and remain represented in all professional sectors. They have also continued their commitment to education with the founding of the Little Rock Nine Foundation, which is dedicated to providing educational opportunities to students of color. 
   On the 50th anniversary of the integration of Central High by the Little Rock Nine, I am pleased to recognize that great progress has been made in education. But I must also acknowledge recent setbacks to the guarantee of opportunity and inclusion within our educational system. A recent Supreme Court decision now severely limits school districts in their efforts to achieve racial balance and diversity in primary and secondary education. 
   But in acknowledging recent setbacks, I would be remiss to not comment on the Jena Six. Just as the Little Rock Nine stood up to the inequities of their time, we must lift up the Jena Six in response to the inequities of their time. 
   The Little Rock Nine did not mean to make national or world history; they were just standing up for what they believed was right. 
   In considering this resolution, I ask that all of our Members move forward with this same kind of determination and understanding of what our democracy is all about. On this 50th anniversary, let us all pledge to continue the legacy of the Little Rock Nine and Brown v. The Board by protecting and advancing equal educational opportunity for all. 
   I omit the great work that was done by President Dwight Eisenhower and others that helped move this situation forward some 50 years ago. And I note also that Arkansas was not a hot bed of segregation. It was considered, frankly, a moderate Southern State. But things transpired so that it became that one activity in which these nine boys and girls have gone into American history. They have been celebrated, and they have been talked about. I have been hearing about them all week long as we prepare for this celebration. And I am so proud to bring this resolution on the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School before this body. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
