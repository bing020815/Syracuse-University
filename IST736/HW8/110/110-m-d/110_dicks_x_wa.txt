<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL GUARD YOUTH CHALLENGE DAY -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Madam Speaker, as a co-sponsor of this resolution, I appreciate the opportunity to offer a statement in support of House Resolution 1202, supporting the goals and ideals of National Guard Youth Challenge Day. I thank my colleague, Mr. Davis from Virginia, for having introduced this resolution so that today we are able to vote on it. 
   Throughout my career I have had a deep interest in programs that help our youth to develop into good citizens; citizens who will carry our Nation into the future, and citizens who are able to enjoy the satisfaction that comes from realizing their individual potential throughout their lives. It was a little over two years ago that I had my first direct contact with the National Guard Youth Challenge Program. I learned much about the program from meetings here in Washington, DC, where I heard about its 80 percent success rate in participating youth getting a high school diploma or GED. I heard about the success in graduating over 77,000 youth from programs in 30 states and territories. And I learned about the impressive numbers of graduates going on to jobs in the economy, joining the military, or continuing their education. 
   The statistics are impressive, but the experience that had the greatest impact on me was my visit to the Oregon National Guard Youth Challenge Program in Bend, Oregon. I was truly astounded by the stories that I heard from the young men and women there who found in themselves a desire to change, and made the commitment to the Youth Challenge experience to fundamentally change the direction of their lives. Many of these were youth who might otherwise have resigned themselves to a future of low expectations that could include drug and alcohol abuse, gang membership, and dead-end job prospects. But they took a chance on the Youth Challenge program, and through their own commitment and hard work found value, discipline and direction for themselves. 
   Today, I am pleased to be able to tell my colleagues that the State of Washington is well on its way to establishing a Youth Challenge program of its own. The support from the State government and the community have been absolutely fantastic. Governor Chris Gregoire, our State Superintendent of Public Instruction Terry Bergeson, the Adjutant General Tim Lowenberg, and the legislature in Olympia, Washington have been enthusiastically behind this program all the way. 
   In my home town of Bremerton, Washington, the Superintendent of Schools and the school board have embraced the program and look forward to our program at the Washington Youth Academy making a difference for youth from across the entire state. At the Federal level, the National Guard Bureau has been unwavering in its support of all of the programs across the country, and for starting this new program in the State of Washington. 
   The great thing about this program is that it sells itself. It just takes coming in contact with the positive energy young men and women in the program and their families to become a believer. By this time next year, I look forward to being able to report to my colleagues that the Washington Youth Academy will have graduated its first class of 150 youth who will be on a fundamentally different and more positive path for the rest of their lives. 
   Madam Speaker, I take great pleasure in supporting this resolution, and commend the National Guard Youth Challenge Program to the attention of all of my colleagues.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to rise to commend my colleagues, Mr. Obey and Mr. Murtha, for the excellent work on the supplemental appropriations bill that they have brought to the House floor. The House leadership has worked hard to put together the votes to pass this legislation. 
   This bill funds the troops. We have given them extra funds to deal with the critical issues of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. We need to clean up the mess at Walter Reed and the other hospitals around the country, including the VA hospitals. There is money in this bill to provide extra staff, nurses and to clean up these facilities. 
   It is critical that we put pressure on the Iraqi Government to end the civil war. The Maliki government must get the message that the American people do not have unlimited patience. General Petraeus has said that we cannot end this war with only a military solution. We need the Iraqis to resolve the conflict amongst themselves. We need them to fix their Constitution, pass necessary oil legislation, and end the sectarian violence. The benchmarks in this bill will help them to accomplish these objectives. 
   I hope that General Petraeus is successful in reducing the violence in Baghdad and the surrounding area. I hope that U.S. forces embedded with Iraqi forces can stop the sectarian killing. Without political reconciliation, we cannot stop the sectarian violence and the al Qaeda-led terrorist attacks. We also need an economic recovery program across Iraq to create badly needed jobs. 
   This bill sets a timetable. It puts pressure on the Maliki government, and I think it is the right bill at the right time to change our Iraq policy and to bring the troops home in a reasonable period of time. 
   I hope we can stabilize Iraq, but we can only do it with the effort of the Iraqi Government and their people.  
   Congress's Challenge on Iraq 
   The House of Representatives now has a chance to lead the nation toward a wiser, more responsible Iraq policy. It is scheduled to vote this week on whether to impose benchmarks for much-needed political progress on the Iraqi government--and link them to the continued presence of American combat forces. The bill also seeks to lessen the intolerable strains on American forces, requiring President Bush to certify that units are fit for battle before sending any troops to Iraq. Both of these requirements are long overdue. The House should vote yes, by an overwhelming, bipartisan margin. 
   It is normally the president who provides the leadership for American foreign policy and decides when there needs to be a change of course. But Mr. Bush stubbornly refuses to do either, and the country cannot afford to wait out the rest of his term. Given Mr. Bush's failure, Congress has a responsibility to do all it can to use Washington's remaining leverage to try to lessen the chaos that will likely follow an American withdrawal--no matter when it happens--and to ensure that the credibility and readiness of the United States military is preserved. 
   House Democrats have wisely moved beyond their earlier infatuation with mere deadlines. The benchmarks spelled out in this legislation, which also provides the next round of money for the war, require that the Iraqi government stop shielding and encouraging the Shiite militias that are helping drive the killing. United States and Iraqi security forces must be allowed to pursue all extremists, Shiite and Sunni, disarm sectarian militias and provide ``evenhanded security for all Iraqis.'' 
   The benchmarks also require the Iraqi government to take measurable steps toward national reconciliation: equitably distributing oil revenues, opening up more political and economic opportunities to the Sunni minority and amending the constitution to discourage further fragmentation. 
   The legislation does not settle for more empty promises--from Mr. Bush and the Iraqis. It would require the president to provide Congress, by July, with an initial detailed report on Iraq's efforts to meet these benchmarks. By October, the Iraqi government would have to complete a specific set of legislative and constitutional steps. Failure to meet these deadlines would trigger the withdrawal of all American combat forces--but not those training Iraqis or fighting Al Qaeda--to be concluded in April 2008. If the benchmarks were met, American combat forces would remain until the fall of 2008. 
   The measure would also bar sending any unit to Iraq that cannot be certified as fully ready. It sets a reasonable 365-day limit on combat tours for the Army and a shorter 210-day combat tour limit for the Marines. As for how many troops can remain in Iraq--until the House's deadlines for withdrawal--the legislation imposes no reduction on the level of roughly 132,000 in place at the start of this year. 
   Critics will complain that the House is doing the Pentagon's planning. But the Pentagon and Mr. Bush have clearly failed to protect America's ground forces from the ever more costly effects of extended, accelerated and repeated deployments. 
   If Iraq's leaders were truly committed to national reconciliation and reining in their civil war, there would be no need for benchmarks or deadlines. But they are not. If Mr. Bush were willing to grasp Iraq's horrifying reality, he would be the one imposing benchmarks, timetables and readiness rules. He will not, so Congress must. American troops should not be trapped in the middle of a blood bath that neither Mr. Bush nor Iraq's leaders have the vision or the will to halt.   
   The Troika and the Surge  
   President Bush's Iraq surge policy is about a month old now, and there is only one thing you can say about it for certain: no matter what anyone in Congress, the military or the public has to say, it's going ahead. The president has the authority to do it and the veto power to prevent anyone from stopping him. Therefore, there's only one position to have on the surge anymore: hope that it works. 
   Does this mean that Democrats in Congress who are trying to shut down the war and force a deadline should take the advice of critics and shut up and let the surge play out? 
   No, just the opposite. I would argue that for the first time we have--by accident--the sort of balanced policy trio that had we had it in place four years ago might have spared us the mess of today. It's the Pelosi-Petraeus-Bush troika. 
   I hope the Democrats, under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, keep pushing to set a deadline for withdrawal from Iraq, because they are providing two patriotic services that the Republicans failed to offer in the previous four years: The first is policy discipline. Had Republicans spent the previous four years regularly questioning Don Rumsfeld's ignorant bromides and demanding that the White House account for failures in Iraq, we might have had the surge in 2003--when it was obvious we did not have enough troops on the ground--rather than in 2007, when the chances of success are much diminished. 
   Because the Republicans controlled the House and Senate, and because many conservatives sat in mute silence the last four years, the administration could too easily ignore its critics and drag out policies in Iraq that were not working. With the Democrats back in Congressional control, that is no longer possible. 
   The other useful function Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are performing is to give the president and Gen. David Petraeus, our commander in Iraq, the leverage of a deadline without a formal deadline. How so? The surge can't work without political reconciliation among Iraqi factions, which means Sunni-Shiite negotiations--and such negotiations are unlikely to work without America having the ``leverage'' of telling the parties that if they don't compromise, we will leave. (Deadlines matter. At some point, Iraqis have to figure this out themselves.) 
   Since Mr. Bush refuses to set a deadline, Speaker Pelosi is the next best thing. Do not underestimate how useful it is for General Petraeus to be able to say to Iraqi politicians: ``Look guys, Pelosi's mad as hell-- and  she has a big following! I don't want to quit, but Americans won't stick with this forever. I only have a few months.'' 
   Speaker Pelosi: Keep the heat on. 
   As for General Petraeus, I have no idea whether his military strategy is right, but at least he has one--and he has stated that by ``late summer'' we should know if it's working. As General Petraeus told the BBC last week, ``I have an obligation to the young men and women in uniform out here, that if I think it's not going to happen, to tell them that it's not going to happen, and there needs to be a change.'' 
   We need to root for General Petraeus to succeed, and hold him to those words if he doesn't--not only for the sake of the soldiers on the ground, but also so that Mr. Bush is not allowed to drag the war out until the end of his term, and then leave it for his successor to unwind. 
   But how will General Petraeus or Congress judge if the surge is working? It may be obvious, but it may not be. It will likely require looking beneath the surface calm of any Iraqi neighborhood--where violence has been smothered by the surge of U.S. troops--and trying to figure out: what will happen here when those U.S. troops leave? Remember, enough U.S. troops can quiet any neighborhood for a while. The real test is whether a self-sustaining Iraqi army and political consensus are being put in place that can hold after we leave. 
   It will also likely require asking: Are the Shiite neighborhoods quieting down as a result of reconciliation or because their forces are just lying low so the U.S. will focus on whacking the Sunnis--in effect, carrying out the civil war on the Shiites' behalf, so that when we leave they can dominate more easily? 
   When you're sitting on a volcano, it is never easy to tell exactly what is happening underneath--or what will happen if you move. But those are the judgments we may soon have to make. In the meantime, since Bush is going to be Bush, let Pelosi be Pelosi and Petraeus be Petraeus--and hope for the best. For now, we don't have much choice.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Madam Chairman, I rise in very strong opposition to this amendment. The principal purpose of this amendment is to block the long overdue increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts provided in the bill. The gentleman is correct that the bill reported by the committee provides $160 million for the NEA, an increase of $35 million over the 2007 enacted level. I am very proud of that increase which I think is fully justified and broadly supported by the Members of this body. 
   It is important for Members to realize as they consider the committee's action that the $160 million recommended only partially restores cuts made to this agency a decade ago. In fact, the amount in this bill is still $16 million below the level provided in 1993. After adjusting for inflation, the amount recommended is $100 million below the level in 1993, as displayed on the chart in front of the Members. 
   As we debate the amendment, Members should also note that the National Endowment for the Arts has been transformed since the arts funding debate of the 1990s. Two gifted chairmen have reinvigorated the NEA into an agency with broad support. Chairman Bill Ivey, appointed by President Clinton, negotiated and then implemented bipartisan reforms in NEA's grant structure to ensure that funds go to activities for which public funding is appropriate. Dana Gioia, the current  chairman, then energized the agency with many new programs and a commitment to reach beyond the cultural centers of our major cities. Last year every single congressional district received NEA support through innovative programs such as American Masterpieces, Operation Homecoming and the Big Read. Today, NEA is truly a national program with outreach efforts to every corner of America and every segment of our society. 
   Each of us has different reasons to support the arts. Some will describe their support in terms of the inherent joy of the arts as a personally enriching experience. Others support the arts as engines of job development and economic growth. It is equally important to emphasize that except for a few members of the Flat Earth Society, there is little opposition to Federal funding for the arts and for the humanities. The culture wars are over. For each of the last 7 years, with the help of many Members in this Chamber, a bipartisan majority of the House has voted to increase funding for the NEA. During the last 2 years, Ms. Slaughter's and my amendments to add funds were adopted by voice vote without opposition. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do not normally include quotes in my floor remarks, but I was struck in preparing for this year's arts debate by a quote attributed to actor Richard Dreyfus at the Grammy awards ceremony: 
   ``Perhaps we've all misunderstood the reason we learn music and all the arts in the first place. It is that for hundreds of years, it has been known that teaching the arts helps to create the well-rounded mind that Western civilization, and America, have been grounded on. America's greatest achievements in science, in business, in popular culture, would simply not be obtainable without an education that encourages achievement in all fields. It is from that creativity and imagination that the solutions to our political and social problems will come. We need that well-rounded mind now. Without it, we simply make more difficult the problems we face.'' 
   I believe Mr. Dreyfus is right, and the committee has acted to provide the funding so arts can reach even more broadly into American communities with a richer variety of programs. 
   I urge defeat of the gentleman's amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I appreciate the gentleman's passion on this issue, but I do not agree that this is the time or the place to overturn the 25-year moratorium protecting our Nation's best ocean beaches and fishing areas. I agree that energy supply is vital to our Nation and our economy, but so is the natural environment. 
   Our committee has looked at this issue closely. The President's budget request and this committee's bill maintains the existing drilling moratoria for oil and natural gas exploration. I want to say that again. The President, who has been the strongest advocate for oil and natural gas development in the history of the country, in his budget opposes lifting this moratorium. I think we ought to listen to him this time. This leaves substantial areas in the Gulf of Mexico and off of Alaska that are available for exploration. 
   Our bill also continues the exploration and development of public resources onshore on our public lands. We really do not need to lift the moratorium now. The protected areas do not have substantial reserves. The total technically recoverable resources on the OCS are estimated to be about 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of gas. The amount under moratoria, or Presidential withdrawal, after January 9, 2007, is estimated to be 17.8 billion barrels of oil and 76.5 trillion cubic feet of gas.  
   I also point out, and maybe the gentleman from Pennsylvania disagrees with this, that the industry people I have talked to say it is impractical to pursue natural gas-only drilling, which does not involve oil. It simply is impractical to issue leases only for gas and not for oil, as well. 
   I think it is important that we do not start major new developments in areas that are entirely lacking drilling and energy infrastructure. These are large areas which are already leased and are available for development. Before we open large, new and sensitive areas to development, we should focus our Nation's efforts in places that already have access to existing pipelines and distribution systems. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Peterson amendment seems so very simple, but that is not a good approach to such a complicated issue. This amendment would not allow the various States to have meaningful input on drilling activities and the extensive development on-shore which would follow. 
   Please join me and continue our protection of America's priceless coastlines. Please defeat this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will ask for a vote on the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Again, I want to point out to the gentleman that we really do not need to lift the moratorium now. The protected areas do not have substantial reserves. The total technically recoverable resources on the OCS, the areas where we are drilling off of Alaska and in the Gulf are estimated to be about 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of gas. 
   The amount under moratoria, or Presidential withdrawal, after January 9, 2007, is estimated to be 17.8 billion barrels of oil, which is about one-fifth, and 76.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, which is about one-eighth. 
   So the reason we have the moratoria is because we think those areas are more important from an environmental perspective, that we need to protect our oceans and beaches. The gentleman from California was here and talked about the north coast of California. I represent the northern coast of Washington State, and I put this moratorium in place, I think, in 1984 for both Washington and Oregon. Mr. AuCoin and I did at the time. 
   I have yet to have one citizen in my State ever come up to me and say, why don't you let us drill for oil and gas off the coast of Washington? Nobody has ever asked us to do that. They want it  protected. It has got fisheries. It is one of the most beautiful beaches and coasts in the entire Nation. 
   I went up to see what happened with Exxon Valdez and see that oil spill and all that oil in and around the waters up there and how it destroyed the herring reproduction and all of the other species. 
   I want to protect the coast of Washington. I want to protect the coast of Florida, the coast of Virginia. Yes, we will drill off of Alaska. We will drill off the areas where the oil and gas exists. And if the gentleman from Hawaii is so interested in this, I am sure we can work out something for him out in Hawaii.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   I believe the report language beginning on page 100 very adequately describes and justifies the new Commission on Climate Change, adaptation and mitigation. As I noted in my opening remarks, we have tried in this bill to move the climate change debate beyond talking about whether global warming exists and, instead, focus on what we must do to deal with this as a reality. The recent reports of the international panel on climate change make clear that warming will persist for many years irrespective of any regulatory actions or technology breakthroughs which may occur in the near future. 
   Testimony before our subcommittee in April describes significant impacts already occurring. These impacts included increased wildfires, changing precipitation and water availability patterns, increasing presence of invasive species, changing migratory patterns for many animals and birds, and significant loss of habitat for many species. The 2-year Commission established in this bill is intended to help identify and jump start the science which can help our country and the world adapt to these changes. 
   The Commission brings together a panel of 15 of this country's science leaders, and is headed by the president of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Ralph Cicerone. Dr. Cicerone, who I have met with personally on this proposal, is one of the world's leaders in climate change studies. 
   While the use of advisory panels is common in guiding federally-funded science, this panel is different in two ways. First, it cuts broadly across all areas of Federal science in looking at the climate problem. I make no apology for that. This is a national and worldwide problem, and I think we need to think beyond the traditional agency or subcommittee's stovepipe approaches. 
   Second, the Commission has $45 million to begin implementation of its recommendations. Giving the commission implementation funds will make it both more credible and more effective. 
   This is not a large amount of money, but we believe it could get a few of the  most critical science initiatives going without having to wait for the 2009 funding cycle. 
   Chairman Obey has asked our subcommittee to be aggressive and imaginative in approaching the climate change challenge this year. We think that the funding, provided in this bill for the climate change adaptation and mitigation science, responds to that need, and I urge the funds be preserved. 
   The committee is aware, however, that a number of other committees are working on legislation in this area. Chairman Oberstar, from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has written us in support of our Commission, which he believes can be supportive of efforts in his committee. 
   We are also working closely with the Natural Resources Committee, and we understand how Science, as I mentioned earlier, will mark something up in July. I want to assure the Members that when we get to conference on this bill, presumably in September, I am going to try for July. We will give full consideration to any new legislation which may be adopted as we finalize fiscal year 2008 spending for climate research in our committee. 
   I think it would be a real tragedy for this House, on the first major amendment this year on climate change, to have a negative vote, to show that we still don't get it, that we still don't realize that the planet is at risk here. 
   So I urge the committee to stay with us. This was approved in the Appropriations Committee, and I think it's a very good Commission, and I think this thing will work and will help us adapt to the problems that we are going to face because of this. We have these problems on all of our Federal lands. We had a hearing on that. 
   I think this is an important amendment. I urge everyone to defeat the gentleman's amendment.

I commit to work with the gentleman to see what can be done to address the problems as this legislation moves forward to conference with the Senate. 
   I might point out that we did put $16 million in the bill for the rural water. There's going to be a competition. This had been an earmark in the past, but it got thrown out in 2007.     
   I have been calling over there to Mr. Grumbles at the EPA to try to get this thing moving as fast as possible so that the money gets out to the rural communities. And I commend the gentleman. This is a major problem. I have a lot of rural areas in my district, and every single one of them is having a terrible time getting the money to do the clean water issues. 
   Now, remember this too: When Christine Todd Whitman did her study, she came up with a backlog of $388 billion. So we are going to need a new authorization program. And I commend the gentleman for having one that focuses on the rural areas. And we have got to at least do that as a priority. 
   So I commend the gentleman and we will continue to work with him. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Texas has expired.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my point of order, and I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   The principal purpose of this amendment is to block the long overdue increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts provided in the bill. 
   The gentleman is correct that the bill reported by the committee provides $160 million for the NEA, an increase of $35 million over the 2007 enacted level. I am very proud of that increase, which I think is fully justified and broadly supported by Members of this body. 
   It is important for Members to realize, as they consider the committee's action, that the $160 million recommended only partially restores cuts made to this agency a decade ago. In fact, the amount in this bill is just $16 million below the level provided in 1993. After adjusting for inflation, the amount recommended is $100 million below the level in 1993 as displayed on the chart in front of the Members. 
   As we debate this amendment, Members should also note the National Endowment for the Arts has been transformed since the arts' funding debate of the 1990s. Two gifted chairmen have reinvigorated the NEA into an agency with broad support. Chairman Bill Ivy, appointed by Bill Clinton, negotiated, then implemented bipartisan reforms in NEA's grant structure to ensure that funds go to activities for which public funding is appropriate. Dana Gioia, the current chairman, then energized the agency with many new programs and a commitment to reach beyond the culture centers of our major cities. 
   Last year, every single congressional district received NEA support through innovative programs such as American Masterpieces, Operation Homecoming and the Big Read. Today, NEA is truly a national program with outreach efforts to every corner of America and every segment of our society. 
   Each of us has different reasons to support the arts. Some will describe their support in terms of the inherent joy of the arts as a personally enriching experience. Others support the arts as an engine of job development and economic growth. It is equally important to emphasize that here in the House we've had votes on this issue year after year after year. In fact, in the last 2 years, the votes on the Slaughter-Dicks amendment have been accepted on voice vote. 
   As far as I'm concerned, one of the things that I'm proudest of is the fact that we had a hearing this year and brought in artists from all across our country to testify about the arts and what it means not only in terms of educating our youth, but also what it means to the American people. 
   I'm always surprised that there are some on the other side of the aisle who always want to beat up on the National Endowment for the Arts. In fact, when Mr. Regula was chairman of the committee, an outstanding chairman, he put into place some very significant reforms which I supported. And what we emphasized was quality, that we don't have enough money to fund every single project, that we must emphasize quality. And that's what Mr. Ivy has done; that's what Mr. Gioia has done. And I want you to know the endowment is thrilled about this increase. They think they can spend this money wisely and effectively. 
   I just urge the gentleman to reconsider his amendment. I wish he would withdraw it and recognize and join all of us who support the arts here in the United States. I'd like to see us have a bipartisan approval of this bill, and particularly this particular increase for the Endowment for the Arts. And we also increase funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities. The humanities are very important to our country as well. 
   So I urge that we oppose this amendment and keep moving along. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard regarding the amendment by the gentleman from Utah? 
   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop). 
   The amendment was rejected.

   Mr. DICKS. I was somewhat mystified by the gentleman's amendment. He was talking about the border. As we understand it, the money for this amendment would go to Forest Service research, which is, as we understand it, $15.5 million over the old 2007 level, and $33 million over the President's level in our budget. We don't need any more money for the forest research. We've already very adequately and generously taken care of it. 
   I appreciate the gentlelady for yielding and for her great leadership over many years. I have always enjoyed being your partner on this important amendment, and now we're close to getting back to where we need to get.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have waited 30 years for the honor of presenting an Interior and Environment bill to the House of Representatives as subcommittee chairman. I am very proud to present H.R. 2643 to the committee as my first Interior appropriations bill. 
   The bill includes $27.6 billion for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service and Related Agencies under this Subcommittee's jurisdiction. This is an increase of $1.193 billion over the 2007 enacted level, or about a 4.3 percent increase. 
   Mr. Chairman, the recommendations reflected in the 2008 Interior bill are the product of a very deliberate and bipartisan process. Our Interior and Environment Subcommittee held 38 separate hearings over 3 months with more than 250 witnesses. The printed record of these hearings is included in eight volumes, totaling over 10,000 pages. 
   During these hearings, we heard from agency officials, Members of Congress and more than 100 Tribal leaders and other public witnesses. This testimony made it clear that substantial increases in environmental and conservation programs were badly needed. These sessions also highlighted the critical health and education needs in Indian country. 
   While the Office of Management and Budget and other Members of the House may criticize the overall size of the bill, I do not know of one increase in this package which can't be fully justified based on need or on the ability to spend the money wisely. Frankly, I don't think I have to remind Members that this bill started in a deep hole created more than a decade ago. 
   As Members have heard me say many times, and as this chart clearly demonstrates, in our hearings and other statements on the floor, between 2000 and 2007, based on OMB's own tables, funding for the Interior Department fell 16 percent in real terms. EPA has been reduced by 29 percent, and the Forest Service nonfire budget by 35 percent when adjusted for inflation. Given that history, I believe the 4.3 percent increase in this bill is well justified. 
   I might just mention that one of the most important powers that Congress possesses is the power of the purse. This is in the Constitution. This is one of Congress' major authorities and one way we can check the actions of the executive branch. 
   Now, while I do not go into all the details, a few of the increases and decreases deserve special mention this morning.     
   The bill provides a $223 million increase for our national parks, as proposed by the President, for the 10-year, $3 billion Centennial Challenge effort to restore the parks for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Park Service in 2016. The additional funds will support 3,000 badly needed new seasonal employees and 590 year-round staff. We also provide $50 million of discretionary funds for Centennial Challenge projects to be matched by private funds. These funds will support enhancements at our parks beyond the funding necessary for core operations. 
   We provide a $56 million increase for our national wildlife refuges, a 14-percent increase above the fiscal year 2007  enacted level. This will reverse the current staffing shortfall problem on our refuges, which have lost almost 600 staff members since 2004. 
   The bill provides a total of $5.7 billion for programs serving Native Americans. This is $235 million over the President's request for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. To address one of the biggest issues facing Indian country, Mr. Tiahrt and I have added $35 million above the request for a methamphetamine prevention initiative that spans both the BIA and the Indian Health Service. 
   The bill provides $2.8 billion for wildfire programs, an increase of $200 million over the current level. The President's budget had proposed more than $100 million in reductions in critical fire preparedness activities, which I believe both sides of the aisle considered completely irresponsible. The bill restores those cuts and provides an increase of $163 million over FY 2007 for wildfire suppression. As we see on television every day, and particularly out in the Lake Tahoe area, this year's fire season is shaping up to be one of our worst. The funds in the bill are the minimum necessary for the wildfire program. 
   We have also restored basic funding for the Forest Service, providing a total of $2.6 billion for the non-fire programs, which is $92 million above 2007 and $355 million above the President's request. This maintains important science, cooperative forestry programs, and land management, and also includes $65 million for a new Legacy Road and Trail Remediation Program to repair damaged roads and decommission those that receive little use, particularly in areas where we have many endangered species. 
   We have provided over $8 billion for the EPA, roughly a $900 million increase over the President's completely inadequate request. As Members know, the President had proposed more than half a billion dollars of cuts for the agency. We restore most of the cuts and provide a number of critical increases. Those include a $437 million increase above the request for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, $52 million above the request to clean up toxic and hazardous waste sites, $220 million for Clean Air State grants, $140 million for sewer and water grants in local communities, and $50 million for the new diesel emission reduction program. 
   This bill recognizes the importance of protecting and restoring a number of our Nation's most important water bodies by providing an increase of $65 million above the President's request for the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, Long Island Sound, Puget Sound, and 28 estuaries funded through the National Estuary Program and other grants for other targeted watersheds. 
   The bill provides an increase of $50 million for our cultural agencies to get them partially back to where they were in 1994. The National Endowment for the Arts will get a $35 million increase to $160 million and the National Endowment for Humanities would get an increase of $19 million for a total of $160 million. 
   One of our witnesses this spring, actress Kerry Washington, described the role of the arts in offering her a world beyond her inner-city neighborhood and giving her ``something to reach for and something to reach with.'' Hopefully, the money in the bill for the NEA and the NEH will give other young people the same kind of inspiration and opportunity. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to draw special attention to our recommendations with regard to climate change. It is now clear that global warming is occurring and that its effects will likely alter how we live in very serious ways. This reality was confirmed at hearings held by the Interior Subcommittee in April where witnesses from the Interior Department, Forest Service and other agencies described climate-related changes already occurring on the Nation's public lands. These impacts include increased wildfires, changing precipitation and water availability patterns, increasing presence of invasive species, changing migratory patterns for many animals and birds and significant loss of habitat for many species. 
   In response to this challenge, the subcommittee has made a series of recommendations. 
   First, we included in the bill the same Sense of Congress resolution on climate change which I offered last year and which was accepted by the Appropriations Committee during the 109th Congress. This appears as title V of this bill. It recognizes in statute that climate change is a reality, that human activity contributes to it in significant ways, and that this country must take action to address this very serious problem. 
   Second, the bill provides $264 million for various climate change activities throughout the bill, an increase of $94 million over the 2007 level; $199 million is provided for EPA climate programs; $67 million for the Department of the Interior, principally for the U.S. Geological Survey; and $22 million for the Forest Service. 
   Third, we set aside $2 million for the EPA to begin to develop the framework for regulation of greenhouse gases. The Supreme Court ruled in April that the agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This bill does not mandate the form of these regulations or set a specific deadline for producing the final regulation, but in law it says the process must begin in earnest during 2008. 
   Lastly, we establish a new temporary 2-year Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation and appropriate $50 million for its work. This commission will be chaired by the president of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Ralph Cicerone, a world-renowned authority on climate change, and will focus on the science issues related to how the world adapts to the reality of climate change. Its role is essentially that of a public-private advisory committee to identify the highest priorities for climate science investment for 2008 across the government. $5 million is provided to cover the cost of the commission for 2 years, with the remaining $45 million to be distributed to jump-start climate science at the various Federal agencies. 
   In summary, the message of this bill with respect to climate change is it is time to quit talking about the problem and start doing something about it. 
   Members should understand that this bill is not all increases. The subcommittee bill includes reductions below the 2007 level totaling over $400 million. This includes $135 million cut from construction programs throughout the bill and termination of a number of programs, including the Land Owner Incentive Program and Private Stewardship Program at the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   Mr. Chairman, as Members know, consideration of this bill was delayed for a while as the committee complied with the agreement to include Member projects in committee reports prior to bills being considered on the floor of the House. House Report 110-187, part 2, filed on June 22, fulfills this requirement. This report lists 228 projects requested by the Members of the House with a total cost of approximately $114 million. The financial disclosure certifications for these projects have been made available to the public, and we believe the filing of the report meets all requirements under clause 9 of rule XXI. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize that the $114 million in this bill for projects constitutes only four-tenths of one percent of the roughly $28 billion in this bill. When Senate projects are counted later, the total allocated to such projects will be less than 1 percent, or roughly eight-tenths of one percent. 
   As I said during the consideration in the full committee last week, many Members will, unfortunately, be disappointed by the project list included in this report. Based on the agreement reached earlier this year with House leadership, funding for Member projects has been reduced by 50 percent compared to funding for similar projects in 2006. 
   Because of this requirement to reduce funding for projects, Mr. Tiahrt and I agreed to concentrate limited funding, with a few exceptions, on critically needed water and sewer infrastructure grants and historic preservation grants. These are the two areas where we get the most requests. Projects requested in these areas were individually reviewed on a nonpartisan basis by our joint staffs working together to ensure that each project was fully justified based on both the quality of the proposal and the needs of the  communities. In the end, however, due to the limited amount of funding, hundreds of worthwhile projects could not be accommodated. I wish we could have done more, but this is the hand we were dealt. 
   I would just add to that, when Christine Todd Whitman was the head of the EPA, she said the backlog on these sewer infrastructure projects was $388 billion. So we are spending $140 million. It is just a little dent in this huge requirement that we have out there. 
   Mr. Chairman, before yielding to other Members for remarks, I want to say how much I have enjoyed working with Mr. Tiahrt as the Interior and Environment Subcommittee's new ranking member. We sat together for over 100 hours of hearings over 3 months, and we have met together privately with many of the agencies. It has been very hard work, but I think because of these efforts, we have a very good bill which should be supported by every Member of the House. I look forward to many years as chairman working with Mr. Tiahrt as my ranking member, or vice versa. 
   I also want to recognize the hard work of our exceptional staff on both sides of the aisle who have worked together as a bipartisan team throughout this process. I want to mention the staff: Mike Stephens, Chris Topik, Greg Knadle, Delia Scott, Beth Houser and Martin Brockman on the majority; Deb Weatherly, Dave LesStrang and Steve Crane for the minority; Pete Modaff and Kelli Shillito on my personal staff; and Amy Claire Brusch on Mr. Tiahrt's staff. 
   Before I finish here, I just wanted to say that I am very proud of this bill. I think it is a good bill; and as, Mr. Natcher said, it is a good bill and everybody ought to vote for it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DICKS. Madam Chairman, the amendment filed by the gentleman may not be considered en bloc under clause 2(f) of rule XXI. The rule states in part that amendments may only be considered en bloc if they do not increase either budget authority or outlays in the bill. 
   While the amendments proposed by the gentleman are offset fully in budget authority, the combined effect of the changes would increase outlays by $8 million, in violation of paragraph 2(f). The amendments are, therefore, not in order to be considered en bloc.

   Mr. DICKS. Madam Chairman, this amendment, if it were adopted, would eliminate nearly all land acquisitions that are high-priority projects that need to be done. It would leave only $1.6 million in the acquisition account, not even enough to continue to staff the program. 
   These are not new projects. These are inholdings. These are inholdings within lands that are owned by the Bureau of Land Management, and these are very important from both an environmental perspective and to lock up land. That's why the BLM favors the acquisition of these inholdings. 
   So I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Mr. DICKS. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
   First of all I want to say that I am a strong supporter of our national parks. And our committee takes a back seat to no one. My problem with this amendment is the source of the offset. 
   The bill provides a $223 million increase for our national parks, for the 10-year $3 billion Centennial Challenge effort to restore the parks for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Park Service.     
   The bill also includes $50 million in discretionary funds for the Centennial Challenge projects. These funds will support enhancements in our parks beyond the funding necessary for core operations. This is the best bill for the parks in decades, but I cannot support  a wholesale gutting of the important work done by the Environmental Protection Agency. The gentleman's amendment would severely cut two of EPA's most important programs. He proposes to reduce by $160 million the Superfund program that cleans up toxic waste sites across our country. 
   Currently, there are over 1,400 Superfund sites. More than 6 million people live within 1 mile of a Superfund site and 76 million live within 4 miles of these sites. 
   Our bill increases Superfund above the request. Why? Because as the Superfund program matures, the remaining sites are more complex, take longer to clean up, and require more funding. How do we explain the proposed reduction to those 76 million Americans? Do you ask them to wait even longer to remove the hazardous substances in their neighborhoods? 
   The amendment would also cut EPA's core environmental programs, those funded through the environmental programs and management account. 
   The account funds the activities which are the backbone of the Nation's environmental programs. EPA sets pollutant abatement standards. It issues permits to control these standards. It enforces those permits to ensure compliance with environmental standards. This account funds programs that control toxic air pollutants which threaten to poison our cities. 
   This account funds the Energy Star program, a program that most Americans know by name and trust, a program that has saved Americans $12 billion in energy costs in 2005 alone. This account funds the programs which license pesticides that control harmful exposures. This account funds programs which protect children, our most precious resource, from indoor air pollutants. With the geographic programs funded through this account, EPA helps to protect the great, and unfortunately threatened, waterways of our Nation 
   Madam Chairwoman, I am certainly a great supporter of the parks. I believe the underlying bill is proof of that. But I cannot support an effort to reduce the programs that are the fundamental basis for our Nation's environmental protection. 
   I urge a no vote on the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. DICKS. Madam Chairman, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and a number of distinguished Members from the Border Caucus. The committee has supported EPA's Mexican Border Program since its inception in 1995. Since that time, we have provided over $800 million for infrastructure projects along the border. I am proud of that and believe this program is an important one. 
   The bill as reported by the committee included $10 million for water and waste water infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexican border. This is the amount requested by the President, but $40 million below the level provided last year. Our committee took this action because of concerns about a slow spending rate in the program. Since that time, a number of Members, including a distinguished member of the committee, Mr. Rodriguez of Texas, have provided new information on this program. 
   Specifically, the reforms recently made to the design, approval, and construction process will ensure the funds are spent more quickly. Because of that information, I am pleased to offer this amendment on their behalf, which provides an additional $15 million for this program, for a total program of $25 million in fiscal year 2008.

   Mr. DICKS. Madam Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, I rise to say that we will be willing to accept this amendment. 
   I do want to point out to the gentleman, though, this bill already funds PILT $43 million above the level requested by the President. We have heard over and over again from various speakers on your side of the aisle that we have to get this bill down, not up. 
   But this is a very important program in the West, and therefore I am willing to accept it. But I want the gentleman to think about this in that context.

   I might mention that one of the programs over the years that I have been a big supporter of is the National Health Service Corps, which allows people to be trained and work in rural areas.

   Mr. DICKS. That is also correct. The committee includes language in our report directing the system to reduce the number of complexes. The increased funding is to be used to address staffing shortfalls, and the committee does not view the use of complexes as a sufficient means for managing refuges. 
   These complexes move the staff too far from the communities and resources that they serve, and we have asked that the number of complexes be reduced to the maximum extent possible.

   Mr. DICKS. Thank you. I appreciate that. 
   The language in title V of this bill is identical to language added by the Appropriations Committee last year to the FY 2007 Interior bill when the Appropriations Committee was being run by the minority party of today. Since that time, this sense of the Congress has been supported by both an international scientific body and the United States Supreme Court. 
   First, the sense of Congress states that ``there is a growing scientific consensus that human activity is a substantial cause of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.'' So far this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group consisting of hundreds of scientists from 113 countries, has issued two reports on the science of climate change, with a third report to be issued later this year. The panel's first report, issued in February, concluded that there is an overwhelming probability, at least 90 percent certainty, that human activities are warming the planet at a dangerous rate, with consequences that could take decades or centuries to reverse. The panel's second report on the consequences of global warming concluded ``with high confidence'' that greenhouse gases produced by human activity has already triggered changes in ecosystems on both land and sea. As evidence, the report cited longer growing seasons, earlier leaf-unfolding and earlier egg-laying by birds, traceable to human activity. The report estimates that 20 to 30 percent of the world's species could be in danger of extinction. 
   I have great respect for the gentleman from Texas, who I think did a good job as chairman of the Commerce Committee, but this is a sense of Congress. It's the authorizing committees that will enact the legislation. What this does is express concern that this problem must be addressed. 
   Clearly, the sense of Congress correctly captures the state of global change science. 
   Second, the sense of Congress states that mandatory steps will be required to slow or stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. In April of this year, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles. The court also held that EPA has the discretion not to regulate only under very limited scenarios. This decision has been widely interpreted to force the administration to propose regulations to control greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, the Supreme Court agrees with what I would consider our sense of Congress resolution. 
   Again, I state my opposition to the gentleman's amendment and urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlelady's amendment. EPA's proposed rule would weaken almost every air toxic rule issued since 1990 by allowing some air pollution sources to increase their emissions. EPA purports that the proposed changes would encourage more sources to strive for additional reductions of toxic air pollution. Yet the EPA cannot provide concrete data to support this assumption and has avoided quantifying the environmental impacts of this proposal. 
   In fact, when given the opportunity to comment on the proposal, EPA's own regional office expressed significant concerns about the increase in emissions that will likely occur from the revisions to the existing policy. 
   I congratulate the gentlelady on her amendment and urge that the committee accept it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, while straightforward is not what it seems. While it seems logical that we should not issue grants to any group that is in litigation with the agency issuing the grant, that could result in far-reaching consequences. Even the gentleman, I don't think, could predict accurately all of the implications of this. 
   For instance, this amendment could very well impact programs in Indian country. Many tribes choose to create, through separate organizing documents, an entity separate from the tribe that does not have sovereign powers and is organized exclusively for purposes described under IRC section 501(c)(3).     
   Here are some examples of non-profit groups within Indian Country: 
   United Tribes Technical College, the Inter-tribal Bison Council, the Affiliated Tribes of the Northwest, the Native American Chamber of Commerce, the National Congress of American Indians. 
   If organizations such as these were involved in any litigation against the Department of the Interior, they would be ineligible to receive grants. Now, I remind the Chair that many tribal organizations across the Nation are in litigation with the Department of the Interior. Are we to deny the services these groups provide to Indian Country because they have longstanding legal disputes with the U.S. Government? 
   In addition to Indian Country, there are many wildlife conservation groups whose grassroots members provide thousands of hours of services to agencies in this bill. Groups that help the agencies with natural resource education, wildlife and habitat management, maintenance and upkeep of our national wildlife refuges and parks, and many other important efforts. These groups would be denied grants to provide those services because their parent organizations are involved in litigation regarding a legitimate difference in policy with the United States. 
   I think this is an ill-advised amendment, and I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop). 
   The amendment was rejected.

   Mr. DICKS. I understand the gentleman's concern on this complex issue. And I also withdraw my point of order. 
   I understand the gentleman's concern on this complex issue, but the Bureau of Indian Affairs has a process for putting land into trust. We should not interfere with that process. 
   When an American tribe decides it wants to engage in gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act on a parcel of land that is not already into trust, it must go through an exhaustive application process that determines if a gaming establishment on newly acquired land will be in the best interest of the tribe and its members, and not detrimental to the surrounding community. 
   Additionally, the Department is currently drafting regulations that will implement section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by articulating standards that the Department will follow in interpreting the various exceptions to the gaming prohibition on after-acquired trust lands. We need to let that process go forward. 
   Even if the Department approves a tribe's request, the Governor of the State must also agree. To interfere with this process circumvents the Gaming Regulatory Act, interferes with an established process in the Bureau of Indian Affairs and should not be included in an appropriations bill. 
   And I want to say that again. This should be in an authorization bill. And if the gentleman is concerned, take it to the Natural Resources Committee or the committee of jurisdiction. That's where this should be worked out, not here on this appropriations bill.

   Mr. DICKS. And we need to let the Mexican wolf population have the same chance. 
   There is no doubt that there have been problems with the reintroduction, but we cannot cancel the entire program because of these isolated problems. There are programs in place that compensate livestock operators when wolves prey upon their stock. I am in favor of working to streamline and expand these programs. I am also in favor of pushing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to work more closely with the affected livestock operators. 
   Finally, I believe we cannot interfere with the Endangered Species Act, and that's what the gentleman is attempting to do here. His amendment would overturn the Endangered Species Act, something that we have never done on this House floor that I can remember, and I don't think we should start today. 
   I have experience with the Red Wolf Program at Point Defiance Zoo in the State of Washington where we regenerated the population, and then we introduced them into North Carolina. That program has worked very successfully. We have wolves in Alaska. We have wolves in Canada. There were wolves in New Mexico. And this is part of nature. 
   I think the gentleman is completely overreacting to this. I urge him to withdraw his amendment and not to try to overturn the Endangered Species Act here on the floor of the House. 
   I urge all my colleagues to vote strongly against this ill-considered amendment.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I make no apology for the amount of money in this bill to address problems in Member districts or the process through which projects were selected. I just want to tell the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Tiahrt and I did this on a bipartisan basis. We worked this out. Our staffs worked together. We went through these projects very carefully. We only approved one out of every ten projects that were requested by the Members. 
   Now, I would remind the gentleman that in the Constitution of the United States, the most fundamental power of the United States Congress is the power of the purse, the power of the Congress to redress grievances of the American people, to help on projects that are important to the Members' districts. 
   Now, in this budget, we also laid out all the projects that are requested by the President. I would just, as one example, point out to the gentleman that in 2004 in terms of STAG grants, there were $533 million; in 2005, $513 million. These are all earmarks.     
   In 2006, $282 million. In 2007, zero. In 2008, $140 million. This is responsible. The administration even says we met their test on earmarks. We went through these projects carefully, we looked at them closely, and we did it in a professional way. 
   So I would urge the gentleman to consider these facts. We are not going to be doing this the way it was done in the past, but we have the right to do it. And even the gentleman from Texas can't give away the power of the purse, because it is in the Constitution of the United States, and the Founding Fathers of this country stated that this was one of the most important powers that the Congress possessed. Throughout history, the British Parliament worked feverishly over the years to gain the power to be able to decide and limit the executive, the king in this case, of Britain. That was one of the most important powers that the Parliament developed over many hundreds of years. 
   So I am here tonight to defend our right to take care of our constituents, and I defend the process by which we did this. We did it in a professional way. We did it with both parties sitting in the same room looking at all these projects, helping each other, so we didn't make any mistakes. 
   I just want the gentleman to know how strongly I feel personally about this. We did a good job, and we cut it way back, and I thought the gentleman from Texas would be here applauding what we did, not attacking it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from New York for his participation on our subcommittee and for all of his good work during the year. 
   I must say, a performing arts facility in a town can be such a fantastic thing. One thing I hope my colleague from Texas remembers is that the local community has to match the money. I think in this case this is a grant of $150,000 to Save America's Treasures which clearly this is one of. And then the local community has to raise $150,000, and out of that there are improvements to the facility and the structure that are done over a period of time. 
   Again, as we analyzed all of these projects, this is exactly what we had in mind. This legislation was authorized by Congress. And I would mention also that Mrs. Bush has her program, the Preserve America Program, which our committee has supported. Mr. Tiahrt has been a strong supporter of that program. I saw Mrs. Bush the other night and I told her we were working hard together up here to try and preserve this program, which does exactly the same things as Save America's Treasures. There may be a nuance or two, but basically it is the same thing. 
   So again, I support the Hinchey project and oppose the gentleman from Texas's amendment. I appreciate the good work of my colleague from New York over all of the years we have been on this committee together.

   Mr. DICKS. This is an amendment that affects a project in my hometown of Bremerton, Washington. 
   The downtown Bremerton library building opened in August 1938. Now, that may sound recent, but, remember, Washington has only been a State since 1889. The building was funded under the Works Progress Administration. The WPA was one of Franklin Roosevelt's principal public works programs that helped America recover from the Great Depression. The building is constructed in an art deco style which was a signature style during the twenties and thirties and a favorite today of preservationists across the country. The building has a large rotunda with skylights. Because of its distinctive style, the library remains one of the most attractive buildings in downtown Bremerton. Like many art deco buildings, the library has a very bright color, in this case a vibrant yellow. 
   The downtown Bremerton library was constructed on land that has housed a library for nearly a hundred years. When this library opened in 1938, it served as the main library. The City of Bremerton and Kitsap County combined their library system in 1955. In 1978, a new headquarters library was built for the regional system and the downtown library became a branch library. 
   The library in downtown Bremerton has been undergoing rehabilitation for the last 1 1/2 years. The city invested $100,000 last year in general fund money and $100,000 from its community development block grant funds. These were matched with $100,000 from Kitsap County and $100,000 from the Gates Foundation. The moneys were spent replacing windows and doors, remodeling bathrooms, rebuilding the roof and other structural improvements which brought the building, to a reasonable degree at least, up to current building codes and took care of pressing life/safety concerns. This year, the city is spending an additional $200,000 in general fund money to replace the existing heating, cooling and air ventilation system, to remove asbestos from the heating plant and associated piping, replace much of the building's plumbing, and to rewire the entire building for additional electrical capacity and other modern communication equipment. 
   When I was a kid growing up in Bremerton, Washington, this was the library that I used to go to with my mother and father and my younger brother, Les. Bremerton is a city where we have the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, probably the most effective and productive shipyard in the United States. We have about 10,000 workers working there, and we have thousands of sailors who are home-ported in Bremerton and at the Trident submarine base at Bangor. I would like to think that this facility would be available to those men and women serving us in the military and for all of those thousands of government employees who work in the Kitsap County area. This is a good project. The money that we are providing, $150,000, will be matched by the city of Bremerton. They've already put in a lot of additional money. And this is a partnership. This is one of those good projects where there's a partnership. 
   I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this amendment and to support this worthy project. 
   I would also say, again, to the gentleman, this is such a dramatic reversal, what we have done on this side of the aisle on earmarks from the comparison when the other side took power. In 1994, there were about a thousand earmarks. In 2006, there were 13,000 earmarks. 
   The other thing I would suggest, too, it's one thing to go after the projects of your colleagues, but the President has what we would call earmarks, executive branch earmarks in this budget. If the gentleman was evenhanded in his approach, and I think he has been very fair in how he has selected these projects, but if he was evenhanded, he would go after some of the things that the President requests. As I said, the Preserve America Program is almost identical to Save America's Treasures, but I don't notice the gentleman offering an amendment on that particular project. No, I don't want to incentivize him, but I guess we can't because there is a unanimous consent agreement. 
   But, again, I appreciate what the gentleman is saying, and it is important. Dealing with the entitlements where two-thirds of our spending is has got to be done, and I hope that we can approach those problems just the same way as the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt) and I have approached this problem, with approving only one in ten of the projects that were requested from our colleagues. 
   Again, it is our power. Don't give up Congress's power of the Constitution, which is the power of the purse. That would be a tragic mistake that would haunt this House for many years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. DICKS. The gentleman is correct. Last year, when Mr. Taylor was chairman and I was the ranking member, Mr. Taylor wanted to accept this amendment, and I went along with Mr. Taylor. 
   However, this year, I am the chairman, and the Congresswoman, Ms. Solis, is concerned about this amendment and is opposed to it. 
   And let me just give you a little text of what she said. This amendment is based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of the study process incorporated in the legislation which she authored, which was signed into law on July 1, 2003, and would result in a change in the study design. 
   The San Gabriel River Watershed Study Act was signed into law on July 1, 2003, after a lengthy effort to build consensus, an effort which included outreach to and coordination with all the members of the San Gabriel Valley delegation, including representatives of Diamond Bar, La Habra, Industry, Chino Hills and the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County and the community of Rowland Heights. As a result of this effort, the legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives with broad support. 
   Congressman Radanovich noted in a letter to the editor on August 4, 2002, that, ``legislative process works best when those with differing views get together to resolve those differences and arrive at solutions that are responsible, workable and widely acceptable. That is what happened in this instance.'' The process by which this legislation was drafted and enacted was iterative and compromising. In fact, upon passage, Representative Pombo noted that this bill enjoys the broad support of both the majority and the minority and urged his colleagues to support it. 
   During this process, the boundaries of the study were clearly defined. According to the legislative text, the Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a special resource study of the following areas: the San Gabriel River and its tributaries north of and including the City of Santa Fe Springs, and the San Gabriel Mountains within the territory of the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, as defined in section 32603 (c)(1)(c) of the State of California Public Resource Code. 
   This study was directed to be done in consultation with Federal, State and local governments, including the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles River and Mountain Conservancy and other appropriate Federal, State and local government entities. These areas were chosen for their importance in the regional watershed. 
   During consideration of this legislation, the Department of Interior recognized the need for this study. It noted that: 
   ``The watershed of the San Gabriel River contains important natural resources which are disappearing throughout Los Angeles County. Continuous greenbelt corridors provided by the river serve as a habitat for breeding, feeding, resting or migration birds and mammals, which allows migration to take place throughout developed areas. The rugged terrain of the higher reaches of the watershed contain different vegetations, including rock outcroppings and vegetation native to the Pacific Coast foothills. This area also has a rich cultural heritage, which is evident by the large number of historically significant properties within the proposed study area. Among them is the Mission San Gabriel Archangel, founded in 1771 by the Spanish missionaries who were moving up the coast of California.''  
   The Department of the Interior also noted that this study would have to examine a number of alternatives for protecting resources in the area. Specifically, the Department of the Interior stated: 
   ``Alternatives to Federal management of resources are often considered in a special resource study for this type of area including national trail designations, national heritage area designations, and the provision of technical assistance to State and local governments for conservation of rivers, trails, natural areas and cultural resources. A study of an area where land ownership and jurisdictional boundaries are as complex as they are in the San Gabriel River Watershed would likely emphasize public-private partnerships.'' 
   What I can't do here, because the gentleman and the gentlelady from California have not been able to work this out, I can't accept this amendment when the gentlelady is in opposition to it. And I think what she's basically saying is that you should not be able to take out all of your jurisdictions from this study because they need to be in there to do a comprehensive study. That's how I view it.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his strong statement in support of the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   I would point out to my colleagues that in 1993 we had a $176 million budget for the NEA. That was cut by almost 50 percent, and over time this budget has been built back up. We have had many votes on this. The Slaughter-Dicks amendment has been voted on many times by the Congress and in strong support of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   Now, we didn't do this frivolously. Mr. Regula, when he was chairman, and I worked together and came up with some guidelines for the NEA. And I think the NEA has done a better job under Bill Ivey, Dana Joya, Jane Alexander, who have all been outstanding leaders of the Endowment. 
   This is important for the education of our children. This is also important because, as the gentleman from Connecticut mentioned, all 435 districts received a project. And when I was first on the committee, it was the big cities that got funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. That is no longer the case. 
   Also, it is a very major economic tool. The gentlewoman from New York has pointed out many times how the funding for the arts has caused a tremendous economic expansion in the country. And I think it is a very important point. 
   So let's continue to support the National Endowment for the Arts. I wouldn't want you all to go home and have to explain why you made this terrible, outrageously big cut on the arts. 
   But I just wanted to say that this is an important amendment. These groups all over the country are excited about Congress stepping up and increasing the funding.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (ON THE PASSING OF FORMER CONGRESSMAN JACK METCALF -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to join the other members of the Washington congressional delegation today in expressing my sadness at the passing of our former colleague Jack Metcalf, who represented the Second Congressional District of Washington from 1995 to 2001. 
   Jack came to Congress later in his career, having served for 4 years in the State house of representatives and 20 years in the Washington State Senate. And throughout his career in Olympia, he continued to teach in the Everett area at the high school, as he campaigned twice for the United States Senate against a very popular Warren Magnuson and as he built a cabin retreat that became a bed-and-breakfast business that he and his family operated, which was a special place for Norma and him. 
   He campaigned in 1994 for an open seat in Congress and promised to be an independent voice for constituents in the Second District. Having served with Jack during his 6 years in the House, I am able to confirm that he was every bit as independent as he said he would be. He came here as a well-established politician with well-established views, and he freely expressed those views with vigor and conviction. But along the way he also did two things that distinguished him, at least from my viewpoint as a colleague of his in the Washington delegation. First he established a high priority for constituent service, which I believe was critical to his job as Representative. He fought hard to help individuals who couldn't get responses from a Federal agency.     
   He supported veterans' causes. And even when it came to voting against party positions in his own caucus, he was for the veterans. Jack also cared deeply about natural resource issues, particularly salmon issues. He worked with Senator Murray on the Northwest Straits Commission. 
   Second, he valued friendship, and he always sought to keep the often-heated debate from becoming personal. When he spoke against a position another Member espoused, he would often cross the aisle and speak with that person personally, so you never took any of his comments directly as a personal affront. 
   Consequently, he was well regarded within our delegation, and I appreciated his friendship and his willingness to help on major State issues whenever he was asked. He will surely be remembered for the independence he demonstrated as a Member of Congress, but I can assure my colleagues in the House today that I will remember him as a real gentleman and a good friend. 
   He will be missed, and our hearts go out to Norma and his family. 
   I would like to yield to my colleague Mr. McDermott, who served with Jack in the Washington State Legislature before he came to Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Madam Speaker, amid the sharp debate over the Emergency Economic Stabilization Bill being considered this week in Congress we have heard dire predictions from both extremes warning of a financial Armageddon if we don't approve the bill or of squandering billions of taxpayer dollars if we do. Beyond the intense rhetoric though, there is a growing body of evidence of serious impacts in every American community this month as the shrinking credit market has already affected consumers' ability to buy cars, purchase inventory for their businesses, afford college loans, and obtain home mortgages. 
   And it's only going to get worse until Congress takes some action that will have a direct effect on the credit markets and on our confidence in the integrity of the U.S. banking system. 
   Unfortunately in the search for an appropriate remedy, I fear that ``perfect'' may have become the enemy of ``good.'' Warren Buffet put it bluntly in an interview when he was asked his opinion of the legislation we're considering this week. He said ``I don't think it's perfect, but I don't know that I could draw one that's perfect. I would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. And it would be precisely wrong to turn it down.'' 
   The Gallup poll conducted this week for USA TODAY indicated that more than half of all Americans--56 percent--say their financial situation has already been harmed by the financial meltdown of the 2 weeks, with 20 percent of our population saying they have been seriously harmed. The longer term outlook is even more gloomy.  
   In Washington State, the failure of one of our biggest banks--Washington Mutual--last week has been a local reminder of the gravity of this crisis, as was the Wachovia failure a few days later. Thousands of financial industry employees, including Washington Mutual employees in the Puget Sound area, will likely lose their jobs in this collapse, which has largely resulted from bad decisions made by executives that most Americans consider to be grossly overpaid. It's understandable for Americans to be angry and to oppose any direct bailout of Wall Street. 
   But a lot of the people who are being hurt by this crisis today are not overpaid bankers or stock market executives. They are working class families in our towns whose small businesses can't get credit for inventory or payroll and people down the street who are not able to obtain a car loan to replace a broken down automobile. 
   Economists remind us that auto sales are typically one of the first indicators of economic trouble. Last month, car sales dropped by 27 percent from September 2007, the slowest pace of auto purchases since 1991. The chief economist at J.D. Power and Associates, Bob Schnorbus, estimates that the credit crunch alone is responsible for more than 40,000 people being denied loans every month. And as the crisis has deepened in recent weeks, even people with good jobs and credit are having difficulty arranging auto financing. 
   The financial disruption is also affecting student loans--the primary way through which we as a nation open the doors of higher education to middle and lower class Americans. The buyout of Wachovia has limited the access of nearly 1,000 colleges to $9.3 billion the bank has held for them in a short-term investment fund. Many of these schools are struggling to meet their payrolls and other commitments, including scholarships, as we start another school year. 
   Over the longer term, if credit contracts further, so will the availability and affordability of student loans. If it closes the doors of higher education to American kids, this short-term financial crisis has the potential to result in a long-term loss of competitiveness in the global marketplace. 
   Small businesses are also feeling the burden. As my colleagues know, small businesses account for roughly half of the nation's total economic output and employ about 40 percent of the total U.S. workforce. The chief economist for the Small Business Administration noted in an interview this week that these businesses are either being denied capital to grow and add jobs or they are simply afraid to seek capital because they are scared of the direction of the economy. More than anything else, cutting off capital to small businesses will be an enormous drag on the economy and job creation over the long term. 
   The credit squeeze is already having a downstream impact on our economy. Consumer spending this quarter appears to be declining for the first time in 17 years. Last month, unemployment reached a 5-year high--6.1 percent--and new filings for unemployment hit the highest level since just after the September 11th attacks. Factory orders are down, and manufacturing activity has fallen to the lowest level in seven years. 
   Two major employers in the rural areas in my district--Port Townsend Paper and Grays Harbor Paper--are victims of this loss of confidence. These firms, both critical to employment in their respective cities, have stated that they are already taking steps to protect themselves from a recession, holding off on investments and new hires as they prepare for a decline in sales. 
   So with mounting evidence that the impact of this crisis is being felt well beyond Wall Street, I am supporting this bill. I am not doing so in order to boost the salaries of Wall Street executives, but so that janitors and nurses and secretaries and teachers and car dealers in my district can keep their jobs. I am supporting this bill so that kids and their parents will still have the access to affordable loans to go to college--an advantage I had as a young man. 
   I am not suggesting this is a perfect solution. But like Warren Buffet, I would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. And I am absolutely convinced that we must take action very soon before the credit crisis deepens and before it affects the lives and livelihoods of even more of our friends and neighbors. The time to act is now. This is the only option before us. We must pass it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Madam Speaker, less than 2 weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke issued a solemn warning to the President and Congress about the increasingly fragile state of the Nation's economic and banking system. They expressed their belief that, without prompt congressional action, widespread failure of financial institutions on Wall Street and across America threatened to send the Nation into an economic crisis not experienced since the Great Depression. 
   In the past few months, as my colleagues know, several financial institutions in the United States have failed, have been acquired by other companies through government intervention, or have been sustained only with Federal assistance. In the last 2 weeks, the number of failures has accelerated at an alarming rate, including the failure of Washington Mutual in my State, resulting in the loss of thousands of jobs. The Washington Mutual situation has underscored for me and my constituents the depth and seriousness of the crisis and has emphasized how our action is needed not simply for Wall Street, but also for Main Street. 
   Even without the collapse of Washington Mutual, it is clear to me that the growing crisis of liquidity could have devastating effect on my constituents and on the middle class throughout America. Companies failing because of an inability to manage their debt would not just be isolated to lower Manhattan; indeed, all of our congressional districts have businesses large and small that rely on the ability to access credit to survive. These businesses may well fail, too, if this crisis is allowed to continue without intervention. Retirees and workers alike are facing the loss of their retirement funds and pensions if they are invested in the markets on a scale not seen in 80 years. 
   It is that backdrop and with the advice of some of the wisest and most financially astute members of the House a well as financial experts from my state, that I am now convinced Congress must act quickly to avoid these disastrous consequences. 
   It was obvious to me that the legislative proposal initially drafted by the Bush administration was overly broad and lacking of any substantive or independent oversight by Congress or any clear safeguards for American taxpayers. After 10 days of intense, often around-the-clock negotiations, the original proposal drafted by Treasury Secretary Paulson has been dramatically improved in the legislation that is under consideration by the House of Representatives today. In addition to helping stabilize the U.S. economy by authorizing the Treasury to acquire mortgage-backed securities, enabling the release of credit for American consumer and businesses, this bill provides strict, independent oversight to assure that the program is carried out properly. The provisions of this legislation will help existing homeowners to stay in their homes and continue to make payments and the bill includes specific provisions to ensure that taxpayers are insulated from any losses sustained in this program. And I am encouraged that, for the first time, the bill places clear restrictions on so-called ``golden parachutes'' and executive compensation for companies participating in the new program. 
   I believe the revised version of this legislation represents a substantially more responsible and prudent means of addressing this crisis, and it is my intention to support it. I recognize that many of my own constituents have deep reservations about this package. So do I. I recognize that it may not be perfect. But I believe it is a responsible action and that it is in the best interests of our Nation at this critical time. And I also believe that the consequences of not acting today could be devastating. It is therefore my intention to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation, which, thankfully, reverses years of decline in Federal Government spending on environmental programs. JOHN SPRATT has made wise decisions on Function 300. 
   Last month, I testified before the Budget Committee, urging increased spending on these important programs. The chairman said he would consider my request, and he is a man of his word. I am pleased to say that the programs included in Function 300 will be funded at a level $2.6 billion, or 9 percent above what the President requested in his budget, and $15.7 billion between 2008 and 2012. 
   This budget resolution rejects the President's proposal to further cut the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Fish and Wildlife Service Refuge Program, and EPA's Clean Water Assistance Program. In addition, the budget resolution accepts the best idea in the President's budget, and that is to increase funding for the national parks. The Ryan amendment in 2008 would cut $1.5 billion below current services and $4.6 billion between 2008 and 2012. 
   Many of the numbers contained in the President's budget were bleak. The President proposed a budget for these programs which was $2.8 billion less than what is required to maintain current levels of service. For example, funding for EPA faced a reduction of $508 million, the Forest Service down $343 million. The funding for the Park Service would have been reduced by $237 million. And, worse, the President's proposed cuts after 7 years of steady decline are severe. The Interior Department has been cut by 16 percent, EPA by 29 percent, the Forest Service by a whopping 35 percent. These cuts have evidently led to declines in services for visitors to our parks, refuges, and forests and to dramatic reductions in assistance to State and local communities for environmental and conservation activities. 
   I urge you to vote against the Ryan amendment and vote for the Spratt budget if you care about the environment of our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4140, a bill to designate the Port Angeles Federal Building in Port Angeles, Washington, as the ``Richard B. Anderson Federal Building.'' 
   Private First Class Richard B. Anderson was born in Tacoma, Washington on June 26, 1921 and graduated from Sequim High School in Sequim, Washington. Private Anderson entered the Marine Corps in 1942 and eventually joined his last unit, Company E, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marines in San Diego, California. He departed for Roi-Namur, an island in the northern part of the Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands, with his unit in January 1944. 
   While hunting enemy snipers on Roi-Namur, PFC Anderson, a member of the invasion force, hurled himself on a live grenade in a shell hole to save the lives of three Marines. Anderson was evacuated to a ship, where he died of his wounds on February 1, 1944. For his heroic actions, PFC Anderson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House is now considering legislation that will honor PFC Anderson for his heroic efforts on Roi Island. Specifically, this legislation would rename the Federal Building in Port Angeles, Washington after Richard B. Anderson. I urge the House to adopt this important legislation.

I was pleased to have been able to participate in this panel that was ably led by my friend from New Jersey, Mr. HOLT. 
   Because we cannot comment in any detail on the classified accounts in this bill, I hope it is useful to my colleagues to hear that the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel undertook thorough reviews of the classified accounts, including many probing sessions with representatives of the intelligence agencies. In the end, the panel made recommendations on the classified accounts to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and the bill before us today reflects those recommendations. 
   Mr. Chairman, like all other agencies of the Federal Government, the intelligence agencies need to be subject to oversight and accountability. I believe that we have done that in developing the appropriations levels that are provided for in the classified accounts of this bill. 
   I also would like to call attention to a few additional areas of the bill that I think are significant. Equipment shortfalls for our Guard and Reserve forces have been an area of real concern to the committee. In order to continue to address this, the bill adds $925 million, $700 million of which is designated for the Army National Guard. 
   Recognizing the need to help the Army provide the facilities that it needs as it deals with the combined effects of growing its forces, rebasing its forces and transforming to the modular force, the bill adds $1.25 billion for facilities sustainment and restoration. These funds will be used to fix barracks, improve childcare facilities and enhance community services at installations around the world. 
   The Navy has some challenges too, some of which this bill attempts to address. In shipbuilding, the bill adds $3.7 billion above the budget request to provide funds for an additional five ships. Furthermore, I am pleased that the bill fully funds the account for ship depot maintenance to ensure that the Navy can continue to maintain the readiness of its current fleet. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, I point out that the bill funds a 3.5 percent pay increase for our military personnel, and it includes $2.9 billion (an increase of $558 million over the budget request) for family advocacy programs, childcare centers, and dependent education programs. 
   There is much more that is very good about this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote to support it.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, when we first had the forest plan, the major reduction in timber harvesting, we worked on a bipartisan basis to get an offset. I think it was like $250 million, something like that, and a phase out over a number of years. But I realize some of the schools, especially in Oregon, get a very substantial amount of money for this program, and I hope we can find an offset.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. Obey, for the work that he has done on this bill. I had some reservations, I must say, when we started down this road. But I now realize that Chairman Obey and our counterpart chairman in the Senate had a good plan to put this thing together. 
   I regret that last year we did not pass 9 of the 11 appropriations bills. Thank goodness, we passed Defense and Homeland Security. And I do think it is important to point out, and I am sure Mr. Obey did this, that we passed most of the bills except for HHS in the House. 
   So I do not blame our colleagues here for what happened. It was the other body that refused to bring the bills up in a timely way. 
   Now, we have, you know, we had a difficult hand that we were dealt. There is some very good programs like rural water development and some very important school money that we could not include because they were earmarks. 
   But I do think it is important for everyone to recognize that, for Indian Health Services, we were able to increase that by $125 million. If we had not done that, hundreds of thousands of members of the tribes would not have been able to get health care. 
   We were able to take care of the LANDSAT for the U.S. Geological Survey, plus $16 million; U.S. Forest firefighting costs, plus $70; EPA Homeland Security hazard, plus $9.5; and operational shortfalls. 
   One of the biggest problems we have with our land management agencies is that they do not have enough money in the President's budget to cover fixed costs, and 80 to 90 percent of their costs are employees. So when that happens they have been, over the last 7 years, forced to cut employment, not fill vacancies. This has affected the Park Service. This has also affected the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service. They are all hurting. They do not have enough resources. So we have some very major issues that we have to deal with. 
   Conservation has been hit by this administration. From 2001 to 2006, the Interior budget has been reduced by 1.2 percent in real terms. EPA has been cut by 6.6 percent. We put these two agencies together in this bill. 
   So this is a question of priority; and what I am hopeful of, with the new majority and with a new budget and with a new allocation, we will be able to stop the bleeding in these conservation agencies. No one has been a bigger supporter of these agencies than the chairman of the committee who has worked with me on a series of conservation initiatives over the years, but this is a serious problem that we have to face up to. 
   You know, we may have to work to get new legislation enacted in order to increase the amount of money. The land and water conservation money, the amount of money that the administration proposed, has never shown up in the budget. So it is time for us to find some new solutions.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your kindness. 
   The resolution that is being considered in the House of Representatives today expresses a very clear message to the American people that it is time to change the direction of our policy in Iraq. 
   The meetings and communications that I have had with people from the Sixth Congressional District from the State of Washington have made it clear that the people I represent want to hear from Congress. My resolve in this is strengthened by the loss and grief I have heard from families in my district whose loved ones have been lost or injured in this conflict. 
   I also deplore the mistakes by this administration: failing to deploy enough troops to stabilize Iraq, disbanding the Iraqi Army, failing to provide jobs and economic restoration. Those are but a few. 
   It has been 4 years since U.S. and Coalition Forces invaded Iraq based on what was faulty intelligence. The premise for our military action against the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq was that he had weapons of mass destruction, and even the President has now acknowledged that this determination resulted from an incorrect interpretation of intelligence information. 
   With more than 3,000 U.S. military personnel killed and thousands more wounded, people across the Nation, including many Members of Congress, are questioning our continued involvement very seriously and very legitimately, especially since the President has now ignored the advice we know he received from many senior military advisors and has decided to increase the number of military troops deployed to Iraq. It is time for this Congress to speak clearly and forcefully in opposition to this escalation and in support of changing course in Iraq. 
   In this resolution we are clear that our determination that American forces have accomplished everything they have been asked to do in Iraq courageously and with the professionalism the Nation expects of the best-trained and best-equipped military in the world. These troops have not let us down, to be sure; but in many ways they have been let down by a policy that ignores the reality of their situation, and by a Commander in Chief whose only response to what is unmistakably a civil war in Iraq is to place more American troops in harm's way while sectarian violence plays out in the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. 
   Day after day, U.S. service people are being killed and injured by bullets and bombs traded by Shiite and Sunni zealots for reasons that predated our involvement and which will likely endure long beyond the time we finally leave Iraq. 
   For the past 4 years, I regret that the Republican leadership of Congress has abdicated much of its oversight responsibility for the Iraq war and its funding. To date, the Bush administration has not adequately explained to Congress or the American people the reasons for our continued military involvement in Iraq. In announcing his intention to send more than 21,000 additional troops to Iraq, last month the President said it is time for the Iraqi Government to act, to take charge of their security and to begin to govern themselves. 
   What we in Congress are saying now is that we believe the Maliki government in Iraq will be more apt to accomplish that goal if we do not send more American troops into Baghdad and if we signal to Iraqis that we are planning for a phased withdrawal from their country. That is what we must do to change the policy that keeps our forces acting as the local police officers on the streets of Baghdad, and to give the Iraqi people greater incentive for taking charge so that our troops can begin to come home. This was a view of the bipartisan Iraqi Study Group, which pointed to a compromise recommendation calling for gradual drawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq. 
   It is instructive to recall the views expressed by many of the generals on the ground, including General Abizaid, General Casey, General Petraeus, that this conflict cannot be won militarily; it will require a political solution. That political solution requires the involvement of other regional governments, including Syria and Iran. 
   All Americans, certainly every Member here in the House of Representatives, wants the Iraqi Government to succeed and to become the stable democracy we had hoped to achieve at the outset of our involvement. None of us want Iraq to fall into chaos and to become a haven for terrorists, including al Qaeda. But the current U.S. policy and the proposed escalation of a number of American troops offers little promise, I am convinced, of accomplishing those goals. 
   Even the recently completed National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, which the President presumably relies upon, concludes that the war, as it is currently being prosecuted, will not or cannot bring about these results. My colleague, Mr. Murtha, has also suggested that it will be up to the Iraqi people themselves who will expel what remains of al Qaeda in the country, and I believe there is merit in his argument.     
   This is an important debate, Mr. Speaker, and one that is perhaps long overdue. We as a new Congress, led by a new Democratic leadership team, must communicate that we are placing a firmer hand on the tiller of this ship of state and that we are demanding greater accountability for both the policy and funding of the Iraq war. This new direction starts with a brief and declarative statement, that ``Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq,'' but it must be followed by that harder task of guiding our military policy through aggressive oversight and more careful direction of our political and military leadership by all of the relevant committees here in Congress. 
   That is our task ahead, Mr. Speaker, and as a member of the Defense appropriations subcommittee, I am prepared to do my part.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (PUGET SOUND WATERSHED COMPREHENSIVE CONSERVATION PROJECT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3184, a bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a competitive grant program for the Puget Sound area to provide comprehensive conservation planning to address water quality. 
   For generations, Puget Sound has been the most important geographic feature driving human settlement in the region--first Native American communities followed by the 4 million people who now call it home. With 2,500 miles of shoreline and 2,800 square miles of inland marine waters, it is the second largest estuary in the United States after Chesapeake Bay. Puget Sound is environmentally, culturally and economically linked to Washington State's way of life and it is truly one of America's most spectacular bodies of water, with more than 200 species of fish, 25 kinds of marine mammals, 100 species of sea birds as well as clams, oysters and shrimp. 
   But the health of Puget Sound is in decline--its waters are experiencing the stress of growth and development and its ability to sustain the abundant fishery we've always enjoyed is in doubt. Around the Sound we have detected low levels of oxygen and increasing concentrations of toxic substances in aquatic animals. With the overall health of this great ecosystem in decline, we have launched a cooperative effort involving all of the local government entities around the Sound, as well as the State and Federal governments, to curtail any harmful substances from being introduced into its waters, to change unwise industrial and agricultural practices and to continue aggressively our research into the causes of pollution in this historically pristine inland sea. 
   One of our responses must be to encourage innovation and action at the local level and to help local communities recognize the importance of incremental actions in the overall solution. Congressman RICK LARSEN and I have introduced H.R. 3184, the ``Puget Sound Watershed Comprehensive Conservation Project Act of 2007.'' This legislation is supported by all Members of the Washington State congressional delegation. It would authorize a total of $25 million in grants to assist non-Federal governmental or non-governmental organizations, Tribes, and individuals in implementing land management practices and projects that improve water quality and habitat for fish and wildlife in the Puget Sound watershed. 
   H.R. 3184 authorizes conservation projects that will target innovative conservation measures where they do the most good. The program is intended to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies while leveraging Federal investment in environmental enhancement and protection, in conjunction with agricultural production. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal government is playing a very important role in restoring the health of Puget Sound, and I believe H.R. 3184 can make a vital contribution to this effort. I urge adoption of the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the omnibus appropriations bill. 
   For better or worse, it is the Appropriations Committee that is charged with the job of making the difficult choices that provide the best mix possible of funding levels for competing programs. The interior and environment portion of this bill is the product of the difficult choices that had to be made as a result of the President's insistence that we cut $22 billion from the levels approved by the House 6 months ago. 
   The final allocation for the Interior Subcommittee was $26.6 billion, essentially flat funding at the 2007 enacted level, because we were unable to achieve a compromise with the President that would have allowed for modest growth in the Interior and related agencies as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. I would remind my colleagues that since 2001, these same accounts have been reduced drastically. Interior has been cut by 16 percent, EPA by 29 percent, and the nonfirefighting accounts in the Forest Service by more than 35 percent. 
   In allocating these funds in this omnibus bill, our subcommittee, on a bipartisan basis, could have frozen funding for all programs at the Department of Interior, EPA, the Indian Health Service, and the Forest Service at the 2007 enacted levels. Alternatively, we could have approved deep reductions proposed by the President for the Forest Service, Indian health clinics, fire preparedness programs, clean air State grants, PILT payments or Land and Water Conservation Fund and Conservation Grants. 
   We did not choose either of these approaches. Instead, we chose to produce a conference version that was consistent with the priorities established in the House-passed Interior appropriations bill, reflecting the input from Members on both sides of the aisle and from 41 hearings held by our subcommittee this spring. The final version reflects the input of hundreds of individuals and organizations during these hearings. 
   The bill includes an increase of $123 million for the National Park Service operational accounts to fund an additional 1,500 FTE positions. This staff will help reinvigorate the Park Service for its centennial in 2016. An additional $24 million is included as interim funding for the new centennial matching grants program for 2008. This will get the program going while the authorizing committees complete negotiations to find a funding source for this new mandatory program. An increase of $39 million is provided for our national refuge system to begin refurbishing our refuges and replacing the 600 positions which have been lost since 2004.     
   $145 million is provided for the National Endowment for the Arts, an increase of $20 million, to partially restore this program to the levels 12 years ago. The gentlewoman from New York has been my partner as we fought to restore this program to the levels of 12 years ago. 
   The bill includes an increase of $165 million for the Indian Health Service to cover medical inflation and ensure adequate medical care for Native Americans, one of this country's most disadvantaged populations. 
   An increase of $169 million over the 2007 level is provided for various firefighting programs, $81 million more than requested by the President. And $188 million is provided for climate change programs, including $43 million for the EPA and $32 million at the U.S. Geological Survey. Included for the USGS is $7.5 million to expand its climate research, of which $2.5 million is for a new global warming and wildlife center. 
   $20 million is provided for the EPA geographic program to ramp up the cleanup of Puget Sound, which is the Nation's second largest estuary and which has been in serious decline. 
   In this bill, we have also addressed the very serious environmental challenges that exist in the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, and other major bodies of water in the United States. These increases represent a significant redirection of funds to priorities which we believe serve the country's present and future needs and have not been adequately addressed by President Bush. But the President's requirement that our bill be reduced by $1 billion below the original House level has forced us to make very painful reductions. As I said at the beginning, these were tough choices. 
   Mr. Chairman, in concluding these remarks, I want to thank Mr. Tiahrt. And I would like to say to my colleagues on the Republican side, I have never seen a year in which Democrats and Republicans at the committee level, at the subcommittee level have worked better and have had better information on both sides of the aisle and have worked to adequately address earmarks to reduce the number of these earmarks very dramatically. So I would say that there has not been a lack of cooperation. There has been outstanding cooperation on the entire subcommittee.

   As chairman of the Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, I have examined the Bush administration proposals to eliminate funding for the USGS minerals information function. Even during these difficult budgetary times, our subcommittee has appreciated the important function of the minerals assessment team at the USGS and refused the administration's recommendation to eliminate its funding. 
   The Pearce amendment would nearly double the size of the new agency. It would create a new bureaucracy with at least 300 staff and a yearly cost of $30 million or more. So please join me in rejecting this amendment. 
   I yield to the former chairman of the Interior subcommittee, Mr. Regula from Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives today is faced with a regrettable decision on the eve of the adjournment of the first session of the 110th Congress. With the appropriations bills that fund the routine operations of all of the departments and agencies of the Federal Government now approved by both Houses of Congress, we are once again being asked to provide additional funding for the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House has already expressed its view on this question when we voted on November 14th to approve $50 billion in supplemental defense funding with three very clear and very reasonable conditions: that our troops should be properly trained; that our forces will not use torture when conducting interrogations of enemy combatants; and, that we should establish a goal of redeploying all offensive troops from Iraq by the end of 2008. It would have been easy--and appropriate--for the President to sign the bill that was approved by a majority of the Members of this House and supported by a majority of Americans, rendering the debate we are having today unnecessary. The President has remained stubbornly determined to continue our involvement in Iraq without clearly defining a plan for the eventual re-deployment of our troops, and he has stated his intention to veto any legislation that attempts to change the course he has set. 
   After more than 4 1/2 years, it is clear that our Nation's involvement in Iraq has cost far too much. It has cost the lives of nearly 3,900 men and women in our military and it has affected the lives of many thousand more who have been seriously wounded--both physically and psychologically. It has cost at least $450 billion in national debt to date, with hundreds of billions more in future costs that will be incurred no matter how quickly we are able to extricate ourselves. It has also seriously diminished our military readiness and our ability to respond to other national security threats. And finally, our initial invasion and our protracted 
   involvement in Iraq has diminished our international prestige and made it more difficult for the United States to exert leadership and influence around the globe. 
   It is against this backdrop that we in Congress have been working toward a strategy of timely redeployment of our troops that I believe is both militarily appropriate and necessary for encouraging the Iraqi government to assume greater control of the security of the Iraqi people. It was discouraging to me on our visit to Iraq last month led by the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Jack Murtha, that the Iraqi government has clearly not taken advantage of the improved security climate, brought about largely by the increased numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq during this past year. President Maliki and his government have not taken the steps they pledged to take in national reconciliation, in the distribution of the oil revenues or in several other key benchmarks that were established as indicators of progress. 
   On the face of it, the provision that has been sent to us by the Senate appears to be strictly about providing funds for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is true that these funds would ensure that the soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen in harm's way are protected and continue to have the equipment, the supplies, the fuel, and the transportation resources that keeps them fed, repairs their equipment, treats their medical needs, and allows them to continue to operate. The reality, however, is that these funds will necessarily have an impact on our entire military. Because of the immediate need to protect troops in wartime conditions, all of the men and women in uniform--as well as the civilian workforce of the Defense Department--are caught in the position of having to curtail important operations that underpin the very readiness of our forces, not just for Iraq, but for all aspects of our nation's defense. 
   The Army is on the leading edge of these impacts with installations across the country already having been notified to prepare for curtailing operations in the middle of February. The Army can keep going that long only by accelerating 
   spending regular operations funds intended to last for the entire year, and by reprogramming other funds to the maximum allowed in law. If no further action is taken on this funding, the Army intends to furlough as many as 100,000 civilian employees and a comparable number of contractor personnel. In addition, it will sharply reduce travel, training, maintenance and child care and other day-to-day activities at installations across the Nation. And we know that the Marine Corps is close behind the timing of the Army in experiencing these impacts, all of which will exacerbate the level of readiness already diminished by our long involvement in Iraq. 
   So it is frustrating for me and for many Members of this House to be presented with the Hobson's choice that we have before us today: whether to impose a terribly chaotic situation on the entire U.S. military or whether to approve another substantial increment of funding for the Iraq war without any clear and well-articulated strategy for the eventual re-deployment of American troops. We are presented with this choice by a President who is unwilling to consider any change whatsoever in our strategy in Iraq and who has clearly not listened to the will of the American people or the views of their representatives here in Congress.  
   I have reluctantly concluded at this point that a vote to deny these funds now could potentially harm the troops in theater and could seriously diminish the condition of all of our military forces who still face other threats around the globe. Out of a responsibility to the men and women in uniform, to their families, to the civilian workforce in DOD and to our Nation's overall security, I intend to vote in favor of this resolution. 
   At the same time, it is my intention to continue working with what I believe is a growing majority here in Congress and a solid majority in the country to advocate for a major change in the direction of our policy in Iraq, and for the prompt re-deployment of the U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq.

   Mr. DICKS. The W.A. Young & Sons Foundry and Machine Shop is truly an American treasure. This remarkably well-preserved shop is an example of the once-common, shaft-driven job shop which played an important role in maintaining and repairing the machines that built early industrial America. 
   This rare industrial facility contains machining and foundry equipment dating back to the mid-to-late 1800s. When the shop doors were shuttered more than four decades ago, everything, the tools, drills, nails, presses, lathes, wooden molds and patterns were left behind, creating a priceless time capsule from the turn of the century. 
   The machine shop and foundry are still able to operate, but the structure of the facility has severely deteriorated and is in desperate need of repair and restoration in order to preserve the  facility and the historic equipment within. And I would assume that's why it hasn't been open; they're waiting to do the repairs.

   Mr. Chairman, I would also point out to the gentleman that the precedent on this Save America's Treasures has been to split the money 50/50; 50 percent would go to the administration and they would then make decisions on a competitive basis. The other 50 percent would be earmarked by the Members of Congress. 
   I think that process works well. Congress has the right to do this under the power of the purse. This is one of our most important constitutional rights. There is nothing wrong with it. The Supreme Court has never questioned it. It is part of our constitutional history. 
   I just want to also join my friend from Kansas and say that I support this project. I urge that the Flake amendment be rejected and that we support this project. It has been carefully vetted.

The salaries and expenses level has come down to where it was in 2007. And we didn't do this as a punitive measure, we did this to send a very strong message, as the gentleman has in his very eloquent floor statement, and that message is we want the Smithsonian Board of Regents to reform the Smithsonian. 
   We all respect and admire and love the institution ourselves. We want to, and I personally hope we can in conference restore funding after they have made the appropriate changes that the committee has talked to them about. I think that is happening as we speak. 
   I have had a chance to talk to a number of the regents and Members of the House who serve as regents, and I am confident that they are on the right track. We hope by the time we get to conference, we will all be satisfied that they have reached the goal of reforming and changing so that the House and the other body can feel confident in funding them at the appropriate level.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Murtha of Pennsylvania. But as was mentioned by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, there are four congressional districts involved in this. I don't know if people from the other districts, I guess they didn't request it or else it would be listed because we've tried to list it where there were multiple names involved. 
   Mr. Murtha is a former member of this subcommittee and this project has been funded for many years. When your party was in the majority, there were a number of years in which this project was funded. The previous chairman, Mr. Taylor, and others have been supportive of this project.

   Mr. DICKS. I'll be very brief. 
   The point I would make is that we only funded one out of 10 requests. So there was a lot of judgment made by both sides of the aisle working together to pick those projects that had a history, that were authorized in many cases. So I think there was a very careful vetting of this process. There are a lot of Members who are mad at me because they didn't get their project. This one met the test and was funded. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).

   Mr. DICKS. I thank the gentleman for his amendment. The gentleman has discussed this amendment with all of us. The bill includes an increase of $11.8 million, as you have mentioned, above the President's request for EPA enforcement. That is enough money to bring the EPA's enforcement level back to levels that we saw earlier in this decade. The majority has no objection and accepts the amendment.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   Am going to be brief here. This would be a devastating cut on this bill. I want to say something to the gentleman. These bills do have consequences. 
   Over the last 7 years, since this administration took power, the Interior Department's budget has been cut in real terms by 16 percent. The EPA's budget has been cut in real terms by 29 percent, and the Forest Service budget has been cut in real terms, taking fire out, by 35 percent. This is one of the few bills that has been devastated by this administration, and it's a regrettable fact. 
   All our bill does is stop this downward trend in our national parks, our downward trend in our national wildlife refuges, and our downward trend in enforcement and clean water and clean air in the environmental protection area, and the reduction in personnel, not covering fixed costs until Mr. Kempthorne came in, and he is only covering the fixed costs for the Interior Department. This is a devastating cut that would reverse all the good work in this bill. 
   I just think it's totally irresponsible, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this. We need the money for the firefighters, there is a huge fire out there in Lake Tahoe right now. We need to get this bill passed. 
   This kind of across-the-board meat-ax approach will not be successful, I predict. I just tell the gentleman that his amendment goes way too far and would have devastating consequences. It would undermine the President's Centennial Challenge that Mr. Kempthorne has worked so hard to create. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. DICKS. And I will say to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) we are, I have already explained, Mr. Obey's already explained why this amendment is not going to be passed by the House today, because it's too big a cut. And I would just say, again, and I want to say this to every Member: This administration has cut the Interior Department budget over the last 6 to 7 years by 16 percent.     
   It has cut EPA by 29 percent. It has cut the Forest Service by 35 percent. It is devastating these agencies, and this amendment would add to that devastation. 
   What we are doing is adding 4.3 percent to try to turn the corner, to try to bring these agencies back. And we are not laying back here. We are just waiting to move on to more important business. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to my colleague on the committee, a distinguished member from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver).

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, again, the former ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Conte, when he was here in the House of Representatives, used to say that this is the ``meat-ax approach.'' An across-the-board amendment doesn't make any selectivity between the national parks and other issues. It's just an across-the-board cut. 
   Again, I must say that the reason we object on this particular bill is because over the last 7 years the administration has cut the Interior Department by 16 percent in real terms. And the cut for EPA is 29 percent and that cuts the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. I mean, it's hard to believe that this administration wanted to cut the Clean Water Revolving Fund by $670 million. How do you do that and go to bed at night and actually get sleep? I mean, it's shocking to me, these cuts. 
   The Forest Service funds all the programs for taking care of our multiple-use Forest Service land. More recreation is provided by the Forest Service than actually the Park Service, and they cut that by 35 percent since 2001. 
   This is a crisis. These agencies are headed down a devastating path, not having enough staff to do their work. The refuges didn't have enough staff. The Park Service didn't have enough staff. Every one of these agencies were losing people year after year because their fixed costs weren't covered. So this was a crisis situation. 
   I think everything we've done in this budget is totally responsible. And I reject the idea of any across-the-board meat-ax approach, using the language of the former ranking member, Mr. Conte from Massachusetts. And I just hope that we can move on here and get to the rest of these amendments. 
   There are a lot of people on the other side who told me they would like to go home on Friday morning, they would like to see us get done on Thursday night. So I don't want anybody to think that we're not in opposition to all these things. I just want them to know that we're trying to work on a bipartisan basis to get the job of this committee done as quickly as possible. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York, a member of the committee (Mr. Israel).

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, again I want to say to my colleagues, the reason we have to make this increase in the Interior appropriations budget is because over the last 6 or 7 years the budgets for these agencies have been reduced dramatically. The Interior Department has been cut by 16 percent. We have lost rangers at every national park in the Nation. The summer workers have been cut back. The services there are not as good as they used to be. 
   This was a crisis. The National Parks Conservation Association had a pamphlet, ``The Endangered Ranger.'' Here it was, our national parks, our national treasure, in decline. 
   I am no extremist. I am a moderate in this House, and I always have been. But this was a true crisis. And what we had to do was stop this decline, this downward trend of our national wildlife refuges, our national parks, and we put a little extra money in to get it turned up, so we could hire a few more people, so we could cover the fixed costs of the rangers and the people running these wildlife refuges. 
   That is why we had to do this. It was a crisis. And it is going to take us a number of years to get back. We only increased this budget by 4.3 percent. With a 16-percent cut, it would take 4 years to get back to where we were in 2001. With EPA, it would take about 7 years to get back to where we were. And with a 35-percent cut in the Forest Service, it would take about 8 years to get back. So we have a long ways to go, and I don't want to have any downward direction here. 
   I do say to the gentleman from Georgia that he is right, the 1 percent could be taken anywhere, and that might mean that all of the projects of interest to the Members would be eliminated by the administration. Now, I hope they wouldn't do that. I hope they wouldn't fall into that trap. But that is one possibility. 
   So, again, I resent the gentleman from Georgia even suggesting that we aren't over here fighting against your amendments. We just looked at the  Record last night and how the votes went, and we thought maybe some of the Members would like to get home on Thursday. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I can guarantee I think that this amendment will be treated properly by the membership. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment would cut a total of $138 million from environmental conservation and Native American programs. It makes no choice based on need or merit of the program, but it cuts 0.5 percent in this bill. This is not merely an accounting change on a table. Cutting $138 million from the bill will have very serious consequences.  
   All of us have been listening on television about the big wild fire at Lake Tahoe. This bill would reduce overall funding for firefighting by $14 million at a time when we are facing what is potentially one of the worst fire seasons in history. It cuts 125 firefighters, shuts down firefighter stations, and significantly reduces air tanker support. It would decimate preparedness efforts by failing to provide critical support for initial attacks, and could allow as many as 80 more wildfires to escalate. This would lead to larger, more damaging and much more expensive fires, costing in excess of $20 million to extinguish. 
   This amendment halts hazardous fuel reduction projects without which there is little hope for reducing long-term fire costs and harmful impacts. 
   In our national parks, it cuts overall National Park Service funding by $13 million, includes a $6 million reduction below the President's request for the basic operational cost of the 391 units of the national park system. 
   It drastically impacts the President's proposal to hire 3,000 seasonal and 600 full-time park ranger positions. 
   For Native American programs, it rejects $29 million for programs that have received bipartisan support. By cutting $16 million out of Indian health care programs, this proposal would deny service to thousands of Native Americans. 
   It takes 4 percent out of the already struggling Indian education programs leaving even more Indian children without adequate education programs. 
   For the Environmental Protection Agency, it reduces a total of $40 million for EPA. Funding for efforts to help local communities with repairs to their aging water and wastewater infrastructure, would be reduced by almost $10 million from fiscal year 2007 enacted levels. This would mean that many communities would not receive the financial assistance they need to repair and improve water and sewer infrastructure. 
   Despite the fact that 76 million Americans live within 4 miles of a toxic waste site, the amendment cuts almost $8 million from programs to clean up the Nation's most toxic and hazardous waste sites. It reduces the amount for restoration and protection of America's great water bodies, including the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, Puget Sound, and others. It would especially jeopardize the cleanup of toxic sediments in the lakes, and community efforts across this Nation to protect 28 estuaries. 
   For the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the cuts here would be $7 million for an agency which has already lost 600 staff positions since 2004. And means that many of our wildlife refuges today have no staff whatsoever because of the devastating cuts that have been imposed over the last 7 years. 
   It would perpetuate staffing shortfall trends and reduce public service by taking funding out of the National Wildlife Refuge System. 
   Forest Service. This amendment reduces funding for the non-fire portion of the Forest Service by $13 million. Forces up to 100 employee layoffs and closures of more than 10 campgrounds while reducing fire improvement activities on several thousand acres. 
   It diminishes cooperative land conservation and forestry actions which serve thousands of nonindustrial private forest landowners. 
   It freezes research efforts and compels the closure of at least four labs. 
   So these are, I think, very substantial and important reductions that would adversely affect this bill. I have a great regard for the gentlelady. As much as I enjoy and appreciate her, I can't accept this amendment. I want her to know it is nothing personal, it is just that we have to do the job. 
   We are in a recovery mode here. That is what I tried to explain. The gentleman who talked about the $16 billion, it wasn't $16 billion, it was a 16 percent reduction in the funding for the Department of the Interior. This has had a devastating impact. We also had a 29 percent reduction in EPA and a 35 percent reduction in the Forest Service budget. All of these budgets have been hit hard. Only the Department of Labor has been hit worse. 
   What we are trying to do is stop this downward trend in the personnel in these agencies. The Park Service budget, 80 to 90 percent of the budget are for people. That is why we are so concerned about this. Without the people, the American people when they go to the parks are not going to have the kind of experience that they should have. That's why we have tried to stop this. 
   The Secretary of the Interior, he got it. I told him, I said you cannot succeed, Mr. Secretary, unless you get 100 percent of fixed costs covered in your budget for the Park Service, for the Fish and Wildlife Service, for the Bureau of Land Management, the Mineral Management Agency, and he did that. But we have to recover over a period of time. 
   Unfortunately, to make further reductions will take us longer before we can restore the services at our national parks, and restore service at our national wildlife refuges. This is a very well put-together bill. I just regret that these cuts are being offered. I think this bill should be accepted as it is. We have to go to conference, obviously we know that. So I rise in very strong opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, with deep regret, I insist on my point of order. 
   I make a point of order against the amendment because it provides an appropriation for an unauthorized program, and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. Clause 2 of rule XXI states in pertinent part, ``An appropriation may not be in order as an amendment for an expenditure not previously authorized by law.'' 
   The amendment proposes to appropriate funds for the rural school program that has not been reauthorized. The amendment, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI, and I am sorry that I have to raise a point of order, but the payments for the Secure Rural Schools Act of 2000 are not authorized.  
   This is a reachback appropriation for an unauthorized program and, therefore, I am sorry I must insist on my point of order. I will also point out that it would be irresponsible to cut this budget bill by $425 million. 
   Public Law 110-28 did not reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Act.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield, yes, I agree. In our report on this bill, the Appropriations Committee warns the Interior Department that we are concerned about the Department's interpretation and actions that would disclaim Federal interests in lands subject to an R.S. 2477 claim or issue any nonbinding determination that would have a similar effect. That is why we tell them to provide advanced notice to the Congress if the Interior Department plans to approve any R.S. 2477 claims. We also require them to provide quarterly reports on activities concerning claims under the R.S. 2477 statute. But it would be even better for the administration to work with the gentleman and the Natural Resources Committee to develop a legislative solution for this serious problem, and I urge them to do so. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman for his leadership on this issue.

   As the gentleman knows, we agreed to $425 million in the supplemental to help these gentlemen on the rural schools. My concern here is that this is not an appropriations problem, this is supposed to be an authorization problem. I even helped them way back in 1992 or 1993 when the timber harvest went way down--Congresswoman Dunn and I got the first program through Congress to keep this going for 10 years. 
   I have been a friend of this rural schools program. I don't quite understand why this very small amendment that doesn't have any negative impact on anyone would be stricken.

   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is important for Members to realize as they consider the committee action that the $160 million recommended only partially restores cuts made to this agency a decade ago. In fact, the amount in this bill is still $16 million below the level provided in 1993. After adjusting for inflation, the amount recommended is $100 million below the level in 1993, as displayed on a chart that I showed Members earlier. 
   As we debate this amendment, Members should also note that the National Endowment for the Arts has been transformed since the arts funding debate of the 1990s. Two gifted chairmen have reinvigorated the NEA into an agency with broad support. Chairman Bill Ivey, appointed by Bill Clinton, negotiated and implemented bipartisan reforms in NEA's grant structure to ensure that funds go to activities for which public funding is appropriate. 
   Dana Gioia, the current chairman, then energized the agency with many new programs and a commitment to reach beyond the cultural centers of our major cities. 
   Last year, every single congressional district received NEA support through innovative programs such as the American Masterpieces, Operation Homecoming and the Big Read. 
   Today, NEA is a truly national program with outreach efforts to every corner of America and every segment of her society. Each of us have different reasons to support the arts. Some will describe their support in terms of the inherent joy of the arts as a personally enriching experience. Others support the arts as engines of job development and economic growth.     
   It is equally important to emphasize that most Members of the House in recent years have been supporting funding for the arts and for the humanities. I believe the cultural wars should be over. For each of the last 7 years with the help of many Members in this Chamber, a bipartisan majority in the House has voted to increase funding for the NEA. During the last 2 years, Ms. Slaughter's and my amendments to add funds were adopted by voice vote, without opposition from Mr. Taylor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do not normally include quotes in my floor remarks, but I was struck in preparing for this year's art debate by a quote attributed to actor Richard Dreyfus at the Grammy awards ceremony: 
   ``Perhaps we've all misunderstood the reason we learn music and all the arts in the first place. It is that for hundreds of years, it has been known that teaching the arts helps to create the well-rounded mind that western civilization, and America, have been grounded on. America's greatest achievements in science, in business, in popular culture, would simply not be attainable without an education that encourages achievement in all fields. It is from that creativity and imagination that the solutions to our political and social problems will come. We need that well-rounded mind now. Without it, we simply make more difficult the problems we face.'' 
   I believe Mr. Dreyfus is right, and the committee has acted to provide the funding so arts can reach even more broadly into American communities with a richer variety of programs. 
   I urge defeat of the gentleman's amendment and support for the committee position. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would say, you know, it's very unusual to say you support a program or support the arts when you offer an amendment to eliminate the entire program.

   Mr. DICKS. This amendment is a mistake. There are plenty of reasons to delay the oil shale leasing which the BLM is doing. The Governor of Colorado and several other local Members of Congress have also asked for an appropriate delay so the public can fully understand the ramifications of massive oil shale leasing. Furthermore, the large-scale demonstration projects have begun and it is far too soon for large-scale commercial leasing. 
   To give the companies time to learn from the demonstrations, I think we should defeat this amendment and stay with the Udall amendment. What this does is basically overturn the Udall amendment, which is pending at this time.

The committee is not required to act because the instructions are considered merely advisory to the committee. In other words, by using the word ``promptly,'' they would kill the bill. 
   Now this motion to recommit is simply a device to protect excess profits of the energy companies. It does this by overturning section 115 of the bill. This section simply requires energy companies who are realizing $9 billion of excess profits to renegotiate the faulty leases which were signed in 1997 and 1998. In legal terms, this is called ``unjust enrichment'' at the expense of the taxpayers. 
   The motion overturns section 115 by delaying it until impossible conditions are met, as certified by the secretary. If this language is adopted, these enormous unjustified profits will continue for an industry making tens of billions of dollars of profit. 
   Adoption of the amendment would kill the bill and with so many good things in it, I urge all Members to vote against the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (GAO DECISION IN AIR FORCE TANKER CONTRACT AWARD -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to announce to my colleagues an important decision was reached today. Thank God for the GAO. An injustice was corrected. 
   The GAO came out today and held on seven different grounds that the Boeing Company's protest should be sustained. This now gives us a chance to win this competition and to keep these jobs in the United States. 
   I'm from the great State of Washington where the Boeing Company resides and has many workers. I think this was one of the most important decisions by the GAO. I congratulate them for the comprehensiveness, for the professionalism, and I hope that the Air Force will read this decision and also look at the other factors, industrial base, the use of subsidies against the United States by the WTO. All of these issues that were not considered should be considered in this decision. 
   These are the crown jewels of American technology, these tankers, and they should be built in the United States by an American company.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to join the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Hastings, in amending H.R. 1684 to emphasize what we believe is an important connection between our national research laboratories and the Department of Homeland Security, DHS. 
   Our amendment would simply insert in the bill a requirement of the Department to report to Congress about its plan for ``leveraging the expertise of the National Laboratories, the process for allocating funding to the National Laboratories and ..... for fulfilling existing National Laboratory infrastructure commitments to maintain current capabilities and mission needs.'' 
   I believe the national labs represent a tremendously valuable resource that can and should be used by the Department of Homeland Security to protect our population. With expertise it biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear science and technology and computer and information science the national laboratories--those controlled by the Homeland Security Department as well as the laboratories under the jurisdiction ofl the Department of Energy--can play a vital role in the prevention, deterrence, detection, mitigation and attribution of the use of weapons of mass destruction. DHS has already initiated a series of cooperative arrangements with several of the labs recognizing the great synergy that is possible through combined research efforts. 
   Congressman Hastings and I have been working on one such cooperative program with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, in the State of Washington. Under a Memorandum of Understanding, the Department of Homeland Security, the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration and DOE's Office of Science are contributing to PNNL's Capability Replacement Laboratory, CRL, to replace mission critical RDT&E capabilities that will be otherwise lost as a result of the Department of Energy Environmental Management Office's accelerated cleanup of Hanford's 300 Area. Among the capabilities of the CRL that should and will be utilized by DHS are radiation detection and analysis, information analytics, and the testing, evaluation and certification of new methods and technologies. 
   According to the interagency MOU signed by all parties, DHS was expected to provide $25 million for the project in FY 2008; however, the President's budget does not include the funds. With construction scheduled to begin this year, we are now worried about the future of this project due to the lack of attention to this issue at DHS. 
   Although Congressman Hastings and I are working to correct this situation in the FY 2008 budget, I believe this situation highlights the need to examine more closely the relationship of the labs to the Department's R&D effort. Thus, our amendment calls for a report to Congress on the Homeland Security Department's strategic plan for its research efforts to include a plan for fulfilling existing national laboratory infrastructure commitments in order to maintain current capabilities and mission needs. 
   Our hope is that such a public clarification of the role of the labs can help the Department to make a stronger case to Congress for  the importance of the work at PNNL as well as the other important national research laboratories.

<DOCNO>Mr. DICKS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DICKS. I want to commend the chairman for his leadership on this issue. I am proud to be a conferee, and also Mr. King of New York for his good work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I must say, I am very proud to be a member of this committee. Over the last 4 or 5 years, whether it has been on the Republican rule or under Democratic rule, this committee has had incredible oversight. I commend the two chairmen for that. 
   Congressman Daniel E. Lungren was on the floor earlier. He was very vigorous in oversight. This is another part of the accomplishment here is it's strengthening congressional oversight, the speaker in the chair today, Mr. Murtha, and Speaker Pelosi created a panel on the Appropriations Committee with HPSCI. This is providing additional oversight. I think it's one of the most important things we can do. But getting this bill finally passed is a great accomplishment. You should be very proud of it.
