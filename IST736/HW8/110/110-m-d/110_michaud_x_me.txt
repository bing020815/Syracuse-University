<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (COSTA RICA CAFTA REFERENDUM -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in strong opposition to the lies being told to the good people of Costa Rica about the importance of the CAFTA referendum they are about to vote on. 
   I went to Costa Rica last night to share some basic truths. The pro-CAFTA government is now telling the people of Costa Rica how wonderful passage of CAFTA will be for them. 
   Remember when the Mexican Government said exactly the same thing to the people of Mexico during a debate on NAFTA in 1993? What happened with the passage of NAFTA, 1.3 million Mexican farmers have been displaced. 
   The country's growth rate has stagnated. Wages have actually declined, and the country's environmental policies have been successfully challenged and chilled throughout NAFTA's outrageous corporate regime. 
   NAFTA and CAFTA have actually increased protectionism by restricting free commerce in lifesaving medicine. One hundred priests in Costa Rica have come out against the flawed trade model; and just this past weekend, hundreds of thousands of good Costa Rican citizens protested this referendum. Out of a country of 4 million people, that shows how strong opposition is, and it should be. 
   Voters are being told by the United States Government that we will retaliate if they do not vote in favor of this referendum. The people of Costa Rica can rest assured that the U.S. Government will not retaliate. In fact, let me quote a letter last week sent from our Senate majority leader, HARRY REID, and the Speaker of the House to the Ambassador of Costa Rica: ``The decision as to whether or not Costa Rica joins CAFTA and votes yes or no on their referendum on October 7 is the decision of the people of Costa Rica.'' 
   The letter goes on to say: ``We understand that it has been asserted by some that there is a link between the referendum vote and Costa Rica's continued participation in the Caribbean Basin Initiative. We are not aware of  any connection between the two. Participation in CBI is not conditioned on a country's decision to approve or reject a free trade agreement with the United States.'' 
   As someone who has supported trade preference for Latin American countries like I have, the most recent the Andean countries, I can confirm that there will be absolutely no retaliation against the country or voters no matter what the outcome of the referendum. The people must look beyond the scare tactics being waged in this campaign. 
   How will CAFTA affect Costa Rica? Voters, all they have to do is look to Mexico to see what CAFTA has done to them. Since the passage of NAFTA, poverty in Mexico has increased. The middle class has declined. Many Mexicans are fleeing to America in hopes of finding a better wage and a life for their families. 
   Who benefits under NAFTA and CAFTA agreements? The multinational corporations, not the people. We have seen that corporations and their friends in the government will employ dirty tricks, election fraud, and tell outright lies to ensure that they continue to be able to exploit workers and ruin the environment. 
   This is a historic and important vote for the people of Costa Rica. I believe it is time for the United States and Costa Rica to go back to the drawing board and develop a new trade agreement that all sides can be proud of. The United States renegotiated Peru, Colombia, Panama and South Korea. We should do the same thing with the agreement with Costa Rica. It is time to develop an agreement that benefits our workers and communities.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   As a 30 year veteran of the Great Northern Paper Company mills and a proud union member, I know firsthand how crucial it is for workers to have the right to organize and bargain together to secure their rights in the workplace. 
   On average, workers who belong to unions earn 30 percent more than nonunion workers, and they are much more likely to have health care and pension benefits. Polls tell us that 58 percent of eligible workers would join a union if they could, yet union membership in the private sector plummeted to 7.4 percent in 2006, a record low. 
   The Employee Free Choice Act would allow workers more freedom to form unions, so they can seek their share of America's prosperity, and fair treatment for an honest day's work. 
   The current system for forming unions and bargaining is broken. EFCA is the right bill to fix it, and I urge my colleagues to give it their support. I yield the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, it's a great pleasure that we are talking this evening about an issue very important to a lot of us in this Congress, and a lot of folks throughout the United States of America, and that issue is trade. 
   I would like to yield to a colleague of mine. We came in this Congress together, and she has been very active in the trade deal and has established with me the trade working group in this Congress, Congresswoman Linda T. S&#225;nchez of California. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in addressing the House and the American people regarding U.S. trade policy and its effect on working families. 
   Let me start by saying, first of all, that I am committed to trade. That's right, I think that trade is good for America and its working families. If we do it the right way, trade can increase the availability of raw materials for production. Trade can also open markets for American goods and can bring exciting new products to American consumers. While I recognize the benefits of trade, not all trade agreements are created equal. 
   On May 10, the administration and Members of this House announced a ``new policy on trade.'' Well, it's about time. Democrats have been calling for a new direction in trade for years, and I am pleased that the administration has finally taken initial steps to improve its trade policy. 
   But, alas, it is too little, too late. This new trade policy is little more than a rehash of the same failed NAFTA model that has been hurting U.S. families for more than a decade. According to the administration, the new additions to the Peru and Panama agreements would add long-sought labor and environmental protections to the basic NAFTA framework. 
   Unfortunately, even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says that these new worker and environmental protections can't be enforced. That's not very encouraging, is it? Supporting this new deal requires us to believe in two things: number one, the actual benefits of the NAFTA free trade model; and, number 2, the promises of the Bush administration. 
   We are supposed to trust an administration that has demonstrated its commitment to anything but the truth. Having misled us on issues like domestic wire-tapping programs, the war in Iraq, global warming, and the firing of U.S. attorneys, it now seeks our trust. How are we supposed to trust a record like that? 
   We have also learned some very hard lessons after more than 10 years of free trade failures. As we hear more familiar promise about the new trade deal, let's look at some of the old ones. NAFTA was supposed to solve illegal integration by developing a robust economy in Mexico that would allow hard-working people to provide for their families and stay at home. Well, that didn't work. 
   CAFTA was supposed to include bold new safety and wage protections for workers, but these protections are disappointingly weak, allowing countries to downgrade their very own labor laws. 
   In the Oman Free Trade Agreement, the administration actually negotiated a deal with a opportunity that, as our own State Department reported, was experiencing a forced labor problem--forced labor. How are our workers supposed to compete with people who are forced to toil? 
   Free trade was supposed to increase economic opportunity for everybody, for big businesses, as well as working families at home and abroad. But it simply hasn't happened. 
   Too many communities have been left to rot because corporations shut down U.S. plants to chase increasingly cheap labor and weak environmental protections abroad. After decades of living with NAFTA and its clones, real wages for American families are down. Our trade deficit is in the tens of billions of dollars, and our manufacturing base is falling apart. 
   The American worker is now more productive than ever, but that increased productivity has not led to a corresponding increase in wages. The truth is that the NAFTA free trade model is designed to favor the wealthiest few and corporate bottom lines at the expense of small businesses, workers, families and communities. 
   In the coming weeks, we will be asked to consider first two of the Bush administration's trade priorities, free trade agreements with Peru and Panama. Despite the long record of failed free trade agreements, the Bush administration and free traders are going to tell us that Peru and Panama agreements are less controversial than the administration's other priorities, free trade agreements with Colombia and Korea, and the renewal of the President's fast-track negotiating authority. 
   This is a sign of how bad Peru and Panama trade deals are. Their only redeeming value, it seems, is that they are not as bad as the deals with Korea and Colombia. But that argument misses the point. Every bad trade agreement passed, makes it easier for another bad trade agreement to slip by. 
   When they say ``not that bad,'' we should say ``not good enough.'' Let's keep our eyes on the ball. 
   The Peru and Panama free-trade agreements are slippery slopes to other bad deals. Passing these deals makes it easier for the Bush administration to push through the Korea free-trade agreement which would gut the American car industry.     
   It would make it easier for the White House to push through fast track authority, which gives the President a blank check to create additional agreements that gut our communities and our economy. 
   Passing the Peru and Panama Free Trade Agreements puts us on a slippery slope toward passing the Bush-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, a deeply flawed trade deal for working families in both countries. 
   I just returned from Colombia, and this was my second trip in 7 months. On these visits I talked with leaders from civil society, indigenous groups, organized labor and the political opposition. 
   Colombia is a great country with wonderful people, a vibrant culture and a growing economy. However, Colombia remains the most dangerous country in the world for worker advocates. Despite recent progress, the Colombian Government has still been unable to protect labor organizers from being attacked or killed over any specific  amount of time. The Bush-Colombia Free Trade Agreement will only exacerbate those problems. Without real enforceable worker protections, increasing numbers of Colombian workers will be forced into sweatshop conditions. 
   The Bush-Colombia FTA will gut Colombia's legitimate agriculture sector. Colombian farmers will be forced to compete with subsidized crops from the United States. Many farmers will be forced to choose between leaving their farms and growing more lucrative drug crops, the very drug crops that we see sending drugs up to the United States. 
   Free traders are going to say that denying Colombia a free-trade package, after giving similar agreements to its neighbors, will destabilize the Colombian Government and give a victory to Hugo Chavez. They are going to say that it sends a terrible message to an important ally that we still regard Colombia as a pariah state. 
   They're going to say that if the worker and environmental protections were good enough for Peru and Panama, why not Colombia and Korea? 
   Here's the bottom line. The Peru and Panama Free Trade Agreements are slippery slopes to more downward pressure on wages and benefits, both here and abroad. 
   You want to hear the surest sign that the Bush Free Trade Agreement is flawed? He couldn't even pass them when his own party was in control of the Congress. The Peru free trade agreement was signed in April of 2006, and yet the White House couldn't get the Republican majority to move it. 
   Some might say, we can't afford not to sign free trade agreements. After all, they say, globalization is here to stay. Trade and globalization are here to stay. The question remains, however, can we make them work for working families? And I say, yes, we can. 
   Trade can benefit our economy and the economist of our trading partners. We can negotiate deals that create new markets, bring new jobs and new prosperity. We can achieve significant new foreign market access and reduce our trade deficit. If we stand united for working Americans, we can deliver a real new deal on trade, not warmed-over promises masquerading as caviar. 
   Minor adjustments to the NAFTA-style deals are just not good enough. No more agreements based on the failed NAFTA model, no more Fast Track promotion authority. We cannot give this administration, or future ones, a blank check on trade deals that devastate our communities at home. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get off that slippery slope and get on the new path toward trade that promotes development and prosperity for all, not just for the wealthy few. 
   And I thank my colleague, a real leader on this issue, Mr. Michaud, for yielding me time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Representative S&#193;NCHEZ. And you're absolutely right. These trade deals are a slippery slope, and we definitely have to make sure that we change that trade model. 
   As you know, I spent over 28 years at Great Northern Paper Company in East Millinocket, Maine, like my father before me spent 43 years, my grandfather before him for 40 years. 
   NAFTA has killed our community. We used to have over 4,500 jobs. It's little over 500 jobs. Small businesses have gone under because the economy has been devastated because of a trade deal. We had unemployment that was over 33 percent. 
   We had individuals who are proud men and women who worked in the mill, made good wages, good health care benefits, they ended up on the food line. They are so many people that went to the food bank that actually the food bank ran out of food. The whole State chipped in and brought food, churches, communities throughout the State to help the devastation. 
   And it doesn't end there. If you go 30 miles south, another mill had closed its doors. Another 30 miles south of that, another mill closed its doors because of trade. 
   Yes, they are getting trade assistance, but they want their jobs. And what are they getting trained for, if there's no jobs to get trained? 
   So this definitely has caused a huge problem, these bad trade deals in the State of Maine, and people are upset, and rightfully so; and that's why it's important for this Congress to get off that slippery slope and head for a new direction, start a new direction; and that new direction is changing that flawed trade policy. 
   And I agree 100 percent, it's more than just a couple of Band-Aids. We have to look at the broader aspect of trade. 
   And I really appreciate your ongoing commitment to do what's right for workers, to do what's right for small businesses in this country, and it's the humanitary thing to do as well. So thank you very much, Representative S&#193;NCHEZ, for your leadership in this issue, and I'll look forward to working with you as we move forward to deal with these trade issues. 
   I now would like to recognize a gentleman who I've really got to enjoy in this Congress, a gentleman who has really been a strong advocate for our veterans, who definitely has been a leader in that area on the Veterans Affairs Committee, but also a gentleman who is extremely interested in the trade issues, knowing what trade has done to his State in Illinois, Congressman PHIL HARE.  
   Thank you for coming to the floor this evening. I look forward to hearing your remarks as they relate to trade.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Congressman Hare. I really appreciate your leadership in this whole trade debate. It is very important, very valuable that we hear freshmen class, and the freshmen class has definitely been pretty vocal on the trade deal. 
   As I mentioned earlier, if you go anywhere in my district, you will see a lot of abandoned mills. What used to be vibrant, a lot of workers working there, they are no longer there today. 
   The other issue that is very important, and Congresswoman S&#193;NCHEZ actually touched upon it, is immigration. I know the Senate has been talking about immigration quite a bit. We will be talking about it soon. But before I vote for any immigration bill, I will look to see if they are taking care of the fundamental problem in immigration, and that problem is trade. 
   If you look at the reasons why a lot of undocumented immigrants are coming from Mexico to the United States, they are coming across the border to get a job. And the reason why they are coming across the border to get a job is because they are living in substandard conditions in Mexico. 
   Let's go back a few years to when NAFTA was passed. One of the arguments why we should pass NAFTA was because all boats will rise here in the United States and in Mexico. And by raising the boats in Mexico, the workers that come across the border illegally will stay because they will have their jobs, they will earn good wages, and there is no need to come across the border. As a matter of fact, at the time Madeline Albright made comments and encouraged Congress to support NAFTA because it will help solve our illegal immigration problems, and she went on to say if it doesn't solve them or help solve them, then we know it is a failed policy.  
   Well, it is a failed policy. It hasn't helped. It has gotten worse. And this is something, when we talk about immigration, we have to make sure we take care of that fundamental flaw, and that is with our trade deals. If it means voting against the rule when immigration comes up, I am prepared to do that because this issue is so important that we need to change the direction. We have got to get off this slippery slope if we are going to make this country continue to grow. 
   It is now a great pleasure to introduce a colleague of mine who is very familiar with labor issues, who is definitely taking on a leadership role, along with Congressman Hare from Ohio. Congresswoman Sutton has been a true leader. 
   I really appreciate very much, congresswoman, all that you have been doing. You are a tireless advocate for working people here in this country, small businesses here in this country, and I really appreciate the way that you have taken on this leadership role, and I look forward to continuing working with you on issues as it relates to trade and other issues. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. 
   I can see from your comments and from hearing your voice that you truly care about the people in your district. And that's what I think has been missing in this debate from some of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Some think, yes, we have a trade deal; if you don't like it, vote against it. Yes, that's the easy way out. What a lot of our colleagues do not understand is just what you have mentioned; these are people's lives. You've seen it firsthand, Congressman Hare has seen it firsthand, I've seen it firsthand, where people who have lost their jobs, who in  a lot of cases are up there in age, 50, 55, 60, that now have to change their lives, they have to try to get retrained, try to find another job. In the meantime, I know in my district, where we have over 33 percent unemployment, we have seen alcoholism and rape increase, divorce increase. The fact that students at high school, their dreams were shattered because they no longer had the means to further their education. We actually had a high school in my district where the senior class did not know whether they were going to be able to graduate or not because the mill that closed its doors paid 80 percent of the tax base, which they had not paid, so the accreditation was in jeopardy. 
   These issues are extremely important to each and every citizen in the State of Maine, whether you're a Republican, Democratic, green or independent. But there are also issues that are issues we have to deal with collectively, they're not Republican issues or Democratic issues. No one is to blame. I think there is plenty of blame to go around. Actually, it was a Democratic administration that brought us NAFTA. Now it's a Democrat-controlled House and Senate, that hopefully we will change the model. And that's what it is about. And you hit the nail right on the head; it's not about being protectionists, it's about how do we want that trade model to look. 
   I hope that the presidential candidates, as they go around this country, will start talking about trade. I am very pleased with a couple of the House Members, Congressman Kucinich, Congressman Hunter, a Republican, who has been very vocal on China currency manipulation. He has legislation dealing with China manipulation, along with Congressman Ryan. Congressman Hunter also has bipartisan legislation with myself and Congressman Pascrell, who is a lead sponsor, on the value-added tax. He is out there, out front. 
   I want to know where the other candidates are standing because this upcoming election is going to be extremely crucial to where this country is heading. We have a lot of issues we have to deal with, the value-added tax, currency manipulation. When you look at the whole patent issue, what's happening with that. We have a huge trade imbalance. How are we going to bring that trade imbalance back into line? That's why, Congresswoman Sutton, I am very pleased to work with you because we're not only working as Democrats, we're working with our Republican colleagues across the aisle, we're working with environmental groups, labor groups. The business community, the United States Business and Industry Council, which has an association of small manufacturing businesses here in this country, has been very vocal on these trade issues, which is important because you have that business community and labor working together. That's what it's all about. Definitely there are those large corporations who have operations in India and China. These trade deals are nothing but a bottom line for them, but that bottom line for some of them could ruin this country. 
   We are heading for a perfect storm. We have the largest budgetary deficit in our history. We have the largest trade deficit in our history. We cannot sustain that type of deficit, either budgetary or trade, if we are to maintain our status, if we are to be a world leader. That is why it is very important for the American people to demand that those who are running for higher office, whether it's Congress or the Office of the United States President, they have to demand to know where they stand on these issues and be held accountable. Because so far, from what I have seen, there hasn't been much leadership in that particular area. 
   If we are going to fund education, health care, issues with childcare, taking care of our veterans, maintaining our super power status of military, we have to have an economy that allows us to do that. We cannot have that economy if we continue to outsource our jobs overseas. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much. This is, as you said, a very important issue. And we are on a slippery slope currently. 
   When you look at Fast Track, Congress is giving up our responsibility as elected officials, as a co-equal branch of government if we pass Fast Track. Congress has no ability to amend trade deals under Fast Track, and I think it's taking the easy way out. I do not believe that Fast Track should pass. I will oppose Fast Track because it is not a good deal for Congress and it is not a good deal for the American people. We have to look at how we can change that model. 
   We have talked, I heard earlier, about the issues of training. Well, if you look at what happens when a mill shuts down because of unfair trade deals, yes, they do get training, as I mentioned earlier, but what are they going to train for, particularly when you have mill after mill after mill close because of trade deals, there's not much you can train. But also, when you look at some of the benefits and some of the problems we have seen because of mill closures. In the Katahdin region, where I am from, when the mills shut down, a lot of individuals actually had to tap into their 401(k) plan just to survive. What happens when they file their income tax? They get  penalized because they had to tap into their 401(k) plan. That's unfair. That's unjust. When they applied for unemployment, guess what? They're taxed on their unemployment. Now, if you want to talk about giving tax breaks to anyone, it's those who are unemployed who actually should have the tax breaks. 
   You look at what has been talked about earlier as well, the labor and environmental standards that they say will be part of the cortex on Peru and Panama, that is yet to be seen. I think we have seen articles in the paper where the administration is starting to slip out of that deal to try to conjure up some other deal and say, well, we will put it in the side room and what have you. So it will be interesting to see what they finally come up with. 
   But no matter what you do on labor standards, when you look at the Colombian trade deal, some of our colleagues say well, there are some labor violations. Well, I like the way that they talk about ``some labor violations.'' They are talking about assassinations of trade activitists. That's more than just a labor violation. And to say that well, we will put the standards in the trade deal, that is not going to solve the problem. 
   I met with the President of Colombia and I told him right up front that I want to see results before I support anything. I don't want to see more verbiage in a trade deal to say that they will take care of the problem. If they want to stop these assassinations, they can do a lot more than what they are doing currently today. I met with several elected officials, individuals from Colombia, on a couple of different occasions. And when you look at how some of these people are being assassinated, on two separate occasions, with other Members of Congress, when I was talking to these individuals, what they have done is to set an example of someone who is a union activist. They have actually beheaded them in front of their neighbors, to set an example, and played soccer with their heads. And this is a country we are going to sign a trade deal? That is outrageous, and it is just disgusting to see that sort of thing happen. 
   Before I do anything on the Colombian trade deal, I want to see the number of trade unionist assassinations drop. I don't want to see writing, I want to actually see results. And that is what is so important, when you look at these trade deals; they are affecting people's lives. These people are more than just numbers on a paper. I wish some of our colleagues could really understand that. I don't think they do. Probably because they haven't been affected like your district, Congressman Hare, my district. 
   I think it is important for the American people, also, to really focus on what is happening here in Congress. Just because it's a new Congress doesn't mean that we are going to change in a new direction when it comes to trade. They want to see results like we want to see results, and hopefully we will see results in this upcoming debate on trade. 
   And there are some issues we can do right now without trade deals. We can pass the Currency Manipulation dealing with China, that can be done right now. We can pass the value-added tax issue, that is a disadvantage to businesses here in this country. That deficit alone is I believe $379 billion, a tax that is affecting companies here in the United States.     
   That is not fair. We have to deal with that. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Well, thank you, very much, Mr. Hare, for your compliments. But we are here as a team. We are here to do what is right for the American people, whether you are an employee, whether you are an employer, because that is very important. 
   I know that you know as well as Congresswoman Sutton and a lot in the freshman class who actually ran on this issue, you have seen what it has done to your districts. You have seen what it is doing to our country. It is very important that those who are sitting here get out there and talk to the people who have been affected by this. 
   It is not that we have to pass trade deals because you want to be good on  business or vote against them because of labor. This isn't a business-labor issue. This is an American issue. It is an issue that is extremely important if we are to sustain our status in the world. We have to make sure that we have trade deals that are fair. It is not about being protectionist. It is about the rules of trade. That is what it is about, the rules of trade. And I think it is extremely important that the majority party and the minority party and the rank and file Members who are dealing with this issue look at it in a comprehensive manner. 
   We have to do several things, as I mentioned earlier, and there is a lot we can do next week and the week after without any trade deal. The currency manipulation, there is legislation dealing with that. There is legislation in dealing with the value-added tax. If those people who are very interested in trade, the so-called free traders, we can pass these pieces of legislation this month to say, yes, we are serious about trade, and here is a start. Then we can start looking at some of these trade deals that have been negotiated, the Peru and Panama trade deal, what has happened with Korea, and see whether or not we should enact those. But we have to start, and we have to start today. 
   We are a new Congress, a Congress to which the American people said that we want a new direction in this country. And we have to give them the new direction that they want, because I can guarantee you, in this upcoming election cycle, if we do not make changes in how we deal with the trade issues, we will be on a slippery slope. I don't want that to happen. 
   I think the American people deserve better. The American people deserve better, and the business community in this country deserves better. Hopefully we will be able to give them that. 
   Once again I want to close by thanking you very much, Congressman Hare, for your strong leadership, and you, Congresswoman Sutton, both in the freshman class. You're a breath of fresh air here in this Congress. I look forward to working with you as we move forward in this debate.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for yielding, and I want to thank him for his leadership as we deal with Veterans' Affairs issues in this upcoming session. I also want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Miller, for all his hard work on this legislation. I look forward to working with him over the next 2 years as we move forward with an aggressive Veterans' Affairs agenda. 
   I rise today in strong support of this important legislation. 
   One veteran taking their life is tragic. Joshua Omvig was one such veteran, and, sadly, he is not alone. There have been others such as Jonathan Schulze from Minnesota and many more, and that is unfortunate. 
   We must do everything we can to provide our veterans and their families with the support and care that they need to prevent more from going down the same tragic path to committing suicide. 
   H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, would assist the Department of Veterans Affairs in furthering its effort to identify veterans at risk of suicide. 
   Our returning servicemembers are under great strain and stress. H.R. 327 would improve early detection and intervention, provide access to mental health services for veterans who are in crisis, and help prevent the unnecessary deaths of the men and women who have served our Nation so greatly. 
   A recent study indicated that nearly one-third of OEF/OIF veterans seen at the VA facilities receive mental health and/or psychosocial diagnoses and that one in five have PTSD. 
   These veterans are at risk. According to reports, one in five suicides in this country is a veteran, even though veterans make up only 10 percent of our general population. 
   Joshua Omvig was one such veteran. Sadly, this legislation cannot help him, but this bill can help other returning servicemembers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 327. And, in closing, I also want to thank Congressman Boswell for his leadership in this area. He has been pushing this bill for the last couple of years. He is a true leader, an individual who cares for our veterans, and I want to thank Mr. Boswell for bringing this legislation forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentlelady from California 5 minutes, I'll take 20 seconds to make very clear, there's not one labor organization that has sent a letter out saying that they support this trade deal. They don't support this trade deal, and to cherry-pick some of the language in the letter that they've sent I think is not correct. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez). 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3688, which would implement the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. 
   This is not a choice between trade and protectionism. It's a choice between fair trade, which can benefit working families across the Nation, and unfair trade, which benefits the wealthiest few at the expense of the rest of us. 
   While there are some welcome, but minor, improvements to the Peru FTA, as compared to NAFTA and CAFTA, the agreement essentially is not good enough. I feel like I'm at a used car lot and the dealer is trying to sell me a beat-up old NAFTA lemon with a brand new paint job and trying to tell me that it's a great car. 
   Well, we learned with NAFTA that there are no refunds for the American people when they're sold a bad bill of goods. Let's learn from our mistakes and reject this Peru FTA junker. 
   To serve the American people, we must work for real trade reform, not just put a Band-Aid on a trade model that has been bleeding jobs from this country since 1994. 
   Supporting this new deal requires us to believe in two things: one, the actual benefits of the NAFTA free trade model; and two, the promises of the Bush administration. 
   Considering the first question, the actual benefits of the NAFTA model are about as real as the tooth fairy. NAFTA was supposed to solve illegal immigration by developing a robust economy in Mexico that would give hardworking people the opportunity to provide for their families without having to leave their homeland behind. That didn't work. 
   Instead, undocumented immigration has actually increased. Subsidized crops from the U.S. pushed millions of farmers off their land, and many of those displaced farmers ended up emigrating to the United States, whether or not they had proper documentation, just so they could find work to support their families. 
   CAFTA, another so-called improvement on the NAFTA model, was supposed to include bold new safety and wage protections for workers. But these protections are disappointingly weak, allowing countries to downgrade their own labor laws. 
   We've learned that the NAFTA free trade model is designed to favor the wealthiest few and corporate bottom line, at the expense of small businesses, workers, families and our communities. 
   As to the second question, I think this administration has made it pretty clear that it has no interest in enforcing labor laws. 
   The BP Texas City explosion, the Sago and Crandall Canyon mine disasters, and the failure to protect 9/11 first responders and cleanup workers who have developed serious breathing ailments, these are just a few of the more notorious examples of this administration's dereliction of duty to provide even the most basic protection to workers: the right to work in a safe environment. 
   So long as we have to rely on this administration to protect the rights and safety of working men and women, we will continue to be disappointed. 
   To some in this House, the only redeeming value of this trade agreement seems to be that it's not as bad as the deals with Colombia and Korea. But that argument misses the point. When they say ``not that bad,'' we have to stand up for the American people and say ``not good enough.'' 
   Finally, the Peru FTA offers inadequate protection for numerous endangered species that live in the forest of Peru, like the giant river otter and the jaguar. If it's such a great agreement, why has no environmental group gone  on record as supporting or embracing this agreement. I ask my colleagues that and I don't think they have an answer. 
   Let me just remind my colleagues that I've heard over and over on the floor tonight that the enemy of the good is the perfect. Well, from where I sit, the enemy of the good is the bad, and this is a bad agreement. 
   We now have a choice before us. We should choose to vote ``no'' to a nondemocratic process, ``no'' to benefiting big business at the expense of the little guy, ``no'' to ignoring the will of the American people, and ``no'' on the Peru FTA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. I thank the Speaker. 
   I urge my colleagues to listen to their conscience and constituents by voting against this bill. 
   I worked at Great Northern Paper Company for over 28 years. My father worked there for 43. My grandfather before him for 40. Three days after I got sworn in as a Member of Congress, the very mill I worked at decided to close its doors because of trade. 
   Trade is not just a policy. It's a face, a name, a job, a family. The debate is, when will we change the course of trade policy so it can benefit the American economy, the American workers, the American families? When will we finally change our direction on trade and adopt a policy that makes sense for America? 
   A ``no'' vote on Peru means we want a new direction in trade. A ``no'' vote means we are sick of watching our jobs go overseas. A ``no'' vote means we reject imports made by child and slave labor. 
   Supporters of this trade agreement claim that strong labor and environmental protections are included. Then why does labor not support this bill? Why do the environmental groups not support this bill? And why does the President of the United States Chamber of Commerce support this bill? He made it very clear that the labor provisions are unenforceable. Those are his words. 
   This agreement is still based upon the same flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model. The proponents like to say it's not. But if you look at the investment chapter, the core investment chapter language, there are very little changes in that chapter in the core investment. 
   Now is the time for Congress to take a step back and consider what policies on trade is the best option, not the quickest one or the easiest one or the most politically expedient one. 
   In 2006, the American electorate voted overwhelmingly for Congress to move in a new direction. This is a golden opportunity to create a new policy, one that will help our workers achieve their highest potential, one that will protect our environment, one that will increase the standards of living for all countries involved. 
   Earlier this year, the Peruvian labor leaders had sent a letter to the Democratic leadership, and it gets to the point that Congressman Kucinich made earlier, urging Congress to reject this bad trade deal. They said if we have to accept it, make one change for us, and that has to do with privatization of Social Security. I would like to quote from that letter: 
   ``By rejecting the Peru FTA, the United States Congress and the Democratic Party in particular can show the world that they can advocate in not only words but deeds.'' 
   We have failed when it deals with the issue of globalization that was talked about earlier. We have failed to put on the President's desk the currency manipulation legislation. We have failed to put on the President's desk the value-added tax that we heard earlier this evening. We have failed to put on the President's desk legislation that will eliminate the tax haven. We have not made the USTR enforce these labor agreements. 
   The American people were not fooled about NAFTA. We heard a lot of the discussions during the NAFTA debate this evening about Peru. Over 3 million jobs have been lost because of NAFTA. Illegal immigration has increased partly because of NAFTA. 
   The American people will not be fooled about this trade deal. They will understand over time what this trade deal will mean to America. 
   It's important for this Democratic Congress to start looking at trade in a different light, to make sure that we have a trade policy that is fair, not only in words but in actions. 
   And that's why labor does not support this. That's why a lot of the environmental groups do not support this. But that is why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports this trade deal, because it's good for the large multinational corporations. 
   Right now, with this Democratic Congress, we have a chance to embrace globalization and make it work, to make it work for America, not against America.     
   As you heard earlier this evening from several of my colleagues who are opposed to this trade deal, it's about human faces. These individuals are just not numbers; they're human beings. And we, as a Congress, particularly a Democratic Congress, have to stand up for the individuals who cannot stand up for themselves. 
   This is a bad trade deal for America, and it is a bad trade deal for this Congress. 
   So, I implore my colleagues to vote against this trade deal tomorrow. I encourage you to continue to try to work with the Ways and Means Committee so we can come up with a new trade model that will actually work for America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I am asking Members who are committed to fair trade to vote against the Peru Free Trade Agreement. I can think of a million reasons to oppose this agreement. Let's start with over 3 million jobs lost because of NAFTA.  Workers in my State have lost their jobs due to trade. They don't want trade adjustment assistance. They want their jobs. 
   The bill's supporters claim that enhanced environmental standards in this FTA will preserve our natural resources. So where is the strong support from the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth? Supposedly the new labor provisions will improve conditions for workers in Peru and create jobs for workers here at home. So where is the support from labor? The two largest Peruvian labor unions are asking us to oppose this trade deal because it will hurt their workers. 
   If this is, in fact, a new direction on trade, don't you think we'd hear from the support from these groups? It is time for a trade policy that benefits workers and creates jobs, not policy that encourages companies to take their investment elsewhere. Yet we are not listening. By passing this bill, we are continuing the same disastrous results that came under NAFTA and CAFTA. 
   I didn't come to Washington so that I could ignore the needs of my constituents back home. I came to Washington to give a voice to those who need it. So let's start listening to the voices of the people back in our districts and take a new direction on trade, to start creating a new trade regime that will benefit all of us. 
   I ask Members to oppose the Peru Free Trade Agreement. Speaking about trade adjustment assistance that passed this body last week, before it left this body the President came out and said he was going to veto trade adjustment assistance. Is that working in a bipartisan manner? No, it is not. 
   I encourage Members to oppose the Peru Free Trade Agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5856, the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities Authorization and Lease Act of 2008. This legislation authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to build or lease major medical facilities across this country. I believe we must do everything possible to take care of the men and women who defend our Nation and fight for freedom around the world. 
   The facilities authorized in this legislation will provide the much-needed physical facilities around the country where we can take care of veterans for different health care reasons. This legislation has strong bipartisan support. We did take a lot of time working with the minority members and had hearings on this bill and actually went around the country to look at the facilities that the VA currently has. This bill is desperately needed to make sure that we keep upgrading and building the facilities that are needed around this great Nation of ours. 
   I do want to thank the staff on both the majority side and minority side for all their efforts in really moving this legislation forward. Especially I want to thank Mr. Miller, who has been a strong supporter of this legislation. We spent hundreds of hours going through this proposal with committee staff and within the VA staff as well. I especially want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Buyer, for your interest in this legislation as well. 
   This legislation did receive a lot of interest from a variety of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and we wish we could accommodate all the interest and concerns that we heard, but we were unable to do that at this time. We will be able to move forward with report language in this legislation that actually requires the VA to report back to the Veterans' Affairs Committee on how we deal with some of the lower cost items, CBOCs around the country, and look forward to that report. Hopefully, we will be able to move forward in a more aggressive way  and get the facilities that we need around the country. 
   With that, I would urge my colleagues to strongly support H.R. 5856.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 5554, the Justin Bailey Veterans Substance Use Disorders Prevention and Treatment Act of 2008. This legislation does amend title 38, United States Code, to expand and improve health care services available to veterans for substance use disorders. 
   It requires that all VA medical centers provide ready access to a full continuum of care for substance use disorders. And it explicitly defines that ``full continuum of care'' as ranging from initial screening through outpatient care and family therapy. We have an obligation to take care of the men and women who chose to fight for our freedom and the freedom of all oppressed people. 
   This legislation had strong bipartisan support during its development. I want to thank members of the Health Care Subcommittee, especially Mr. Miller, for their support and contributions to this legislation, as well as the committee staff on both sides of the aisle. 
   I also would like to thank Congresswoman Berkley, who has been a true advocate for our veterans, and who has been strongly involved in the development of this legislation as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   H.R. 2199 is a bipartisan effort to address the challenges presented by traumatic brain injury and to improve the quality of care for our rural veterans. 
   TBI is considered to be the signature wound of this war. TBI is complex and frequently overlooked or misdiagnosed. 
   We also have very little understanding of the long-term consequences of TBI. We must make sure that the VA is doing all they can to provide for these wounded soldiers. This is only the beginning, we still have more work to do, but this is a good first step. 
   H.R. 2199 also includes two provisions to improve the quality of care provided  to our rural veterans. With so many veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan living in rural areas, and an already existing population of older veterans in these areas, we need to explore innovative ways to improve VA accessibility and quality of care, especially on mental health issues. You heard both from the chairman and ranking member as far as what this legislation does. 
   I would like to recognize the hard work of a group of Members on both sides of the aisle who helped craft this legislation. This truly is bipartisan legislation. I do want to start with my good friend, Mr. Miller of Florida, who is the ranking member of the Health Care Subcommittee, who has been extremely helpful in getting this legislation introduced and moved through the full committee; also, Mr. Altmire of Pennsylvania, who has taken a real leadership role in traumatic brain injury, and for his focus on TBI with his legislation, H.R. 1944, which is included in H.R. 2199; Mr. Walz of Minnesota, for his legislation to establish centers for TBI research, education, and clinical activities, which are now also included in H.R. 2199, who also served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee; and Mr. McNerney of California, his legislation was included in H.R. 2199 to create the Committee on Care for Veterans with TBI; Mr. Donnelly, who sits on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, of Indiana, for his bill which was included in section 4 of H.R. 2199, to create an advisory committee on rural veterans; Mr. Welch of Vermont, for his bill and efforts to establish a pilot program for mobile vet centers, which are extremely important for rural areas; Mr. Lamborn of Colorado, for his amendment to include providing benefits outreach and assistance with claims for benefits as part of the mission of mobile vet centers. He also sits on the committee and was very helpful in making this bill a better bill. 
   So this truly has been a real bipartisan piece of legislation that took a lot of components of other bills that were through, that were introduced and we had hearings on, to be part of this bill. 
   I also would like to thank Ranking Member Buyer for his focus on this issue, and for his understanding of the importance of long-term research and the pursuit of the best practices for TBI care. He definitely has been very helpful with this legislation. 
   And, finally, I would like to thank and congratulate Chairman Filner for his strong bipartisan leadership on this bill and other veterans bills on the floor as well, and look forward to tackling other veterans issues as we move forward in the 110th Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2199.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, NAFTA held a great promise to provide workers in Mexico and the United States a livable wage. It simply hasn't lived up to that promise. Illegal immigration has increased. 
   The number of undocumented Mexican workers who live in the United States has skyrocketed in the NAFTA era from an estimated 1 million in the mid-1990s to about 6 million today. 
   While many people talk about closing down the U.S.-Mexico border, few care to confront the root cause of this issue: the failure of the NAFTA model to provide sustainable livelihoods for workers in Mexico. Over 1 million Mexican farmers lost their livelihoods due to NAFTA-mandated agricultural policy changes. Wages declined for workers. 
   These are just some of the reasons why one in ten Mexican citizens have made an often dangerous border crossing to the United States. 
   NAFTA is a failed model. It is time that we change the model. We can't afford to keep approving models based on the same old NAFTA model. And that is what Peru and Panama are, agreements based on the same flawed principles.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (FAILED TRADE POLICY -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. 
   I rise with my colleagues here this evening to talk about our failed trade policy. 
   As a former mill worker at Great Northern Paper Company in East Millinocket, Maine, I know firsthand how these trade deals have crippled our manufacturing base in the State of Maine. 
   When I ran for Congress, I told the people of the State of Maine I would fight for them, for their jobs and for their families every single day. Mainers know that these trade deals have left them behind. You can go almost anywhere in my district and find an abandoned mill or a vacant factory. They are painful reminders of what was and is no longer to be. Their jobs have been outsourced to countries that pay slave wages. How can we compete when our own workforce has been left behind? 
   The election results proved that the American public is sick and tired of their jobs being outsourced. They want a Congress that fights for our workers and businesses. They want this country to move in a new direction. They want this Congress to move in a new direction. 
   I will be the first to say that I am concerned when I am hearing from my fellow colleagues that we can't cut side deals on trade agreements. Some say maybe we can make a few concessions on both sides and a deal is cut. The American workforce is sick of these trade deals, these side deals being cut. They don't want more trade adjustment assistance; they want their jobs. 
   Some say that the pending free trade agreements, that we should do a side letter to appease labor, or maybe a couple tiny provisions that fix the environment. My mom always told me, you can't fix what's broken. Our trade policies are broken. 
   It is time to start from the ground up. It is time to renegotiate the Peru, the Colombia and the Panama Free Trade Agreements. With the TPA deadlines quickly approaching, we cannot rush something through. The American public deserves to have the new majority renegotiate these trade deals. 
   This election sent a strong message. It is to change course in what the Bush administration has done with our failed trade policies. There is no quick fix to this solution, not when these agreements are based on a flawed model. These agreements compromise our port security, they privatize Social Security, they threaten our intellectual property rights, they undermine  States' rights, and they infringe on access to medicines. 
   I strongly agree with Chairman Levin that we need to address these issues, and we need to do it now. Nonbinding side letters are not good enough. 
   Regarding the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, there is no fix that can make this agreement acceptable. It is highly offensive that the Bush administration even initiated negotiations with a country infamous for having the highest rate of trade unionists assassinated. More than 2,000 labor union activists have been murdered in Colombia since 1990. More than 2,000 labor unionists murdered since 1990, with 60 assassinated in 2006 alone, one per week. Until the Colombian Government changes this abominable situation, the United States should not offer any enhanced trade relations to Colombia. 
   And then let me touch on the biggest issue of them all: fast track. Fast track delegates away Congress' constitutional authority. It undermines our right to have a say in what goes on in these trade deals. We must replace this outdated, failed trade negotiating system. 
   Over 3 million American manufacturing jobs, one out of every six manufacturing jobs, have been lost during the fast track era. Before fast track, we had balanced trade. The United States trade deficit has exploded as imports surged. The worldwide gulf between the rich and the poor has widened since fast track. 
   I could go on and on and on about fast track. Fast track has put us on the wrong track, and it is time to turn it around. Any acceptable version of fast track must include the bare minimum of some of the following: 
   It would restore Congress' right to decide which countries it is in our national interest to negotiate new agreements. It would set mandatory requirements for what must and must not be in every agreement, including core labor and environmental standards. It would require Congress to vote on a trade agreement content before it can be signed, and it would not allow for secretive negotiations. A new negotiating system must include more oversight on how past agreements are actually working. It would reinstate our system of checks and balances. 
   I am pleased that some of my colleagues are here this evening to join me in this trade discussion, and I look forward to their remarks. I would like to thank them for their leadership as well in this area. 
   I now would like to introduce Congressman PHIL HARE, a newly elected freshman from Illinois, to be the next speaker. PHIL knows firsthand about how these trade agreements affect our manufacturing industries. Prior to working for Congressman Lane Evans, PHIL's first job was at the Seaford Clothing Factory in Rock Island. During the 13 years, he cut linen for men's suits there. 
   PHIL served as a union leader and as the president of Unite Here Local 617. As district director for then-Congressman Lane Evans, PHIL HARE fought for the working men and women in his district. Phil is a leader among the freshman class on trade issues. 
   Phil, I want to thank you for your tremendous leadership on this very important issue that affects men and women throughout the United States. I yield to the good gentleman.

So I really appreciate your leadership and look forward to continuing working with you as we move forward in this area. 
   There is another Member I would like to recognize, not a member of the freshman class, but this Member has been a true advocate for fair trade. Congresswoman Kaptur has been a tremendous leader in this fair trade fight. 
   MARCY came to Congress from a working-class background. Her family operated a small grocery where her mother worked, after serving on the original organizing committee of an auto trade union at Champion Spark Plug. MARCY knows firsthand how these unfair trade deals have affected industry throughout her congressional district in Ohio and has been a key player in our trade working group in the House. 
   I really appreciate all the leadership and expertise that you have brought forward on this issue, Congresswoman Kaptur. You have been a true leader, and you have been a mentor to me ever since I got elected to Congress. So thank you, and I yield you such time as you may consume.

   We also have been joined by Mr. Ellison, who represents the Fifth District in Minnesota with distinction. Congressman Ellison believes NAFTA and CAFTA have encouraged the movement of manufacturing and agricultural jobs out of Minnesota to be done under sweat-shop conditions in other countries. 
   A 2003 report by the Minnesota Fair Trade Coalition reported that at least a quarter and likely one-third of the net 45,000 manufacturing jobs that Minnesota lost from 2001 to 2003 were directly attributable to trade deals such as NAFTA.

   During his career as an ironworker, Congressman Lynch worked at a General Motors plant in Framingham, Massachusetts, the General Dynamics shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, and the United States Steel plant in Gary, Indiana, all of which were shut down due to foreign competition and unfavorable trade conditions. 
   Mr. Lynch's firsthand experience in seeing the effects of plant closures on American workers and on local communities has led him to focus on efforts to improve United States trade policy and help protect not only American workers but also American businesses which also feel strongly about these trade deals and have been working very closely with the United States Business and Industry Council to make sure that we have fair trade deals. I look forward to hearing Congressman Lynch's remarks.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for his comments. We have talked a lot about the individual workers, but, also, this really devastates the community. 
   Three days after I got sworn in as a Member of Congress, the company I worked for filed bankruptcy. The Great Northern paid approximately 65 percent of the tax base in the town of East Millinocket. That had a devastating effect on what is going to happen to the school system as far as being able to get the taxes owed because of the mill going through bankruptcy. But also other small businesses in the community actually had to close down because they relied on the workers in the mill to help keep the small businesses going and running. 
   When you talk about getting retrained, my colleagues I worked with at the mill, they were up in the age of 50 or 60 years old. Now they have got to go back to school. A lot of them never went to school beyond high school. Now they had to go back and try to further their education, which is very difficult, and get trained. For what? 
   If you look at what happened in our State, we had mill after mill, paper machine after paper machine, shut down. It has been very, very difficult to find jobs in these communities, and it is very disheartening to see grown men and women for the first time in their lives that they actually had to go and ask for help for food. They had to raise funds to fund the food bank, and it is very difficult. 
   I just hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have seen the failed trade policy that has come about starting with NAFTA, and I know it was a Democratic administration, but probably conceptually sounded good. But now we have got a track record of what NAFTA has brought us; and, hopefully, we have learned our lesson and will be able to move forward in the manner that we do have fair trade deals. 
   I will open it up for any discussion that my colleagues might have.

   Mr. MICHAUD. You are absolutely right. The American people, they do get it, and that is why they sent so many freshmen Members here in this Congress on the very issue that they talked about in their campaigns, and that issue is trade. 
   We are heading for disaster, a perfect storm. We have the largest budgetary deficit in the United States history, with over 45 percent approximately is owned by foreigners. We have the largest trade deficit in our history, over $202 billion with China alone. It is over I think approximately, what, 7 percent of our GDP? 
   We are heading on a collision course. We must make sure that we have a strong manufacturing base here in the United States, and that is why I look forward to working with my colleagues here on the floor, look forward to working with a good, diverse group of the United States Business and Industry Council, labor, environmental groups, my colleagues across the aisle, Congressman WALTER JONES, DUNCAN HUNTER, TIM RYAN on our side of the aisle and BETTY SUTTON. 
   So I am really excited. We see new life here in Congress as it relates to trade, and we have just got to keep talking about trade so that our colleagues will start paying attention to what is going on here.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding; and I also want to thank Congressman Hare for bringing this issue forward. Having worked with Congressman Hare over the last month or so, I know he is going to fill the shoes of Congressman Evans and fight for veterans issues. I really appreciate that. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 521, designating the post office in Rock Island, Illinois, as the Lane Evans Post Office Building. It is right that we should honor Congressman Lane Evans. 
   Lane Evans will be known for the years he spent fighting for veterans and their families and for attacking issues like mental health, toxic exposure and homelessness. These issues were once brushed aside. Now, because of Lane Evans, we face them and we deal with them. Because of Lane Evans, many Americans will lead healthier and better lives. 
   He never sacrificed what he felt was important. He always remembered why he came to Washington and who sent him here. 
   Even though he is no longer in Congress, I know that he will continue to fight for what he believes in. His influence will be felt in all the work that we do for the rest of our times here in Congress. 
   Congressman Evans has been a mentor to me and many others in this body. It is an honor for me to speak in support of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 521 honoring our dear friend and colleague and fighter for our veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (OPPOSE THE PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, many of the newly elected freshmen campaigned on a platform of ensuring a significant change of course from the Bush trade policy. 
   The Peru Free Trade Agreement is based on the same flawed NAFTA-CAFTA model that has been so devastating to industries all across our Nation. 
   While I campaigned for this seat 5 years ago, the cornerstone of my campaign also was to fix our broken trade policies. I've seen firsthand what they have done to the State of Maine. 
   I firmly believe that in order to address our trade imbalance, we have to change the trade model. The Peru Free Trade Agreement is the same old model with a little lipstick. 
   There is overwhelming opposition to the agreement by unions, environmental, consumer and small business groups. They're all asking Congress to oppose the Peru FTA. Who supports the bill? The large multinational corporations, Big Business, does. 
   When Tom Donahue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce,  states that he is ``encouraged by assurance that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance with ILO conventions,'' we should be more than skeptical. 
   While we have all heard that the Peru trade agreement text improves labor and environmental standards, we fail to hear that they were added on top of the same old NAFTA and CAFTA text. The bottom line: this is another Bush NAFTA expansion. 
   Key unions are worried about the labor provisions. The new provisions require countries to adopt, maintain, and enforce only the terms of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 
   The new FTA language does not require signatories to meet the ILO conventions. That's the binding standards. The declaration is a nonbinding statement. 
   It is highly likely that changes to the environment and labor provisions will have no real effect on the ground. 
   We all know that the Bush administration has a long record of not enforcing the standards of past trade agreements. Why should they start now? 
   And there are so many problems with the Peru Free Trade Agreement, whether it's the privatization of Social Security, ban on anti-offshoring, or failure to protect our intellectual property rights. There are more than enough reasons to oppose the Peru FTA. Not to mention if you look at NAFTA, NAFTA has caused a worse problem here in the United States with illegal immigration. The Peru Free Trade Agreement will do the same thing, cause the illegal immigration problem to get worse. 
   I could go on and on about the Peru FTA. I ask my colleagues to really listen to what America is saying about these free trade agreements. I'm asking Members to vote their conscience. Oppose the Peru FTA.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This legislation will provide the single largest investment in higher education since the GI bill, helping low- and middle-income students and families pay for college. 
   Unfortunately, too many Maine students do not obtain a postsecondary education because they cannot afford the dramatically escalating costs of higher education. This legislation is a historic opportunity to put education goals within reach for many students by increasing funding for Pell Grants, cutting interest rates on subsidized student loans, and increasing funding for Upward Bound. 
   While there are provisions within the underlying bill to protect small lenders, I will continue to work hard to ensure that the small lenders in Maine, including the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME), are protected in the final legislation. FAME has provided many Maine students the opportunity to go on to postsecondary education and it's important to ensure that they, and other small lenders, are able to continue to provide the best service possible for Maine students.

   Mr. Speaker, I come to this floor as a proud union member after working 28 years at a paper mill in Maine. I come here as cochair of the Labor and Working Families Caucus. I come on behalf of the hardworking men and women of the State of Maine, and I am here to say we need to pass this legislation. The salaries of Members of Congress have increased by $31,600 since 1997, while the minimum wage continues to earn just $10,700 a year. Today, the average CEO earns more before lunchtime the very first day he goes to work than the minimum wage earner earns all year long. What kind of priorities are these? 
   We sometimes forget the face of the minimum wage worker. They aren't the corporate giants. They aren't the special interests. They are the hardworking men and women of this country, and they deserve a raise. 
   There is still more that we can do to help our people in this country work their way out of poverty and achieve prosperity, but increasing the minimum wage is a necessary first step.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this College Student Relief Act of 2007. This bill will help thousands of students throughout the State of Maine. 
   Maine has one of the highest high school graduation rates in the country. However, only one out of four Mainers go on to complete college. That is because college costs are rising, and  many Maine students cannot afford their tuition. Too many are being denied the opportunity that college provides. 
   The legislation before us today would save students thousands of dollars on their loan repayment by cutting interest rates in half. Students in Maine beginning college in the fall of 2007 would save $2,107 on their loans, and those starting in 2011 would save $4,210. 
   This bill is also consistent with the pay-as-you-go principle that my fellow Blue Dogs and I have long advocated and that the Speaker has committed to. So it will not increase the deficit one dime. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation to help all the young people live the American Dream.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Chairman, I want to give just one example why this investment is important to our Nation. 
   The Module Ballistic Protection System, developed at the University of Maine, is made of light, strong-as-metal wood composite panels that are inserted into tents to protect our soldiers over in Iraq and Afghanistan. This life-saving technology would not have been possible without the initial investment from the wood utilization funding. 
   In fact, this funding spurred advances in many different industries. It creates jobs and, in some cases, it will save American lives. This funding benefits the entire Nation. 
   I urge the rejection of the gentleman's amendment.  
   I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman from Arizona's amendment. 
   Investment in Wood Utilization Research at these locations including the University of Maine supports education and economic development across our country. 
   The funding encourages students to pursue careers in advanced wood science and engineering at a time when international competition in these fields is growing. This type of research is important to a growing number of industrial applications and to our national economy. 
   At U-Maine, every dollar appropriated to the Center generates an additional $7 in economic output. The research has promoted important advances in fields as diverse and important as biofuels and advanced wood composites. 
   I want to highlight one program in particular that was born from this funding. The Modular Ballistic Protection System, developed at the U-Maine Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center, is a series of lightweight, strong-as-metal, wood composite panels that are inserted into tents to protect our soldiers from mortars and other incoming fire in Iraq and Afghanistan. This lifesaving technology would not have been possible without the initial investment from the Wood Utilization funding. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's intent but I believe it is misguided. In offering these kinds of amendments, the gentleman has frequently asked: what is the federal interest? 
   Well, in this case, it is clear. This is a project with national implications that helps our competitiveness, our industries, and our national defense. It is an investment that the federal government should be making so that America can lead the way in a variety of important R&D fields, create jobs, and in some cases, save American lives. 
   We do not pick any winners and losers here with this project--in fact, we all win with this research. So I urge the rejection of the gentleman's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (PATENT REFORM ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Congressman Rohrabacher. I really appreciate both yours and Congressman Manzullo's leadership on this patent issue. It's definitely an issue that's very important. 
   Tomorrow, the House is expected to consider the Patent Reform Act of 2007. I strongly oppose this bill. It's fundamentally flawed. 
   There are nearly 300 large, small businesses, associations, universities, and labor unions from a wide diversity of industry and perspectives that have raised serious concerns about this legislation. 
   H.R. 1908, the Patent Reform Act of 2007, as you heard earlier, has been described as, I quote from one of the quotes, ``the most sweeping changes in America's patent system since 1952.'' 
   Yet, the House Judiciary Committee reported H.R. 1908 to the floor of the House after holding only one public hearing this Congress and despite bipartisan and widespread cross-industry opposition. 
   At a time when America's innovators, manufacturers, and laborers need strong patent protection to compete internationally, the net effect of this bill will be to weaken patent protection by making patents less reliable, easier to challenge and cheaper to infringe. 
   H.R. 1908 is a severe threat to American innovation, American jobs and American competitiveness, and ought to be opposed. 
   Hundreds of companies and organizations around the United States have written to Congress to raise serious objections about this legislation. And you heard some of them earlier: manufacturers, organized labor, biotech, nanotech, pharmaceuticals, small businesses, independent inventors, universities, economic development organizations, and the list goes on. 
   Foreign companies are watching this legislation, and the reason why they are watching and eagerly looking at this legislation is they want to attack U.S. patents, as evidenced by the recent article in the Economic Times, India's second largest newspaper. 
   We are compromising many of our industries by passing this legislation. Many stakeholders of the United States patent system have complained about the process surrounding the Patent Reform Act. 
   Only one hearing has occurred on this bill in this Congress. Tomorrow we are prepared to vote on this bill without ample time to review the two manager's amendments designed to address some of the complaints that have been raised about this. And this actually is violating the pledge made at the beginning of this Congress to allow Members ample time to review legislation. 
   Patent legislation is very complicated. It's very technical, and we need that ample time to review it. So at this point in time I would urge my colleagues to defeat the bill tomorrow and send it back to the Judiciary Committee, because we do have to make some changes in patent reform. I'm not ultimately opposed to it. We have to make changes. But this legislation is not the way to go. 
   So with that, I want to thank the good gentleman for yielding time to me and, hopefully, we'll be able to get the problems corrected with this patent reform law.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (VETERANS' HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman FILNER and Ranking Member Buyer for their leadership on the Committee and for moving these four bills forward to help our veterans. I would also like to thank Ranking Member Miller for working with me on the veterans' health care bills we are considering today. 
   I will limit my comments to H.R. 2874, although I support each of the bills we are considering today. H.R. 2874 was passed unanimously by our Committee. It represents a bipartisan effort to address a variety of issues facing our veterans. 
   Section 2 of H.R. 2874 supports therapeutic readjustment programs to assist veterans in their long physical and mental journey home through a new grant program. Veterans already participate in these programs without any financial assistance or guidance from the VA. It is my hope that this new grant program will increase the number of veterans using these rehabilitative options and that this will enable VA and providers to better assess the benefits of these programs to veterans. 
   Section 3 authorizes funding for transportation grants for rural veterans. Access to care is a significant challenge for rural veterans. This program will provide grants to VSOs to implement innovative ways of overcoming this challenge. This section was authored by Mr. SALAZAR. 
   Section 4 provides permanent authority for VA treatment of participants in the DOD chemical and biological testing conducted by Deseret Test Center, including Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense). This permanent authority was requested by the VA. Section 5 extends collections authorities for the VA until 2009. This extension was also requested by the VA. 
   Section 6 authorizes the VA to provide expanded readjustment and mental health services in areas determined by the secretary to be underserved, especially peer-to-peer outreach services, for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans. 
   Sections 7 and 8 come from Congressman PATRICK MURPHY's legislation, H.R. 2699. It is no surprise that Congressman Murphy has taken a leadership role in helping our Nation's veterans, and I thank him for his work. There are as many as 200,000 veterans on the streets each night. This is a shame on our Nation that must be addressed. The provisions from Congressman MURPHY's bill are critical to ending this shame and helping these veterans find their way home. 
   Section 7 expands and extends the successful VA program of referral and counseling for at-risk veterans transitioning from certain institutions. The program is extended to 2011 and expanded from six locations to 12. These services are largely directed toward incarcerated veterans. There were over 225,000 veterans in prison in 1998. I believe it is important that we make every effort to make sure that they do not return to prison. 
   Section 8 requires the Secretary to ensure that VA domiciliary programs are adequate in capacity and safety to meet the needs of women veterans. Homeless women veterans are an increasing proportion of the homeless veteran population. We need to make sure that facilities are capable of safely caring for this population and helping them get back on their feet. 
   Section 9 authorizes funding for the Secretary to provide financial assistance to eligible entities to provide supportive services for very low-income veteran families residing in permanent housing. This section comes from a bill authored by Congresswoman HERSETH SANDLIN. 
   Section 10 changes from 60 days to 30 days the required time for a homeless veteran to be in a VA program before they are eligible for dental care. Section 11 makes technical amendments to title 38. 
   Overall, this bill continues the ongoing efforts of our Committee and this Congress to address the needs of our veterans and their families. It is my hope that when we return in September, we can work quickly with the Senate to create an omnibus package that includes H.R. 2874, H.R. 2199, Mr. Miller's bill H.R. 2623, and other important veterans' health care initiatives to send to the President for his signature. 
   I believe this is a good bipartisan bill and I ask my colleagues for their support.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, in the coming days Congress will consider the Peru Free Trade Agreement. I rise tonight to ask why are we in such a rush to approve a flawed and misguided trade policy. 
   The Peru Free Trade Agreement doesn't enjoy the support of any of the constituencies which it's supposed to benefit. No labor unions vocally are out supporting this agreement. Why would they? The labor standards are unenforceable. It doesn't protect ``buy America.'' It promotes off-shoring of our industries. 
   The Peru Free Trade Agreement is just like the NAFTA-CAFTA framework. NAFTA has cost Maine over 23 percent of our manufacturing base. The new labor environmental language will do nothing to improve the situation. 
   The Bush administration claims that the agreement will improve labor standards in Peru and, in the next breath, Tom Donahue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce states that he is ``encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance with the ILO conventions.'' 
   So why are we rushing to approve such a toothless measure? 
   Why is Congress moving so fast to approve a trade policy which has not been subject to a full hearing since the deal was announced? The last hearing on the Peru Free Trade Agreement in the Ways and Means Committee was held in 2006. There are no environmental groups that are rallying support for the unenforceable environmental protections. That includes the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth.  
   So why are we not taking the time to consider the impact the Peru FTA will have on our environment, our intellectual property or privatization of Social Security? 
   Even the labor leaders of major Peruvian labor organizations oppose this agreement. They urge Congress to vote ``no,'' claiming that it will weaken labor standards, encourage illegal immigration to the United States, and increase the rates of drug trafficking and violence. 
   So who supports this agreement? Big Business. It's the large multinational companies who seek to profit off the backs of working men and women in our country. 
   Remember back on May 10 when we heard about the new trade model? Well, if it's so new and great, then why aren't we hearing from all sides on the trade debate asking us to support it? There is a reason: there is not much new about it. It's the same old model with a little fancy title. 
   I ask my colleagues to take a step back and consider this agreement carefully, demand the enforcement of the labor standards that conform with the ILO Conventions and environmental protection that might actually protect the environment. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider the impact of this agreement and to question why we are moving so quickly to box ourselves into a corner. And I'm asking Members to listen to their constituents. 
   All across this country, the American citizens are opposed to these bad, flawed trade deals. This is more of the same. We must have a new trade model. We have to start thinking globally of how we're going to deal with the globalization in this world today. So I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Peru trade deal.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, S. 521 is a bill to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 515 West First Street in Duluth, Minnesota, as Judge Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse. 
   Gerald Heaney was appointed judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on November 3, 1966. He took senior status on December 31, 1988, and retired on August 31, 2006, after over 40 years of distinguished service to his country and the citizens of Minnesota. I rise in strong support of this bill. 
   Judge Heaney was born on January 29, 1918, in Goodhue, a rural community in the southeastern part of Minnesota. As a child growing up in a farming community, Judge Heaney learned the value of a close family, honesty, and hard work. These qualities have marked not only his personal life but also his life as a public servant. 
   He was educated at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul and received his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1941. 
   Gerald Heaney is a decorated World War II veteran and was a member of the distinguished Army Ranger Battalion and participated in the historic D-Day landing at Normandy. He was awarded the Silver Star for extraordinary bravery in the Battle of La Pointe du Hoc in Normandy. He also received a Bronze Star and five battle stars. At the end of the war, Judge Heaney returned home and entered private practice in Duluth. During this time, he was instrumental in improving the State's education system, and served on the board of regents for the University of Minnesota. 
   He was instrumental in helping develop for the Duluth school system the same pay scale for both men and women. In 1966, he was appointed by President Johnson to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. In that capacity, he has been a champion in protecting the rights of the disadvantaged. He was devoted to making sure that every person had an equal opportunity for an education, a job, and a home. 
   He firmly believes the poor and the less educated and the less advantaged deserve the protection of the Constitution. As a hardworking, well-prepared and fair-minded jurist, he left his legal stamp on school desegregation cases, bankruptcy laws, prison treatment, and Social Security law. His public service is marked by industry, brilliance, and scholarly excellence. His compassion and dedication to those most disadvantaged is unparalleled. 
   Judge Heaney is most deserving of this honor. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, I am asking Members who are committed to a fair trade deal to vote against the Peru FTA. While I have been a Member of Congress for only 5 years, I have been a mill worker all my life. The mill I worked at in Maine shut down 3 days after I was sworn in as a Member of Congress. The culprit? Badly flawed trade deals. 
   This lunch bucket sits proudly in my office. It symbolizes who I am, what I stand for. It also symbolizes what has been lost. 
   Since the passage of NAFTA, our country has lost over 3 million jobs. When the vote on NAFTA happened, Members of Congress were promised NAFTA would raise the standard of living for all. They were sold a dream, but the dream is now a nightmare of millions of workers all across this country. 
   The American people get it. Polling indicates that an overwhelming number of Americans, Republicans and Democrats, are concerned about exporting our jobs. They worry whether or not they will have a paycheck in the years to come. We have all seen the ugly face of trade agreements that don't live up to the promises. The debate here today is not whether Peru is a small country and the trade impact is small compared to China. The debate is when will we truly change the course of trade policy. 
   If this was truly a good trade policy, I would be the first to support it. The bill's supporters claim that enhanced environmental standards in the FTA will preserve our natural resources.  Where is the strong support from Sierra Club, Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth? 
   The new labor provisions supposedly will improve conditions for workers in Peru and create jobs here at home. So why is no single labor union actively supporting this trade agreement? That's right, not one, not one labor union. 
   If this so-called new model is so great, then why aren't we hearing from all sides of the trade debate asking us to support it? If you stand with the multinational corporations that seek to offshore jobs, then vote for it. If you stand with the Chamber of Commerce who says that these labor standards are unenforceable, then vote for this trade deal. If you stand by President Bush, who has a track record of listening to corporations instead of the men and women of this country, by all means vote for this trade deal. 
   But if you stand by the working men and women of this country, I would encourage you, you must vote ``no.'' A ``no'' vote calls for a new model and a new direction on trade. A ``no'' vote means you stand up with the workers of northern Maine; Lorain, Ohio; Flint, Michigan; Galesburg, Illinois, and men and women all across this country who are asking, no, who are begging this Congress for a new direction on trade. These workers don't want more trade adjustment assistance; they want their job back. 
   It's time to send a message that we embrace globalization so long as it lifts us all up. I will never forget who I am or why I am here. I hope my colleagues will do the same. 
   I ask my colleagues today to vote ``no'' on this bad trade deal. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MICHAUD. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule, and I ask my colleagues to consider voting against this rule for one simple reason, and that's time. I respect the work of our Rules Committee; I do not oppose this rule lightly. 
   But the fact of the matter is, under this rule, we would begin debating a huge change to our patent system that would have major ramifications for our economy. We have just returned from a long work period in our districts. We found the committee report filed late in the day when we came back, and two manager's amendments filed late yesterday. Most Members haven't had time to understand what the manager's amendment fixes or doesn't fix. 
   I can tell you, having worked all night late last night with staff to find out what the manager's amendment does: it actually worsens the underlying bill, especially with respect to the damages section of this bill. But Members aren't going to be given the time to really consider what the manager's amendment does or what it does not do. They are going to be told to trust the changes that have been made to fix a badly flawed legislation. 
   Congressman Manzullo and I went to the Rules Committee yesterday to request that we not vote on this bill because it's not ready for floor action. We asked for more time to debate the bill in order for the opposition to be heard. We were denied. With over 300 organizations who are opposed to this legislation, have very serious concerns about this legislation, it is important that their voices be heard in this debate. 
   We do need to address our patent system, and we must have the time to do it and do it right. By voting down this rule, we would give this House and the American people the time to make the right choices for our innovators, our jobs, our economy. So I would urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Today I rise in strong opposition to the Patent Reform Act of 2007. While I appreciate all of the hard work that Chairman Berman did on this bill, I think this bill is bad for our manufacturing industry. 
   We have been told that the manager's amendment significantly improves the bill. It actually is worse than the underlying bill, especially with respect to the damages section in the bill. This bill is fundamentally flawed. It can't be fixed by the manager's amendment. 
   This bill will weaken patent protection by making patents less reliable, easier to challenge, and cheaper to infringe. This bill severely threatens American innovation, jobs and competitiveness and ought to be opposed. 
   Hundreds of companies and organizations around the country have written Congress to raise their strong opposition and their strong objections to certain provisions of this bill. Manufacturers, organized labor, biotech, nanotech, pharmaceuticals, small businesses, universities, and economic development organizations have serious concerns about this legislation. 
   Foreign companies are watching this legislation and are eager to attack U.S. patents. The Economic Times reports that Indian companies see an opportunity to challenge our patents; and by doing so, they will leave our businesses in a litigation crisis. 
   We are compromising many of our industries by passing this bill. We are creating a litigation nightmare. We need to proceed to get a better bill, and I urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation so we can move forward on legislation with more people who will support patent reform which has to be changed. I urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. I thank the gentlewoman and the gentleman for yielding. 
   The Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 represents a vision for economic development in our Nation that will help Americans in the most distressed regions of our country. 
   In the northern border region, we are seeing clearly persistent patterns of economic distress. If you look at the 36 counties that lie on the border or right next to the border between Maine and New York, you will find poverty above the national average, medium household income that is more than $6,500 below the national average, persistent unemployment through layoffs in traditional manufacturing industries, and most striking of all, a meager gain of only 0.6 percent in population between 1990 and 2000, compared to the 13 percent growth nationally over the same period. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, our mills are closing, our young people are leaving, and too many of our workers are looking for work. Clearly, this region has a common set of challenges and a compelling need for investment in new growth. 
   Two days after I was elected to Congress, the very mill that I worked at for over 28 years went bankrupt, and my hometown and region were devastated. The story of my town and the mill that I worked at has been repeated across our region. That is why we need to support our regional industries and build new job opportunities, and that is why we need the investment, leadership and focus in our regional economic development bill. 
   The Northern Border Commission would help the region invest in transportation, health care, agriculture, broadband, and alternative energy. It can be a partner with businesses to maintain our industry and build a new industry cluster. It can help us create jobs in the long term. 
   We have all the ingredients we need to face our challenges head-on and make our region an economic engine. This new commission will help us make the fundamental changes for our future. 
   I want to once again thank the chairman and chairwoman for all their hard work on this bill. This bill is a new way to look at economic development in our Nation. 
   So with that, hopefully our colleagues will pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (PERU FTA -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Peru free trade agreement. I can't figure out why Congress is taking up this agreement now, especially when the Bush administration has had such a bad track record of enforcing any of our trade agreements. 
   President Bush has given little or nothing to our workers these last few years other than a pink slip. So why give them another vehicle for job losses? 
   Last week, the House passed a trade adjustment assistance overhaul bill. This legislation would provide our workers much-needed relief, but we wouldn't need more trade adjustment assistance legislation if we had better trade agreements. 
   Even before the TAA bill passed the House, we heard that the President would veto it. So what would the House Democrats be doing by taking up the Peru free trade agreement without a TAA bill? 
   And just last week we heard from the House leadership that there will be no China currency manipulation bill this year either. So let's review what we are getting out of our new trade deal: no additional relief for our workers, no China currency manipulation bill, no value added tax bill, no enforcement of existing trade policy. 
   This is what we do get. We get another NAFTA-style trade deal. What do workers get? The same old direction on trade. 
   The biggest supporter of the agreement is big multinational corporations. As a matter of fact, the President will be meeting with them tomorrow to get them to lobby for the passage of the Peru trade deal. It's the large multinational companies who seek to profit off the backs of working men and women in our country. 
   The Bush administration claims that the agreement will improve labor standards in Peru, and in the very next breath, Tom Donohue, who's president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, states that he is ``encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance with ILO Conventions.'' 
   These multinational companies like Peru, they love these free trade agreements because it's not enforceable. 
   While some may think that there has been progress made on the environment and labor provisions by the Peru FTA, all you need to do is look at who's supporting these trade deals. Not one union supports this trade deal, not one union, environmental, consumer, small business, faith, family farm group supports the modified Bush Peru NAFTA-style trade deal. 
   Even the leaders of major Peruvian labor organizations oppose this agreement. They urge Congress to vote ``no,'' claiming that it will weaken labor standards, encourage illegal immigration to the United States, and increase rates of drug trafficking as well. 
   By voting ``no'' to the Peru FTA, you're asking for a new direction on trade. I ask my colleagues to join me and vote ``no'' on the Peru free trade deal. It's a bad deal for America. It's a bad deal for Peru. It's the same old, same old NAFTA-style trade deal that we're dealing with.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the workers at NewPage Corporation in Rumford, Maine, and Fraser Timber Limited in Ashland, Maine. These workers received some devastating news this week about job losses and layoffs. Fraser Timber Limited will lay off 70 workers on February 8, 2008 to June 1, 2008. NewPage Corporation announced a shutdown of a paper machine in Rumford as of February 25, 2008. This decision could impact approximately 60 to 70 jobs in Maine. 
   In Maine, we are all too familiar with an economic and trade policy that has devastated our manufacturing sector. As a mill worker for nearly 30 years at Great Northern Paper Company, I know how devastating this news is for these workers and their families. When this happens in small rural communities in Maine, it ripples through the economy and throughout the region. 
   When the House considers a potential economic stimulus package in the next few weeks, I'll keep the workers of NewPage and Fraser at the forefront of my mind. Any economic stimulus package the House considers must consider what's good for our workers and their industry. We must get back to fiscal discipline, yet provide the relief so many people in Maine need. 
   But if we are truly trying to reform our economy, we must also address the serious trade imbalance that's creating this job loss. It's no secret that trade has gotten the better of Maine's manufacturing industry. Since passage of NAFTA, Maine has lost 23 percent of our manufacturing base. 
   Today the USTR Trade Representative Susan Schwab said that moving forward on these trade agreements will actually help our economy. Well, I can tell you this, she obviously hasn't talked to the men and women of NewPage and Fraser. She hasn't talked to other workers in Maine and across this country that have been devastated by these NAFTA-style trade deals. These workers don't want more TAA. They want their jobs back. 
   I've been in touch with the Maine Department of Labor Rapid Response Team, the workers at the mills, to discuss the implication of this, the paper machine shutting down on these workers. In the days and weeks ahead, my office will be working to provide whatever assistance is necessary to help these workers get back to work. But they want their jobs. 
   Mainers have rallied for each other during difficult times in the past and will do so again. I'll continue to be involved in meeting the needs of our workers affected by this announcement, and I'll stay in close contact with plant officials and workers in the days ahead. 
   But this Congress has to look at the fundamental problem with our flawed trade models and trade deals that we've been passing in this Congress. And this Congress is no different than the previous Congress. We continue to use the same flawed trade model, and that's going to continue to hurt workers and manufacturing businesses here in this country. 
   This Congress has to wake up to what's actually happening out there. We will not need any economic stimulus package if we make sure that we pass fair trade deals that are good for our workers here, that are good for our businesses here in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (VETERANS' HEALTH CARE POLICY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6445, the Veterans Health Care Policy Enhancement Act. I would like to thank Mr. Cazayoux for this progressive piece of legislation, and Representatives Doyle, Walz, Buyer and Hare for their significant contributions. Thank you also Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for your support of this measure. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the great effort of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee staff in compiling this bill and achieving it's strong bi-partisan nature. 
   Over the past few decades, VA has transformed the way it delivers care to our veterans. This transformation has significantly increased their efficiency, increased veterans' access to care, and aligned the VA with the health care industry at large. 
   Unfortunately, certain policies that are relics of the previous era of health care delivery remain. This bill will modernize VA policies regarding copayments for nonservice-connected, catastrophically disabled, Category Group 4 veterans; pain care; counseling services for family members; and HIV testing. Additionally, this legislation enhances the VA's ability to collect third party payments. 
   Currently, there are approximately 25,000 non-service connected catastrophically disabled veterans enrolled in Priority Group 4. These veterans have a permanent, severely disabling injury, disorder, or disease that compromises their ability to carry out many activities of daily living. 
   The very nature and severity of their disabilities precludes them from employment. Yet current VA policy requires these veterans to pay copayments for their care. 
   Section 2 of this bill prohibits VA from collecting copayments from these vulnerable veterans. 
   Another legacy policy of the VA states that families of veterans being treated for non-service connected disabilities are only eligible for family support services, such as counseling, training or mental health services, if they are necessary for the veteran's treatment and they are initiated during the veteran's hospitalization and they are essential for the discharge of the veteran from the hospital. 
   Since the VA has transformed to a predominantly outpatient-based system, this policy is no longer effective. 
   Section 3 of this bill removes these restrictions on the provision of family support services. This is essential for our newest generation of veterans and their families. 
   Veterans suffer from acute and chronic pain in proportions far exceeding the general population. In fact, pain is the leading cause of disability among veterans. 
   To address the issue, the VA developed a ``National Pain Management Strategy'' and issued a directive to make pain management a national priority. However, this directive expired May 31, 2008 and reports from the field suggest that implementation has been far from consistent. 
   Section 4 of this bill mandates that the VA develop and implement a comprehensive policy on the management of pain experienced by veterans. It requires the VA to develop the policy in consultation with veterans service organizations and other 7137 
   organizations with expertise in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and management of pain. 
   Current law authorizes the VA to bill veterans' insurance companies (third-party collections) for non-service connected care provided to veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. A June 2008 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that $1.2 to $1.4 billion dollars go uncollected annually by VA due to improper coding, delays in billing, and collections follow-up. 
   In 2005, VA created the Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Patient Accounting Center (CPAC) in Asheville, North Carolina which has been tremendously successful. 
   Section 5 of this bill would require the VA establish no more than seven other CPACs to help maximize its collections by using industry best-practices to improve timely and accurate billing and enhance collections. 
   The VA is the largest, single provider of HIV/AIDS care in the United States with over 22,800 patients with HIV/AIDS. In 1988, Congress passed legislation that required the VA obtain a veteran's written informed consent before being tested for HIV. This was based on the best practice in 1988. 
   However, since then our knowledge of HIV/AIDS has increased significantly and treatments have advanced significantly. As a result, in 2006, the CDC revised their recommendations regarding diagnostic HIV testing. CDC now recommends HIV testing be a part of routine clinical care and recommends that separate written consent for HIV screening should no longer be required. 
   Section 6 of this bill brings VA HIV/AIDS care up to current standards of practice. 
   All the provisions in this bill are intended to enhance current VA policies to bring them into the 21st century. 
   The improvements in these policies will have a direct and positive impact on improving the quality of healthcare our veterans receive.  
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6445.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Acadia National Park Improvement Act. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young, as well as subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop, for their work on this measure. 
   This is a very important bill for the State of Maine as well as the future of Acadia National Park. Acadia National Park is a spectacular and unique landscape of mountains, hills, ponds, marshes and shorelines. 
   Earlier visitors to Mount Desert Island and its surroundings helped to establish Acadia as the first national park east of the Mississippi. The park is a major engine of the regional economy, bringing in almost $130 million in visitor spending to the region, and supporting over 2,600 jobs. 
   The Acadia National Park Improvement Act will help the park continue to attract visitors to the area and maintain and preserve their important natural resources. It allows the park to continue to complete the vision laid out in the 1986 law setting the park's boundaries and to enhance the emission-reducing Island Explorer bus system. 
   Most importantly, this legislation will reauthorize the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission. The commission brings representatives of surrounding towns, the State of Maine, and the Department of the Interior together to make sure all community members are involved in park planning. 
   I want to thank everyone involved for their hard work on this, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this important bill for the State of Maine.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 124 authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service. Over 150 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2006 will be honored at this memorial service. 
   In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15 as Peace Officers' Memorial Day, and the week in which the date falls as Police Week. 
   The first official memorial service took place on May 15, 1982, at which 91 law enforcement officers were honored. Over the past 26 years, the memorial service has honored over 3,000 law enforcement officers from around our Nation. 
   Today, the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service on Capitol Hill has become one in a series of well-attended events during Police Week. Activities on Capitol grounds conducted under House Concurrent Resolution 124 will be coordinated with the Office of Architect of the Capitol, will be free and open to the public. I support this resolution and urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Hare, I, too, would like to thank you very much for taking a leadership role in the freshmen class along with Ms. Sutton from Ohio. The freshmen class has done an outstanding job talking about trade issues, and I appreciate your leadership. 
   When I campaigned for office for my seat 5 years ago, the cornerstone of my campaign was fixing our broken trade policy. I firmly believe in order to address our trade imbalance, we have to change the model. It appears that the deal that was cut a few weeks ago by the administration and the leadership does not change that model. It is the same old NAFTA model with a couple of improvements. Americans don't want the same old model with a few Band-Aids. They want a fix. This election reaffirms that Americans are calling for an all-out new trade policy that puts our industry on a competitive playing field. Any deals between Capitol Hill and the Bush administration that fails to change this flawed model means that we are going to continue to see the U.S. trade deficit continue to rise, and it is going to destroy hundreds of thousands of our critical middle-class workers, our manufacturing base here in this country. 
   In Maine, we lost over 23 percent of our manufacturing base alone. The reason I know that, because they qualified for trade adjustment assistance. So trade has affected Maine very deeply. 
   This new deal, there are no unions, environmental groups, consumers, or small business groups support this deal, while all of the big businesses do. Some groups have remained neutral to find out what is actually in the deal. Those who have the most money to gain are praising the deal. Those who represent the working men and women of this country are not. 
   I am not the only Member of Congress who firmly believes that our trade model needs to be changed. There are countless others, especially those who are leading the freshmen class, believe we need a new model. They ran and fought for fair trade. They simply cannot go home and tell their constituents it is the same old model with a few improvements. 
   Adding new labor and environmental provisions is a step towards a new policy, but placing those provisions into a NAFTA-style pact is not going to solve the problem. 
   We also have concerns about those provisions and whether or not they are enforceable. There are those in this town who say it is a good deal because there are loopholes in the labor provisions. But since our membership has not seen the actual text of these agreements, how are we to know whether or not they are enforceable? From what we understand, the deal fails to address many of the damaging elements of the NAFTA model. 
   The deal does nothing to address the FTA's ban on anti-off-shoring or buy American policy. As you heard earlier, the deal does nothing to fix Peru's FTA terms that would allow Citibank or some other U.S. investors providing private retirement accounts to sue Peruvian taxpayers in Peru to reverse its failed social security privatization. 
   Does this deal fail to protect our intellectual property rights? No one knows. 
   But also when you look at trade, and trying to look at the globalization of what is going on around the world, there are other issues we have to address. The fact that there is a $327 billion disadvantage on U.S. goods because of the value-added tax, that has to be looked at. We have to look at the current trade deals that have been negotiated and see how we can bring the $800 billion worth of trade deficit back in line, because if we don't, we are heading on a collision course. 
   We have the largest trade deficit in our history. We have the largest budgetary deficit in our history. The debt limit was increased over $9 trillion with 45 percent owned by foreigners. We have to start addressing this issue. It is a serious issue, and I look forward to working with my colleagues from the freshmen class as well as my colleagues on the Republican side and the leadership to really put forward a trade model that will actually work for not only America, but for other countries as well. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. MICHAUD. I think that remains to be seen. I have been in negotiations before when I worked at Great Northern Paper Company. We put together ideas, but the devil is in the details. 
   I think it is very clear that the American people want a new direction. They want us to look at the rules of trade. We have to give them that direction because we as Democrats, we are in the majority in both the House and the Senate. There is no excuses, no excuses. We have to give this country a new direction as it relates to trade. We have to look at the trade rules, and now is the time to do it. It is not let's pass a couple of them and see how it works out. We have to take a comprehensive view on what we want for a trade policy. The American people, they want that. We are here. They voted the Republicans out. They fired the Republicans. 
   As we heard from our leadership, they haven't hired the Democrats. This is our time to show them that the Democrats can lead this country. We must lead this country, and what better way to show that we can by taking a global look at trade and trade policies and how it affects us here in the United States.

   Mr. MICHAUD. That is a good point. It is not only about the workers and unions; the business community is very upset. Those small businesses, the United States Industry Council, which is an organization which represents small manufacturers all across the country, are very concerned about these trade deals, and we have to make sure that we look at it globally. That is why I think it is important for those of us who have seen it firsthand, not read about it in the paper, but actually seen it firsthand, that we are part of this discussion because it is very important. 
   I have seen my fellow mill workers end up on the unemployment line. They ended up in food lines as well where food banks actually in Maine went dry because there are so many people applying or getting food at food banks because paper mill after paper mill had shut down because of trade.     
   Yes, we did get trade assistance, but that's not what they want. They want their jobs, and that's why it's very important that we do look at the rules of trade, changing the trade model so it's fair. It is, as Ms. Sutton mentioned, the American dream, and we have to bring that dream back once again.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (FAST TRACK TRADE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to talk about trade, Fast Track, and what it's doing to this country. 
   As a former millworker that worked over 28 years at Great Northern Paper Company, I know firsthand that the trade deals are crippling manufacturing in the State of Maine. We have lost over 23 percent of our manufacturing base alone since NAFTA came into effect. 
   But it's more than just losing jobs. You're losing the identity and the community as well. We had certain labor market areas in the State of Maine that had over 33 percent unemployment rate. A lot of small businesses went under because the anchor of the community went under, it filed bankruptcy. The high school, senior class, was not sure whether they would be able to graduate from high school because the mill paid about 80 percent of the tax base. They hadn't paid their taxes, and the accreditation was in jeopardy. Alcoholism, divorce rates, people were filing bankruptcy because of trade. 
   You can go anywhere pretty much in the Second Congressional District in the State of Maine, and you'll see a lot of empty factories that are no longer there. You'll see factories but you will not see the number of vehicles in the mill yard because of machines being shut down. 
   It's because of our failed trade policy. We have to change the trade policy. We have to make sure that when Fast Track is up at the end of this month, that we not renew Fast Track. I think it's incumbent on each Member of Congress to look at these trade deals and have the ability to amend the trade deals. I don't think we should be a rubber stamp to the United States trade representatives, and that's what we are, rubber stamps: Either vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' and that's wrong. 
   I have two colleagues here this evening who have really taken on this trade issue. They know firsthand from their own district what trade means to their constituencies. They know what it's done to the United States of America, as a whole. We have lost over 3 million jobs. We have to do better. We must do better. 
   I think the last election, when a lot of candidates were talking about trade, they are ready, the American people  are ready for a new direction. It's my hope that this Congress will give a new direction, will change that flawed trade policy, the flawed trade model. 
   I would like to recognize Congresswoman Linda T. S&#225;nchez from the west coast of California, who has started the House Trade Working Group that also Congresswoman Betty Sutton has been very active on, and it's an issue that is very important to all of us here in our constituency. 
   I recognize the Congresswoman from California. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Thank you, Congressman Michaud, and I also thank Betty Sutton for being here this evening to talk about the President's Trade Promotion Authority and its effect on working families. Mr. Michaud and I cochair the House working group, and we have been working very hard this year to emphasize the impact that our current failed policy has on average households. 
   We are here because we believe that our trade policies should ensure a fair shake for American working families, not just for those who sit in corporate board rooms. We have already spoken many times in this House about the flaws in the new trade deal recently announced by the administration. This new deal, which applies to the Bush negotiated Free Trade Agreements with Peru and Panama, is an improvement over past FTAs, but it still doesn't give American families much to be excited about, quite honestly. 
   Despite additional labor and environmental provisions, these agreements are based on the NAFTA trade model, the same failed NAFTA model that has hurt the American family for the past decade, the same NAFTA trade model that didn't bring about the jobs or the prosperity that we were promised, the same NAFTA model that didn't stop the immigration flow from Mexico, the same NAFTA model that hasn't been able to assure that our trading partners uphold the strong labor and environmental standards that we do here in the United States, thus putting our workers at a competitive disadvantage. 
   If the long-sought-after labor and environmental protections the administration promises to include in the Peru and Panama FTAs are no stronger than those that we were promised in NAFTA or its cousin CAFTA, they are little more than hollow promises. Yet the Free-Trade-At-All-Costs lobby asks the American people to have faith that the administration has really turned over a new leaf. They are asking us to trust that enforceable labor and environmental standards will be included in the text of the Peru and Panama agreements. But even if these agreements are the best written, fairest trade agreements possible, so long as they rely on this administration to enforce the labor and environmental standards they contain, they are not worth the paper that they are written on. 
   This administration has failed to protect workers here in the U.S. The BP Texas City explosion, the Sago mine disaster and the 9/11 first responders and cleanup workers who have developed serious breathing ailments, these are just the most notorious examples of this administration's lack of dedication to provide even the most basic protection to workers: the right to work in a safe environment. Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says these new worker and environmental protections can't be enforced. 
   Now, if that isn't telling, I don't know what it is. They flatly came out and said they are not enforceable. This President has lost our trust, and with it any argument that he has to renew his trade promotion authority. The administration's track record does not demonstrate a commitment to the working families of America. 
   Free trade was supposed to create economic opportunity for everyone, for big businesses, as well as small businesses, working families at home and abroad, but that, quite frankly, hasn't been the case. The truth of the matter is that the NAFTA free trade model favors the wealthiest at the expense of small businesses, workers, families, and ultimately communities, like the communities Mr. Michaud was talking about that are dependent upon millwork for their life blood. 
   More than a decade after NAFTA and NAFTA-styled replicas, it's clear that the promise of economic prosperity has yet to arrive. Our trade deficit has ballooned into the tens of millions of dollars. Real wages for American families are down, and our manufacturing base is falling apart. 
   We need an administration committed to protecting the rights of workers, and until we get one we cannot grant this administration an extension of Fast Track authority. The American people deserve better. They deserve a commitment to trade that expands their opportunities rather than diminishes them. 
   I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help our working families get back on track to economic prosperity. 
   I urge them to oppose the Fast Track renewal, and I want to thank, again, my two colleagues for their leadership on this issue, because they have been trying to carry this message to those who have been unwilling to hear it.

You're absolutely right when you talk about Fast Track, and we'll get into that a little bit more, because I know Congresswoman S&#225;nchez has to go to another meeting, and I know she's been to Colombia a couple of times, so I'll be interested in hearing what she has to say about her trips to Colombia. 
   But before she does, before I yield time, I'd actually like to give a quote. And it's not very often I quote Pat Buchanan. But I saw this quote and I thought it was worth quoting. It says, ``The trade deficit is a malignant tumor in the intestines of the U.S. economy.'' That's absolutely right. We have to start dealing with our trade deficit. And one way, one of the issues we have got to deal with is, as you mentioned Congresswoman Sutton, is not to renew Fast Track, which is extremely important. Let Congress do our job that we're elected to do, representing our constituents. 
   I did have a chance to actually meet the President of Colombia a couple of weeks ago. I had an interesting conversation and asked several questions about the brutality and the murders that are happening in Colombia with trade unionists, and I'm looking forward to his response to some of the questions that I have. 
   But right now, I'd like to yield to the Congresswoman from California, who actually had a couple of trips over to Colombia. If you'd kindly let us know what happened and what we can do. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Sure. About 2 weeks ago I returned from Colombia, and it was my second visit in just 7 months. Colombia is one of the countries that President Bush negotiated a free trade agreement with without really seeking the advice of those Members of Congress who have been vocal opponents to the NAFTA trade model which he based this agreement on. 
   And I have to say at the outset, Colombia is a beautiful country. It's people are a warm people. We were well received there. And so I want to be very clear that I am for expanding trade with countries around the world, but in a way that is fair and balanced to both our workers here in the United States and also the workers in the countries that we seek to engage in trade with. 
   Just for the record, Colombia has a horrible record on human rights and labor rights violations. In Colombia, more trade labor unionists were killed there last year than in all the countries of the world combined. So it has an abysmal record with respect to violence towards people who try to organize workers to help lift them out of poverty. And nobody really wants to talk about that dirty little secret of Colombia's, because they want to talk about how much better things are in the first 6 months of this year. 
   The statistics do show that there is an improvement. I will grant them that, and I applaud that. But it still means that about 99 percent of the murders that happened last year have gone unsolved, and nobody has been brought to justice for that. 
   And the reason why trade labor unionists are targeted is because they speak out on behalf of people who are living in poverty, who are earning wages that don't allow them to support themselves or a family. They're working in dangerous working conditions. 
   And I have to say, on the trip that I just most recently returned from, we really weren't given a lot of time to go and actually talk to the workers themselves about their experience. We were basically told by the government that things are getting better and things were improving. 
   Interestingly enough, the first trip that I took to Colombia last November, I met with labor organizations, civil rights groups and advocates, and I met with the workers themselves who told me, ``don't be fooled by the rosy picture that our government has painted. It's very dangerous here in Colombia to speak up if you are working in dangerous working conditions. It's very dangerous in Colombia to speak up if you'd like to see your wages rise so that you can support yourself.'' 
   And, in fact, there is a very big informal labor sector in Colombia which isn't even subject to basic standards like a minimum wage. There's no minimum wage for these folks. There are no contributions made on behalf of them for the hours that they work into any kind of Social Security or pension system. And there are no workplace safety standards. A lot of these workers work in some of the biggest industries that they're pushing the free trade agreement because they say that they need to expand these industries, one of which being the textile industry, which is notorious for their workers that are part of the informal sector that don't have contracts, that don't have any basic rights. 
   And basically, in Colombia, when I bring up the point that there's this promise made to lift all these people out of poverty, but when they have to compete against U.S. goods, some of which will be subsidized, like many of our agricultural products, who is going to suffer the most? Who's going to bear the cost? Because they tell me, oh, yes, there are some transitional costs associated with moving towards this new free trade agreement, but they're transitional costs; they won't be forever, and not everybody's going to be affected. 
   But let me tell you who will be affected by those transitional costs: rural, poor, indigenous people and largely women who are heads of households. They are the ones that will suffer the most, not to mention American workers who will have to compete in industry with Colombia, where they have no minimum wage, no minimum work day, so they can work workers 16 hours a day if they want, and no safe working conditions. 
   And there's just, quite frankly, no way that American workers, who demand a certain level of respect and dignity at the workplace, are going to be able to compete in industries where those are the conditions that Colombian workers are working in. 
   Knowing all of this, did President Bush negotiate with Colombia a free trade agreement that would try to address those very basic labor standards? No. He based the Colombian free trade on the NAFTA model. They didn't even put in basic rights that are respected around the world as international standards for human and labor rights. He just said, hey, the marketplace is going to take care of it. We're going to move forward. This is the trade agreement, and Congress, because of Fast Track authority, you can't change it; you can't make it better; you can't amend it. It's either yes or no; you vote in favor of this. And if that's the choice that I'm given, my vote is no because it doesn't even try to address the problem with the labor standards and the violence in Colombia. 
   I say, hey, I'm willing to give Colombia the benefit of the doubt. If you can  show to me over a certain length of time, minimum of 2 years, that, yeah, you've gone after these people that have targeted labor unionists, and yeah, you've moved people out of the informal sector into the formal sector where people have basic standards, I'm willing to give Colombia an opportunity. But I'm not willing to enter into a trade agreement with them based on empty promises of how much better things are going to be. 
   All we heard when we were there, 90 percent of what we heard was how much better Colombia was at human rights and how much better they were at trying to find those responsible for killing trade labor unionists. But while we were there, one of the biggest scandals that has hit Colombia in recent months is the scandal of paramilitary groups that are linked to elected members of their congress, elected governors, some of whom were hand picked, and cabinet members, some of whom were handpicked by President Uribe himself. And these paramilitary groups have been responsible for killing people, for massacres of villages of people. And currently, 14 elected officials sit in jail because they've been tied to these paramilitary groups. And there are as many as two dozen more that are under investigation. 
   But we're supposed to trust President Uribe that they're going to bring these people to justice and that labor rights and human rights are going to be better in Colombia. I say, show me, and then we'll sit down and negotiate. But I thought it might be interesting to just inform you guys a little bit about what the flavor of that trip was. 
   And like I said, I think the Colombian people are wonderful people. I think we need to open up new markets. But we need to do it in a way that's fair and balanced for our workers here, so we don't continue to hemorrhage manufacturing jobs, and for the workers in these countries, which corporations will exploit. 
   And with that, I will yield back to Mr. Michaud.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much, Congresswoman S&#225;nchez. You're absolutely right, and that's one of the problems with Fast Track and why this Congress should not renew Fast Track. Even if we did have a say in these trade deals, as you mentioned, particularly with Colombia, I'm not sure that even if we had the ILO standards in the agreement that that would help as far as the murders and the assassinations that are going on in Colombia. I've met with several elected officials on different occasions from Colombia, and they're scared for their lives. There's one senator that actually sleeps no more than two nights in a row in the same bed because he's been threatened with his life. 
   And we've been told, or I've been told in those meetings that they want to set an example, the paramilitary, and they force some of the other labor folks to go out there with actually, they told me that they actually beheaded a trade unionist. And that's wrong. So no matter what we do on trade deals, like you, Congresswoman, I want to see results before I agree with any trade deal with Colombia at all. We have to get back 
   to changing that model. 
   I'm very pleased actually to see another colleague from the great State of Ohio who has taken a great leadership role since he's been here on trade but also has introduced major legislation that will help deal with one of the components when you look at the flawed trade model. And he's also a member of the 30-plus caucus now, I guess, something caucus, congressman Tim Ryan.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Thank you very much. That is a very good point that you mentioned because the very mill that I worked at, we had six paper machines. Four are no longer there. They were unbolted and shipped overseas. So that is absolutely right. People might not think they are going to unpack the machinery and move them overseas. It has happened. I have seen it happen, and it will continue to happen unless we change the flawed trade model that we have been operating. And part of that component that is absolutely right is the currency manipulation with China that we have to address. 
   And as Mr. Ryan had mentioned, we have Mr. Ellison here, who is also another freshman Member of the freshman class who is very interested in the trade issue. So I yield to Mr. Ellison.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (FAST TRACK TRADE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ellison brought up a very good point. There has been a lot of discussion over the past month about immigration, particularly in the Senate. We will be having our discussions here in the House. And that is part of the component when you look at trade. It is not a simple issue. And Mr. Ellison hit the nail right on head. If you look at immigration, what is happening, they are coming across the border because they want a job. They want a good job so they can provide for their family like any one of us would be doing for our family, provide for our family. 
   I was reading an article, actually, ``Since NAFTA, Winners and Losers.'' I will just read a part of this article. It says: ``As a bonus,'' talking about NAFTA, ``the predicted increase in jobs and prosperity in Mexico under NAFTA was expected to reduce illegal immigration. In 1994, when NAFTA was put into effect, then-Attorney General Janet Reno predicted that illegal immigration would fall by two-thirds within 6 years.'' 
   And I want to quote the former Attorney General Janet Reno: ``NAFTA is our best hope for reducing illegal immigration in the long haul. If it fails, effective immigration control will become impossible.'' 
   I want to repeat that again. This is the former Attorney General Janet Reno: ``NAFTA is our best hope for reducing illegal immigration in the long haul. If it fails, effective immigration control will become impossible.'' 
   And that is absolutely right. We have seen what is happening since NAFTA. The same flawed model is in existence. It is going to take a real active role of the freshmen class and Members of this Congress on both sides of the aisle who really want to make a difference. A new direction, that is what we need, a new direction. 
   We need a new trade model. Part of that trade model will go to what Congressman Ryan had mentioned when you look at the China currency manipulation, when you look at the value-added taxes, legislation that has just been introduced, bipartisan legislation dealing with a value-added tax that we have to look at that accounts for a big portion of our trade deficit. In the United States, 94 percent of all U.S. exports and imports with trade deal with countries that have a value-added tax. That is hurting this country. 
   And for those of you who do not know what the value-added tax is, actually, for the countries who export their products to the United States, they actually have been rebating those companies the value-added tax to a tune of $217 billion in 2006. Plus if the United States wants to export their product over there, they are actually taxed to a tune of $110 billion. This has to change. This has to change. 
   And when you talk about Fast Track, actually during the several discussions about reauthorizing Fast Track in 1974, 1988, and 2002, Congress actually encouraged the USTR to change the value-added tax so we can be put on a level playing field. We have got to change the rules. This is one of the components that we can deal with in changing that rule. 
   I yield to Congresswoman Sutton.

Actually, I would like to follow up, Mr. Ellison, if I might, because I have in front of me, actually, testimony of the Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, Ms. Moore, who attended our hearing in the Small Business Committee on June 13. And I will paraphrase. It says, ``Our work aims to increase exports by expanding market access for American goods, creating a level playing field.'' She also mentions, and it gets right to your point, ``In addition, we enforce agreements and resolve trade problems using a wide variety of tools.'' That is clearly not what's happening.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Well, if you are tickling them with a feather, it's probably a feather made in China. 
   And I can tell you, the Trade Working Group has worked very closely with a variety of different groups, environmental groups, religious organizations, labor, business organizations, the United States Business and Industry Council, associations, small manufacturing businesses here in this country. And the United States Business and Industry Council has told me directly that the United States Trade Representative has turned away businesses when they've brought complaints to the USTR primarily because the dollar amount wasn't enough. And I can tell you personally that, as you know, I worked at the Great Northern Paper Company for a number of years, and when the company I worked for, when I was talking to the public relations before they filed bankruptcy, they actually went to the Department of Commerce and talked about trade and what it's doing, and the response that they got: Yup, you've got a great argument, but go spend over a million dollars and come back to us later on. Well, we couldn't hold on. They filed bankruptcy. They closed the doors at the time, and it is devastating. So they are not enforcing those agreements, and we continue to see a huge disparity in our trade policy.

   If you look at this Congress, particularly with the freshman class that we currently have who has been out there, very aggressively, talking about a new direction, we do need a new direction; we have to pause with all these trade deals that are currently going on. Even the former President, Bill Clinton, said we ought to pause on these trade deals to see what's happening.

   Mr. MICHAUD. That's true. He's the one that brought us NAFTA. But these issues aren't Democratic issues or Republican issues. These are issues that are important to the United States, important to our long-term future, and we have to look at changing that model. And it can be done in a bipartisan manner. Congressman Tim Ryan, who was on the floor, is sponsoring legislation with a Republican Member of this body, Duncan Hunter, on the currency manipulation. I am glad to see that a Presidential candidate is out there talking about trade, along with Dennis Kucinich, who is also talking about trade. We have the value-added tax, which is another piece of legislation which has strong bipartisan support, once again, Congressman Duncan Hunter, Congressman Walter Jones, myself and Congressman Bill Pascrell. 
   So these issues are not Democratic issues or Republican issues. These issues are American issues. And we definitely have to be more aggressive. We have to change that trade model. And we have to sit down and pause, and sit down in a bipartisan manner, no backroom deals. We've seen what these backroom deals have done in the past, and they don't work. We have to work open so the public can see what is going on and the real effect that we currently are seeing with trade deals.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, today I strongly support the prescription drug bill that will be coming up today for a vote. I commend the leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor as a central part of the first 100 hours. 
   When the Medicare drug bill was being assembled, the pharmaceutical lobby convinced its authors to write rules into the bill that would forbid ever negotiating for lower-cost prescription drugs. These drug companies  charged American consumers far more than anyone else in the world. 
   This bill today would allow the Secretary to negotiate for lower-cost prescription drugs. This is a commonsense solution that could have enormous cost savings for seniors and the government. The VA Administration already does this effectively; so does every other industrialized country in the world. 
   My own State of Maine has led the way in implementing this approach at the State level. I have introduced my America Rx bill based on Maine's approach in the past Congresses. I am so pleased that this bill today does that same thing, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   I think, all too often, once people get here in Washington, D.C., they tend to forget what is really happening in reality. And reality is, we have lost over 3 million jobs nationwide because of our unfair trade deals, and we have got to bring equity back in that. So I really appreciate your leadership in that role and look forward to working with you as we move forward to make sure that we do have fair trade deals here in this Congress.

And I think what a lot of people don't realize is the fact that fast track only allows Congress two options, to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' We have no options to amend this trade deal. We just have to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' And we are abdicating our responsibilities by allowing fast track to occur, which hopefully, with a new Congress and a new direction, when we look at trade deals, we will be able to change fast track so that we can have an opportunity to make sure that we do have fair trade deals.

I am opposed to it now, especially when you see what damage fast track has caused to this Nation, what it has caused to our manufacturing. Maine alone, over the last 6 years or so, we lost 23 percent of our manufacturing base alone in the State of Maine. Certain labor market areas had unemployment rates over 30 percent.

   Mr. MICHAUD. You are absolutely right. As a matter of fact, when you look at what is happening, a lot of municipalities, their primary business has been hit because of unfair trade deals. It has that rippling effect to other businesses within the community, but also the family structure. When you look at the fact that when Mills filed bankruptcy, and I have seen it in my own town, the divorce rate actually goes up. The alcoholism goes up, and you are losing that structure, and that is why we have to make sure that we do have fair trade deals. 
   As we heard earlier today from Congressman Hare, he is not against trade deals. He just wants to make sure that they are fair trade deals. And that is  what we have to do as a Congress is to make sure that we do have fair trade deals. 
   I am very pleased to see that a lot of Members, new Members of Congress who have just come off the campaign trail, when they were campaigning, they were talking to their constituents, and they heard a lot about loss of manufacturing here in this country because of the trade deals.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady. You are absolutely right, it is these flawed models that continue to come up after the NAFTA model and all these other trade deals. Until you change that flawed model, we are still going to get these bad trade deals continuing. 
   You mentioned the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. I don't think there is any fix for this agreement. I think it is highly offensive that the Bush administration would even negotiate with a country that is infamous for the highest rate of trade unionist assassinations. More than 2,000 labor union activists have been murdered in Colombia since 1990; 60 assassinated in 2006 alone. I think that is just unconscionable. 
   I agree with Congressman Sandy Levin when he says that we have to look at these flawed models that are out there. These side agreements that people are talking about, they are not going to work. They don't have the force of law. 
   I think we definitely have a long ways to go before we have trade deals that I can support. And with the freshman class we currently have under your great, fantastic leadership, I applaud them, and encourage that each and every one of you continue to speak out on this issue, because it is an issue that is important to the American people, it is an issue that is important to our businesses, workers in this country, but it is also an issue that is very important when you look at our security and immigration. 
   When we heard the NAFTA discussion, when they passed NAFTA, we were encouraged; I was not here, but Members were encouraged to vote for it because it would help with the illegal immigration problem with Mexico. The problem has not been solved. It has gotten worse because the NAFTA agreement has not worked the way it was supposed to work. 
   So I look forward to working with you and the rest of the freshman class, along with other colleagues who are interested in this trade deal. 
   Speaking about other colleagues, another gentlelady from Ohio as well, Congresswoman Kaptur, who has also been a strong leader in the trade debate over the past 5 years that I have been here, and she has been a tremendous advocate for making sure that we have fair trade deals, I see she has some charts up there with a lot of red  ink. I assume that is probably the trade deficit that she is going to talk about. 
   I yield to the gentlelady.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, we are headed on a collision course. If you look at our budgetary deficit, we have the largest budgetary deficit in our history. The debt limit was increased to $9 trillion. We have the largest trade deficit in our history, which continues to rise because of these unfair trade deals. And if Congress does not get a handle on both the budgetary deficit and our trade deficit, we will no longer be the superpower that we are today. 
   When you look at our budgetary deficit, over 45 percent of that is owned by foreigners, China being one of them. If you look at our trade deficit with China, we saw charts earlier where it is skyrocketing. 
   When I hear my colleagues talk about the fact that we are going to put trade assistance funding in there so that we can retrain workers, they don't want trade adjustment assistance. They want their jobs. That is very important for them.

   Mr. MICHAUD. Absolutely. Congresswoman Sutton mentioned earlier the fact this is not just a workers' issue; it is a business issue. The United States Business and Industry Council has been very supportive, very helpful with the Kaptur trade deal. They are going to be very helpful I think when you look at fast track and other areas. So this isn't  just working people issues; it is business issues. A lot of people try to put workers against business. It is not that issue at all. It is these unfair trade deals. 
   I would like to ask Congresswoman Sutton a question, if I might. How would you address this issue: We hear all kinds of times the issue, you are a protectionist. What is your response to that?

   Mr. MICHAUD. That is very good. I know we are running out of time. I do want to thank you, Congresswoman Sutton and Congresswoman Kaptur, for your leadership in this role, and I really appreciate the hard work that everyone is doing on this issue, especially our freshman class. 
   As Ms. Kaptur had mentioned, the freshman class has really come forward and really taken on this issue, taken an interest in this issue, I think primarily because you just came off the campaign trail. You heard what people were talking about out there. It is important for Members who have been here for a while to listen to you as freshman Members because you definitely have a lot to talk about when it comes to this trade issue. 
   We have seen it firsthand. As I mentioned earlier, I worked at the mill for over 28 years, and I have seen firsthand what NAFTA has done to my town, my community, to individuals who worked in the mill. 
   So I want to thank each and every one of you for taking an interest in this very important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of this resolution that expresses our unwavering support of our troops and our opposition to the escalation in Iraq. This is an extremely important debate and it is one that is long overdue. 
   We have lost over 3,100 brave Americans. Many more will return home with mental health and physical wounds that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. 
   We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have lost their lives or fled their homes as their country has fallen into deeper civil war.  
   Regardless of one's opinion on how we got into Iraq, we are there, and the situation is deteriorating. So the simple question before us is, What is the best plan for the future? 
   The President has called for an escalation of troops; in other words, more of the same approach. 
   I oppose an escalation of U.S. troops in Iraq. I will not support funding for the President's plan or blank checks for an open-ended commitment.     
   We need a new plan, and escalation is not what the Iraq Study Group called for. It is not what our top generals have advised, and it is not what the American or Iraqi people want. When General John Abizaid, former top commander in Iraq, asked his commanders in the field if more U.S. troops would help, the unanimous answer was no. As he said: ``And the reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own future.'' 
   U.S. forces cannot clear and hold neighborhoods in Baghdad indefinitely. We have tried so-called ``surges'' before, and they have not stopped the violence. And as with these previous surges, when we leave, the same problems will return, and perhaps even worse. 
   The reality is that United States military strength cannot solve the problems in Iraq nor should it. The future rests on the capability and the will of the Iraqi people. Our continued dominance only prevents Iraqis from taking control of their country and their destiny. The military mission of toppling Saddam Hussein is over. The political mission, the reconstruction mission, the nation-building that this administration said it would never do has all but failed. 
   But that is what we must now address, not our strength of arms but our strength of diplomacy and our power to rebuild. 
   Our new strategy should be to withdraw and redeploy our soldiers quickly while empowering the Iraqi security forces. We can help to rebuild and create economic opportunity, to train Iraqis and perform other assistance as asked, but we cannot remain the dominant force in Iraq. 
   It is time for Iraqis to take control of their own country. A stabilized, secure and free Iraq can only be achieved when Iraqis take full control. Until that time our forces will be stuck in the middle of an increasingly violent civil war and all the while Afghanistan sliding back into danger and violence and al Qaeda continues to plot while our attention is being diverted. 
   I have spoken with many people in Maine about this war. I have spoken with current military personnel, many who have served in Iraq, their families, veterans, and concerned citizens of all political stripes. Everyone agrees there is no simple solution to the challenges we face in Iraq and how to solve it. 
   There is one opinion that is unanimous. We all support our men and women in uniform. They, like the generations before them, are heroes. They heard their country's call and they did not hesitate to answer. I am glad this resolution makes that support clear. We owe it to our military personnel to provide them with the very best when they are in harm's way and when they come home. 
   I have heard from many Vietnam-era veterans who fear that our new veterans may face many of the hardships that they faced. This cannot happen. As a member of the Veterans Affairs' Committee, I am committed to addressing the mental health and physical needs of our returning heroes, and I know the American people are willing to do that as well. And as we discuss alternative strategies, it must be clear that we must do something that fully supports our military personnel. 
   This resolution is not about politics. This issue should unite all of us. This is about the future of Iraq, our strategy abroad, and our welfare for our troops.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING EFFORTS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT AND HELP END THE WORSENING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AND GENOCIDE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about a human tragedy that affects the lives of millions of innocent individuals. The barbarism in the Darfur region of Sudan continues despite international calls for a cessation of violence. Lives continue to be lost and hope for peace remains distant. 
   On July 4 of 2004, the 109th Congress declared that genocide was occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan. Over 3 years later, the violence continues. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives. An estimated 2.2 million people have been forced from their homes. 
   Today the House will consider three resolutions related to Darfur. It is my hope that this body will continue to focus on this humanitarian crisis until the genocide comes to an end. H. Res. 573 recognizes and commends the efforts of the United States public and advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening humanitarian crisis and genocide in Darfur. The responsibility to help end this humanitarian crisis is part of the values that make us American. It is in the best spirit of our country, and it is part of the leadership that we should bring to the world. We must continue to work together as one to bring this conflict to an end. 
   The second resolution, H. Res. 756, condemns rape and sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. The violence and inhuman experiences perpetrated upon the people of Darfur and the surrounding region have been particularly terrible for women. This resolution urges the President to take an active role in providing victims of sexual abuse with medical and legal support. It also calls on fellow members of the United Nations to sanction the Sudan for any non-compliance to bring known perpetrators to justice. We cannot be silent while innocent women and girls suffer such cruelty. 
   The final resolution, H. Res. 740, condemns the attacks made on African Union Peacekeepers in the Darfurian village of Haskanita on September 29, 2007. This violent act took the lives of 10 peacekeepers--7 Nigerians and 3 other soldiers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana. These attacks are unacceptable and detrimental to the peace effort but should not deter the conviction of the African Union or the international community to bring peace and security to the region. 
   The displacement of millions of people as well as the rape and murder of hundreds of thousands cannot be tolerated by the United States or any country that holds freedom and democracy as sacred values. The ongoing events in Darfur constitute the worst ongoing humanitarian disaster in the world. We must do everything we can to bring it to an end.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (THE PERU TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. I thank Madam Speaker. This weekend, Senator John Edwards announced his opposition to the Peru Trade Agreement. The reason? As his statement says, ``All of these agreements replicate the terrible features of NAFTA.'' Senator Edwards is right. It is more of the same old, same old. A leading Presidential candidate is saying it. The American people are sick of it. And so why is Congress pushing for it? Why would we push for a steady stream of lost jobs that gives incentives to multinational  corporations to move overseas? Why would we agree to an agreement that would displace peasant farmers who would be forced to migrate to the United States? 
   The American public aren't fooled. Campaign finance reform hasn't stopped the incredible financial influence of multinational corporations. These corporations are weighing in with the candidates, even Citibank. Take, for example, the provisions hidden in the Peru FTA. As Senator Edwards points out, ``Buried deep in the 800-page text of the Peru FTA are ambiguous provisions that could allow U.S. banks to demand compensation if Peru reverses its disastrous social security privatization.'' 
   The Peru FTA contains provisions that could allow Citibank to demand compensation in FTA foreign investor protection tribunals from the Peruvian Government if Peru seeks to reverse its failed social security privatization. The Peruvian archbishop and both labor federation presidents asked the Ways and Means leaders to fix this problem. And it hasn't been fixed. 
   The House floor will be voting on this in a couple of weeks. As a Democratic Party, we have stood united against privatization of Social Security. We have not backed down. That is why it shocks me to hear that Senator Obama supports the Peru FTA. Yes, Senator Obama does support the Peru FTA. 
   Senator Edwards has it right. It is time to stick up for the American workers. It is time to reject the same NAFTA model that has devastated our industry. It is time to listen to the broad list of groups who do not support the Peru FTA. Not one union, environmental, consumer, small business, faith, family farm group supports the modified Bush Peru NAFTA Expansion FTA. So why would any Presidential candidate? 
   It is important to hear what the candidates are saying about protecting our jobs and fighting for fair trade deals. It is important that we stick together in this fight to keep our jobs here at home. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Peru FTA.

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 represents a vision for economic development in our Nation that will help Americans in the most distressed region of our country. 
   In the northern border region, we have seen a clear, persistent pattern of economic distress. If you look at the 36 counties that lie on the border right next to the border between Maine and New York, you will find poverty above the national level average, median household income that is more than $6,500 below the national average. You'll see a persistent unemployment through layoffs and traditional manufacturing industry, and most striking of all, a meager gain in only 0.6 percent of the population between 1990 and 2000, compared to a 13 percent growth nationally over the same period. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, our mills are closing, our young people are leaving and too many of our workers are looking for work. Clearly, this region has a common set of challenges and a compelling need for investment and new growth. 
   As a mill worker for over 28 years at Great Northern Paper Company, I understand the particular challenges in the border regions of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. Like my father and grandfather before me, I left high school and went straight to work in the paper mill in my hometown. After 28 years, and 2 days after I was sworn into Congress, the mill that I worked at went bankrupt, and my hometown was devastated. Unemployment rose to over 33 percent. 
   The story of my hometown and the mills where I worked has been repeated throughout the State of Maine and our region. That is why we need to support this region economic development bill. We have to support our regional industries and build on new job opportunities, and that is why we need to invest in leadership and focus in our regional economic development that the Northern Border Commission would bring. 
   The Northern Border Commission would help the region invest in transportation, health care, agriculture, broadband and alternative energy. It can be a partner with businesses to maintain our industries and build new industry clusters. It can help us create jobs for the long term. 
   We have all the ingredients that we need to face our challenges head on and make our region an economic engine. This new commission would help us make a fundamental change in our future. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working in a bipartisan manner on this bill. I'd like to thank the Chair of the full committee, Chairman Oberstar, and the Chair of the subcommittee, Ms. Norton, for their efforts as well, and also the former Chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Shuster, for all his hard work on the regional commission bills, as well as Congressman Hodes from New Hampshire who has been a true leader in this particular area as well. 
   This bill represents a new way forward for economic development in our Nation for the places and the people that need it most. Let's pass this bill and give our people the hope and the future that they deserve

<DOCNO>Mr. MICHAUD. (OPPOSE PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, on the eve of the Ways and Means Committee markup on the Peru free trade agreement, I rise tonight in strong opposition to the Peru free trade agreement. 
   I am extremely disappointed there will be no formal committee hearing on the Peru free trade agreement. The last hearing for the Peru free trade agreement in the Ways and Means Committee was held in 2006. 
   Given that the administration and leadership announced proposed changes to the trade model in May, I believe it is critical to have a full hearing on the Peru trade agreement. The diversity of viewpoints on the Peru FTA have not been significantly heard by Members. Many of the newly elected freshmen Members campaigned on a platform of ensuring a significant change of course from the Bush trade policy. 
   The Peru free trade agreement is based on the same flawed NAFTA and CAFTA model that has been so devastating to industries across the Nation. 
   When I campaigned for my seat 5 years ago, the cornerstone of my campaign was fixing our broken trade policies. I have seen firsthand what they have done to the State of Maine. I firmly believe in order to address our trade imbalance, we have to change the trade model. The Peru FTA is the same old model with a little lipstick. 
   There is overwhelming opposition to the agreement by unions, consumers, small business, and environmental groups. They are all asking Congress to oppose the Peru FTA. 
   Who supports this deal? Big Business does. When Tom Donahue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, states that he is ``encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance with ILO conventions,'' we should be very skeptical. 
   While we have all heard that the Peru agreement text improves labor and environmental standards, we fail to hear that they are added upon the old NAFTA and CAFTA text. The bottom line: this is another Bush NAFTA expansion. 
   Key unions are worried about the labor provisions. The new provisions require countries to adopt, maintain, and enforce only the terms of the ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. The new FTA language does not require signatories to meet the ILO conventions. These are the binding standards; the declarations are nonbinding. It is highly likely that changes in the environment and labor provisions will have no real effect on the ground. 
   We all know that the Bush administration has a long record of not enforcing the standards of past trade deals.  Why would they start now? There are so many problems with the Peru FTA, whether it is the privatization of Social Security, ban on anti-offshoring, or failure to protect our intellectual property rights, there are more than enough reasons to oppose the Peru FTA. 
   I could go on, but I do not have the time. I ask my colleagues to really listen to what America is saying about these trade deals. I am asking Members to vote their conscience to oppose the Peru free trade agreement.
