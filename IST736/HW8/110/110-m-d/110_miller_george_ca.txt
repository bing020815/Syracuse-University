<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, the economy needs our help right now. And it will need our help in the long-term as well. 
   The American people don't need expert economic forecasts to tell them that our country and our economy are seriously off track. They experience it every day--when their paychecks shrink, when foreclosure signs go up in their neighborhoods or even on their own home, and when friends and family members receive pink slips. 
   It's clear that the economy needs help. The bill before us today, the Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act, offers an urgently-needed first step to boost the economy and help save jobs. 
   The economy may be complicated, but the reasoning behind this bi-partisan bill is not. By putting money into the hands of low- and middle-income families who will spend it quickly, we will inject demand back into the economy. While we can't know for sure what the future holds for our economy, we know that we can make a difference if we pass this stimulus package quickly. 
   I am very pleased that this package includes unprecedented tax relief for 35 million American families who work hard every day but earn too little to pay income taxes. Past economic relief packages, including the one developed to respond to the 2001 recession, did not benefit these families. But these families must be included to really help boost the economy. This represents a very significant change in policy thanks to pressure from Speaker Pelosi and Democrats in Congress and I applaud the Speaker for working so hard to ensure that these families and workers were included in our package. 
   Under this bill, a married couple with two children and an annual income of $33,000 will see a rebate of $1,450. A single parent with an annual income of $20,000 and two children will see a rebate of $1,035. This financial assistance will provide substantial relief to families struggling with the rising costs of energy, food, transportation, and other basics. 
   Another important feature of our stimulus plan is the help it provides to homeowners seeking to avoid foreclosure. The bill increases loan limits for single-family houses from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from $417,000 to $729,750 for 2008. 
   This increased loan limit will enable qualified homeowners with larger mortgages to refinance their mortgages, lower their monthly payments, and avoid foreclosure. 
   In Contra Costa County, CA, where I live and which I am proud to represent in Congress, the median home price in 2006 was  more than $640,000. In Solano County, which I also am proud to represent in Congress, the price was nearly $490,000. Both prices are well above the current $417,000 limit. So, the change our bill makes will provide critical help to untold numbers of families in my district and around the country who are struggling to hold onto their homes. 
   Indeed, foreclosures in California skyrocketed in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 421 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. This is an economic crisis that we must address, and our bill takes a strong first step in that direction. 
   We have a responsibility to do everything we can to limit the economic trouble that our country is now facing. We have this responsibility to American workers who could lose their jobs and to families that could lose their financial security. 
   We also know that passing this legislation is only a first step. That's because our economy faced fundamental problems well before the housing bubble began to burst and the turmoil started in the credit markets. 
   Indeed, ever since the end of the last recession in November 2001, the economy has been growing. But the benefits of that growth went mostly to corporate profits--not to workers' paychecks. 
   Indeed, despite that economic growth, median family income last year was actually lower than it was before the 2001 recession. Since 2001, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased. So has the number of Americans without health insurance. 
   These are long-term challenges that we must continue to address after we pass this short-term stimulus package. We have an obligation not just to get the economy on the right track again, but also to create a stronger economy that truly benefits all Americans for years and years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representatives Hodes for introducing H.R. 2851, also known as Michelle's Law, and for his hard work in bringing the legislation to the House floor today. 
   H.R. 2851 is named in honor of Michelle Morse who was diagnosed with cancer while she was attending college at Plymouth State University. 
   While Michelle was facing one of the most difficult times in her life and desperately needed time off to deal with her diagnosis and receive treatment, her health insurer informed her that it would not cover her for chemotherapy treatments unless she continued in school full-time. 
   As a result, Michelle had to keep up with her course work at the same time as she was receiving 48 hours of chemotherapy a week. She died in November 2005. 
   Michelle's law declares that no college student should have as difficult a road as Michelle. Students should have the ability to focus on treatment and recovery before returning to school. 
   H.R. 2851 amends ERISA, the Public Health Service Act and the Internal Revenue Code to require employers and health insurance companies to continue covering college students for up to 12 months if, as the result of an illness or injury, they need to take time off from school to receive treatment and to recover. The rights provided under the bill are in addition to those already provided under ERISA, COBRA and HIPAA. The bill also preserves stronger state laws. 
   In fact many States are ahead of Congress on this issue and have already enacted laws that mandate insurers to cover children over 18 under a family plan regardless of the child's school status. Nine States have laws similar to H.R. 2851 and require health plans to continue insuring students who withdraw from school or change their status due to an illness or injury. 
   However, the state laws do not cover employer sponsored health plans regulated by ERISA which is one of the critical reasons H.R. 2851 is needed. 
   Receiving a cancer diagnosis or suffering a serious injury can be devastating. We must ensure that students who are seriously ill or injured do not have to choose between their health and their health insurance. 
   H.R. 2851 is a common sense bill that will benefit many young people facing adversity. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2851.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, for too long this Nation has been held hostage and has been dependent upon Middle East oil. For too long this Nation has been held hostage and been dependent on the automakers of this country in terms of determining whether kind of transportation we will have in the United States. 
   Today, just an hour or an hour and a half ago, this House voted overwhelmingly and on a bipartisan basis to break that dependency and to become free again, to become free of Middle East oil, to become free of the automakers who have prevented us from having more efficient automobiles, getting better miles per gallon, and greener, to save our environment. 
   By that vote, this House spoke for the independence of this country. By that vote, this House spoke for the American people who have been demanding from us now for many years to have automobiles that were more efficient, less polluting, that serve their needs. For many years, they have told us that they have been worried about our national security, about our foreign policy, when we are driven to decisions based upon the dependency of Middle East oil, based upon the dependency of foreign oil, based on the dependency of not having our own energy house in order so we can make those decisions. 
   When they have seen time and again American lives and treasure lost to secure sources of oil, they have asked for a new direction. They have asked for a new day in American energy policy. Just a couple of hours ago, the House of Representatives delivered to the American people that new energy policy and that new direction. It's a policy that is based in the future, it a policy that is based in American ingenuity, talent and skills. It's a policy that is based in innovation and discovery, the things that America has been great at since this country was founded, that real talent and the strengths of this Nation being pulled together for the new technologies of wind energy, of biotech energy, of ethanol, and the other alternative fuels that are available, to the alternative sources of electricity, whether it's wave energy, solar energy. That is what America does best. We have wasted 8 years while we have refused to embrace the future. 
   This bill over the next few years will generate 3 million jobs in every geographic sector of this Nation as utilities seek out alternative energy sources for the generation of electricity. That means the people will be going to work in solar facilities, people will be going to work in wind facilities, people will be going to work in biofuel facilities, in ethanol facilities, in all kind of new technologies, new production, new manufacturing, the next generation of manufacturing, the next generation of innovation. 
   When we were working on our Innovation Agenda, which this Congress passed a couple of months ago and was sent to the President, passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote, signed by the President of the United States, when we were working on that Innovation Agenda with the leaders in biotech, in high-tech, in the venture capital community, people who are betting real money on the future of this country, they told us to give them a new energy policy that would drive a next generation of technology in the computer industry, in the telecommunications industry, in the biotech industry; that would drive the next generation of investment in energy and in the future of this country; that would drive the next generation of discovery and innovation. 
   Today, the House of Representatives delivered that energy policy to the American companies so they can go to work in discovery and innovation and creating jobs here in America in the new industries surrounding the new energy future and the new energy policy. 
   I am very, very proud this day to be a Member of the House of Representatives, casting this vote for a new energy future for America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this legislation. I want to thank the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and the skill and experience and the knowledge of Congressman John Dingell for all of this help on this legislation. 
   This is a remarkable day for the United States House of Representatives and, hopefully, for the people of this country as we break the chokehold of those Middle Eastern countries that have us tied to them because of oil. 
   The energy independence that we talk about in this legislation is the ability, through the savings, through fuel-efficient automobiles, through fuel-efficient appliances, through fuel-efficient houses and businesses and buildings that the savings that we will be able to have with respect to the use of energy and oil in this country will allow America to make decisions based upon the American interests and not the interests of other countries because we are tied to them because we do not have energy efficiency in this country. 
   This is a remarkable piece of legislation for the benefits that it will provide for American consumers at the gas pump, at the department store when they buy new appliances, when they buy new homes, when they go to work in new buildings, when they start businesses in more energy-efficient buildings. 
   These are the kinds of benefits that we can have because we have renewable energy, we have fuel standards, and we have a new CAFE standard that is a 40 percent increase in the efficiency of automobiles that Americans will buy into the future that will break that tether to that high price, $3.50 gasoline as it is in California. They will be able to go further on each one of those gallons of gasoline. That is what we need. 
   This bill also creates over 3 million jobs in the green industry that are supported by this legislation that encourages that investment in wind and biofuels and solar energy. Those 3 million jobs, we are 8 years late coming to those jobs, but they are in this legislation; and those jobs will be created in almost every sector of the economy no matter what geographical area people live in. But we need to develop those skills. And I want to thank John Tierney and Hilda Solis for their efforts on that. 
   This is what the people who are betting their money on the future of the high-tech companies, people who are betting their money in terms of venture capitalists, that this is where they told us to go to generate the next generation of innovation, of technology, was in energy. And that is what we are going to do, and America is going to have a much better energy future as a result of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, Members of the House, my colleague from the other side said that every American is guaranteed the right to organize, and that is what this legislation is about. You have a guaranteed right to organize, but when you do, very often what you find out is you do not get the right to organize on behalf of better wages or a pension plan, or holding onto your health care benefits, or the hours that you get paid at work, or the tension between your family life and work, the kinds of things that people organize for. 
   In many workplaces, when you exercise your right to organize, you get fired, you get intimidated, you get harassed, you get followed home, your kids get followed to school, people park their cars outside your house. Your work shift has changed, you are on the graveyard shift instead of the daytime shift. That is what you get. 
   What we are here about today is to redeem what has been in the law for almost 70 years, and that is the law that gives you the right to organize. It says you can either choose to go through an NLRB election or you can choose to have a majority sign-up. But then they inserted in the law many years later the right of the employer to veto that right to majority sign-up. 
   So what the Republicans are suggesting in their opposition to this bill is that we should take away the choice from those workers that has been in the law for 70 years. So that those people, when a majority of people in a workplace decide that they need to organize their workplace to protect their jobs, to protect their salaries, to protect their pensions, to protect their health care, that they will be able to have that organization come into being. 
   Today, you get harassed, you get intimidated, you get an election, and after the election, you get appeals. And you get endless bargaining that in our  own State of California, people have been waiting 7, 8, 9 years for a union that they won in an election. Apparently the secret ballot isn't enough to win your full share of democracy, and has not been enough for millions of workers across this country. 
   So this legislation is very simple, it is only eight pages long. It says the worker gets to choose. That is the basis of American labor law. It is up to the employees to choose their organization and to choose how they want to arrive at that organization. They can choose an NLRB election or they can choose a card check majority sign-up. And we are simply saying, let the law work. Let the employees have the choice. And stop the illegal intimidation of workers. 
   This last year, 30,000 workers had their pay restored to them because illegal actions were taken against them by employers because those workers did nothing else than exercise what the gentleman on the other side of the aisle spoke to, the right in America to organize. But 30,000 workers lost pay, lost hours at work, got fired. All of those things happened to them. And the year before it was 20,000, 20,000 and 20,000. 
   This has gone on far too long. It is time to empower the employees to make this choice about their workplace. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank all of my colleagues who participated in this debate. 
   At a time when the middle class standard of living in America for millions of Americans is at greater risk than at any time in recent history, at a time when people see employers arbitrarily terminating their pensions, freezing their pensions, shifting the cost of their health insurance, cutting the benefits under health insurance; at a time when they see that they have no new money to take home in their wages, that their wages have been flat;  at a time when CEOs are awarding themselves golden handshakes, golden parachutes, and golden hellos, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, at that time at that moment we have an opportunity here to redeem a provision of the law which has been in the law for 70 years to simply give the workers a choice. They can choose an NLRB election, or they can choose a majority signoff. 
   That is a simple choice that these adults in the workplace can make. It is a choice that was given to them 70 years ago, and it was a choice that later was taken away by a veto of the employer. 
   Imagine, a majority of the Americans get together and they do something and one person gets to veto it. One person gets to veto it in the workplace. Think of what the relationship is between that employer and those employees. Think about how those employees must have felt that they needed to organize in the workplace, because employees know that they do if they are going to stop the trend and the bleeding that they see today, against the benefits that they have at their workplace, against their salaries, against their hours at work, against their right to a retirement nest egg that means something. 
   Every day you pick up the business journals of this country and you read where again another employer has terminated a pension, has restricted the pension, won't pay into the pension, puts the pensions into bankruptcy. You want to know why people need card checks? People need card checks so they can have the freedom of choice to choose do they want an election, do they want a card check. It is in the National Labor Relations Act today, it is the law, but for the veto, the veto of the employer. 
   How more arbitrary can you possibly get that a single employer could override the desires of a majority of the employees in its workplace? How more arbitrary can you get? It is the same arbitrariness those employers show when they cut your health care benefits and your pensions and your retirements without any say by the employees, without any negotiations. That is why millions of Americans want representation at work, so that they can have a voice in that workplace, they can have a voice in their future, they can have a voice in whether or not they are going to be able to buy a home, buy a car, educate their children, have a health care policy that they can afford that will be there when they need it. 
   That is what this is really about. This is about whether or not we are going to strengthen and help maintain and grow the middle class in this country. Because it is not happening under the arbitrary policies that are imposed on workers today by their employers. This Employee Free Choice Act gives the workers that choice, the choice that is currently in the law. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation when it comes time for passage. Again, I thank all my colleagues for participating in this debate, I thank the Chair for the courtesy they have shown both sides.  
   Madam Chairman, We all know that workers in the U.S. are among the most productive workers in the world. Yet for far too long, they have not been reaping the benefits of their hard work. 
   For years and years now, many workers have found themselves working harder and harder just to stay in place. And many more have been losing ground financially despite their work. 
   This is troubling enough on its own. But what makes it even more troubling is that, over the last several years, our economy has been growing. The stock market is doing well. Corporate profits are high. 
   Consider the facts. 
   Since 2001, median household income has fallen by $1,300. Wages and salaries now make up their lowest share of the economy in nearly six decades. 
   The number of Americans who lack health insurance has grown by 6.8 million since 2001, to 46.6 million, a shocking record high. 
   The number of Fortune 1000 companies that have frozen or terminated their pension plans has more than tripled since 2001. 
   Indeed, the middle class itself has shrunk. Over 4 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since 2001. 
   And meanwhile, corporate profits make up their largest share of the economy since the 1960s. 
   Madam Chairman, there are a lot of explanations for the growing inequality in our economy. Congress' failure to raise the minimum wage for 10 long years is an obvious example. But perhaps the most significant explanation is that workers' rights to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined. 
   Today, when workers want to form a union, their employers can force them to undergo a National Labor Relations Board election process. That process is broken, because it allows irresponsible employers to harass, coerce, intimidate, reassign, and even fire workers who support a union. 
   Take the example of Ivo Camilo. Mr. Camilo is from Sacramento, not far from my district. For 35 years, he worked at a Blue Diamond Growers plant in Sacramento. In 2004, he and several dozen coworkers sought to form a union. For that, Mr. Camilo was fired. After 35 years of service, Blue Diamond tossed Mr. Camilo out on the street, just because he wanted a union. 
   The same thing happened to Keith Ludlum when he supported union representation for him and his coworkers at a Smithfield foods plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina. Mr. Ludlum, a veteran of the first Gulf War, was fired in 1994 because he wanted a union. It took him 12 years of litigation to get his job back. 
   What happened to Mr. Camilo and Mr. Ludlum happens with distressing frequency in this country. In 2005 alone, over 30,000 workers were receiving back pay from employers that had committed unfair labor violations. 
   Earlier this year, the Center for Economic and Policy Research estimated that employers fire one in five workers who actively advocate for a union. A December 2005 study by American Rights at Work found that 49 percent of employers studied had threatened to close or relocate all or part of the business if workers elected to form a union. 
   And Human Rights Watch has said, ``[F]reedom of association is a right under severe, often buckling pressure when workers in the United States try to exercise it.'' 
   Corporate executives routinely negotiate lavish compensation packages on their own behalfs, but then they deny their own employees the ability to bargain for a better life. 
   This debate is about restoring workers' ability to choose for themselves whether or not they want a union. To make that happen, the Employee Free Choice Act does three things. 
   First, it says that when a majority of workers sign cards authorizing a union, they get a union. The legislation requires the National Labor Relations Board to develop model authorization language and procedures for establishing the validity of signed authorizations. 
   The legislation does not take away workers' ability to have a National Labor Relations Board election instead of majority sign-up if that's what they want. It gives them the choice. If 30 percent sign cards saying they want a union and petition the Board for an election, they get an election. But, if a majority of workers sign cards saying they want a union and they want recognition now, they get a union. 
   This majority sign-up is not a new idea. Under current law, when a majority of workers sign cards authorizing a union, then they can have a union if their employer consents to it. But instead of consenting, employers often reject the employees' choice and force them through an NLRB election process that is dramatically tilted in the employer's favor. The Employee Free Choice Act would simply take this veto power away from employers. Under current law, it's the employer's choice that matters. Under the Employee Free Choice Act, it's the employees' choice that matters. 
   Majority sign-up has a proven track record for reducing coercion and intimidation. In cases where responsible employers, like Cingular Wireless, have permitted their employees to form a union through majority sign-up, both sides have praised the process for increasing cooperation and decreasing tension. 
   Second, the legislation increases penalties against employers who fire or discriminate against workers for their efforts to form a union or obtain a first contract. 
   Under current law the National Labor Relations Board is required to seek a federal court injunction against a union whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the union has violated the secondary boycott prohibitions in the National Labor Relations Act. 
   Under this legislation, the Board must seek a federal court injunction against an employer whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the employer has discharged or discriminated against employees, threatened to discharge or discriminate against employees, or engaged in conduct that significantly interferes with employee rights during an organizing or first contract drive. The legislation authorizes the courts to grant temporary restraining orders or other appropriate injunctive relief. 
   Employers found to have discharged or discriminated against employees during an organizing campaign or first contract drive must pay those workers three times back pay, instead of the simple back pay required under current law. Employers found to have willfully or repeatedly violated employees' rights during  an organizing campaign or first contract drive would receive civil fines of up to $20,000 per violation. 
   Under current law, remedies are limited solely to make whole remedies: back pay (minus any additional interim wages the employee did or should have earned), reinstatement, and notice that the employer will not engage in violations of the National Labor Relations Act. Many employers conclude that, even if caught, it is financially advantageous to violate the law and pay the penalties rather than to comply. 
   And third, the legislation provides for mediation if an employer and a union are engaged in bargaining for their first contract and are unable to reach agreement within 90 days. After 30 days of mediation the dispute would be referred to binding arbitration. Under current law, employers have a duty to bargain in good faith, but are under no obligation to reach agreement. As a result, a recent study found that 34 percent of union election victories had not resulted in a first contract. 
   Madam Chairman, we have heard a lot of shamefully misleading claims from the critics of this bill. Those critics claim that they have workers' best interests at heart, and that they are trying to protect democracy. 
   Yet their claims are belied by the fact that some of the nation's leading workers' rights and prodemocracy organizations support this bill, including Human Rights Watch, Interfaith Worker Justice, and the Drum Major Institute--among many, many others. 
   These are organizations that are dedicated to the mission of improving the lives of American workers. I can tell you that if this bill would do the kind of harm that its critics claim it would, then these respected organizations would not be supporting it today. 
   I want to close by just reminding people how much is at stake here. 
   We can continue on our nation's current path, where our society grows more and more unequal and polarized. If we stay on the same path, then our middle class will keep getting squeezed, and will struggle to pay for just the basic necessities of life, like housing, healthcare, education, and transportation. 
   We can stay on that path, or we can go in a new direction. We can ensure that every American worker gets his or her fair share of the benefits of a growing economy. 
   To strengthen America's middle class, we have got to restore workers' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. 
   After all, union workers earn 30 percent more, on average, than non-union workers. They are much more likely to have retirement and health benefits and paid time off. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 800 so that we can finally start to reverse the middle class squeeze and create an economy that benefits all Americans.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairwoman, I think the gentleman from New Jersey has explained this quite correctly. This allows you, because of your membership in a union, to be discriminated against in the employment. 
   The actions that the gentleman says that he wouldn't like to have take place are actions that are already illegal under the law. You don't get to disrupt the workplace. You don't get to engage in those kinds of activities, and that's the way the law is written. 
   This is just simply a broad discriminatory practice against the employment, or it allows the nonemployment of individuals who are members of the union. At very best, under the best interpretation, what this employee would buy themselves if they go to seek a job is they would get themselves a lawsuit. They would have to sue for the right to be employed in a workplace. 
   You know, a job today in America is not a luxury; it is a necessity. This is just part of the harassment of individuals who believe in the organization of the workplace. This is just one more of the harassment, and now they want to put this one into the statutes of the United States. 
   We should vote against this amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, you look at this amendment and you realize this is just another piece of the continued effort by which the party on the other side is fully prepared to diminish the rights of workers to have access to information about an organization that may help them in the workplace. But, you know what? 
   If the employer wants to bring that worker in and sit him down on a one-to-one meeting with the supervisor, with the owner of the company or the Board of Directors, if he wants to take them off of their job where they may be getting paid for productivity and explain to them why they shouldn't join the union and all that, there is nothing to protect that employee there. There he is sitting with the person who can fire them. There he is sitting with the person who fired over 35,000 people or docked their pay or did some other illegal action against them because they said, well, I think I might still want a union. 
   But if the union wants to go out, if other employees want to talk to their fellow workers about this, you have no opportunity to communicate. And then you are supposed to go into an election. But one side doesn't get any opportunity to communicate. 
   That is an interesting theory, that those with all of the power in this arrangement, those with the authority to hire and fire, they get unlimited access. But here, you may get, on break time in the break room you may still have a little tiny bit of access for the union, but they can't talk to a person out there because they could take them off the list. 
   What do you think the first thing is the employer might suggest to the employees when they hear that there is a union effort in the company? Put yourself on the Do Not Call List. Joe, did you put yourself on the Do Not Call List yesterday? Because then the employer knows immediately that the union no longer has access. Just another form of intimidation, just another form of a kind of arbitrary power over the employees, just one of those little things that the anti-union consultants will tell the employer to check off. 
   Make sure you told your employees to sign up for the Do Not Call List. Make sure you run down that list, find out who signed up and who didn't, get that list clean, because if we ever get that list, if we can get 100 percent, then the union has no access to them. It is a wonderful tool in the name of democracy you want to put into the hands of the anti-union campaigns. 
   No, it is very unfortunate that they simply won't allow workers to make this decision, the decision that is accommodated and allowed and provided for in the law of whether or not they want an NLRB election, or they want a majority sign up. They are not going to do that. And so fearful of the decision that the employee might make, they have decided to insulate the employee from the campaign and put them off limits to anybody except the employer.  
   No, this amendment should not be supported at all, and I urge its defeat. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him so much for his role in bringing this bill to the floor and the subcommittee where he chairs the subcommittee and in the full committee during the debate and here on the floor today, and I thank all of my colleagues who voted for this bill. 
   I don't know, maybe you have been doing business so long where you have been paying back your supporters, you think that is the way everybody does business. And that is why you have people heading down toward the courthouse and that is why you lost your leadership, because they were paying back their supporters. 
   Now, I know it is hard for you to change your stripes, and some of you will be wearing stripes, but the fact of the matter is, that is not the way we are doing business. But that is your language and that is your habit and the way you ran the Congress. It is pay to play. Pay to play. 
   Well, a new day is in town, and we are here today about whether or not workers will simply have the choice to exercise a right that has been in the law for 70 years, a right that can be taken away from them like that from an employer who simply says no to a majority of people who want representation in a workplace, a right that is part of the National Labor Relations Act. But it is revoked by employers, arbitrarily, without reason, without purpose. Then they can insert those employees into a process that is well documented now of hundreds of thousands of employees over the last decade that have been punished and had retribution, been harassed, lost pay, lost their homes, lost their jobs, lost their good shift, lost their premium time. That is the record. That is the record. 
   So the question is simply this: Will we give these employees the choice to decide, do I get to have an NLRB election, or do I want to choose this. Thirty percent can have an election. It takes 50 percent to have a card check. 
   And your secret ballot, Mr. McKeon, you forgot to have the secret ballot for the decertification election. Apparently you don't need a secret ballot for that. You just have a card check. Okay. Now we understand what is going on here. 
   Let's remember today that families find themselves in the most difficult of economic situations. Today, your employer, who has reduced your pension, they have terminated your pension, they have reduced the payments into your pension, they extend the time in years that you have to participate in the pension before you can vest. Your health care, they ask you to pay more for it and reduce the benefits that you are paying more for. They change your hours. They change your pay. They change your premium pay. They change your shift. 
   So finally people say, I have got to have some say. I want the right to organize at work. I need representation. As the new Senator from Virginia said, everybody needs an agent. ``I need somebody to negotiate with this employer because I am not able to support my family. My wages aren't going up.'' 
   The productivity is going up, the highest productivity in the history of the country, and employees are taking home the smallest share. Who is taking the most home? The CEO's, with their arbitrary golden parachutes and golden handshakes. What about the person trying to support a middle-class family? What about the person trying to decide whether they can hold on to their house or if they can buy their first house? Where do they get to negotiate? 
   The law says go to the National Labor Relations Act, and there you find a provision that says an employee has the choice of how to do this. But if they choose a card check, the employer can take it away from them. That is not democracy. That is arbitrary. That is capricious. That is an outrage. These are real people. These are real people that have been hurt this way. 
   I conducted a hearing. Ivo Camilo worked for Blue Diamond Growers for 35 years. He was awarded all kinds of awards for being an outstanding employee. Thirty-five years he gave them his life. And then Ivo said he wanted a union and they fired him. And when he said that to our hearing, he started to cry. Thirty-five years he had worked, and he started to cry. 
   My granddaughter was sitting next to me in the hearing. She had to leave early, but she had her father call me from the car. She got on the phone and she said, ``Papa,'' she said, ``Papa, why did that man have to cry in front of all those people?'' 
   I said, ``Montana, he cried because he was embarrassed to admit to other people that he couldn't provide for his family; that he had lost a job that he was proud of. He lost a job because he simply spoke up.''     
   Another constitutional right you forget sometimes, he simply spoke up and said, ``I would like to have representation at work.'' And so Ivo Camilo was fired, along with tens of thousands of  other workers who simply made that statement to their employer. 
   You believe that is a fair system? That is a fair system that people can be fired? And when he gets his job back, he gets his back pay, no penalty for doing this, and that is why 30,000 people have taken action against them, because there is no penalty for the employer to fire these people, because what do they want, they are trying to increase the security in the workplace, they are trying to increase the financial security of their families. 
   You can pick up the paper every day and understand what is happening to people with health care, with their pensions. You can see what happens every day. The wages of working people are flat. They have been decreasing over the years, even as they have been the best workforce in America, and now they understand the risks that they run. 
   They want more say. They want their employers to stop fooling around with pension plans and dipping into their retirement funds and putting those things at risk. That is what the Employee Free Choice Act does: it gives these employees a chance to have representation and protect the health and welfare and support of their families. I urge a vote against the McKeon amendment and in support of the legislation. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker and Members of the House, this is one of the more cynical amendments that could be offered at this time. You are going out to organize a workplace, and the people you are going out to organize are the employees of a company. 
   Now, either that company has a large number or maybe a total workforce that is illegal, and they don't want you near them; or they are legal because they are employed there, because that employer is supposed to check to see whether or not they are legal and to certify that they are. That is the pool of people that you are seeking to employ. 
   Now, this administration, you know, I think in 2004, maybe fined five companies, or you can put them on one hand. They now want to shift their failure to enforce in the workplace to the union organizers that they somehow have to do immigration checks because neither the employer apparently did them, nor the administration did them. 
   This is simply outrageous that we would ask people to do this. The people who are working in the facility, whether it is a plant or a job site, the employer has certified that they are legal, and they are legal workers. Why is it we would shift this to the unions? 
   If this company is not properly certified, that is why the Federal Government is supposed to be inspecting them. But they don't inspect them, because you haven't done this in the past, because you haven't taken this problem as seriously as you should. But all of a sudden you decided on this bill you are going to take it seriously, and you are going to shift it on to the union organizing effort to check this. It is an outrageous and cynical approach. 
   If you take it seriously, if you take it seriously, then enforce the law. Enforce the law. You have been in power for 12 years. And apparently this is a problem that is so important that it only comes to light this evening. Enforce the law, 2004, three companies. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield time to Mr. Andrews from New Jersey.

   Madam Speaker, I just want to say to the House, let's not vote for this cynical amendment. Let's vote ``no'' against this and not punish people who are out trying to organize for the benefits of their families and their communities and for their health care and for their wages and put this burden on them that this administration hasn't accepted and the employers haven't accepted or the employers are doing it illegally.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate the committee bringing this bill to the floor. 
   It is just so fundamental that one of the times when government should step in and lend a family a hand is when that family, through no fault of their own, has lost their job. The difference is whether or not that family will be able to maintain and hold on to their home, to their car, to their kids' education, to provide the wherewithal for their children. And for millions of Americans, that's what's happened. And since they've lost that job, they have also exhausted their unemployment benefits that has enabled them to keep their head barely above water. They're gone looking for jobs, they've gone looking for work. They've tried to retrain. They still haven't been able to  secure the employment because this is a terrible market for employment. 
   What we need to do is to extend those unemployment benefits to those families so that they can hold themselves together. It should not be a policy in this country that when you lose your job through no fault of your own, that you crash to the ground, you lose your home, you lose your kids' education, and you start all over again. It's not good for the economy, it's horrible for these families, and it's wrong for this government not to take every step we can to prevent that.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PORT CHICAGO NAVAL MAGAZINE NATIONAL MEMORIAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial Enhancement Act, a bill that ensures that the stories of Port Chicago will be preserved and that the site will be properly maintained for generations to come. This bill will increase the National Memorial's accessibility, provide additional visitor services, and help ensure long-term preservation of the site. 
   The legislation before us today is the result of months of diligent and collaborative effort, for which I want to thank: Chairman NICK RAHALL of the Natural Resources Committee, and ranking member DON YOUNG; Chairman RA&#218;L GRIJALVA of the National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Subcommittee, and ranking member ROB BISHOP; Chairman IKE SKELTON of the Armed Services Committee, and ranking member DUNCAN HUNTER; and the  thoughtful and hard-working staff for the two committees, including Meghan Conklin, Dave Watkins, and David Sienicki, and my own legislative director, Ben Miller. 
   The Port Chicago memorial, which is in my district, commemorates a very important story in American history. 
   The deadly munitions explosion there on the night of July 17, 1944, killed more than 300 people--the worst homefront disaster of World War II. 
   When sailors were ordered to resume work a few weeks later, most of them refused to return to their dangerous tasks until supervision, training, and working conditions were improved. 
   In response, the Navy charged 50 men with conspiring to mutiny--all were convicted. 
   The majority of the men killed while handling ordinance at Port Chicago, and all of those convicted of mutiny, were African-American. 
   The Port Chicago story was a turning point in American history. The injustice strongly influenced the Navy's move toward desegregation in 1945. 
   The Port Chicago memorial tells that story, and I am proud to have authored the legislation designating the memorial, as I am proud to be involved in enhancing it with this legislation. 
   At our hearing in Mr. GRIJALVA's subcommittee last fall, we heard from the National Park Service, in support of this bill; from Dr. Robert Allen, who literally wrote the book on Port Chicago and is a board member of the Friends of Port Chicago; and Mr. Eugene Sayles, who was a seaman first class at Port Chicago and helped to get injured men out of the barracks after the explosion. 
   As they and others have said, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial tells a critical story in our civil rights and military history, and with this legislation, we are ensuring that more Americans will hear the Port Chicago story. 
   The National Parks Conservation Association has also strongly supported this legislation, pointing to the ``broad local and national support'' for the effort, and noting that the Port Chicago memorial deserves elevation to its ``rightful place as a fully-fledged unit of the National Park System.'' 
   The new designation under this bill brings with it increased stature--and more importantly, the Park Service will be able to budget for the memorial's needs. 
   In addition, the bill provides for an interpretive center for the Memorial--this facility will allow school groups, families, and other visitors to learn about Port Chicago even if they can't access the site, which is located within the Concord Naval Weapons Station. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman GRIJALVA, Chairman RAHALL, Chairman SKELTON, and their staff for helping us bring this important legislation to the floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of legislation that would greatly enhance the health and safety protections in the Nation's coal mines. 
   Despite significant progress over the last several decades, mining remains one of the most dangerous jobs in America. Mining fatalities occur at a rate more than seven times the average of all private industries; and we are reminded of how dangerous mining can be by the tragedies like the one in Utah in August of this last year, where six miners and three rescuers died in what appears to have been a preventable disaster, and the tragedies of Kentucky and West Virginia in 2006. 
   Accidents every year claim the lives of one or two miners at a time. In 2007, according to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 32 coal miners and 31 metal and nonmetal miners died on the job. Miners also face serious health risks, including a resurgence of black lung disease. 
   The legislation we are considering today, the S-MINER Act, builds on the work of the last Congress when it passed the MINER Act of 2006. The S-MINER Act represents a comprehensive approach to minimize the health and safety risks facing miners. It is critical that Congress take this action, because one of the things that is clear is that we cannot leave mine safety and health to the Bush administration. 
   When the Sago Mine disaster occurred, we learned that the Bush administration had withdrawn or delayed more than a dozen health and safety proposals that would have benefited miners. The Bush administration filled top-level positions at MSHA with executives from the very industry that the agency was charged with regulating. Dangerous rules favored by the industry, which would leave miners vulnerable to aggressive ``belt air'' fires, became law under this administration. 
   From 2001 to 2006, the Bush administration gutted MSHA by cutting funding and staffing, and especially in coal mine enforcement, where the worst tragedies would strike in 2006 and 2007. Even as coal production increased around the country, the Bush administration cut the Mine Safety and Health Administration's coal enforcement personnel by 9 percent by 2006. And then came the Sago disaster, Aracoma Alma, Darby, and Crandall Canyon mines. Even after these recent tragedies, even after the MINER Act was enacted, we continue to see neglect from this administration. 
   The Inspector General found this past fall that MSHA was failing to conduct mandated inspections on time, leaving thousands of miners unprotected. In 2006 alone, MSHA failed to complete the required inspections of 107 mines, employing 7,500 miners. And,  Secretary Chao failed to meet a simple deadline under the MINER Act to produce regulations on rescue teams, fundamental regulations on rescue teams, at the end of this last year. 
   The track record of this administration on mine safety and health has been horrendous, and Congress needs to act. That is why we are here today, to make sure that our government fulfills its obligations to protect those brave men and women who risk their safety to keep this country running. 
   The S-MINER Act addresses three broad issues: disaster prevention; improved emergency response; and long-term health risks. And I will talk more about those areas in a moment. 
   Later today, in addition to the underlying bill, I will be offering a manager's amendment that makes modifications to the bill. Among other things, that amendment will address the troubling problems of substance abuse. Because of injuries, overwork, and stress that miners often suffer, we have heard reports of substance abuse among miners. 
   I want to be absolutely clear. None of the recent mine tragedies have been linked to drug use in any way, but we should nevertheless be proactive in heading off the dangers that drug use poses to the miners. A few States have already adopted drug testing requirements for miners. Most, if not all, of the large coal mining companies already utilize some form of drug testing program. It will take further study to determine what role, if any, the Federal Government should play here, but this issue should be dealt with. That is why the amendment I will offer later today will require the Secretary of Labor to conduct a study on best practices and will authorize her, within 6 months, to set up a drug testing and rehabilitation program for miners, in consultation with miners, their unions, operators, State agencies, and public health experts. 
   Two other amendments will be offered by Representatives BOUCHER and ELLSWORTH to build upon and modify this legislation, and I support those amendments. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   My colleague from California said that we had a study in this. Yes, we have a study for the Secretary to determine the best way to implement a drug testing and treatment program after 6 months of talking to the States and local agencies and the companies and the miners. We don't impose this from Washington. And then the Secretary, if she determines that it is feasible, she is instructed to start the program. 
   We just thought it would be wise to consult the companies who have programs, States that have programs, the miners themselves, the local public health agencies.

   The gentleman from Alaska is quite correct. It's a pathetic sight to see the President of the United States begging the Saudi prince to release more oil 8 years after that President has been in office; several energy bills passed by the Republican Congress, and the President is left going hat in hand begging the Saudi prince for more oil. It just shows the opportunity cost of this administration, of that Republican Congress and the pathetic energy policy that we were left with. 
   The new energy bill, however, reverses that trend. I'm very proud to be part of it.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I want to thank you for your support of this legislation. I would note that the manager's amendment will slow down the required schedule of underground mines to convert to the new more fire-resistant conveyer belts. These belts will help prevent deaths in all kinds of underground mines. And the amendment will ensure that mine operators have a chance to use up the perfectly good belts that they have in their inventory. 
   Also, the S-MINER Act will not adopt new safety standards for underground non-coal mines, except for the conveyor belt, and in this case, the mines which regularly emit methane gas, new rules for explosion-proof seals. It certainly does not treat these mines like coal mines. 
   The current air quality standards for underground salt mines are based on 1973 rules established by a private organization and incorporated by reference into the MSHA regulations. It is hard to even locate a copy of these old standards. It is the intent of S-MINER to adopt air standards that are justified by the unbiased scientific evidence as preventing health risks to miners and are feasible for the mines to achieve. If mine operators object to the new mine health limits based upon concerns of technological or economic feasibility, the bill requires them to fully analyze these concerns before adopting new standards. By speeding up the rulemaking process, we want to accelerate MSHA to address real hazards, but do not intend to adopt unsupported standards that do not create significant benefits or are not feasible for compliance. 
   The S-MINER Act does increase minimum and maximum penalties for violation of requirements that specifically protect the health and safety in underground metal and non-metal mines. However, it leaves in place the requirements in the law that small mines get a break, that a mine operator's history is a factor in assessment, and that the degree of negligence and seriousness of the hazard is to be considered. 
   Also, I want to note that our colleague, Congressman Ellsworth, has an amendment which would eliminate the requirement from the bill that concerns many of your constituents with respect to escrowing proposed penalties before contest.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. This amendment, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, does four things. First, it will authorize $30 million for the Department of Labor to buy a new generation of personal dust monitors required by the builder and provide them to miners. These dust monitors greatly enhance the accuracy in measuring the concentration of coal dust in underground coal mines. Both miner and industry representatives have expressed support for this initiative. It will go a long way in helping us reverse the rise in black lung and save untold amounts of costs in dealing with such debilitating disease. 
   Second, the amendment will increase the time permitted for the mining industry to install a new generation of fire-resistant conveyor belts, significantly cutting industry compliance costs with the underlying bill. This amendment takes into account the industry concerns about significant amounts of old-style conveyor belts already purchased and in reserve. Under this provision, miners can use up the reserved belts before purchasing new fire-resistant belts so long as after 5 years of use they pass a proper annual inspection. 
   Third, the amendment would eliminate delays by some mine operators in providing supplies of breathable air in underground coal mines for miners who may become trapped as required under the MINER Act of 2006. We recently learned that some miner operators are putting refuge chambers on order, with a wait of several years in some cases, and MSHA has been treating these purchase orders as sufficient to comply with the MINER Act's breathable air requirement. In the meantime, miners are underground without the breathable air that this Congress intended them to have. At least 11 of the 12 miners of the Sago explosion, for example, did not die because of the explosion. They died because, after many hours of awaiting rescue, they ran out of air. So this provision closes an apparent loophole in the MINER Act and ensures that breathable air is readily available to miners underground today while operators await the delivery of refuge chambers. Such air supplies can be provided via air cylinders or through boreholes to the surface pursuant to MSHA instructions. 
   Finally, this amendment deals with the potential safety problems posed by substance abuse in a direct and responsible fashion. Many of us have seen the recent reports about the rise of substance abuse problems in mines and mining communities. There is no doubt that the injuries, overwork and stress that miners experience can leave some of them vulnerable to abusing substances like painkillers. Now, none of the recent tragedies have been linked in any way to drug use, but we should be proactive in this area. 
   The amendment directs the Secretary of Labor to study the problem in consultation with all parties and to impose the program if she determines it to be feasible. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass the manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that, first of all, on the question, I'm sure we had both the same reaction when we read the story in The Washington Post that we had an opportunity in this legislation to address, the issue of substance abuse by those in the mining industry. You drafted your amendment and we drafted our amendment. Ours is, in fact, a study and then the implementation of the program. 
   The gentleman from the other side of the aisle and his colleagues are always saying they don't want a solution made in Washington. They want to consult other parties. We thought we should consult the companies. We thought we should consult the States that have experience in this, the public health agencies that have some experience in this, and have the Secretary develop the best program and then enact that program with drug testing. That's what we thought we should do, and I think it makes the most sense. There are States that have extensive experience, and rather than just somehow creating a program sent from Washington, whether those programs have drug testing or not, didn't make any sense to us. 
   With the rest of the criticisms of the amendment, I think it's sort of like maybe the ``Abbey Road'' album, where you guys play it backwards and it says ``Paul is dead'' or something. You're reading the amendments upside down or something because that's not what the amendments do. These are good amendments. They address some concerns that the industry has raised with us. And the fact of the matter is miners are entitled to have breathable air, to have 96 hours of air underground today. When the chambers come, they will come, but in the meantime they should not be unprotected given the history of the accidents that we have witnessed in this country and the problems that the miners have reaching those breathable supplies after the explosions. 
   So I would encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment, the manager's amendment, by voting for it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

They would change the retreat mining where we just saw a disaster of a mine accident in Utah this last August. They would provide a provision of a study. Rather  than changing the regulations by which that happened, they would provide a study. A study was not going to save those miners. 
   They would also take out the provision that we have that miners should have 96 hours of air available to them in the mines until such time as we have the refuge chambers. They take that out. Those miners need that air today. The fact that a refuge chamber is on order, may not be delivered for six months, a year, a year and a half, does nothing for the miner who goes to work today and tomorrow, and that is why we did it. We did it so that we could provide that margin of safety for those individuals. 
   We also look at conveyor belts, a major ignition point of fires in the mine, and if not properly installed, if not properly taken care of, can take the fire and the gases directly to where the miners are working. So they take that provision out. 
   We say that MSHA cannot investigate itself. It cannot investigate itself. These must be independent investigations, because you have to look at whether or not MSHA properly did its job, properly enforced the requirements of the law, properly inspected the mines and all that that entails, and to have them redo that themselves is a disservice to the miners and to the families. It's the single most provided complaint to this committee by the families, that they just don't understand how the watch dog can investigate themselves when their family members died in these mines. They want somebody else to take a look at it. They want somebody else to see whether or not it was done properly or not, and that is out in this provision. 
   It also limits the family participation. Why is it that the victims aren't able to testify and to participate and understand the design of the investigation? They are excluded from this process today. These are family members, these are victims of the disaster, these are taxpayers, and they're told, Just stand on the side, we'll tell you what happened. In many instances, they know more about what happens because when their spouses come home from work, they talk to them about what is wrong in the mines, what's dangerous, about their fear of going to work. So we provided an ombudsman so that that could happen. They should also be part of that investigation. 
   We think it's very important that this amendment be defeated because it wipes out, it guts those provisions of the law that we envision in this legislation that are so important to those miners and to their families. We cannot do what we have done in the past and assume that we can just leave this to the Mine Safety Health Administration. They essentially did nothing for 8 years. 
   Now, tragically, year after year those mining families are paying the price for that. That must come to an end. That is what this legislation does. This amendment destroys the ability of this legislation to provide that margin of safety to the miners and to their families, and I urge a ``no'' vote on the Wilson amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time I may consume. 
   Just in response to the question that was asked, the whole point is the chambers are not available. We are asking that they put 96 hours of air available in canisters until such time as the refuge chambers are available. Currently now, apparently if you order a chamber, you are considered to be in compliance. No new air has come into that mine. No new resources of air are available. Nothing is available to the miner, but you are in compliance with the law. 
   We saw miners lose their lives because they simply ran out of air. They weren't killed in the explosion. They weren't killed in a slide. They weren't killed in a roof collapse. They ran out of air. 
   So what we are saying is we appreciate that you have gone ahead and you have ordered the chambers because you have made the decision to put the chambers in. Until such time as they are there, we ought to provide that kind of margin of safety. One is not inconsistent with the other.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. These are air cylinders that are readily available. These are not the individual-sized packs that we deal with here in terms of inspections that didn't work in the Sago Mine. Canisters of air are readily available all throughout American society. We just say you should  put some in the mines so people can use them. 
   Then let me just say the question that is raised here, currently the law allows for employer and employee involvement in safety issues. Many, many organizations and businesses have these committees. But we want those committees to remain independent. 
   This suggests that somehow the employer should select those employees to engage in those discussions. We think that the workers ought to be able to do that and do it independently so that, in fact, they can have a true discussion about the conditions and the safety of the mines and not be establishing unilateral committees to make those determinations. 
   The fact of the matter is, where people have these employer-employee safety committees, very often the efficiency of the mines improves, the productivity of the mines improves and the safety improves, and we think that that is the model that ought to be continued.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, over this weekend we were treated to a very sad and disturbing story in the Washington Post about drug use in the mining community in Virginia and other States, about miners who have been crushed by equipment in the mines, who have been crushed in roof falls in the mine, who had been run over by other equipment in the mine, whose bodies were wracked with pain, who got addicted to painkillers, to OxyContin, to other drugs such as that, prescription drugs, and then were struggling with their addiction. 
   There was also the story of a miner who got up every night at midnight,  fixed himself a quick meal, and drove 135 miles round trip before he went to work so he could get his methadone treatment at the clinic and get on his job, and do that with the knowledge of his employer, struggling with his addiction, struggling to stay employed. 
   In this bill, we had the opportunity to address this situation. Rick Boucher, our colleague, addressed it by authorizing with almost unanimous support $10 million for treatment and to work with these miners, that the Secretary can use. 
   We have suggested an amendment in the manager's amendment, which you voted for, which says that the Secretary will spend 6 months to work with the industry, to work with the miners, to work with the States. Virginia has a program. Kentucky has a program. West Virginia does not. Pennsylvania apparently does not. Indiana does not. Illinois does not. The Secretary will work with them to see how they're doing it, the best way to do it, and at the end of that 6 months, after those consultations, after her study, to impose a drug program with drug testing and treatment and rehabilitation. 
   How is that different than what is being offered here by my colleagues on the other side? They impose drug testing, and then they impose a blacklist for those who test positive. You want to talk about baseball? You're being a hell of a lot harder on hardworking miners in this country than you are on the baseball stars because they use drugs, and they go to work every day and nobody says anything. 
   But a miner who's been crushed on the job, who's trying to provide for their families, tests positive, we don't know if it's a false positive. They don't make allowances for false positives. He gets on the blacklist and he may never work again. 
   Rick Boucher had a better idea. Our committee had a better idea. Have the Secretary work with the States and the companies and the mining industries and the miners and the unions and say how can we best do this because I'm going to do it. So what's the best way for us to do this. 
   So many of you from both sides of the aisle during the consideration of this bill have said to me one thing over and over again: Will you work with the companies? Will you work with the companies? Now, along comes drug testing, nobody says work with the companies. Nobody says work with the unions. Nobody says work with the community health facilities. They just say test them and list them. 
   What the hell kind of thing is that to do to hardworking people in one of the most dangerous industries? We've had spouses come to this committee and talk about the fear in their spouses at night when they come home from work and before they leave, the fear that these miners have of going into that workplace. 
   In that article, one of the miners said he takes drugs and he used to drink because he's fighting, he hates the job. Some of them love the job in that article. They said, This is my life, mining. Digging coal is what I do best, but my legs have been crushed, my arm has been crushed. 
   Let's give them testing. Let's give them treatment, and let's give them some understanding of the kind of industry that they're in. We benefit, we burn the coal, we run the economy, and these families live in fear.     
   This is a very good bill. This is a very good bill. We should not suggest for a moment that because there is no link between the tragedies of the mining accidents last year and the year before, that drugs were involved at all. We have a nutty owner in Utah, but we're not going to test him. We're not going to test that owner, who is running around giving all these false reasons to these poor victims and their families as to what happened. 
   So yes, you can talk about baseball. But at the end of the day, those baseball players, just as they did last season and next season, they'll be playing. And they'll get a warning, and they'll get treatment. And they'll get a second warning, and they'll get treatment. These guys get a test and a list. It's unfair. It's outrageous. And you should not support it.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, Members of the House, today we continue the consideration of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. This is legislation that was reported from the Committee on Education and Labor with unanimous bipartisan support. Once again today, I want to thank my colleagues on the committee on both sides of the aisle and the staff on both sides of the committee for working in a manner which allowed us to report this bill in very short order to the House for its consideration, and on working with the Department of Education, the Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, for her cooperation in helping us with this legislation so that we can assure the parents, families, and students of this country that there will be no interruption in their access to student loans. 
   As the lending season starts to progress now, as students are getting their letters of acceptance, thinking about the next semesters of education and next year's education, as that lending season comes into its fullness, we want to make sure that there is no disruption. 
   We are concerned about a disruption because of the general disruption that is taking place in the Nation's credit markets, and specifically, concern about whether or not there will be a spillover onto the student loan markets so that students will have difficulty finding those loans. 
   We have worked with the Department of Education, we have worked with the administration, we have worked with the Republican members of the committee and our own caucus to devise a system of relief that is available to the Secretary and to the administration in the event that that should happen. And really what we're doing is three things: One, we're making sure that the existing law and the existing program for such an emergency, the Lender of Last Resort program, is functioning, that agreements are reached between the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Treasury, and we've been told by the Secretary of Education that she has informed the members of the committee that that has been done, that the Secretary meet with the guarantee agencies that might stand in the stead of those lenders that cannot make those loans to make sure that there is a smooth transition between them and the universities and colleges, and that that program is in place. 
   Also, that schools are aware that they can apply to qualify for the Direct Lending program. Many colleges and universities use that today. They may want to consider that so, again, there is smooth transition should the private lending market not be able to come forward with the student loans, they could direct their students to either of those two programs. 
   And, finally, to try and help the private sector credit markets for student loans, as this bill does, to give standby  authority to the Secretary to purchase those government loans from the traditional lenders in the student loan field so that we might develop some liquidity in that market so that they can then take the money they receive from the Secretary and make a new tranche of student loans. If she purchases those loans, that money could only be used to provide a new set of student loans for the students for the coming year. 
   And we also raised the loan limit for students, for undergraduates, because we understand that the private student loan market is in very rough shape, and there are some students who use private loans to fill a small gap between the total cost of their education and what they were able to borrow. We think by raising the limit, we will be able to help most of those students in that situation. 
   So this is an important piece of legislation. It's legislation that we look to be acted upon in the Senate in a very timely fashion and then to be sent to the President, we believe, for his signature. And then we will have completed a series of standby authorities and a series of processes that we should be able to assure families and students that there will be no major interruption in the student lending for the remainder of this year and next year. 
   With that, I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the manager's amendment to H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. The amendment was done on a bipartisan basis with the input of the senior Republican member, Mr. McKeon. The manager's amendment we are considering here today makes various technical changes to the legislation and additional substantive changes to ensure continued access to Federal student loans. 
   Specifically, the amendment makes the following changes: It targets loan limit increases to undergraduate students and families. It clarifies that only eligible students as defined under section 435(a) may qualify for these loans as with all other Federal student aid. It clarifies that at the discretion of the Secretary, a loan may continue to be serviced by the current lender. And in regard to school-wide Lender of Last Resort eligibility, it specifies that the Secretary of Education shall determine whether a school qualifies and provides criteria for the Secretary to consider in making the determination. It specifies that funds received by lenders from loan sales will be used to originate new loans. And it clarifies that, at the discretion of the Secretary, a loan purchased by the Secretary may continue to be serviced by the current lender. 
   Now more than ever, families deserve every assurance that we are doing all that we can to make sure that they will continue to be able to access the low-cost loans they need to pay for college, regardless of what happens in the credit markets. I am confident that our efforts, coupled with the proper planning by the Federal Government, will provide them with that guarantee. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I commend Mr. Petri for this amendment. He addresses an oversight in the legislation in making sure that the Secretary has the ability to review and revise the regulations concerning prohibited guaranty agency inducements to ensure that agencies do not engage in improper inducements. We don't think this is a problem, but we had a problem in the past in the rest of the program, and we passed on a bipartisan basis, the Student Loan Sunshine Act, and I think this amendment is an important part of keeping the integrity of that act and the continuity within the student loan program so that all participants in that program understand that we cannot condone even an appearance of improper relationships. When students and families are borrowing money and making sacrifices for that money, we want to make sure that they get the best deal available and they get the best facts available to them. 
   I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, Members of the House, this is an important amendment. 
   This committee, on a bipartisan basis, has struggled with trying to get a good handle, if you will, an understandable handle on the cost of education and the reasons for the increases in the cost of education, as we watched the cost spiral up in higher education much faster than the general inflation index. And it is a rising concern in families. As their budgets compete with fuel, food and mortgage payments, this obviously becomes a very serious matter. 
   Congressman McKeon and Congressman Castle have been on this watch  for many years in this committee trying to help us come to grips with this problem and trying to carry on a positive conversation with the universities and colleges so that we can better define those costs that they control, the costs that they don't control, and certainly the actions of the States in their support for the public institutions. I think this amendment is very helpful. 
   Congressman Welch has spoken to me about this during our deliberations of the higher education bill and of the college loan reduction bill that we passed last year. 
   This is an issue that continues to nag at us. I think providing some good guidance to GAO, with their expertise, we have an opportunity to really take a good look at a cross-section of institutions, what is properly driving the increases in cost and what maybe is improperly driving the increase in cost, and those things that can possibly be brought under control and be reduced by cooperative actions between the institutions, the States, and the Federal Government. 
   So I strongly support this amendment, and I want to thank Congressman Castle and Congressman Welch for offering this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I just want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida for introducing this amendment. She had talked to me about this early on, and it was an oversight. But she has raised the issue that for families that have engaged in serious medical encounters, the question of what the real bill is becomes a matter of serious negotiations that can take over a period of time. 
   You get your bill. It says you owe $65,000. And then it says, but the real cost was $45,000, and somebody will pay $20,000, and you owe whatever is in between. And then you find out that is really not true, that was the initial billing, and you back over a period of months. Those negotiations, because of an unexpected serious medical encounter within a family, should not bar, in these times, those individuals from being able to access student loans. It doesn't mean they've lost their incomes. It doesn't mean any of that at that point. 
   I think it is a very important addition to this legislation as we are trying to weave together a support system for families that must rely on loans for the education of their children. 
   I want to thank you very much for offering this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, in a few minutes, the President of the United States will veto the legislation to hold the Iraqi government responsible and accountable for the benchmarks that they promised their citizens and the citizens of this country. Tonight, after 24,000 U.S. soldiers have been wounded, 3,212 have been killed, and the country has descended into a bloody civil war, what we now see is the basis on which the President told this country he wanted the surge in the escalation was that he would hold the Iraqi government responsible. 
   In January, he said he would hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks as announced, and that if no progress is made, they would lose the support of the American people. The fact is that no progress has been made, and the Brookings Institute has shown us that situation. 
   What we see now, as Secretary Rice says, that the administration believes that holding the Iraqis accountable to these benchmarks that they establish as the price of the surge ``doesn't allow us the flexibility and creativity we need to move forward.'' 
   You can be creative all you want but unless the Iraqis know that there are consequences, and that is what this legislation said, that if you can't reach these benchmarks, if you can't establish a civil society, then we will withdraw our troops. 
   Right now, under President Bush's proposal under Secretary Rice's proposal, what we see as the only people paying the price are the American soldiers. Those are the only people paying the price tonight.  
   Today marks a sad anniversary for this, country. 
   Four years ago today, President Bush declared that the mission in Iraq was accomplished and that major combat operations in Iraq were over. 
   Since that time, 24,270 U.S. soldiers have been wounded, 3,212 have been killed, and the country has descended into a bloody civil war that we cannot stop nor should we referee. 
   It is time for America to redeploy it's troops from Iraq. 
   That's why today, Congress sent a bill to the President's desk that would do just that: to redeploy from Iraq. 
   It's what a majority of the American people want, and it's what a majority of the United States Congress wants. 
   But instead of ending the war, the President is pursuing a war with no end in sight. 
   He refuses to hold the Iraqi government accountable for the benchmarks it promised to achieve: to establish a government supported by its people that can provide for its own security. 
   In January, the President said that ``If the Iraqi Government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people.'' 
   Well Mr. President, the Iraqi's have not followed through, and your war has lost the support of the American people and a majority of the United States Congress. 
   According to a study by the Brookings Institute, there has been ``no progress thus far'' achieving the administration's benchmarks. 
   Yet, despite the President's promise in January to ``hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced,'' the administration has flip flopped. 
   On Sunday, Secretary Rice said the administration believes that holding the Iraqis accountable ``doesn't allow us the flexibility and creativity that we need to move this forward.'' 
   You can be creative as you want, but unless the Iraqis know that there are consequences to not living up to their end of the bargain, American Soldiers, taxpayers will continue to make all of the sacrifices and bear all the costs. And that is unacceptable. 
   Optimism is not a strategy. Ignoring the facts and misleading the country is not a path to victory. 
   It is time for the Iraqi's to be held accountable, and to take charge of their own country. 
   And it is time that the President yield to the will of the Nation, and end our occupation of Iraq now.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, I rise in very strong support of this bill, and I want to thank Chairman Obey and Chairman Murtha for all of their hard work to put this legislation together. 
   I believe it is time to bring our troops home, to come home from Iraq, and I believe it is time for this Congress to support this legislation. 
   As the American soldiers begin their fifth year in this war of choice in Iraq, we confront the tragic fact that the Bush administration's preparation, planning and execution of this war has not kept faith with the enormous sacrifices our men and women in uniform and their families have made. 
   More than 3,200 American soldiers have died in Iraq, and close to 25,000 more have been seriously wounded. And Iraq is mired in a civil war, with tens of thousands of civilians killed, or even more internally displaced. Hundreds of billions of taxpayers dollars have been squandered in this war that has left our military readiness in jeopardy, the All-Volunteer Army is at a breaking point, and the world's faith in America's leadership is gravely shaken. 
   The American people recognize President Bush's approach in Iraq for what it is, a failure. That is why we sent a message to Washington this past November to change the course, to end this war, to get out of Iraq. That is what the American people said in November. 
   Instead, this President, in all of his arrogance and all of his lying, chose to choose a surge. 
   Well, the time is now for the Congress to do something about that because the American people do not support a war in Iraq, and has no end in sight, and continues the tragic, unnecessary loss of life. And given the President's unwillingness to change course, it is incumbent upon the Congress to act. With this bill the Democrats in Congress are taking a stand against the President on behalf of the soldiers in this country and the American people. 
   The bill before the House would protect our troops on the battlefield and at home, and require accountability from the Bush administration and the Iraqi Government, and set a responsible timeline for the phased redeployment of U.S. troops with a date certain by September 2008 at the latest. We must support this legislation. And again, I thank the authors of this legislation.  
   I rise in strong support of this bill and I encourage all of my colleagues who believe it is time for our troops to come home from Iraq to support it. 
   As American soldiers begin their fifth year of this war of choice in Iraq, we confront the tragic fact that the Bush Administration's preparation, planning, and execution of this war has not kept faith with the enormous sacrifices our men and women in uniform and their families have made. 
   More than 3,200 American soldiers have died in Iraq and close to 25,000 more have been seriously injured. Iraq is mired in a civil war, with tens of thousands of civilians killed and even more internally displaced. Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars have been squandered in this war that has left our military readiness in jeopardy, the all-volunteer Army at the breaking point, and the world's faith in America's world leadership gravely shaken. 
   The American people recognize President Bush's approach in Iraq for what it is--a failure. That's why they sent a message to Washington this past November to change course. 
   Americans do not support a war in Iraq that has no end in sight and continues the tragic and unnecessary loss of life. Given the President's unwillingness to change course, it is incumbent on Congress to act. With this bill, Democrats in Congress are taking a stand against the President but on behalf of our soldiers and the American people. 
   The bill before the House would protect our troops on the battlefield and at home, require accountability from the Bush Administration and the Iraqi government, and set a responsible timeline for a phased redeployment of U.S. troops--with a date certain, by September 2008 at the latest, for U.S. combat troops to be redeployed from Iraq. 
   Adoption of our plan is the answer to America's plea to bring this war to an end and turn away from the President's bottomless commitment to U.S. participation in the Iraqi civil war. Our plan provides a responsible, phased plan for requiring the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future. And voting yes on this bill will clearly show to the American people that a majority in Congress clearly stand with them in their desire to bring an end to the tragic U.S. occupation of Iraq. 
   My colleagues must understand that if they oppose the war, if they oppose spending more money on the war, if they oppose continuing the tragic loss of life in Iraq, then they must support this bill. 
   The only alternative to this bill that could garner enough votes to pass would be a supplemental appropriations bill to fund the war with no accountability, no timetables, and no end. That is the reality. 
   I know that the majority of the House opposes the continuation of the war. There are differences over strategy, on how best to achieve our goal on behalf of the country, on behalf of the soldiers, and on behalf of their families.  
   Defeating this bill would prolong the war. Defeating this bill would enable the President to continue to his irresponsible and deadly failures. Defeating this bill would send a message to the American people that Congress is not listening to them. 
   The President has run out of excuses for his failures in Iraq. 
   The American people have correctly run out of patience waiting for him to change course. 
   And America's soldiers have done everything asked of them and everything that could be expected of them. 
   It is time for a new direction. 
   The bill before the House provides a new direction for America. And it is the only bill that can take us in that direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him and all of the members of this committee for their work on the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. 
   This a very important piece of legislation, as so many of my colleagues have already testified to. We desperately need, in communities all across the country, the upgrade and the repairing of our Nation's wastewater infrastructure. There is not a congressional district in the country where we are not behind the curve on this effort. 
   I also rise because this legislation does continue the prevailing wage laws of this Nation, the Davis-Bacon law, which guarantees hardworking Americans, those who are working in Federal construction projects, will be paid a livable wage. 
   Today, we see report after report, economic study after economic study that talks about the precarious state of the American middle class, about how families are struggling to maintain their status in the middle class. It is one of the imperatives of this new Congress, of the Democratic majority, to grow and to strengthen the middle class; and, clearly, the wages that people pay will play a great part in that. 
   We should not have Federal dollars, Federal contracts and Federal projects, whether they are in conjunction with locales or not, undermining those livable wages. These wages are incredibly important to the American middle-class family. 
   We see now that the hardworking Americans and middle class, with the greatest productivity gains in recent history, are sharing the very smallest part of that increase in productivity than at any time in recent history. 
   It is imperative that we have today Davis-Bacon protections in this law. It is imperative that we have the Davis-Bacon protections for middle-class families in the country. 
   We know middle-class families now are constantly confronting the risk of what is happening to their pensions: Will they be funded? Will they be terminated? Will they be frozen? What is their ability to put away money in a 401(k) plan? What is their ability to purchase health care? How much more of the cost of that health care is going to be shifted from the employer to the employee? How much more of that are they going to be able to afford? 
   Maintaining good wages for good quality work is important to these families. It is important to these projects, and it is important to this Nation. 
   I commend the chairman for reporting this bill to the floor with these provisions in it, to ensure that we continue to grow and strengthen the middle class in this country.  
   Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. For over 75 years Davis-Bacon has guaranteed that hard-working Americans working on federal construction projects will be paid a livable wage. I am pleased that the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007 includes Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provisions and requires that prevailing wage rules be applied to all projects financed in whole or in part through State Revolving Fund programs (SRFs). I vehemently oppose any and all efforts that are intended to strip the prevailing wage provision and undermine the long-standing tradition of Davis-Bacon. 
   The Water Quality Financing Act of 2007 will be one of approximately 70 Federal laws that include a Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provision. Throughout these laws Davis-Bacon has infused fairness into Federal contract work; and it has protected contractors and workers from unjust treatment and unfair competition. 
   As more and more families struggle to pay the bills, it is critical now more than ever that we ensure hard-working Americans earn a livable wage. 
   On a bipartisan basis Congress has historically stood together in support of Davis-Bacon, recognizing the obligation that we have to ensure that Americans are paid a livable wage and to ensure the government does not operate to undermine those wages. As we consider H.R. 720 today we again have a moral obligation to stand up and set the example for how workers should be treated and the standard by which they should be compensated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank him and the ranking member for bringing this bill to the floor and certainly thanking the staff that has worked with all of the Members on this legislation. I think this is a very good bill. I think this bill reflects the priorities of America, that we would once again start reinvesting in the Clean Water Revolving Fund so that people and communities can meet their obligations for clean water. And as millions of Americans set out across America with their families to visit the national parks, this bill makes legislation about the importance of those national parks, about the value of those national parks and the importance that we lay out a plan over the next 10 years to restore them and to reinvest in them so that the visitors a decade from now will have the same experience or a better experience when they visit the national parks as people do today. 
   The national parks have far too much neglect in terms of the backlog of projects that need to be done, to enhance them, to improve them and to protect the national parks. The stateside of the Land and Water Conservation allows the Federal Government to be a partner with local communities on their priorities for the protection of open space and the enhancement of recreational opportunities, to improve the quality of life in our communities. We have seen this very, very successful program to enhance the communities, to enrich the experience for families in those communities. 
   Finally, I would say in the Indian education programs where again as Indian tribes and others have more and more say in the education of their young people, where they're bringing about very innovative programs, to see us again invest in those programs. What we see now is we have a record number of Indian children who have gone on to college, who are enrolled in college, who are getting advanced degrees. We've got to continue to improve that program and this legislation does it. 
   I also want to thank the committee for recognizing the Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Park. This is a park that's growing in popularity. It tells the incredible and magnificent story of the women who came to the shipyards in California to build the ships to win the war in the Pacific and what that meant to us as country, as a culture, what it meant to the integration of the workforce during World War II, and certainly what it meant in terms of supplying our troops with the materials necessary to win the war in the Pacific. 
   We have seen women from all across the country come with their daughters, with their granddaughters, with their great granddaughters and explain to them, this is where I worked, this is where we built and launched a ship a week in these shipyards. It's remarkable the ceremonies that are held there, to see these women, to come there and to leave their historical documents, to leave their letters home, to leave their welders' cards and their ironworkers' cards with the museum, and now we will be able to share all of that with the public as part of a greater effort in the National Park Service to develop the home front national park system all across the country where those who were on the home front during the war enabled us to successfully win and prosecute the Second World War. 
   I want to thank the committee and the members.

   I think it is just incredible that the other side of the aisle would argue, at a time when the most competitive and the most stressed oil market in the world, that what you need to develop oil leases offshore is to have government subsidies. At a time when you have national governments and international oil companies scouring the world to lock up resources, almost willing to do business with anybody in the world, doesn't matter if they are a dictator from the right or the left, at a time when countries are out trying to get their hands on these resources, we suggest the only way you can get people to drill in the most secure area of the entire world is to give them a subsidy. 
   The national security of the United States is the subsidy they get when they drill here. They do not need additional subsidies.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (RELATING TO SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank him and the Chair of the committee and Mr. Issa for all of their work on this legislation. 
   This legislation was drafted with the help and the cooperation of the Veterans Administration and the Office of Personnel Management and the Selective Service. 
   Current laws governing Federal employment do not draw a very clear distinction between those who do not register for selective service through an oversight and those who knowingly and willfully avoid registering. Under current law, we are lumping sort of the innocent along with the guilty, and this legislation is an effort by these agencies to correct what's wrong with this legislation and to make sure that we can protect those who do this in an unknowing fashion. 
   The bill sets out to correct this by exempting individuals from employment ineligibility who failed to register for selective service but were honorably discharged from active duty in the armed services. And second, it would allow current Federal employees who are at least age 31 to remain eligible for Federal employment despite their failure to register. And this would effectively change the lifetime ban from employment to a 5-year ban, which would coincide with the statute of limitations. So there would be the full ability to prosecute those individuals that we felt wrongfully failed to register for the draft. 
   This would have a big impact on the caseload, and it would also make sure  that we do not deny many of our agencies the talents and the abilities of individuals who have been caught in this conundrum that has taken place. 
   And this has been, after many months of negotiation, and Mr. Issa has been a vital part of these negotiations with Selective Service, with the Veterans Administration, and with the Office of Personnel Management, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I think it restores to law the intent for which it was passed and keeps us from punishing those individuals who are not guilty of knowingly refusing to register for the draft.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I want to thank my colleague from California for mentioning Mr. Frecking, because this was a case that really was just so absurd in how it was being played out because of the circumstances that he found himself caught in, but more importantly it also had the potential to deny the veterans service of the VA Hospital in San Francisco the very skilled talents of this individual. They went to bat. They recognized that they too had made a mistake, inadvertently they made a mistake. But they did not want to lose his skill and talents to our veterans coming through that hospital. And it was really at their insistence, their concern, that brought this case to the forefront and allowed us to be able to work it out with the Office of Personnel Service and Selective Service. 
   I know as we explained it, we talked about it back and forth, and Mr. Issa, at first I don't think he thought this could possibly be going on, but we convinced him that it was, and this is exactly the kind of case that this legislation is designed to address so we don't harm these individuals in the manner which was possible for Mr. Frecking.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS COVENANT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to congratulate her on this legislation. 
   This is an important piece of legislation, and I'm delighted that we were able to work it out in the committee on a bipartisan basis. And I want to thank all of the Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   Since the early 1990s, I've tried to bring legislation to the floor of this Congress to reform the abusive labor practices and the broken immigration policies of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, an American territory in the Pacific. 
   I sought these changes so that we could put a stop to the well-documented and widespread abuse of poor men and women in the garment and tourism industry in the CNMI and to better secure America's borders. But for more than a decade, a lobbyist by the name of Jack Abramoff joined then-Majority Leader Tom Delay and others here in Congress to block my reform efforts, even though they passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and in the Senate committee twice. 
   Ten years ago this month, in fact, Tom Delay visited the Mariana Islands and declared that our Federal reforms ``had no future'' as long as he was in control of the House of Representatives, but there is a new Congress in town. We have new Republican leadership and we have new Democratic leadership, and we're moving quickly under the leadership of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands to right the wrongs of the past. 
   Earlier this year, we raised the minimum wage across the country, and for the first time in almost a decade we gave the workers of the Northern Marianas a raise as well. Thanks to that minimum wage increase, workers in the Marianas make $3.55 an hour, up from barely $3 that workers were paid for these past years. And what's more, the minimum wage will continue to rise in the CNMI until their wage is equal to that of other American territories. 
   Today, my friend and committee colleague from the Virgin Islands has brought this legislation to the floor to fix the other long-standing problem in the CNMI. The broken local immigration program in the CNMI has allowed unscrupulous recruiters to exploit and abuse thousands of workers and their families, and it helped the CNMI's sweatshop-based economy to persist for decades. The legislation we are considering today brings the CNMI within the Federal immigration system so that we can put an end to that exploitation and abuse. The bill was drafted by the Bush administration and improved by the Natural Resources Committee. 
   I want to congratulate Chairman Rahall and Chairwoman Donna Christensen for bringing this legislation to the floor. As I said earlier, I also want to thank Congressman Conyers, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for helping to improve this. And I thank the cooperation of the Republicans, Don Young, and the subcommittee of the Resources Committee. 
   Today, Jack Abramoff is in prison and Tom Delay has resigned in disgrace. And today we pass a bill that restores the human rights to those individuals working in the CNMI. And today we strengthen the borders of America. 
   With these two pieces of legislation soon to become law, the minimum wage, which is already the law, and this legislation, to repair the immigration, I think now we can comfortably consider and support the notion of a delegate from the CNMI to the Congress. And I want to thank the gentlewoman for her persistence, the gentlewoman from Guam, and the gentleman from American Samoa for that effort. As they know, this is legislation that I have been deeply concerned about for a  very, very long time that unfortunately brought about a lot of bad practices in the CNMI. But I am convinced with this legislation that we're doing the right thing, and we can open a new chapter, hopefully, of economic prosperity and of representation for the CNMI in the Congress of the United States. 
   And again, I thank the gentlewoman very much for your tireless effort on this legislation.

   This is a bill that is designed for environmental education. I understand the gentleman doesn't like the bill. He voted against it in committee, one of the few Republicans that did. He doesn't like it. They are disappointed because we passed comprehensive energy reform and they have lost their energy debate. 
   But most importantly this: under this amendment, a school could not get money for environmental education. The Governors Association could not get money for environmental education, universities could not get money for environmental education, so who the hell would get the money for environmental education because  under this amendment the very organizations that are supposed to be developing the program are prohibited because they hire lobbyists. Yes, the Governors have a lobbyist; universities have a lobbyist; school districts have lobbyists for the State or what have you. They are immediately excluded. 
   So here we are again. The gentleman from Maryland has presented a comprehensive bill, a well-thought-out bill that has incredible support across the board by educational organizations and nonprofits and others who want to engage and step up the environmental education in this country. This amendment would absolutely prohibit these organizations from participating. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, finally, but 4 years too late, the Bush administration, with Vice President Cheney's trip to Afghanistan, has recognized that the real war on terror is not Iraq; that Iraq has been a diversion against that war on terror; that, in fact, the real war on terror is in Pakistan and Afghanistan and in the border area. They are starting to discover that the Government of Pakistan has not been our friend as we have tried to stabilize Afghanistan and the Karzai government, as we have tried to build democracy in Afghanistan, as we have tried to root out the Taliban and al Qaeda; that, in fact, because of the diversion and our early leaving of Afghanistan for Iraq, that we have now allowed the al Qaeda to come back in command and control and to build their membership, to recruit around the world. 
   We have seen the Taliban come back into Afghanistan and start to threaten and overturn village leaders and democratically elected leaders in villages in various parts of Afghanistan. Only now, 4 years too late, does the Bush administration recognize that this is the real war on terror, and they have failed to fight it, failed to deal with it and failed to prepare for it. -

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and I thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee for all of her work, as well as everyone on the committee, for bringing this bill to the floor of the Congress today.  
   I rise in support of this bill to authorize State and local governments to divest assets in companies that conduct business operations in Sudan, as well as to prohibit United States Government contracts with any such companies. 
   Several years ago I traveled with a bipartisan Congressional delegation to see firsthand the site of the ongoing genocide in Darfur, and to meet in person with the refugees--people displaced from their homes because of targeted political violence. At that time, 250,000 people had already been murdered or had died from subsequent malnutrition and disease. Another 2 million people had already been displaced. 
   I returned from that trip outraged with the conduct of the Government of Sudan. Not only did the Sudanese Government refuse to protect the innocent people caught between the rebels and the government, but it was also actively involved in the raping, maiming and killing of these refugees. 
   I returned with the hope that our Nation would do everything possible to bring this nightmare to an end. But not enough has been done. The murders and the rapes continue in Darfur, and in response, the American people want us to do more to help bring this genocide to an end. 
   Therefore, we in Congress must pass this bill today so that State and local governments will be able to divest from companies that continue their financial ties with Sudan. We must also ensure that the Federal Government is not complicit in the horrendous conduct of the Sudanese Government through our use of government contracts. 
   By passing this resolution, we will stand with the thousands of religious groups, churches, humanitarian and community organization, and State and local governments--all of whom are coming together to send a message about the ongoing genocide in Darfur--not on our watch.

I thank the chairman for yielding me this time, and I want to join with my colleagues in thanking him so much for all of his leadership on this legislation, his knowledge of the subject matter, and his ability to work out the intricacies in what may be the longest-standing battle in the Congress, and that is on fuel economies. But he has put together a standard that will work for the consumers, it will for the environment, it will work for the auto industry, and it will work for the people who work in that industry. 
   And, Mr. Dingell, I want to thank you for that. I also want to join in thanking the Speaker of the House of Representatives for making this her most important priority for this legislation, to give us an opportunity, this Congress and the American public, to break with the past, to break with the stranglehold of the old way of thinking both about our transportation sector and about our energy sector, to introduce into that sector the competition of alternative energy sources, of renewable energy sources, of efficient automobiles that will change America dramatically. 
   Whereas, we know, with this legislation, many have said it, by 2030 it will save almost 4 million barrels a day. That is almost the equivalent of the output of this entire Nation. You can keep thinking that you can produce your way out of this problem, but it has shown that we can't. We continue to become more and more reliant on questionable sources of energy, and yet this legislation itself will produce, just the automobile standards will produce half of what we import from the Persian Gulf. This changes that dramatically. You can find oil in conservation. You can find oil in Detroit. Or you can find it in the Persian Gulf. We chose to go in the smart direction, to think about conservation, not only its impact on energy, but on the environment and on the pocketbook of the American public. 
   Four million barrels of oil a day saved by 2030, five times the output of the Alaska pipeline today, five times. It is like finding money in the street and oil in the street. It doesn't mean we won't continue to produce, but it means we are going to be very smart about oil production in this country and about the use of energy on behalf of this Nation. 
   I also wanted to mention that we address the jobs that are going to be created by this commitment to renewables, this commitment to alternative energy sources, whether it is in nuclear, whether it is in coal, whether it is in the automobile industry or in the renewables sources, and that was the green jobs bill to provide training and expertise for people in solar panel manufacturing, construction work, and renewable energy and initiatives. Those are very important. Those were reported out of the Committee on Education and Labor and were championed by Congresswoman HILDA SOLIS and by Congressman JOHN TIERNEY on that legislation. 
   This legislation has a potential to create millions of new jobs in new industries of the future in every geographical sector of America, not just confined to the old centers of manufacturing, but all across this country for new high-skilled jobs for the future.

   Think how their lives would have been different if, for the last 7 years, instead of defending the subsidies for big oil companies, the tax breaks for big oil companies and the royalty holidays for big oil companies, the Bush administration and the Cheney administration had put their heads together and had thought about the future as opposed to the past. But when you have two oil men together in the Oval Office in the White House, they think about the past, and that is protecting the oil companies; it is not about the future. 
   Think if President Bush had come out for any increase in the mileage standards 7 years ago where we would have been, instead of defending for 32 years the right of the automobile companies to keep us away from more efficient automobiles. 
   But that would have been the future. The Bush-Cheney administration has never thought about the future; they have only thought about the past, and that has turned out to be terribly, terribly costly to the American consumer.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PENSION PROTECTION TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Ways and Means Committee for sheparding this bill, the Pension Protection Technical Corrections Act, to the floor. 
   The Pension Protection Act contained major changes to the funding rules for defined benefit pension plans. The final bill was over 900 pages long. 
   As can be expected with any massive legislative vehicle, the final law contained dozens of mistakes, some technical and some not so technical. 
   The bill before us today primarily fixes only the technical errors that have been found in the bill. It does not seek to make any changes in pension policy. 
   The bill was put together by the staffs of all the committees of jurisdiction, both in the House and Senate and on both sides of the aisle. The bill has been vetted by the key regulatory agencies--the Department of Labor, Treasury Department, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). 
   The bill mostly fixes incorrect punctuation and citations. It also contains a few substantive changes in places where the language of the PPA was unclear and clarification was needed for the agencies to be able to carry out the purposes of the law. 
   I would like to address some confusion created by the Treasury Department, in which it, as part of its PPA interpretation, provided guidance on the wear-away of workers' accrued pension benefits in cash balance plans. 
   An important part of the Pension Protection Act was to make clear that the wear-away of workers' benefits was illegal in cash balance plans, not only with respect to normal retirement benefits, but also with respect to early retirement benefits. As a political compromise, Congress made this rule prospective only, with the question of wear-away under the pre-PPA law to be decided by the Federal courts. 
   The Treasury Department issued a first ruling last year that undermined this carefully crafted compromise. Treasury recently issued new rules in which it indicated it will not rule on pre-PPA wear-away. There are many court cases pending on this matter and it must remain solely to the courts to decide whether pre-PPA pension law permitted employers to wear-away workers' otherwise legally protected accrued benefits. 
   Although I did not support the PPA, I hope that the House can pass these technical changes and then move on to the more pressing retirement issues of the day. 
   With the faltering economy and housing market crisis, more and more individuals are withdrawing their 401(k) pension monies in order to pay their mortgages and other bills. 
   These families are being forced to sacrifice their retirement security in order to survive day to day. 
   The Congress needs to address the real retirement security crisis facing working families. 
   The Pension Protection Act only made the problem worse. The law forced companies to speed up pension plan funding regardless of the financial status of the company or the pension plan. While faster funding had some superficial appeal, the real result is to encourage employers to terminate their pension plans or seek access to the accumulated assets. 
   Workers are increasingly dependent on 401(k) savings plans for their retirement security. 
   But as my Committee has found over the past year, 401(k) plans are being decimated by below average investment returns and excessive fees. 
   The Congress needs to start thinking about these more pressing issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the Chair, and I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman and Members of the House, it is disgraceful but true that in much of the United States, it is perfectly legal for employers to fire workers simply on the basis of their sexual orientation. 
   I am proud that today the House will vote on legislation to end this discrimination. It has no place in American society. 
   The legislation we are considering was first introduced in the House in 1975, more than 30 years ago, and in the last three decades, gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans have waged a courageous campaign for their workplace rights. I regret that they have had to wait so long for this vote, but I am pleased that this historic day has finally arrived. 
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act ensures that employment decisions are based upon merit and performance and not prejudice. Federal law and the laws of 30 States permit employers to discriminate against employees based solely on their sexual orientation. In those 30 States, employers can fire, refuse to hire, demote, or refuse to promote employees on the basis of sexual orientation alone. 
   Earlier this year, under Chairman Andrews, the Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee heard testimony from Michael Carney, a highly decorated police officer. Officer Carney was initially denied the opportunity to return to his job with the Springfield, Massachusetts Police Department because he is gay. Fortunately, Massachusetts is not one of the 30 States to deny these basic rights to gay workers, and Officer Carney was eventually able to return to his job. 
   But that was not the case for Brooke Waites, who testified at the hearing. Ms. Waites was fired from her job in telecommunications after her employer discovered that she was a lesbian. Since the State of Texas allows employers to fire workers based on sexual orientation, Ms. Waites had no recourse. She could not get her job back. 
   It's hard to believe that fully qualified, capable individuals are being denied employment or fired from their jobs for these completely nonwork-related reasons. This is profoundly unfair and certainly un-American. Unless we act to outlaw this discrimination, millions of American workers will continue to live with the legitimate fear that they could be fired or denied a job and wind up unable to provide for themselves and their families. That is why it is essential that this Congress act to protect the rights of all workers, regardless of their sexual orientation. 
   The Employment Non-Discrimination Act extends employment nondiscrimination protections to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual people. It prohibits employers, employment agencies, and labor unions from using an individual's sexual orientation as a basis for employment decisions such as hiring and firing, promotion, or compensation. The bill prohibits employers from subjecting an individual to different standards of treatment based upon the individual's sexual orientation. The bill does not apply to businesses with less than 15 workers, private membership clubs, or the U.S. Armed Forces. And it does not apply to religious schools or other religious organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Madam Chairman, I appreciate the frustration of my colleagues on the other side the aisle. They really don't like this bill. They don't believe that we should be outlawing discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals. What they are upset about is that most of the handles that they thought they could grab on to to destroy the consensus for this bill are gone. 
   Why are they gone? Because we went through a markup. We listened to our colleagues on the other side, and we made adjustments. We had a religious exemption in that many of the religious organizations strongly supported. We listened to the debate. We went back to them and suggested that a straight exemption from title VII would be preferable for all of those involved. 
   So we have continued to listen as that process has gone through. And, yes, we have a bill here now that is far more acceptable to far more Members of the Congress of the United States because it does what it says it is going to do. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS).

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 4 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in support of an amendment to this ENDA legislation that I and Mr. Stupak have written to ensure that this law will protect religious liberties of religious corporations, societies, associations, and in particular, religious schools, including those religious schools that are not affiliated with any particular church or denomination. Our amendment would make it clear that the ENDA exemption matches the religious exemption found in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Under my amendment, a religious corporation, association, or school would be categorically exempt from ENDA. 
   In addition, our amendment also clarifies that the references to the term ``married'' refer to the Federal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, as enacted in the 1996 Federal law referred to as the Defense of Marriage Act. 
   With respect to the religious exemption, this issue has been the cause of a lot of confusion in the past weeks. The religious exemption that was part of the ENDA bill that passed out of the Education and Labor Committee on October 18 was exceptionally broad; however, several nondenominational religious schools raised concerns that they might not be covered under the ENDA exemption. 
   For example, the president of Wheaton College in Naperville, Illinois, sent a letter to Representative TIM WALBERG in advance of the Education and Labor Committee's markup on ENDA. Mr. Walberg then shared that letter with the entire committee, and our Republican colleagues argued that Wheaton College, which is clearly a religious school despite the fact that it is not controlled by or affiliated with any specific church, may not be covered by the ENDA exemption. That argument was incorrect. 
   Wheaton, along with other religious schools and organizations such as the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, asked that we ``ensure that the act categorically exempts religious organizations as in section 702(a) of title VII,'' and we have done precisely what Wheaton College and the Council for Christian Colleges has asked us to do. 
   Under this amendment, if a religious organization, including a religious school, is exempt under either section 702(a) or the arguably broader section 703(e)(2), then that organization or school is exempt from ENDA, period. So, if a school qualifies for either one of those exemptions under title VII, it is categorically, as they requested, exempt from ENDA. By directly referencing title VII, we also ensure that the many decades of case law on title VII's religious exemption is imported to ENDA. 
   This amendment provides clarity for religious schools that have experience with the title VII exemption, and it should satisfy all of their legitimate concerns about ENDA. 
   Let me be clear, the title VII exemption, and therefore, the ENDA exemption, applies to both nondenominational religious schools like Wheaton and church-affiliated schools. And as one court explained, ``Even though a Christian corporation or organization is nondenominational, it nevertheless may subscribe to particular religious views with which other Christians do not agree, and conversely, it may disagree with the religious views of other Christians.'' And to go on, the court said, ``This is precisely the situation for which the title VII exemptions were enacted; the exemptions allow religious institutions to employ only persons whose beliefs are consistent with the views of the religious organization.'' And that is the purpose of this exemption. That is the purpose of this amendment. 
   In addition to clarifying the scope of the ENDA religious exemption, my amendment also specifically states that the references to marriage in ENDA refers to the definition of marriage as defined in Federal law. Specifically, these terms in ENDA are given the meaning provided by the Federal law that is referred to as the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for Federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman. That is the definition that applies to ENDA, and my amendment makes that definition absolutely clear. 
   Madam Chairman, because our amendment offers strong protections for religious organizations, including nondenominational or nonaffiliated religious schools, and because our amendment clarifies that the Defense of Marriage Act operates to define the term ``marriage'' in this bill, I trust that the Miller amendment will receive a large bipartisan vote in its favor. 
   Madam Chairman, I would like now to yield 4 minutes to my cosponsor of this legislation, Mr. Stupak.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chair and members of the Committee, I first want to correct some of the mistaken assumptions that I think Mr. Souder just made in his remarks. 
   He claims that the language of section 8(a)(3) would undermine the definition of marriage that some States have chosen to adopt. This is untrue. Even after ENDA becomes law, regardless of whether section 8(a)(3) remains in the bill or is taken out, the States, for purposes of State law, decide marriage issues for themselves. Nothing in ENDA would change that. Nothing in ENDA would alter the Federal laws referred to in the Defense of Marriage Act. 
   Second, Mr. Souder makes a claim that section 8(a)(3) would have prevented an employer from firing an employee who has extramarital sex. Frankly, I don't see anything in the text of 8(a)(3) that discusses extramarital sex. In fact, I don't see anything anywhere in the text of ENDA that discusses extramarital sex, and I can't understand how Mr. Souder's come to this conclusion about extramarital sex. But the entire issue is just a diversion from what ENDA actually does. 
   ENDA is very simple. ENDA will prevent employers from firing a perfectly qualified gay, lesbian or bisexual employee just because of that employee's sexual orientation. 
   Madam Chairman, in short, I will vote for this amendment, but the fact of the matter is I don't think it is necessary. But Mr. Souder has pursued this course, and I think that it's important. Another important provision of ENDA is the nondiscrimination section that already outlaws employers from discriminating based upon sexual orientation through any pretext policy including the pretext of marital status. 
   Moreover, many States, including Mr. Souder's home State in Indiana, have already created State laws that allow a plaintiff to sue their employer based upon marital status discrimination. And those State laws would further protect against pretextual discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans. 
   Finally, I want to explain in more detail why I will vote for Mr. Souder's amendment. I have realized that section 8(a)(3) is redundant. It is unnecessary. The concern that section 8(a)(3) has sought to address and will actually be addressed in many cases by section 4 of ENDA. 
   Let me explain this concern. When Mr. Frank and other original ENDA sponsors and I wrote this bill, we were worried that a clever discriminatory employer might realize he could not fire a gay employee specifically because of his or her sexual orientation, so the discriminatory employer might decide to create a pretextual reason for firing that person; in this case, the fact that the employee is not married or does not have the right to get married. That's why we drafted section 8(a)(3). 
   However, the thing that convinced me to vote for the Souder amendment is the fact that section 4 of ENDA, which my committee marked up and favorably reported, makes the Souder amendment practically irrelevant. Section 4 of ENDA is the portion of the bill that will very clearly prohibit the discrimination based upon sexual orientation. So if an employer is actually discriminating based upon sexual orientation, but is pretending that the decision is based upon marital status, the gay plaintiff will have the opportunity to convince a Federal jury of that fact. 
   Consider the following example: A large accounting firm that has no policy whatsoever about whether its accountants should be single or married. That's not hard to picture because not many accounting firms anywhere in America have a policy that requires an accountant to be married. Being a good accountant is the reason that they hire people. 
   Then imagine that one of the accountants in a branch office let's his coworkers know that he is gay. Now let's say that the branch office has a homophobic manager who the very next day sends out a memo announcing a new policy in the branch office that all accountants will have to be married to keep their job. The manager has figured out this new policy will allow him to fire gay or lesbian accountants, and it happens only to an accountant who is unmarried. 
   Also imagine that after sending out the memo, the homophobic branch manager sends an e-mail to some of his colleagues explaining: ``Now that we have our new marriage policy, we can fire that disgusting homosexual accountant.'' 
   That gay accountant will be able to file a lawsuit pursuant to ENDA. And that's the point of this legislation. They will be able to put evidence before a Federal jury and to try and convince them he was really fired because of sexual orientation, not because of marriage policy. And that is why this legislation exists.  
   My point of this scenario that I've just described to you is that already covered by section 4 of ENDA stating that the same thing of section 8(a)(3) is just redundant. For all of these reasons I will vote for the amendment offered by Mr. Souder. Even if 8(a)(3) is stricken from ENDA, I believe that the gay plaintiff will still be able to succeed in court and have a meritorious claim. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the mental health parity provisions contained in H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. 
   These important provisions of the bipartisan legislation would not have been possible without the vigorous advocacy of the late Senator Paul Wellstone and the continued dedication and commitment of Senator Wellstone's family. 
   In addition, I want to thank Congressmen KENNEDY and RAMSTAD as well as Senators KENNEDY and DOMENICI. Without their tireless efforts, these provisions would not be before us today. 
   Mental illness and substance abuse affect millions of families across this country. 
   Without treatment, those suffering from mental illness and substance abuse often struggle to hold a job or make ends meet. 
   Today, approximately 44 million Americans suffer from mental illness, but only one-third receive treatment. 
   A key component of this problem is that private health insurers generally provide less coverage for mental illnesses and substance abuse than for other medical conditions. 
   A 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation study found that, while 98 percent of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance had coverage for mental health care, 74 percent of those workers were subject to annual outpatient visit limits, and 64 percent were subject to annual inpatient daily limits. 
   The bill amends the Employer Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, to prohibit employer group health plans from imposing mental health or substance abuse treatment limitations, financial requirements, or out-of-network coverage limitations unless comparable limitations requirements are imposed upon medical-surgical benefits. 
   The out-of-network coverage provisions are particularly important. 
   Under this provision, if a health plan permits individuals to go to an emergency room for a medical condition without prior authorization; or an out-of-network hospital or treatment center at in-network rates for a medical condition, then the plan must apply the same rules to an individual suffering from a mental illness or substance disorder. 
   In addition, the bill does not require group health plans to provide any mental health or substance abuse coverage. 
   However, if the group health plan does offer mental health and/or substance abuse benefits, there must be equity between mental health and/or substance abuse coverage and all comparable medical and surgical benefits that the plan covers. 
   As a result, more Americans will be able to access affordable mental health and substance abuse benefits. 
   Nothing in the bill is intended to preempt stronger state mental health and substance abuse parity laws. 
   The Committee on Education and Labor has analyzed each state's mental health and substance abuse law; it is our understanding and intent that this legislation will not pre-empt any of these laws. 
   In other words, a state law that may contain broader or more favorable mental health and/or substance abuse benefit requirements will not be pre-empted. 
   Finally, this bill directs the Department of Labor to provide information and assistance to individuals, employers, and states in order to help them comply with the requirements of this law. 
   It is time to end the stigma and provide fair coverage to those in need.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (AIRLINE FLIGHT CREW TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, today, the House has an opportunity to restore Congress' intent to allow flight attendants, pilots, and reserve flight crew members to take unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 without fear of losing their jobs. 
   Passage of H.R. 2744, the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act, will ensure job protection for these workers when they need to time off to recover from an illness or care for newborn children or sick family members. 
   While millions of American workers are guaranteed up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave, narrow Department of Labor regulations have rendered more than 200,000 flight crew personnel unable to take advantage of the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   The problem is that flight crew workers are not paid or scheduled for work in the same manner as industries that are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Currently, the minimum threshold to qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act is based on working at least 60 percent of a normal 40-hour work week--or 1,250 hours annually. 
   However, most fulltime flight attendants' and pilots' work schedules are calculated based on their ``in-flight'' time--generally only those hours spent while the plane is moving. They are not paid for the time spent between flights or during layovers. 
   This means that an average flight attendant spends approximately 13 hours on-duty for every 5 hours of actual flight time. But only those 5 hours are counted towards their FMLA eligibility. 
   Work schedules for full-time flight attendants, pilots, or reserve personnel make it almost impossible to meet the minimum 1,250 threshold because of their unpaid time doing pre-flight and post-flight work activities.

   Work schedules for full-time flight attendants, pilots, or reserve personnel make it almost impossible to meet the minimum 1,250 threshold because of their unpaid time doing preflight and post-flight work activities.  
   On average, a flight attendant is scheduled for 960 in-flight hours each year, and according to FAA regulations, pilots are prohibited from flying more than 1,000 hours a year. 
   The legislative history is clear that airline attendants and pilots were meant to be covered when Congress enacted the original legislation in 1993. 
   The Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act clarifies that flight attendants and pilots are entitled the benefits afforded by the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   The legislation provides that airline attendants, pilots and reserve personnel meet the hours of service requirement in the Family and Medical Leave Act if they work or are paid 60 percent of the airline's monthly work schedule and if they work or are paid for at least 504 hours. 
   This number represents about 60 percent of the monthly work schedule of a typical airline. 
   Hard working flight attendants and pilots should be able to take needed family and medical leave, and they deserve the protection of the law in securing their jobs when they return from tending to their personal and family medical needs. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Timothy Bishop for introducing this important piece of legislation. I also thank the ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. McKeon, for working with us to help craft a true bipartisan bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act, named in honor of the late Paul Wellstone, who fought vigorously for better treatment for mental illness. 
   We in the Congress have known for many, many years, and so many of our constituents in our communities that we represent have known for so many years, the need for coverage for those individuals who need mental health treatment, whether it is for themselves or members of their family, and the difficulty in not only having coverage, but providing that care and to make sure that some form of that care is reimbursed. This has been a struggle for many years. 
   Today we address that struggle head-on with the consideration of this legislation, but we would not be standing here today without the efforts of Paul Wellstone and all of his efforts to rule out the discrimination against individuals in need of mental health services. He is joined in that fight, and they have led that fight, by Congressman PATRICK KENNEDY and Congressman JIM RAMSTAD. Again, we would not be here today debating this legislation and hopefully later this evening passing this legislation so that we can, for the first time, offer as a matter of national policy the idea that there would be parity in the coverage between physical illnesses and mental illnesses, to make sure that those people can get that coverage, can get the treatment that is necessary, can get the care that is necessary for them and for their families. 
   Yes, the fact is that a number of States have laws governing this treatment for mental illness and the reimbursement for those services, but Federal law still hampers the reach of many of those laws. And as a result, many of the people who would be otherwise covered are not covered, and they continue to suffer under those discriminatory practices, and they fail to  get the services that they need so they can live a better life and so their families can live a better life. 
   Today we get an opportunity because of the hard work, the efforts that Congressman Ramstad and Congressman Kennedy have made to travel this country, to talk in communities all across the country, to inform them and to discuss with them the possibilities of this legislation, what it would mean to individuals, what it would mean to families, what it would mean to the general health care in this country. They have taken on that mission, and they have convinced, I think, the vast majority of the country, and they have certainly enlisted those who understood the problem before their appearances that this is a problem that we need to address and we need to address now and we need to address in the most comprehensive fashion that we can. 
   This legislation doesn't do all that I would like to see it do. It doesn't do all that Congressman Kennedy or Congressman Ramstad would hope that it would do. And it doesn't do all that Paul Wellstone wanted us to do in terms of eliminating all of those discriminatory provisions. But it is a magnificent start, and we should begin by passing this legislation today. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for a unanimous consent request.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the typical income of American households has actually declined between 2002 and 2006 in inflation-adjusted terms. Last year, the number of Americans without health insurance actually increased by over 2 million. 
   For years now, Americans have had to deal with stagnating incomes and rising costs for basics like health care, food, energy and housing. For many reasons, Americans are deeply concerned about the future of their economy and their place in it. One cause of  their concern is the negative consequences they see from international trade. 
   Indeed, Americans find themselves increasingly caught in the crosshairs of the global economy. They have watched neighbors, friends and loved ones lose their jobs when plants close and move overseas. Americans have become even more skeptical about trade agreements, and for good reason. They have watched jobs move to China, and in return they get lead-poisoned toys. 
   Given these very real concerns, it is critical that we include in trade agreements strong and enforceable labor and environmental protections. And we must provide substantial assistance to workers who are negatively affected by this trade. 
   On the first part, I want to thank the committee for what they have done in terms of the trade agreements with these labor and environmental protections and I want to thank them for this legislation today. 
   This legislation we are considering addresses this very important point of what happens to those workers who have the negative consequences of international trade. This legislation helps ensure that displaced workers can help make ends meet while they find a new job, or in the case of older workers, until they reach retirement age. 
   The bill requires a layoff or plant closing notification if 50 or more employees, including part-time employees, at a single job site are laid off in a 30-day period. It eliminates a loophole that has allowed employers to avoid giving notices by shifting employees around job sites. 
   The bill increases notice to employees of a plant closing or mass layoff from 60 to 90 days, and that is very important. 
   And it also says that TAA-eligible employees can extend their COBRA coverage for as long as they remain TAA-eligible, up to 2 1/2 years. And TAA-eligible employees who are 55 years or older and who have worked for an employer for more than 10 years can extend their COBRA coverage until they are eligible for Medicare at age 65, or covered by another health care plan. The coverage is available to workers today, but only up to 18 months. The bill extends that provision. 
   This is the most important provision for those workers who lose their income and lose their job, trying to hold their families together, and also see the loss of their health care. COBRA is of no cost to the government. The employee must pay the employer share, the employee share, and the 2 percent administrative cost. Over 40 million Americans have used COBRA coverage. But in any given year, only 2 to 3 million Americans are on the program, and close to 200,000 people are losing that coverage every month. This is an important benefit to these workers and certainly to people who have preexisting conditions and know they will not be able to go in and find insurance that they can afford or that is even available to them. 
   It is important that we make certain that these older workers are able to bridge the time until they reach Medicare eligibility so they will have continuity of health care. 
   This is good legislation. I hope my colleagues on the floor will support this legislation.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   We could leave this to the marketplace, and you could throw your workers out on the street with no notice, no health care, no training, and that's it, and just tell them, welcome to the globalized world. 
   We thought we would try a different tack. We thought we would give workers notice where it is practical for employers to do so so the worker would have time to deal with the implications of a lost job on their family, to try to save their home, to try to save their kids' education, try to save the automobile, figure out how to get another job or how to get to retirement. 
   We also know that many workers that are released don't have health care coverage or can't get it in the marketplace. So we extended COBRA. We made that decision many years ago. Forty million people have used that to get them to another health care plan or to hold on to their coverage as long as they possibly could. We said for older workers, you can take it to Medicare. If you are over 55 years old and you have worked there 10 years, you can use COBRA. You pay all the premiums, you pay the administrative cost, but at least you have coverage. For some people, that's absolutely vital, because once they lose coverage, they can't get it again because they can't afford it or because they have preexisting conditions and they won't write that policy for those individuals. 
   This is just about whether or not we are going to treat Americans with some sense of decency who work all year long, provide for their families, work hard, play by the rules or whether they are just going to have to crash to the street and lose their income, their houses, their cars, their kids' education. That's the choice we get today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this substitute and in strong support of the underlying legislation. 
   I really want to say that I think that this is the bare minimum that a society and a government can do for those members of our society that find themselves in a situation, really through no fault of their own, that they suffer job loss because of a decision that is made to close a facility or to transfer their job overseas. 
   What we have now seen over the last decade is that there has been a huge impact in families all across this country, in all different parts of the region of this country, that have been economically severely displaced, that have had to scramble to try and get job training, to get health care, to get a new job, to get a new profession, to get a new occupation. At first, people thought it was only limited to those who did hot, heavy, dirty, nasty jobs. But that is not the case. What we see is, with the continued trend toward globalization and outsourcing, that it can impact all different classes of Americans. 
   But at a minimum, what we ought to do is make sure that those people have some ability to make a transition to that new job, to that new profession, to retirement if they are older workers, and not risk losing everything that they built up during the time that they were holding their jobs. They should not be in a position where they are scrambling to try to find health care, job training, saving their home, maybe their kids' education, and maybe even the car they need to go to work. Too often, that is what happens in this country because of the inadequacies of these underlying laws. Trade assistance over the last decade, WIA over the last decade, have not provided comprehensive services for these workers that they can fully engage in.     
   We need these kinds of changes that are presented by the committee bill coming out of Ways and Means. I believe we need the notification provisions that came out of the Education and Labor Committee, and clearly we need an extension of the COBRA benefits for people who find themselves in great jeopardy of not only temporarily losing health care, but very likely permanently losing health care until they are eligible for Medicare because they may have health conditions that are preexisting and it is either so expensive to get an individual policy or people won't write that policy for them, for whatever excuses they have to cover up the idea of a preexisting condition. 
   So this is a basic fundamental compact between this government that has made a decision, I think properly so, to engage the rest of the world through trade agreements and globalization, but we have to look at what happens here at home. These trade agreements are now being strengthened through the good work of Mr. Rangel and the committee and Mr. Levin and others, to provide for ILO labor standards overseas so we can compete on a fairer basis with workers overseas, with environmental standards so we don't let them subsidize products by just dumping toxins into the rivers and bays and oceans.  
   This is an important piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, a bill to respond to what could be one of the worst financial crises to face our country. 
   Just over 10 days ago, in response to this crisis, President Bush asked Congress to immediately approve a 2 1/2 -page plan to grant never-before-seen powers to the Secretary of the Treasury to spend a staggering $700 billion in taxpayer money to bail out Wall Street firms, with no strings attached, no accountability, and no guarantee of success. 
   This President, who has overseen one of the worst economic records in American history, asked us for a blank check. 
   The Speaker of the House, my colleagues, and I said, ``No.'' We rejected his blank check plan. 
   But we did not dismiss the need to take action on behalf of American workers and families already hurt by our economic problems and who would be severely hurt further if this financial crisis becomes a full scale economic meltdown. 
   Instead, we said that if we are to rescue failing institutions because it is in the public's interest then we must ensure that the plan protects the taxpayer and holds officials accountable. 
   The plan that we are voting on today is a far cry from what we were first asked to approve. It is the result of hundreds of hours of negotiations between the House, the Senate, and the White House and between Democrats and Republicans. 
   The result is a plan that: 
   Provides money to rescue firms in stages, not all at once; 
   Limits the compensation of CEOs whose firms the government rescues. No more golden parachutes for Wall Street tycoons who get government assistance. 
   Provides immediate and ongoing tough oversight by independent boards including the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office; 
   Gives taxpayers ownership of the companies that they would rescue, giving them a share of the profits in those companies; 
   Helps families going through foreclosure, and; 
   Provides a mechanism for paying for any losses the taxpayer might face from this plan. 
   You would think that these protective measures would have been obvious to the President when he asked us to approve his plan. 
   The fact is, Democrats in the House and Senate had to fight for them. We had to fight to limit CEO pay for rescued firms. We had to  fight for tough oversight. We had to fight to give taxpayers ownership of the companies we help. And we had to fight to get some mechanism of paying for this plan. 
   So, with great deliberation and a lot of hard work, we made this a much better bill. 
   This bill does not have everything in it that I or others here wanted. It is a compromise. But it is a compromise that I believe is far preferable to the alternative of not acting at all. 
   The American economy is in its weakest condition in many, many years. Rising unemployment, stagnant and declining wages, record high energy costs, and soaring food prices. 
   Mortgage foreclosures continue to rise and home values continue to decline. 
   Fundamental investments in our economy remain unmet--for health care, aging roads, bridges and schools, new energy sources and energy conservation, and for education. 
   Amidst this economic crisis we face the potential for a sudden meltdown of our nation's financial markets of a magnitude that few of us have ever seen in our lifetime and that would reach into every corner of our nation and further weaken the living standards of every American. 
   No one can say with certainty, but if you believe the experts' predictions the collapse of the financial markets will not just result in the bankruptcy of banks and other firms on Wall Street. 
   The financial collapse would cripple the credit markets and would prevent the economy from growing, hurting Americans' ability to borrow at reasonable rates to make payroll at small businesses, invest in new equipment, borrow for college, take out a mortgage, start new businesses, or buy new cars. It would hurt our ability to create new jobs. 
   As we are seeing in California, school districts, counties, and cities are losing millions of dollars because of the collapse of Wall Street firms in which they held investments. 
   The question of whether to help rescue Wall Street firms and stabilize the credit markets is daunting and one that I know each of my colleagues is considering with greatest sense of caution, obligation and responsibility. 
   Americans are furious with the CEOs of Wall Street, and they have every right to be. Just as they should be furious with 8 years of the Bush Administration and 12 years of the Republican-led Congress that did nothing but cut taxes for the rich and help Wall Street with deregulation of the banks and provide no oversight from Washington. 
   With the Republicans' help, the barons of Wall Street have taken the upside of the economy with relish. They invented and mastered the golden parachutes and eye popping executive compensation schemes that have created their own economic class in our country. 
   They created new, complex financing mechanisms that were beyond even their own understanding and they violated every common sense rule of corporate transparency and financial soundness. 
   Armed with their powerful lobbyists, Wall Street cunningly held off fair regulations by Congress, arguing that left to their own devices Americans would be better off. 
   The American people are the victims of this go-go, Wild West approach to governing. 
   Well, the damage is done, and the damage is devastating. And now, the party is over. 
   Congress and the American people are going to have to step up to the plate and right the pieces. It will not be easy. 
   But the taxpayers should not be asked to do so without the protections that we have fought to include. 
   That is our primary concern--the American people who have had to withstand a devastating economic downturn during the last eight years, who had to shoulder the mounting costs of bailing out one large bank or financial firm after another, and who have not had anyone come to their own rescue when times got hard. 
   This bill is intended to stabilize the credit markets, slow the decline of foreclosures, slow the decline in home values, and begin to free up credit so that the economy can have a chance to grow. 
   Based on what I have learned from a wide range of experts across the country, I believe the financial crisis is real and that the consequences of not acting now will be far, far worse for average Americans than if we do nothing at all. 
   This bill is not just about trying to prop up the stock market. Markets will rise and fall for a variety of reasons. But the dramatic decline in the stock market clearly hurts tens of millions of Americans with pension funds, retirement accounts, college funds, and other savings that are invested in the stock markets. 
   What we are attempting to do is stabilize the credit markets because that is what fuels our economy and creates jobs and good incomes. The crisis that started on Wall Street does not end on Wall Street, it ends on Main Street, in every small town and big city in our country. 
   If this bill were just about Wall Street, given their behavior, I wouldn't walk across the street to save them. But this is really about our communities and families and people's access to credit, and jobs and economic growth. This is an important step but clearly much more needs to be done to create jobs and try to stop the slide in home values. 
   For example, the House passed a bill to spend $60 billion quickly on a stimulus plan, for infrastructure and unemployment insurance. The Administration has opposed it and has threatened to veto our plan. 
   Our plan would have created good paying jobs in California and in America, providing an infusion of money for mass transit, highways, water projects, bridges, water recycling, and broadband technology, all of which are an investment in the economic future of America. 
   The President is wrong to oppose this. At a time of rising unemployment, it is unfortunate that the President has opposed us and refuses to support our investment plan. But I will continue to fight for our economic plan that is essential to our long-term economic recovery. 
   I have fought to protect homeowners, taxpayers and consumers. I urge my colleagues to support this plan and to continue to work together to make further investments in the economy that are crying out for our approval to get America moving forward and get Americans working again.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the chairman for yielding and thank him for bringing this legislation to this floor. I'm honored to be a cosponsor of this legislation along with Mr. Rahall and Mr. Green. 
   I rise in very strong support of this comprehensive, forward-looking bill that will provide relief at the pump, create good jobs here in America, and finally put our Nation on a path toward a clean and more independent energy future. Surely that is something that we could all support. 
   Americans understand the problem. Our Nation is addicted to oil. Consumers are paying record prices to heat and cool their homes and to drive their cars and trucks. Global warming is real; it's serious and a growing problem. Meanwhile, oil companies are making more money than ever before. That's why Democrats made energy a top priority when we took back the House and Senate last year. 
   We raised auto fuel economy standards for the first time in a generation, overcoming the objections of the auto and oil industries and the Republicans in Congress and the White House. And we passed one bill after another to improve America's energy policy to expand wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources, to increase the efficiency and conservation, to curb speculation and energy markets, and to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and to recoup tens of billions of dollars that oil companies have unfairly taken from the taxpayers as they've exploited the taxpayers' resources on our public lands. 
   Every bill we passed was opposed by a majority of the Republicans in Congress and by President Bush. And at the end of all of their objections, gas rose to $4 a gallon. Think how different this debate would have been if in the previous decade when the Republicans controlled this House and the 8 years when they controlled the White House and the Congress if they had pushed forward on energy in those days. Think how different the automobile industry would have been today had they not caved in to the oil industry and the auto industries and moved those standards. But no, it took 30 years, and we did it in this Congress with the Democratic leadership. 
   Think how different this discussion would be on renewables and alternatives if the Republicans had chosen that. But no. Every time they brought an energy bill to the floor, they looked to the past. They said that we could drill our way out of this problem, we're just another drop of oil away from the problem. And at the end of that decade, we ended up more dependent upon foreign oil than at any other time in our history. 
   So that's why we're here today. We're here to help consumers, to drive down the price of energy, to expand the energy resources in this Nation that are available to all consumers all across the country, and to create good American jobs in the process of doing that and to put us on that path to energy independence and to greater diversity in our sources of energy. 
   We are not going to succumb to the old interests that tell us we have to continue to give away the public's resources and not provide the royalties that the public is entitled to, that the public, with all due respect, in most every other nation in the world gets when they give their resources to be exploited. 
   We're going to stop the days of the royalty holidays, royalty holidays for oil companies that are making record profits because of their record ingenuity and their skill and their talent. But the fact of the matter is there is no royalty holiday for the ratepayers, for the people paying at the pump, for people trying to heat and cool their homes. And that's why this legislation must pass because this legislation speaks to the future, to a sustainable and renewable energy policy for this country for the first time in over a decade.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the Chair. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Rules Committee for bringing this resolution to the floor so we can debate on the energy bill and vote on the energy bill later today. And I rise in very strong support of this comprehensive, forward-looking bill that will provide relief at the pump, create good jobs in America and finally put our Nation on a path toward a clean, more independent and sustainable energy future. Surely that is something that all of us can support. 
   America understands the problem: Our Nation is addicted to oil. Consumers are paying record prices to heat and cool their homes and drive their cars and their trucks. Global warming is a real, serious and growing problem. Meanwhile oil companies are making more money than ever before. 
   That is why Democrats made energy a top priority when they took back the House and the Senate last year. We raised the fuel economy standards for the first time in 30 years, overcoming the objections of the auto industry, the oil industry, the Republicans in Congress and the White House. And we passed one bill after another to improve America's energy policy and its energy future, to expand wind, solar and other renewable energy sources, to increase the efficiency and conservation and our use of energy, to curb speculation in the oil markets so consumers would not be ripped off by the oil speculators, to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so that small businesses, truckers and airlines would not be thrust into economic hardship and to recoup tens of billions of dollars from the oil companies that are unfairly taken from the taxpayers. All of these are thrusting America into the future with respect to its energy resources, its supply and its usage. 
   But every bill was opposed by a majority of the Republicans in Congress and by President Bush. This is sort of the Goldilocks of the energy debate, too much wind, not enough solar; too much solar, not enough energy; too much going after the speculators, not enough going after the oil companies; too much going after the oil companies, not enough for the energy industry. They could never get it right. And they could never support an energy bill. And they have never been able, in all the time they controlled this Congress, to move America into the future of energy, to move America into renewables, to move America into efficiency. They voted against it all. And they didn't propose it. And at the end of their decade in Congress, gas was $4 a gallon. They controlled the White House, and they controlled the Congress. At the end of their decade, gas was $4 a gallon. 
   So what are we able to do here today? We're able to help consumers and the taxpayers by ending the subsidies to oil companies, subsidies that President Bush said were obsolete at $50 a barrel. Well they are certainly obsolete today at $100 a barrel or $90 a barrel or $140 a barrel. But the Republicans are going to hold to those subsidies. We are going to end the royalty holiday, a holiday for oil companies where they don't have to pay royalties. Where is the holiday for consumers? Where is the holiday for the person commuting to work? Where is the holiday for the person heating their home? Not from the Republicans. They fought tooth and nail. The President fought tooth and nail to hold on to those royalty holidays. 
   And finally we are talking about creating jobs for Americans here at home in green industries and the renewable energies of the future, in the efficiencies of the future. That is what the American energy future looks like. And that is what this Congress is going to be able to vote on. And that is what the American people are going to get as a result, a bright, renewable, smart energy future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, because our country urgently needs to create new jobs and provide vital relief for struggling families to get our economy moving forward again, I rise in strong support of our economic stimulus package, H.R. 7110. 
   Our economy needs two things right now to help workers and families. First, we must restore the confidence in the credit markets, confidence that was destroyed by the reckless lending and risk-taking by banks and Wall Street institutions and the failure of the Bush administration to properly police and regulate those financial markets on behalf of the taxpayers. 
   We must revive the credit markets to help the economy grow again and create jobs so that Americans can borrow at a reasonable rate to make payroll at small businesses, invest in new equipment and inventory, borrow for college education, start a new business, buy an automobile or protect their pensions. 
   Wall Street and Main Street are joined at the hip. We all share an interest in helping to restore the confidence in these markets that have been so battered by the lack of regulation over the last several years. 
   Secondly, we must invest directly in new infrastructure, roads, bridges, mass transit, clean water and new schools to get America working together, to create good, well-paying, good-paying, middle-class jobs for Americans all across this country. 
   Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their jobs so far this year. The unemployment rate continues to go up month after month after month as people are looking for jobs to support their families. 
   Our economic recovery package will yield immediate results, helping to get more Americans back to work. It provides for long overdue investment of $3 billion to repair crumbling schools and help children, while also creating construction jobs; much-needed support for millions of unemployed Americans through extending the unemployment insurance benefits to help cover the basic living expenses of them and their families; a $500 million investment in job training programs to prepare workers for new jobs; to create new recycling projects that are so desperately needed in the parts of our country that are now in persistent drought conditions, and we need to use water more efficiently so that we can continue to have economic growth and the growth of jobs.

   We are not only falling behind the competition in terms of intellectual property, in terms of intellectual capital and science and engineering, we are falling behind in the basic infrastructure that is needed for this country to compete with the rest of the world in the movement of goods, in the education of our children and the improvement in our water systems and the infrastructure of our cities. 
   This is an urgent piece of legislation, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. I want to thank Mr. Kildee for his authorship of this legislation for over, I believe, 12 years now in support of this legislation, and Mr. Duncan, his cosponsor, for the same years, to try and provide for the organization of our public safety officers around the country. 
   I want to thank Mr. Keller for his work on the subcommittee and Mr. Andrews for shepherding this bill through the committee. With the 280 cosponsors of this legislation, which obviously represents very strong bipartisan support, this legislation clearly demonstrates that this Congress is committed to protecting the rights and the livelihoods of our first responders, and this legislation stands in tribute to these dedicated men and women. I am proud that the Education and Labor Committee was able to pass H.R. 980 out of the committee almost unanimously by a vote of 42-1. 
   Firefighters, police officers, correction officers and emergency medical technicians risk their lives each and every day to protect our lives and this country. H.R. 980 will ensure that all public safety officers have a right to sit down with their employers and bargain over wages and working conditions. 
   While States and cities and towns have historically managed their own labor relations, approximately 28 States do not fully protect the collective bargaining rights of public safety employees. That is why this legislation is so necessary. This legislation would respect those States that already provide for collective bargaining rights for public safety employees, but it would extend those rights in all other States. 
   The bill would provide basic labor protections for State and local public safety workers, including the right to join a union, the right to have their union recognized by their employer, the right to bargain collectively over hours, wages, terms and conditions of employment, a mediation or arbitration process for resolving the impasse in negotiations, and enforcement through the courts. 
   H.R. 980 will give public safety officers a voice in issues like safety on the job and effective delivery of services. It will improve communications and cooperation between rank-and-file public safety employees and their employers, ensuring a more cohesive and coordinated operation.     
   That's the crux of this legislation. This gives the rights of these negotiations, the rights of these discussions, the rights to have a union, to the very same people that we trust every day to protect our lives, to protect our communities, to protect our country, both before and after a terrorist attack, before and after a criminal act. These are the people that we trust to do this. 
   This legislation, under the authorship of Mr. Kildee and Mr. Duncan, also suggests that we trust them to have a responsible say in their workplace conditions, in how they carry out their job, to make suggestions, to negotiate with their employers, to more effectively carry out their duties. I think it is a long time coming. I think this legislation and its very broad cosponsorship indicate this could have been done much sooner, but it is going to be done today. It is going to pass the House today. I believe it will pass with large bipartisan support. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I also want to say that the fact that this legislation is here today, although 12 years late, is maybe a hallmark of Mr. Kildee's career, and that is persistence. He doesn't give up on an idea because others disagree. He has pushed for this legislation year in and year out. He was not allowed to have it heard for passage, and this year we were able to accommodate him and Mr. Duncan. When we do that, we are also accommodating and supporting our first responders all across the country who need these rights to better do the job that we have handed to them, a very difficult, a very dangerous job. I would hope that the House would pass this legislation overwhelmingly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the Chair. 
   Under this amendment, what this amendment says is that the National Labor Relations Board could not enforce the party's obligation to bargain in good faith following a voluntary recognition. So an employer and an employee can get together, they can voluntarily enter into an agreement by which they have their working relationship, and if they're down the road at some point, one of them wants to bring an action, the employer against the employees or the employees against the employer for not bargaining in good faith, the National Labor Relations Board couldn't enforce that, couldn't take any action. 
   This is a voluntary agreement. It doesn't even have to be through the card check process. Any voluntary agreement, you're suggesting that somehow these people would not be able to enforce that agreement once it was entered into. 
   This undermines the rights of potentially millions of American workers that have already organized under voluntary recognition agreements and already engaged in a collective bargaining relationship. These workers may have decades long collective bargaining arrangements already that they have worked under, and then if the most recent contract expires, they would have no enforceable right to go back and enforce their rights under the Souder amendment. 
   This makes no sense. It's rather incredible to me that under the Souder amendment what we would be doing is inserting the government in a private voluntary agreement between an employer and an employer. I understand the gentleman doesn't like card check, but that's not what this is about. This is about any voluntary agreement that they've entered into, and I don't know why we would be inserting the government at this point. 
   Madam Chairman, at this point, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, let me just reiterate again, and my two colleagues have said this. Under existing law today, if the employer doesn't like the agreement, the voluntary agreement, or if employees come to them and say, gee, we all want to join a union, here's a majority, whatever it is, the employer says, no, game is over, it's off, it's done. He has a veto, absolute veto, it's over. So the only way you can have this voluntary agreement is if the employer is happy with it. 
   So, now we have an agreement where the employer's happy, the employees are happy, and they work under it for a number of years, but you cannot ever go and seek enforcement. So apparently what the gentleman is doing, he's just decided he's going to insert the government for only one purpose, and that's the purpose to destroy basic worker rights and the ability to organize the workplace, even if they do it voluntarily and with the consent of the employer. 
   Now, I know the gentleman's always believed in limited government, and I know the gentleman doesn't think the government should interfere in all these contractual arrangements. Here's a voluntary arrangement and you're going to insert the government for one purpose, to deny the employees their rights under the voluntary agreement which they entered into with an employer who had the veto if he didn't want to enter into it. They can't coerce him into doing it. He has the veto. We should reject this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5522, the Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008. 
   On February 7 of this year, a huge explosion ripped through the Imperial Sugar refinery in Port Wentworth, Georgia. Eight workers died instantly, and five more have died in the months since the explosion from the horrific  burns that they suffered. More than sixty workers were injured, some so seriously that they will never fully recover. This was a terrible disaster, one of our Nation's worst workplace tragedies of the past decade. 
   The cause of the explosion was combustible sugar dust. It may surprise many of us that sugar dust can explode with such violence. But it can, and so can many other dusts that are commonly found in U.S. industrial sites. 
   In 2003, three fatal dust explosions occurred in the United States, killing 14 workers. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board investigated these incidents. The board examined whether these tragedies were just coincidences or a major national problem. The Chemical Safety Board also examined whether there were adequate laws to protect workers or whether new protections were needed. The Chemical Safety Board found that these explosions were not coincidences. In fact, between 1980 and 2005, 119 workers had been killed and 718 injured in dust explosions that had also extensively damaged the industrial facilities. The Chemical Safety Board also found that there were no enforceable national regulations to prevent combustible dust incidents. Let me repeat that. The Chemical Safety Board also found that there were no enforceable national regulations to prevent combustible dust incidents. 
   The Chemical Safety Board concluded that controlling combustible dust explosions isn't a mystery. In fact, the first National Fire Protection Association standards to prevent combustible dust explosions were issued in 1923. In November of 2006, the Chemical Safety Board, an independent Federal agency whose members were all appointed by President George W. Bush, concluded that the only way to prevent more worker deaths was for OSHA to issue a comprehensive standard covering combustible dust. That was in November of 2006. But to this day, OSHA has taken no action to issue a standard. In fact, OSHA has refused to act despite the fact that 70 more combustible dust explosions have occurred since 2006. 
   Even now, after 13 needless deaths in Georgia, OSHA demonstrates no understanding of the urgency of this problem. This is a shocking failure by the very governmental agency responsible for keeping workers safe. 
   Sadly, this isn't the only time that OSHA has failed to act on a Chemical Safety Board recommendation, and it's not the only time where the result of that inaction has been the death of American workers. The Chemical Safety Board warned OSHA in 2002 that new rules were needed to prevent reactive chemical explosions, but OSHA refused to act. Then last December a reactive chemical explosion in Jacksonville, Florida, killed four workers. 
   Because OSHA refused to act, Congress must now act. Congressman John Barrow and I have introduced H.R. 5522 to force OSHA to do the job it should have done on its own. The legislation will require OSHA to issue an interim standard on combustible dust within 90 days and a permanent standard within 18 months. It would require OSHA to base the new standard on the National Fire Protection Association standards. 
   OSHA says that the combustible dust hazards are already covered by numerous existing regulations. But that simply is not true. Most of the existing standards do not even mention the word ``dust'' and do nothing to educate or inform employers and employees how to prevent combustible dust explosions. Existing OSHA standards also do not address what levels of dust are safe, how to clean the dust safely, or how to prevent dust from accumulating to unsafe levels. 
   And it is not true, as opponents of this bill say, that we don't allow for public input. In fact, OSHA would have to conduct full public hearings and a small business review but to do so on an expedited basis that reflects the life-or-death urgency of this issue. 
   Because of the serious hazards imposed by combustible dust, because OSHA has issued no major standard during this administration except under pressure of the courts or the Congress, and because OSHA is unable to meet the regulatory deadlines it sets for itself, it is necessary to set some tight deadlines for action. 
   It is also not true that this bill requires OSHA to adopt the National Fire Protection Association standards. The bill requires OSHA to include only the relevant and appropriate provisions of the National Fire Protection Association combustible dust standards. While the National Fire Protection Association standards have proven to be effective, OSHA should use its discretion, after full public hearings and comments, to determine how the National Fire Protection Association guidelines should be used in a final standard. 
   You will hear opponents of this measure say we should wait until the OSHA investigation is completed and the results of OSHA's current National Emphasis Program are in. But we have waited long enough. And, in fact, again, the Chemical Safety Board recommendations predate that accident based upon the urgent need for these regulations to save American workers' lives and to prevent their injuries prior to that time. 
   Again, if OSHA doesn't act, we must. We know that most businesses are doing the best they can to make their workplace safe. But it is also clear that other businesses may not be doing enough to ensure the safety of their employees. The bottom line is that workers need protection and the agency established by Congress 37 years ago to protect workers has once again failed in that duty. 
   The goal today is to protect workers from those preventable explosions, and we believe that this legislation accomplishes that goal without imposing unreasonable burdens on employers. 
   I want to leave the House with the closing words of a witness who appeared before the Education and Labor Committee, Tammy Miser. Tammy Miser's brother, Shawn Boone, was killed in a combustible dust explosion in 2003. Tammy recounted the terrible suffering that her brother went through before he died, her hopes that something would happen after the Chemical Safety Board recommendations were issued, and her disappointment that OSHA has yet to act, even after the Imperial Sugar explosion. 
   Tammy left us with this one request: ``that you not let our loved ones die in vain and help us keep other families safe from the dangers of combustible dust.'' 
   It's the least we can do for Shawn Boone, the workers in Port Wentworth, and the many other workers who have needlessly lost their lives. 
   Madam Chairman, I strongly urge that all of my colleagues will support H.R. 5522. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   This manager's amendment is offered because during the drafting and the refining of this bill we have had numerous extensive conversations with OSHA, with its technical staff and with affected industry associations about problematic issues. Our goal is to save workers lives, but also make these OSHA standards workable for businesses who need to implement them. To that end, the manager's amendment makes four adjustments to the bill: 
   One, several industry associations were concerned that the short 1-month effective date on the interim standards was too short to make some of the capital improvements that may be needed for engineering controls. The manager's amendment therefore provides for engineering controls required by  the interim standards shall be effective 6 months after the issuance of the standard, rather than 30 days. 
   Because emphasizing specific National Fire Protection Association standards was seen as putting more emphasis on some than on others that were not mentioned, the manager's amendment maintains the provisions that OSHA shall include appropriate and relevant National Fire Protection Association standards in its final standards, but eliminates reference to specific National Fire Protection Association standards. 
   Then, because we want to make perfectly clear that OSHA is expected to conduct a full review of small business impacts of this standard, the manager's amendment clarifies that the final standard shall be conducted in accordance with the usual rulemaking procedural requirements, including those that provide for a small business review. 
   Finally, it changes the title to ``The Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosions and Fires Act.'' 
   I would encourage all of my colleagues to support the manager's amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment is an attempt to gut this legislation. This amendment would have OSHA not only wait for the outcome of the Imperial Sugar investigation, but also from findings from the combustible dust National Emphasis Program before deciding on whether or not to move forward. The National Emphasis Program could go on for years before there are findings. In fact, at the end of the day, OSHA could decide to do nothing. 
   To do nothing has turned out to be very expensive for the American workers in those workplaces where there is combustible dust. The track record is horrible with respect to OSHA preventing these dust explosions from taking place. That is the reason that prior to the most recent explosion that Mr. Barrow and I are trying to address, prior to that, the Chemical Safety Board made a recommendation to OSHA that they should promulgate these enforceable regulations, because there are no enforceable regulations with respect to dust currently in effect, except for what we did years ago in the grain industry.     
   Except for what we did years ago in the grain industry, and that dramatically reduced the number of incidents that took place. So to adopt the Wilson amendment is to adopt a position to do nothing, and to take an agency that has chosen time and again to do nothing in this field that any way provides for enforceable regulations of this most dangerous material when the workplace is not properly maintained and preventible actions are taken. That is just not acceptable. That is not acceptable in the name of the workers who died in the Port Wentworth plant. It is unacceptable to the workers who died earlier from the explosions. 
   OSHA has refused to act. They have not acted on a single standard in the entire last 8 years unless they were prodded by the Congress or the courts. So to now say that you are going to take the lives of American workers and you are going to give those lives again back to OSHA, where they have not seen any hazard, they have not seen any danger in spite of the explosions is just the height of irresponsibility by this Congress. And I would hope that the Congress would overwhelmingly reject this amendment that allows OSHA to continue the status quo that allows OSHA to continue its irresponsible position. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would just note that a significant number of the signatories to the letter that was referred to by my colleague on the other side of the aisle really have little or nothing to do with these standards or are impacted by them. And this is the same coalition that continues to call for no action with respect to actions by OSHA, and it is that approach to the protection of American workers and to the safety of those workers that has led to the tragedy that we witnessed at the Imperial Sugar facility. And, clearly, these are accidents that we know are preventable, that we know we can dramatically reduce because we have the experience from the grain dust standards. 
   This legislation is designed to be workable. It was worked, as I pointed out, with numerous conversations with the technical staff of OSHA, with the affected industries and the trade associations that are involved with this. 
   I would note that the National Fire Protection Association, when we tell OSHA that they should select the ones that are relevant to the standards and the ones that are meaningful to this effort, we are talking about standards in which a consensus has been arrived at within the industries. These are consensus regulations that are put out there, but they are not required. And we think that in our discussions again with the OSHA staff and with the associations this is a good place to start because of the consensus. There may have to be additions and subtractions, and that is within the discretion of OSHA during the process that is anticipated under this legislation. 
   So I would hope that we would reject this amendment by Mr. Wilson and that we would pass the underlying bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I would hope that people would vote against the Wilson amendment. The people who are truly impacted by combustible dust are the workers who have been killed in the past and the workers that will be killed and injured in the future if we do not have an enforceable standard. I appreciate you have 17 regulations and all these things that OSHA is yakking about now, after years of doing nothing. The fact of the matter is, according to the Chemical Safety Board, they are not enforceable standards with respect to dust.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker and Members of the House, this is a very serious piece of legislation and a very important piece of legislation. The idea that we would delay this until some time that the Secretary of Labor could make some certification about its impact on food costs is really unacceptable. 
   Let's look at the record of the Secretary of Labor. Since January 1980 until 2006, there were 281 explosions in these kinds of facilities due to dust. Seven hundred eighteen people were injured and 119 died in those explosions. One hundred nineteen bread-winners were killed in those explosions. That's the result of a study from the Chemical Safety Board of whose members are all appointed by President George W. Bush, an independent agency that may be the gold standard in terms of independent review of accidents. 
   They then recommended that OSHA adopt dust standards. OSHA did nothing. Did nothing. No enforceable standards were adopted by that point. No enforceable standards at all. And then in February 2008, the Imperial Sugar plant exploded. 
   In the meantime, 67 explosions took place since the Chemical Safety Board recommended the standard. Five hundred seventy-five injuries and 14 deaths took place before OSHA did anything. And the Chemical Safety Board recommendations continue to say there are no enforceable standards with respect to dust. Not only does it devastate the lives of these individuals and their families and the community, it devastates the facility, a facility here that is key to the commerce of that area. So talk about an impact on price in a tight market when these facilities start pumping up. 
   The feed and grain people, they're under their own standards. And what is their analysis of that standard? That it drove technologies, it drove better design, and better productivity in their markets. That's their findings. They're not implicated in these standards. What happened there? Eight people were killed in the explosion, 20 were put into medically induced comas for a number of weeks, 5 of those died, and 3 are still in the hospital. 
   Since the Chemical Safety Board made its recommendation, there have been 67 explosions, and OSHA never found the urgency to protect these workers. Now to come along and to be so cynical as to suggest that if we could just keep killing the workers, the price of food will stay down. 
   You know, it's funny. I read the papers, read the business journal, read The Wall Street Journal, and they're talking about how the price of food has driven the profits of the grain companies; but when they talk about why it's gone up, it says, ``The crisis stems from a combination of heightened demand for food from fast-growing developing countries like China and India, low grain stockpiles caused by bad weather, rising fuel prices and the increasing amount of land used to grow crops for ethanol'' and others. 
   Some people say it's because Zimbabwe has quit producing food under the corrupt regime of Mr. Mugabe, so Africa has a double problem. I see the Governor of Texas, Mr. Rick Perry, thinks we ought to cut back on ethanol production. He doesn't think we ought to keep killing American workers. Nowhere in this paper, The Wall Street Journal mind you, nowhere in this paper, when you read about food prices, do you see any mention that we ought to continue to subsidize food prices by blowing up processing plants and killing and injuring workers. Nowhere do you see that except, perhaps, in this amendment.     
   We ought not to accept this amendment. These workers and this critical industry are entitled to this protection. And the facts on the ground are: The last time we put in a standard was for the feed and grain industry, and it has turned out to be wildly successful. Why is it wildly successful? Because injuries went down 40 percent, fatalities went down 60 percent, explosions went down 60 percent. 
   Don't you think we know enough now to think that these other workers in this industry are entitled to this protection? But OSHA has done nothing. OSHA has done nothing. And if OSHA is not going to act, we must. In this administration, OSHA has only acted when prodded by the courts or the Congress, never on their own. Never on their own have they suggested that they were going to go out and do this. Even after the recommendation of a presidentially appointed commission to look at these kinds of accidents, appointed by this President, they've chosen to do nothing. And it's important; it's important to these workers, it's important to the Congress. 
   John Barrow and I have put together legislation that works for the industry. We've consulted with the industry. We've sat down with the industry. We've sat down with OSHA. And we ought to oppose this motion to recommit in the name of the workers, in the name of their families, in the name of our Nation, we owe it to protect these workers.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Members of the House, this country has given the best of its young men and women in the battle in the war in Iraq and much of its treasure on the theory that we were fighting terrorists in Iraq so that we would be safer at home, on the theory that we were fighting terrorists in Iraq to eradicate them. We have lost over 4,000 young men and women in that battle, and tens of thousands of more seriously wounded, and almost $1 trillion of our treasure. Yet, this last week we saw our troops were not called upon to go against insurgents, to go against al Qaeda. They were called upon to enforce one side of an election battle of Shias against another band of Shias. 
   Our troops were put into battle over this last week because there was a fear by the Maliki government that the Supreme Council of Iraq would lose an election in Bosra. So they declared a battle against Muqtada al-Sadr's supporters in Bosra. They were unable to do it. They were unable to effectively carry it out. And they didn't force American troops into that battle. 
   Our troops should not be engaged in trying to square the field for the election advantage of one group of Iraqis over another. That is what elections are about, that is what democracy is about. But it should not be with the lives of our troops and the treasure of this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007, which was reported by the Committee on Education and Labor pursuant to the reconciliation instructions of the budget resolution. The committee was tasked to decrease the deficit by $750 million without reducing the assistance that makes college more affordable to students. 
   In keeping with that policy, this bill will significantly reduce the costs that place college out of reach for far too many students today. This bill represents the largest effort to help students and families pay for college since 1944, when the Congress passed the GI Bill, which helped millions of veterans go to college, the first generation to do so under that legislation. 
   For years, college costs are rising rapidly and are far outstripping families' ability to pay for them. Students are graduating with more debt than ever before and are working harder to pay back the loans which they borrowed to pay for their college education. 
   Several hundred thousand students a year now decide to forego a college education, even though they are completely qualified, fully prepared to go to college, because they don't know how they'll pay for it or how they'll manage the debt that they will inherit when they graduate. 
   Recognizing this need, H.R. 2669 demonstrates our commitment to growing and strengthening America's middle class by making college more affordable and accessible for all qualified students. It also recognizes our commitment to those who are less fortunate, for low-income families, to make sure that we increase the Pell Grants that are available to the students, and also low-cost loans to those same students who need to borrow beyond the Pell Grant. 
   The College Cost Reduction Act, which passed the Committee on Education and Labor with bipartisan support, boosts the college financial aid by roughly $18 billion over the next 5 years. And this bill does so in a fiscally responsible way. We are committed to the pay-as-you-go budget rules, and we honor that commitment with this legislation. 
   H.R. 2669 recognizes that we have an obligation to make sure that students have the maximum opportunity to take advantage of a college education and that they need access to that education, they need preparation for that education, they need success while they're there, and they need completion of their education. To do that we've made sure that, regardless of their background, that they will be prepared for college, they will have access to higher education, they will graduate to achieve their goals, and they will not be so burdened with unmanageable debt that that becomes a failure. 
   The bill does that by, for low-income students, increasing the Pell Grant $500 over the next 4 years. This is a very significant increase in the Pell Grant. As many know, the President promised many years ago that he would have it up to $5,100, and the fact of the matter is it was at $4,050. They failed to increase the Pell Grants. 
   It cuts in half the interest rates for subsidized loans for hardworking families that are going to borrow money, students that are borrowing money. We will cut their interest rates in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. This will save the average student graduating with about $13,000 in debt, $4,400 over the life of that loan. We guarantee that those students who borrow this money, when they begin their time in the work world, they will not have to commit more, if they decide not to, to commit more than 15 percent of their income to pay back the loans so that they can enter those professions that may not have great starting wages, but over time in that career, they will build up income. 
   We also provide, in keeping with the mandate, to try to provide highly qualified teachers in every classroom for students who are excelling in college and want to teach, if they make a commitment to teach in difficult public schools, we will provide $4,000 a year in tuition assistance while they're in school, not after they graduate, while they're in school, to a maximum of $16,000. 
   For those students who go to college and they get their degrees and they want to enter professions and serve the public, they want to be first responders, they want to be nurses, they want to be firefighters and public defenders and prosecutors and special education teachers and early childhood teachers, we offer them a $5,000 forgiveness of their loans if they stay in that field for 5 years. We know that in each one of these areas there is a crisis in attracting people to those fields. Many in Congress, hundreds of Members of Congress, have co-authored legislation to provide loan forgiveness for some of these professions. This bill, in fact, funds that loan forgiveness for those individuals. 
   We also increase the loan limits so that students will have greater access to more money to pay for the increasing cost of college and not have to go to the private market, where they will be able to continue to take advantage of the subsidies provided in the Federal loan program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 additional minutes.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. We also make a landmark investment in minority-serving institutions to make sure that those institutions that serve a disproportionate number of minority students are able to provide the services, to make sure that those students who are fully qualified to go to college, who are prepared to go to college, in fact, stay in college, so we don't have a continuation of the situation we had today where, all too often, because services aren't provided in college to help those students stay in college, those students end up out of college, no diploma and a lot of debt. And we want to make sure that that, in fact, doesn't happen. 
   So today this legislation provides a great deal of promise and a great deal of assistance and a great deal of resources to those students and their families who are sitting down figuring out how they're going to pay for this college education that is so incredibly valuable today if you're going to fully participate in the American economic system, if you're going to participate in our democratic society. 
   This is a very, very important piece of legislation. This is legislation that is designed to help these students be able to pay for that education. 
   We do something else in this legislation. We set up a partnership where we go to the private sector, to wealthy individuals, to corporations, to foundations, and we tell them for every dollar that they'll put up to pay for essentially a Pell-eligible student to complete their education without going into debt, we will match them 50 cent on the dollar. 
   We are told by those individuals who have actively been participating in raising money for these students that this should allow them to raise hundreds of millions of dollars additionally because of that match; to have that public/private partnership pursuing one of the great goals of this great democratic society, which is to make sure that a student from any part of American society who's prepared to go to college can, in fact, go to college.  
   So we not only have the government helping them out, we also have private citizens, corporations, philanthropic organizations, and in some cases even local governments if they decide this is good for their economy, and we will provide a match to help them do that. 
   This is a comprehensive bill. It recognizes the complex needs of families and students to gain access to college, to pay for college, and to succeed in their employment afterwards; and I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Cost Reduction Act. 
   Students from working families, especially those who are the first in their families to attend college, face many obstacles. 
   For example, there is no one at home to say the SATs aren't that difficult or that tricky; or that financial aid forms aren't going to be a nightmare to fill out; or that taking out a student loan isn't as scary as it might seem. 
   The high cost of college is, of course, the biggest obstacle. In recent years, rising college tuitions have far outstripped inflation, and the previous congressional majority failed to ensure that Pell Grants kept up. 
   That's why I am proud to support this bill. It provides the single largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill at no new cost to taxpayers. 
   My mother and father, both immigrants who arrived in the U.S. with little money, and not knowing English, raised seven children. With a lot of hard work and sacrifice, all of us attended college and two even made it into Congress. 
   What I really like about this bill is that it ensures that the doors that were open to my brothers and sisters and me will stay open for the young people of today and generations to come. 
   I urge support for this inportant bill.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the members of the committee for their work on this legislation on both sides of the aisle. I certainly want to thank the staff as we finish general debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, we said when we gained the majority in this Congress that we wanted to take America in a new direction. This legislation, in fact, does that. 
   For 6.8 million students who take out need-based loans, this legislation will allow for cutting the interest rate in half over the next 5 years for those students. That will save them almost $4,400 on the average debt that they graduate with. For almost 5.5 million students who rely on a Pell Grant for the basic cost of their education, this means that over the next 4 years that grant will increase by some $500, definitely a new direction. 
   Because what we saw in the past was the Republicans made it more expensive to pay for your student loans. They provided little or no contribution to the Pell Grant over the last 4 or 5 years. That is a new direction. 
   What does it mean to America? It means that we are investing in the students and the talent of the future. It means that these are the young people that will take their talents and provide the next generation of discovery, the next generation of innovation, the next generation of jobs in America, the next generation of economic activity here at home. That's the investment that was made by our grandparents back in 1944, in that generation, the first generation to go to college in such great numbers with the GI Bill, and that's the investment that we have the courage and the vision to make in this generation of young people for the future of this country. 
   That's what this legislation is about. It's about making sure that the doors of a higher education that every employer tells us is now necessary to come to the American workplace if you want a career and you want a decent wage and you want to be able to provide for your family. The doors to those higher education institutions, be they community colleges, State colleges, universities or elite universities, however you want to characterize them, that those doors will not be closed to people who are talented and ready and qualified to go to college. 
   This legislation provides the means to ensure their access to help them pay for it and to help them make sure that they don't have to make choices against their best interest because of  that debt and later in life that they can choose to go into the professions that serve us as a society. This is a dramatic departure, a dramatic departure from the status quo, a dramatic departure. 
   What the Republicans did, when they had a chance, they had $20 billion. They decided they would help pay for the tax cuts to the wealthiest people in the country. That's what they did with a big chunk of the money that they took from these excess subsidies, the subsidies that we are taking a way from the banks. 
   The entitlement program that the banks have today as we stand here will be changed. Yes, it will become an entitlement program for America's families, America's students, those most at need in this country. That's what this Congress ought to be doing. That's what this society wants us to do, and we're going to do it today when we pass this legislation.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker and members of the committee, I think this has been a very good debate because this has been a debate about which direction this country should go in and I believe will go in and the direction that the American people want this country to go in. 
   Parents all over this Nation hear every day from business leaders, from educational leaders, from the media, they hear that for America to be competitive, we have got to have a smarter workforce, a better skilled workforce, a better equipped workforce so that we can continue America's leadership in the world in the economics of the world and in the national security of this country. The key to that workforce, the key to that competitiveness, again, the very people who are hiring those individuals say that you must have a college education. What used to be good enough, which was graduation from high school, is no longer good enough today. You have to have advanced learning. It may be in a professional school. It may be in a trade school. It may be in a community college. It may be in a 4-year college. You may get some of it now and some of it later. But the fact of the matter is, you need those skills. 
   But what has happened over this time is that college education has increased as rapidly as anything else in society, in fact, more rapidly than many other indicators in our economy, over 35 to 40 percent over the last 5 years above inflation. What has that meant? That meant that families who thought they could afford that education now find that they have to squeeze harder. That meant that people who thought they weren't going to have to borrow money are now going to have to borrow money. That meant that people who thought they were going to be able to go to college are now deciding that they can no longer go to college. They are going to postpone it or maybe not go at all.     
   That's not good for America. That's not good for America's economy. That's not good for America's democratic institutions. And it's not good for our society. We need those young people to go to college. 
   What this legislation does today is it says to those individuals who are fully qualified to go to college, we will not deny you access to the college of your choice, to the education of your choice, to the career of your choice, and to the curriculum of your choice because you can't afford to pay for it. We're going to help you. We're not going to give you everything you need. Your family is still going to have to sacrifice, you're still going to have to pay back loans, but we're going to give you greater access to the ability to do that. 
   We're going to take this country in a new direction. We're going to take this country in a direction where we place a priority, a focus and a vision for education in America today because we know we must. 
   We're told again by the leaders of all of the new technologies, the new companies, the people who are investing in the future that we were the beneficiaries of when John Kennedy said that he wanted to send a person to the Moon and bring them back safely. It was more than a Moon shot. John Kennedy captured our imagination; he captured world leadership with that decision. And over the next decade, we did exactly as he directed. 
   But you know what else they did? They give 28,000 high-performing college students a grant to go to graduate school so they didn't have to borrow money, they didn't have to walk around with a tin cup, they didn't have to put themselves into debt, so they could use their best skills and talents to create the space program. You know what they created after they created the space program? They created Intel, they created Microsoft, they created Hewlett Packard. They created the infrastructure of this Nation. Now, did we whine and moan because they got a grant and the taxpayers used their money? They created millions of jobs in this country over the next four decades. That's what this is about. 
   Those are the investments that my grandparents made in my education before they ever met me. Those are the investments that my parents made in my education after they met me. They still thought it was worth something. And those are the investments that have made this country the greatest and strongest Nation in the world, have made us an economic leader, and have given us the ability to lead the world. Do we want to turn our back on it now? If you accept this substitute, you're turning our back on that idea. 
   The Republicans say, well, we're just going to take a little less money, but we're going to put it all in the Pell Grant. The Republicans, after flatlining Pell Grant all of these years when they had the opportunity to do something, did nothing. Now they want to love this bill to death by putting all the money in the Pell Grant. 
   This is what this legislation will do for Pell recipients; it will take them up to $5,200 in a Pell Grant. That may or may not pay for their education for that year, but it's a big leap forward. 
   But we also recognize something else, that this isn't the only constituency struggling to pay for education in this country. No, there are millions of students who will take out a subsidized student loan. And for those students, and their parents who will help them pay it back if they're that fortunate, for those students they will be paying for it by themselves, we're saying we will cut the interest rate in half when you graduate and you start to repay your loan. You borrow the money today, you pay your tuition, and when it comes time to pay your loan, your interest rate is half of what it is today. 
   Because we know that those middle-income families in this country are struggling as hard as anybody. They have the same vision, the same hope and the same aspiration for their children. So that's why we're doing this, because it's the best investment we can make in this country in that talent of our children, in the brilliance and the excitement and the vision of those children. That's what this legislation is about. But that's not what this substitute legislation is about. You cannot walk away from them. 
   I find it interesting that just 4 months ago, 5 months ago, 124 Republicans voted to cut those interest rates for middle-income families and their children, and now they're going to vote against it today. So they voted for it then, and now they're going to vote against it today. What was going on? Did they believe it then, or they don't believe it now? Which is it? But the fact of the matter is, this is about whether or not those families that struggle, they may be single parents, they may be two in their family, they may be families that find themselves with one, two or three kids in college at the same time. This government should help them because those children will return that gift of this Nation back to this Nation time and time again over the life of their earnings, over their careers. They will give back to this Nation because we made that investment as my parents and grandparents made in us. 
   If you vote for this substitute, you get rid of the interest rate cuts for those middle-income families. And also, for these very same Pell recipients, over half of these students will have to borrow money because a Pell Grant isn't enough. So they participate also in that interest rate cut. 
   You fail to participate in the loan forgiveness for the teacher, for the firefighter, for the policeman, for the special education teacher, for first responders. For those people in critical occupations that give so much to this society, but they're not the highest paying jobs, we're telling them if you stay on the job 5 years, we will give you $5,000 in loan forgiveness. For a student that graduates with an average debt of around $13,000, $14,000, that's a significant amount of loan forgiveness. What do we get? We get an educated firefighter, an educated policeman, a school teacher. We get these people. 
   For high-performing college students who are willing to go into teaching and go into math, science and engineering, and then go to the most difficult schools to teach, we're saying we will give you $4,000 a year in tuition assistance while you're in school, not later,  up to $16,000; again, an investment, because we now know that a highly qualified teacher can dramatically change the educational outcomes and the future for the children in ways that we can only dream about. That's an important investment, because that investment in that teacher will be invested in all of those students that come across his or her line of vision in those classes. 
   That's why this legislation is about a vision for America. That's why this legislation goes in a different direction. We stop today when we flatline aid to education in this country. We want to invest in young people. We want their families to be able to invest with us. And that's the importance of this legislation. 
   And, clearly, the commitment that we make to minority-serving institutions so that those students who are fully qualified to go to school go to school, receive the kind of help to keep them in school so they don't end up dropping out with a debt on the loans that they took. We want that success. It's a problem that's recognized across the country; we address it. 
   We raise the cap on the amount of money that families can borrow. It's not great news to hear we let you borrow more, but it's a lot cheaper than if you have to borrow it in the private loan market. It's 3.8 percent here, and it's 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent in the private market. That means a lot to families. That means a lot to students. That's what this legislation is about. 
   I would ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this substitute, to vote for the passage of the final bill. Let's take America to a new future. Let's take America to new heights. Let's take America to new greatness on the next generation of discoverers, of innovators, and of economic creators. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit says this will not allow a public officeholder or a lobbyist to get loan forgiveness. This has never been raised, and if you don't want them to get it, write me a letter and we will take care of it. 
   But what this does is this says that you must report this back promptly, so this kills this bill. This kills this bill. The greatest contribution to helping families pay for education since the GI bill, they want to kill it. Cutting interest rates in half for middle-income families, they want to kill it. You could have written the motion another way. You deliberately wrote it this way so you could kill this bill. 
   What is it you don't like about this bill? You don't like the fact that while you were in power, after years of flatlining the Pell Grant, we finally have given the biggest increase in decades for the poorest kids in the country. You don't like that, so you want to kill the bill. You don't like the fact that we are going to take 5 million middle-class kids and extend to them a loan with an interest rate that is cut in half while their families are struggling to get them through college. They are making sacrifices every year. You are going to do this. You are going to kill this bill? Are you proud of this amendment that you are going to try to kill this bill? Say it louder, that you are proud. 
   What about loan forgiveness? This amendment supposedly is about loan forgiveness, but in the process, they kill loan forgiveness to firefighters and policemen and nurses and teachers of special education and people who hold our society together and make it work, they kill that. What is it they don't like about having a society that can help its children? What is it they don't like about partnering up with families who want to help pay their kids' education, that borrow money, that are told every day they have to save more for this education, and here we are giving them loan forgiveness. We are giving them loan forgiveness because they have chosen to go into a career that doesn't pay very well. We are giving them an interest rate cut that will save them $4,000. That loan forgiveness will save them $5,000. 
   We are raising the amount of money that they can borrow, no great gift to their parents, money that they can borrow, but they don't have to go to the private market and pay 15 percent. They can pay 3.8 percent.     
   That's what this legislation is about. What is it you don't understand about the American people's vision? Mr. Speaker, what is it they don't understand about the American people's vision for this country? What is it you don't understand that America wants to go in a new direction? What is it you don't understand about this vision of the future where we have faith in our children, where they have the confidence of their parents; they have the vision that their kids can succeed, that they can be the next generation of discoverers, of innovators, of those who create economic opportunities and hire other people or get hired? 
   That's the vision America wants, and it needs help to pay for that education, and this is what this legislation does. That's what this legislation does. 
   Yes, we help those minority-serving institutions. I guess you don't like that either.  
   And yes, we thought we would partner up with some of the richest people in the world who said that if you partner up, we think we can raise hundreds of millions of dollars for poor children. So we said, you raise $1, we'll match it with 50 cents. They're now telling us they think they can raise hundreds of millions of dollars of private money. Sounds kind of Republican to me, but what the hell, I don't know.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. We've even got a multiplier in this bill. We tell high-achieving college students who are studying math, science and engineering, if you will commit to going in and teaching in the most difficult schools in this Nation, you will bring those talents to those kids, we'll give you $4,000 tuition relief while you're in school, not later. We know that that is a multiplier because we know the kids that are exposed to highly qualified and effective teachers can learn things that we can't believe of, and that's what gives back to this society. 
   At the end of the day, maybe Speaker Pelosi said it best: The dollars we invest in this legislation, the dollars we invest in these young people, that we invest in their families, in their futures, in their competencies, comes back to us every year from the same group of people as they graduate. They return the gifts. They return this gift of the Nation. 
   We're trying to do for this next generation, what my grandparents did for me, what my parents did for me. And those investments that they made in the college systems of this country, in the GI bill in this country, what did they do? They took America to the premier position in the world in economic leadership, in national security, in foreign affairs, took us to the first place in the world and has been there for 50 years based upon that investment. 
   America knows now that they need a new investment, and that's what this legislation is about. It's about a new investment for the next generation, the next generation of talent and competency and fearless and beautiful young people, beautiful young people who want their future to be as rewarding as all of ours have been. I ask you to vote ``no'' on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr Speaker, this water recycling legislation, H.R. 1526, enables local agencies across California's Bay-Delta region to invest in sustainable and reliable new water supplies. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   The Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Authorization Act will provide Federal assistance for an ambitious and forward-thinking regional water recycling program that will reduce demand on the Bay-Delta and drought-proof our regional municipal water supplies. 
   The legislation will assist efforts in Pittsburg, Antioch, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Pacifica, South Santa Clara County, Redwood City, and San Jose. 
   The city of Pittsburg and the Delta Diablo Sanitation District, in my congressional district, have been leading the charge on this effort, investing time, energy, and local funds in developing water recycling projects to help meet regional water needs. Water recycling is good for the environment and for local budgets. 
   In Pittsburg, for example, instead of using fresh water from the Delta, recycled water will be applied to city parks, golf courses, medians, and other green spaces. As the Contra Costa Times wrote about the bill, ``There is no good reason to flush wastewater into rivers, bays, estuaries, and the ocean if it can be treated and used again for other purposes such as irrigating parks and golf courses.'' 
   I want to thank Chairman Nick Rahall and Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, and the staff of the Natural Resources Committee and the Subcommiteee on Water and Power, for their assistance in this effort, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, when Speaker Pelosi spoke about the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, one of the things she said she wanted to accomplish was to begin to make the economy fairer for all Americans. Today, with this legislation to increase the minimum wage, we begin that task. 
   For 10 years, the lowest-paid workers in America have been frozen out of the economy of this country. They have ended up every year, after going to work every day, every week, every month, they have ended up poor, far below the poverty line of this country. They have been working at a Federal poverty wage, not a Federal minimum wage. 
   I am very honored today to be here supporting this legislation as the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. I am also very honored to be sharing this legislation with our new majority leader, Mr. Hoyer. Because of his activities in the last Congress, we were able to bring this issue to a head because of the amendment that he offered on the Health and Human Services bill, where the Republicans chose not to bring the bill to the floor of the Congress, not to bring it to a vote because they wanted to deny American workers access to the minimum wage. 
   I consider this a new beginning and a new Congress, but I must say I cannot let the history that the gentleman from California laid out for us to suggest that that is the record. The gentleman has said numerous times in his opening statement that this is a colossal missed opportunity. Let me tell you what a colossal missed opportunity is. For the last 10 years, the Republican leadership in this House fought tooth and nail to avoid any, any opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on the minimum wage. The only time they thought the poorest workers in America were worth an increase in the minimum wage was if they could tie it to a tax cut for the wealthiest people in the United States.     
   So they never really were interested in it. They wanted to use the power of the sense of fairness that the American public had about the treatment of the poorest workers. They wanted to use that power, that sense of outrage, that sense of immorality that they had about what the Republicans were doing, to drive tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country. 
   They said they were going to pass the bill and send it to the President's desk. We said it was going to die in the Senate, and it died in the Senate. And here today we see the same proposal being made. They are going to suggest that later today they are going to couple minimum wage with the wonderful health care plan for workers. 
   Their own CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says that more than 75 percent of the small business workers, over 20 million workers and their dependents, would see their health insurance premiums increase as a result of this proposal. So now they are going to give these workers an increase in the minimum wage, but then they are going to increase their premiums for health insurance. What a wonderful gift from the Republican Party. 
   Can't you just give these workers an increase and be done with it? They have been working at a 10-year-old minimum wage, but they are paying 2007 bread prices and milk prices and energy prices and rentals. Where is the decency? Where is the decency to give these workers what they are entitled to, what everybody knows that they should have? 
   Not only that, but then we find out with this wonderful health plan that some 8 million workers who are currently insured will probably lose their insurance. So now they are going to, if you get insurance, they are going to increase the premiums. If you have insurance, you may lose your insurance. 
   This isn't what America thinks makes the economy fair. What they  think makes the economy fair is an increase in the minimum wage. 
   As you all know, this is the longest period in history of law without a wage increase. During that time, the minimum wage has dropped to its lowest buying power in 51 years. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 would increase the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour over three steps over the next 2 years. 
   Raising the minimum wage is critical to fighting the middle-class squeeze in this country. Fifty-nine percent of American workers state that they have to work harder to earn a decent living than they did 20 or 30 years ago. Since 2001, the median household incomes have fallen by $1,300. Wages and salaries make up the lowest share of the economy in nearly six decades. Meanwhile, corporate profits, CEO buyouts, golden parachutes, golden handshakes and golden hellos take hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars out of the same corporations that say they can't give an increase to their workers. 
   While the economy is growing and the wealth of its Nation is increasing, more Americans are struggling to pay their bills. Over the last 5 years, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased from 5.4 million to 37 million. One in six children now lives in poverty. 
   Since 2000, prices of education, gasoline and health care have all greatly outpaced inflation. Raising the minimum wage is an important first step for the Congress in its efforts to stand up for middle class and to stem the middle-class squeeze. This raise will make a real, critical difference to millions of people's lives, and that is what America understands. You pass the minimum wage, and you dramatically change life for millions of people. 
   Does it solve their economic problems? Does it solve the economic stress? No, it doesn't. But it changes their lives. For a family of three, increasing the minimum wage will mean an additional $4,400 a year, equaling 15 months of groceries or 2 years' worth of health care. That is a change in the standing of these people's lives. 
   Raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in 2009, taking into account the increases in family earned income tax credit will take those people who are 11 percent below the poverty level line and move them to only 5 percent below the poverty line. Still below the poverty line but beginning to make this economy fair. 
   It is important that we pass this legislation and we pass it free standing. It is important that we do that so we can address the needs of these families, not that we hijack their plight, not that we hijack their misery, not that we hijack the willingness of the American people to do something for them to then do something that works against them. This is very, very important, this piece of legislation, and it is important that we address the concerns of these individuals. 
   I am proud to say that, on this legislation, H.R. 2, its over 200 original cosponsors, and I am very proud to say we are joined by seven Republican Members who are original cosponsors of this legislation, and I want to thank so many of those Republicans who worked over the years to try to get us this vote on the minimum wage, but we weren't successful. Today is the opportunity to bring these two sides of the aisle together, to begin to make this economy fair and to help these people who struggle every day in very difficult jobs, to do the right thing, to participate in the American economy and to provide for their families. But they are not able to do it at a 10-year-old minimum wage, and we need to bring that kind of equity to it. 
   We are joined in support of this legislation by over 500 national and local organizations, by over 1,000 Christian, Jewish and Muslim faith leaders who have spoken out on this legislation, by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops who wrote: ``For us it is a matter of simple justice for a decent society.'' And that is what this is about today. 
   This is more than just the dollars and cents per hour. This is about the morality of this country. This is about the ethics of this body on whether or not these people who have been stuck at this wage for 10 years are entitled to have this modest, modest increase, and I would hope that the House would overwhelmingly support this clean vote on the minimum wage increase over the next 2 years to $7.25. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I say, it is an interesting discussion from the other side of the aisle. It just doesn't comport with the evidence that we have in States that have passed a higher minimum wage than the Federal minimum wage. They have experienced higher job growth than those States with the low minimum wage. Overall, retail job growth between 1998 and 2006 was 10.2 percent in those States with a higher minimum wage and only 3.7 percent in the Federal minimum wage States. 
   Overall across all sectors it was 30 percent greater. The fact of the matter is, an increase in the minimum wage is helping the economy grow.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds to submit for insertion into the RECORD a statement of 650 economists, including five Nobel laureates, that support this increase in the minimum wage and say that it will not be detrimental to the economy. 
   Hundreds of Economists Say: Raise the Minimum Wage 
   The minimum wage has been an important part of our nation's economy for 68 years. It is based on the principle of valuing work by establishing an hourly wage floor beneath which employers cannot pay their workers. In so doing, the minimum wage helps to equalize the imbalance in bargaining power that low-wage workers face in the labor market. The minimum wage is also an important tool in fighting poverty. 
   The value of the 1997 increase in the federal minimum wage has been fully eroded. The real value of today's federal minimum wage is less than it has been since 1951. Moreover, the ratio of the minimum wage to the average hourly wage of non-supervisory workers is 31 percent, its lowest level since World War II. This decline is causing hardship for low-wage workers and their families. 
   We believe that a modest increase in the minimum wage would improve the well-being of low-wage workers and would not have the adverse effects that critics have claimed. In particular, we share the view the Council of Economic Advisors expressed in the 1999 Economic Report of the President that ``the weight of the evidence suggests that modest increases in the minimum wage have had very little or no effect on employment.'' While controversy about the precise employment effects of the minimum wage continues, research has shown that most of the beneficiaries are adults, most are female, and the vast majority are members of low-income working families. 
   As economists who are concerned about the problems facing low-wage workers, we believe the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2005's proposed phased-in increase in the federal minimum wage to $7.25 falls well within the range of options where the benefits to the labor market, workers, and the overall economy would be positive. 
   Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have set their minimum wages above the federal level. Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and Ohio, are considering similar measures. As with a federal increase, modest increases in state minimum wages in the range of $1.00 to $2.50 and indexing to protect against inflation can significantly improve the lives of low-income workers and their families, without the adverse effects that critics have claimed.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   Essentially, the case that the gentleman from Georgia makes, it just doesn't reflect the reality on the ground. As those States have increased the minimum wage far above the Federal minimum wage, their economies have expanded, job hiring has expanded, business growth has expanded far faster than in those States that thought it was in their interest to keep a lower minimum wage. 
   And I also find it interesting that in my own State of California the business organizations support an increase in minimum wage to $8 an hour and our economy continues to grow and continues to add those jobs. So the real-world experience is different than data from 20 years ago.

   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Fair Minimum Wage Act. This bill will help nearly 13 million workers and their families by raising the minimum wage. 
   The value of the minimum wage is lower than it has been in half a century. Instead of providing a living wage to hard-working American families, the minimum wage is a poverty wage. It is nearly $6,000 short of the Federal poverty line for a family of three if a minimum wage worker works full time. 
   Shouldn't having a job raise you out of poverty, instead of trapping you in it? 
   The minimum wage has stagnated since 1997, but wages have soared for those highest on the income scale. 
   The average CEO of a Standard & Poors 500 company made $13.5 million in 2005. 
   The average CEO makes 821 times as much as a minimum wage worker. 
   With salaries like these it is clear why an average CEO earns more before lunchtime than a minimum wage worker earns all year.     
   The average CEO is doing just fine looking out for himself. But America's most vulnerable families need somebody who is looking out for them. 
   This bill is a good bill, it is an important bill, and it is the right thing to do. I hope all my colleagues will join me in voting ``yes'' on H.R. 2.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is rather interesting that speaker after speaker gets up on the other side of the floor and in spite of the economic evidence of how well those States that have raised their minimum wages are doing compared in terms of job creation and economic growth to those States that kept the minimum wage low; it is rather compelling and overwhelming evidence in terms of higher job growth and higher economic growth, significantly higher even in the retail professions in those States that increased the minimum wage. 
   It is also rather interesting in light of the fact that the Gallup Poll of small business owners in March of last year said the overwhelming majority of small business owners, 86 percent, say the minimum wage had no impact on them. Nearly half the small business owners, 46 percent, supported the increase in the minimum wage. 
   It is an interesting dynamic you are talking about, but it is almost 20 years out of date in terms of the economics, what is taking place, as States have continued to raise the minimum wage, and the economic growth that has followed the wage increases that have followed, the growth and retail, which is very difficult in a competitive area, and the job growth that was created in those areas because people had money to put into the economy.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the staff of the Education and Labor Committee, Jody Calemine and Michele Varnhagen, for all of their work on this legislation. They have diligently worked for years to get this day to come before the House of Representatives, and I know they have the appreciation of all of the members of our committee. 
   I also want to thank our newer staff members, Megan O'Reilly, Brian Kennedy and Michael Gaffin, for their good work today and all of their efforts on behalf of this legislation, preparing it for the floor. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues on this side of the aisle who argued on behalf of this bill to increase the minimum wage, and I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who said that they were going to support this measure. They may not fully agree with it, but they said they would support it. 
   And I want to thank the cosponsors of this legislation, including I believe seven Republicans who were original cosponsors of this legislation and over 193 Democrats on this side of the aisle. 
   I was especially taken with the remarks of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who understand that this debate is about more than dollars and cents per hour. This is about the values of this Nation. It is about the value we place on work. It is about the statement that we make to people who go to work every day and work terribly hard in very difficult jobs that most people in this country would prefer not to have. But they go to work every day to do that, to provide for themselves, to provide for their children or to provide for their families. 
   When you talk to minimum wage workers, whether they are providing for themselves or themselves and a child or a child and a spouse, it is tough. It is tough. As the gentleman said on the front page of The Washington Post today, ``When I get all done, I have nothing left for me,'' because he is also taking care of his parents as he is earning the minimum wage. 
   So this is a big day. This is a big day because this is the first time in 10 years that the Congress signals that in fact we are going to raise the minimum wage. 
   It is what our leader, Speaker Pelosi, said she wanted to do in this first 100 hours. In this first 100 hours she wanted to address urgent parts of the national agenda that are of deep concern to the American people. And to over 80 percent of the American people in this country, they understand that the increase in the Federal minimum wage is a matter of morality, it is a matter of their values, it is a matter of the reflection of our Nation. They understand that these people, minimum wage workers in this country, have been working at a wage that is 10 years old. Ten years old. And they understand the unfairness of that, and they understand the difficulty of that. 
   That is why we brought this bill as a clean bill, because we wanted to highlight and to speak to the Nation about this group of workers who are toiling in spite of the fact that in 28 States they have raised the minimum wage at or above the levels we are talking about. In spite of that fact there are still some 13 million people who are directly impacted by the actions we take here today and the actions we take later on to send this bill to the President of the United States. 
   There are 13 million people whose economic viability is dependent upon this bill to increase the minimum wage. That is why we have to do this, and that is why I am so terribly proud of the Members who stood up today and argued for this increase in the minimum wage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will reserve 5 minutes of my time, yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) so he may have a similar amount of time, and yield back the balance of my time over the 5 minutes.

   You know, very often Members of Congress will take the floor and they will harken back to the time in their youth when they worked at the minimum wage and they will talk about the different jobs they had. Well, let me share with you that I, too, share those experiences. 
   I cleaned out oil tanks; I cleaned out ships; I drove trucks in the pear orchards; I picked fruit; I worked in the canneries; and sometimes I did two of those at the same time. I worked at night in the cannery and in the daytime in the oil refinery. I worked at the minimum wage. I wonder how I would have felt about that minimum wage if it had been 10 years old. If I was working at the minimum wage and my wages were 10 years into the past and everybody else working around me had current wages, I wonder how angry I would have been if I would have had to support a family--at one point I was supporting a family with those minimum wage jobs--I would have been very angry. I would have thought this was a very unfair system, that my wages were stuck 10 years in the past and everybody else's wages were current. 
   Well, that is what has happened to these workers up until today. Today, we finally release them from being frozen in time, where their wages are from 10 years ago, but when they go to the supermarket, the food prices are higher; when they put gasoline in the car, the gasoline prices are higher; when they pay the utility bills, the utility bills are higher; when their kids get sick, the medical bills are higher. All of those things are higher. They are living in 2007, but in their wages they are living in 1997. There is something terribly, terribly wrong with that picture. 
   That is why overwhelmingly throughout the country the people support this effort now to raise the minimum wage. Eighty-nine percent of the people believe that we should do this, and they basically believe it as a matter of economic fairness, of economic justice to these people who are working so hard at minimum wage, who, as we say over and over again, but remember what they are, they are the poorest paid workers in America today. 
   And when they turn on the TV, when they watch it on their lunch break, they see a CEO walk away with $210 million and a golden handshake after that CEO took a good corporation and ran it into the ditch. They see people backdating stock options, they see people defrauding the corporation for extra compensation, and yet their wages are back in time. 
   This is a question of economic fairness that the American public overwhelmingly responded to in this past election; and it is this issue of economic fairness that our new speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said would be the subject of this hundred hours, that we would begin by trying to make America a fairer place for those who go to work and for those who try to provide for their families. We would make America a fairer place and we would begin by increasing the minimum wage, and that is what we are going to do in the next few minutes, when we receive a strong and a bipartisan vote to increase the minimum wage for these workers. 
   It is terribly important that we do this. It says something about us as a Nation. When it is questioned all over the world about the economic disparities in American society, the unfairness of it, we get a chance to begin that process to change that dynamic.     
   I think this is a wonderful moment for the House of Representatives, no matter what side of the aisle you sit on. We, the people's House, are going to address the needs of the people that we were elected to serve. They grant us, they grant us the authority and the ability and the honor to come to the Congress of the United States; and today, and today we are going to address their needs. Today, we are going to address the needs that have concerned them in their communities. 
   If I have any time left, I want to thank the new majority leader for his efforts over these 10 years to try to bring this vote to the floor when time  and time again he made that effort in the Appropriations Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, and Members of the House, today is a remarkable day, because after 10 years, we are going to have an up-and-down vote on whether the poorest people in our Nation, who are working every day and, at the end of the year, end up poor, deserve a raise. That is what we are going to do today. 
   For 10 years, we have struggled to have this vote, and now we are finally going to have it. We have had a lot of excuses why we couldn't have it. We have had votes hijacked, and we have had votes pulled off the floor, but we could never have this vote. Today, the beginning of the 100 hours, we are going to have this vote. We are going to have this vote, because this is a major concern. This is a major concern to the American society. 
   What so many of my colleagues made clear today in the debate is that after you have stalled this vote for 10 years, this goes way beyond the dollars and cents of the minimum wage. It goes to the core values of America and economic justice and social justice and fairness and whether or not every American is going to get to participate in the American economic system and also be able to provide for their children and their families. 
   But my colleagues didn't disappoint me today on the other side of the aisle. We have one more bump in the road. This last moment, they have offered us a motion to recommit where they say, if you offer your employees a health care plan, you can keep the minimum wage at $5.15. Now it doesn't say that health care plan has to be affordable. It doesn't say what the deductibles are, the copayments, which I am sure if you are a minimum wage worker at $5.15 today, a wage that is 10 years old, I am sure you can pay the copayments and the deductibles and the premiums. That will not be a problem. 
   What is it you don't understand about being poor? What is it you don't understand? You are stuck at $5.15 in today's world. You can't buy the gasoline to go to work, the bread to put on the table, the milk out of the refrigerator. Your utilities are going up. The rent is going up. 
   Now you say, by the way, if you can pay for a health care plan, you can stay at the minimum wage, you lucky ducky. I don't think that is what America was talking about when 89 percent of them said they want this Congress to raise the minimum wage, not trade it in, not trade it in. 
   They didn't ask us to trade in the increase in the minimum wage for some phantom health care proposal. You know what the average premium is for a family? The average premium is $10,880. Okay. That is good plans and bad plans together. Cut it in half. You are at the minimum wage. You have got to pay $5,000? Cut it in half again. You are at the minimum wage. You can pay another $2,000 for your health care? I don't think so. I don't think so. Let us get on with the Nation's business, with the people's business, and with the minimum-wage workers' business. Let us reject this motion and pass this bill now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, today we have an opportunity to provide a great deal of assistance to those students who borrow from the subsidized student loan program. I want to thank the Rules Committee for providing for the passage of the rule for the consideration of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. 
   Today, millions of students and their families all across America are struggling to figure out how to pay for college. They are making critical decisions about whether college is in their future, based on what they can afford and how much debt they will be able to reasonably take on. 
   We know that a college education is as important today as a high school diploma was a generation ago. Yet, since the 2000-2001 academic years, tuition and fees at public colleges and universities have soared by 41 percent, while those at the private universities have increased by 17 percent. This is not a problem that we can ignore. 
   The College Student Relief Act helps students and their families by cutting interest rates for undergraduate subsidized student loans in half, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, phased in over 5 years. Once this interest rate is fully phased in, a student with an average loan debt of $13,800 will save approximately $4,400 over the life of their loan. 
   I am pleased to report that the College Student Relief Act is fully paid for, and complies with the House's new, strict PAYGO rules. Additionally, all changes to both students and lenders only apply to future loans. 
   This legislation will give much-needed relief to some 5.5 million students who borrow subsidized loans each year. The majority of students helped by College Student Relief Act are low- and middle-income students with family incomes between $26,000 to $68,000. Half of these students are eligible to receive Pell Grants, but many such students find that Pell Grants alone are insufficient. Because of the failure to increase the value of the Pell Grants over  the last decade, the Pell Grant does not cover the cost of education, and so those students who are eligible for Pell Grants because of family income and resources also find out they have to borrow. They borrow from this program, so this program is an additional savings, when we pass this legislation, to those who are eligible for the Pell Grants. 
   Providing debt relief to our students is the right thing to do. Current studies indicate that more students are borrowing more than ever. The debt level of graduates from public universities has skyrocketed by 58 percent in the past decade. The Pell Grant recipients and students with modest incomes are likely to borrow more often and in greater amount than other students. 
   This is just the first step in helping students and their families with college education. We plan to increase Pell Grants later in the appropriation process in the amount which has seriously fallen behind the cost of college, and we need to again take a look at making college tax credits and deductions simpler to use and more robust. That is what this Congress is committed to doing in the future when we are done with these six bills in the first 100 hours. 
   I also believe that colleges and universities should play their part in addressing affordability by becoming more diligent about cutting expenses and more transparent about college costs. We hope to address this in the 110th Congress when we reauthorize the Higher Education Act. 
   We cannot ignore the fact that students and families are drowning in debt in such a way that many of them have been forced to make difficult choices. Some choose just not to go to school, they stop going to school or they defer going to school, or they choose professions that will be more lucrative, instead of public service professions such as teaching, social work, law enforcement and other such professions because they know the debt that they will have to repay. 
   The debt issue and the agony families feel when they think about being able to afford college for their children is all too familiar a story to many of us who have been involved in this issue for some time. 
   I am pleased this bill has earned wide support in the education community among students, with such groups as U.S. PIRG and the United States Students Association, with colleges and universities across the country, including the National Association for Independent Colleges and Universities and the American Council on Education, and with labor unions such as the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007, so we can tell middle- and low-income families that we want to invest in a college education, we want to help these families find a way to pay for that, and we want to do whatever we can to reduce the burden of debt that these students are taking on today in unprecedented levels, the first generation to be put in that situation. 
   I think this is a good beginning in the first 100 hours to put this Congress on record not just as hoping to do something for students, but in fact doing something for 5.5 million students who will be eligible for the benefits under this interest rate cut. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the presentation of my colleagues on the other side; their sort of would have, could have, should have. 
   But the fact of the matter is, last year, when they had the Higher Education Act in front of them, the only thing they did was take $16 billion out of the student aid accounts and give it to pay for tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country. They didn't think about the Pell grantees at that time. They talked about them, but they didn't do anything for the Pell grantees. They didn't do anything to lower the student loans here. 
   They took $16 billion, and we begged them, we went to the Rules Committee and we begged them to let us recycle that money on behalf of the students on loans or Pell Grants or whatever. They said, no, this is going to the richest people in the country. And the fact of the matter is, the Rules Committee was so generous that in the entire higher education bill of last year, we got one amendment. We got one amendment. 
   So I think the point is that on this day, here in the first 100 hours, we are going to take care of middle-and lower-income students, 5 million of them who need these resources; then we will move on to tax deductions for families. And then we are going to move on and deal with increasing the Pell, something the President promised to do 6 years ago and has never been done.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 1/4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez), a member of the committee. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Student Relief Act. This bill will put college education back in reach for millions of students and their families. 
   The debt relief in this bill is targeted to help the students who need it most, students from 5.5 million working and middle-class families across the country. 
   Here I am, a kid from a family of seven whose parents came to this country without knowing English, without much money, and without jobs waiting for them. But with hard work, the great support of family and friends, and some good luck, and mostly because of affordable student loans, I made it where I am today. Each month when I write that check to make that payment on my student loan (because I am still paying off my student loans) I know that I am paying for an investment that was well worth it. 
   Many young people today find themselves where I was at age 18, wondering what they will do with their lives; and to those students, especially those whose parents did not go to college, the prospect of student loan debt can be very frightening. 
   When I was working as a bilingual aide in an elementary school to help pay my college bills, I would always talk to my students about going to college, what they would do when they went to college, and how hard they should work to prepare for college. 
   I used to talk to my kids about college all the time, and finally, one of them asked me, Teacher, what is college? 
   It is a long road from discovering what a college education is and what doors it can open to choosing the right college and then figuring out how to pay for it. 
   This bill makes the paying-for-it part a bit easier for millions of hardworking students and families and helps students make an investment in themselves by reducing the burden of debt that high interest rates create. 
   These students have worked hard to open the door of opportunity that a college education brings them. Those of us who have already stepped through that door have an obligation to hold it open for those who follow, and the College Student Relief Act does just that. 
   This bill will help make the prospect of college debt less daunting. 
   In this great Nation, what we teach kids from the youngest age is that there are no class barriers, that they can achieve anything they work for. Finances should not be a barrier between students and their educational training.  
   This bill will save students and their families thousands of dollars, giving them the opportunity to earn a college education. It will bring many American dreams that much closer to reality.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I just say it is an interesting discussion, but people who are betting with real money have a different discussion of this legislation. What they have said, the investment houses that are advising their people whether or not to buy stock in student loan lenders and others, have said that what we have done is absolutely manageable by these lenders. And, in fact, they were quite surprised that the committee had as light a touch on these lenders as we did. And that is interesting, because those are people who are advising mutual funds and others whether or not to buy the various lenders, and theirs was that this is essentially a neutral act and very manageable by those companies. 
   And so I think we ought to have it not what the political politicians are saying but what people who are betting with their money are saying.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I find it very interesting that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep coming to the floor and saying this won't help a single student. You know who thinks this will help a single student, and in fact this will help 5 million students, are the students, the students who are getting ready to take out the loans to borrow money to pay the tuition, to pay their college costs. They overwhelmingly support this legislation because it will help them and their families finance their education. 
   So apparently it won't help Republican Members of Congress, but it will help students and that is why the students support it. That is why we call them ``student loans'' because they go to students and then the students have to pay them back. You say they don't have to pay it back until after they graduate. Yes, but they borrowed the money their freshman year, their sophomore year, their junior year, and their senior year. They got the benefit. They were the students. So the students have decided that this bill is good, and it is really good for them, and it will make college more affordable for them and it will allow more of their colleagues to participate in going to college because the overall cost of that college education will be reduced through this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).

   So under the gentleman's theory, apparently the Republican repeal of the estate tax is only good for one day because you have a sunset on it. 
   And when the gentleman says one of the pundits, as opposed to a student who is going to get value for this, one of the pundits says this isn't good because it is on existing loans, no, it is on new loans. 
   So the pundits don't like it, the Republican Members of Congress don't like it, but the students like this. Hey, a novel idea. Let's do something the students like that they think will help to make college education affordable. There is an idea. Let's vote for that.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the staff of the majority side of the committee, Gabby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, Lisette Partelow, Stephanie Moore, Brian Kennedy from my staff for their great efforts in helping to prepare this legislation for the 100 hours, legislation that will have a dramatic and important impact on the cost of student loans for students borrowing from the subsidized loan program. 
   Madam Speaker and Members of the House, we come to the end of this debate on the question of whether or not we ought to make an effort to reduce the cost of college for millions of college students who will be taking out loans in the future to try to pay for that cost of college, and I think the resounding answer of this Congress in a few minutes will be: Yes, we should. Because we understand from discussions with our families, with our neighbors, with people in our communities that families are struggling with their children to try and figure out how they can afford them the opportunity that has become so terribly important in the economic future of these young people, and that is a college education. No longer today can you get by with a high school education. In fact, for most jobs now and most jobs certainly in the future we know that employers are telling us that at a minimum 2 years of college education is required. So this bill is about the opportunity to provide those students the means by which they go to college.  
   I have listened to all of this discussion on the other side of the aisle. The fact of the matter is they simply don't understand the bill. When a person is deciding whether or not they are going to pay the tuition this year, some of these students are eligible for a Pell Grant, they will get their $4,100; they still won't be able to meet the cost of the college, and they will borrow money. And under this legislation, after July, they will start to get a reduced interest rate, and next year they will get a further reduction in the rate and it will continue on. Unless the Republicans are going to repeal this legislation, maybe you are going to repeal it and take away this benefit for the students, it will continue on, as the gentleman knows. Just as we have a sunset in the Higher Education Act, a reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, we continue to reauthorize them time and time again because that is the commitment of this Congress, and I don't think the gentleman is suggesting that. 
   So what we have today is the opportunity for this Congress in the first 100 hours, in the first 100 hours of legislative business to reduce the student loans for those people on a subsidized loan from 6.8 percent down to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years and then thereafter. That is a magnificent opportunity. 
   When it is fully implemented this legislation will provide $4,400 in interest rate relief. $4,400 is a very substantial relief to low income and middle income families when they look at the life cycle cost of what it is going to cost to acquire 4 years of education to get that basic B.A. degree. When they look at that, they will see that this legislation will substantially reduce their costs. 
   But as Speaker Pelosi made very clear about this 100 hours, this is only the beginning. This is a down payment on our efforts to reduce the cost of college. 
   Yes, we want to follow along with Mr. McKeon's suggestions and his work in talking to the universities about whether or not they are doing all they can to keep the cost of college down and to make it affordable. We want to increase the Pell Grant, and we will be doing that in this committee and in the Appropriations Committee. And we hope to be able to enlarge the tax deduction for parents who are paying for the tuition and the cost of college beyond that.     
   So, yes, in this 100 hours, this is what we can do. This is what is affordable. Yes, my colleagues talk about all that they wanted to do. They paid for none of it. They sent the bill to these very same college students in terms of deficit, in terms of debt, in terms of interest on the debt, trillions of dollars of debt. This they may think is too small now, but the fact of the matter is, it is very important to these families that it is paid for so we don't continue to add to the debt because we have said we were also going to be fiscally responsible and have pay-as-you-go. 
   Finally, there has been a lot of discussion today about who doesn't like this bill. Maybe some of the lenders don't like this bill, some of the pundits don't like this bill. Maybe some of the people who work with the lenders don't like this bill. The people who like this bill and the people who matter are the students. And that is why U.S. PIRG and the U.S. Student Association and so many students support this legislation, because they know what this means to them with the passage of this bill, that their interest rates will be lower. They know this will lower the cost of college. 
   That is what we said we would do. That is what we are going to do. That is what the 100 hours have been about. That is what is going to happen with the passage of this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. Help these students and help families with the cost of college.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I would hope that the House would turn down this motion to recommit because if you don't, there is going to be an awful lot of people who are going to be terribly disappointed. 
   This motion as presented today would knock almost a million students out of the benefits of this legislation, the benefits of a reduced interest rate on their college loans. 
   This motion if it is accepted would mean that families that might have one, two or maybe three kids in college, if they earn more than $68,000, they wouldn't get the benefits of this program. 
   This amendment, as offered and if it is accepted, means that perhaps a firefighter who is married to a teacher or teachers who are married to one another would not be able to get the benefits of this program for their families. 
   Is that what we want to do? Is that what we really want to do? We knock a million of the 5.5 million beneficiaries off eligibility for this interest rate reduction? Do we want to knock off families that may have more than one child in college off of this ability to benefit from the interest reduction? Do we want to take middle-class families, where a teacher might be married to a firefighter or teacher married to a nurse, and say to them, you are not eligible for this? I don't think you want to do, and I certainly know that the Congress doesn't want to do that. 
   This is aimed, based upon income, the cost of the institution you go to, the number of children in your family, income determinate, you get a subsidy. What they want to do now is put a cap on the income of about $65,000, which means if you have more than one child or two children in college, you still have the income cap and you can't get help. 
   So we are sending a message that you can help make your first child, but not the second child? That is what we are going to tell families? Their income didn't go up, but their cost just went up because another child is eligible for college? Another child said, I want to go to college. The family has to say, We can't help you because there is a cap. 
   That is why this is called the subsidized loan program, because we recognize there are people within the middle class, at the lower end of the middle class who need this help. Two and a half million of the recipients are eligible for Pell. They are going to get this help. That is what this is designed for. 
   This is designed for those families in the middle class that need this kind of interest rate help and is designed for those in Pell who still need additional  money to go to school. That is why we picked this category of people. 
   But to now tell hardworking Americans because of a cap you pulled out of the sky in the last 5 minutes that they can't help their children with the cost of education, that they are not eligible for this subsidy of cutting the interest rate from 6.8 to 3.4 percent, I don't get it. I don't understand it, and I don't think the Congress should support it. 
   I don't think that is the message that we want to send to those working families. I don't think that is what we want to do. 
   You think of your districts and you think of somebody with a family income of $65,000, and you start thinking who you are telling, you are not prepared to help with reducing the cost of college for those families. Start thinking now because you are going to vote in a few minutes. Think about that family, two parents working their tails off to make ends meet. They are firefighters, construction workers. They don't work all year round. They get laid off. They are married to a nurse or a teacher or a policeman. All of a sudden they find out that they are not eligible for this. 
   I ask this House to give this a resounding ``no.'' This isn't fair, it isn't just, and it is wrong. It is going to drive up the cost of college for the very families and students who need it the most. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, more than 40 years ago, we recognized that poverty was robbing millions of children of the opportunity to do well in school and succeed in life. 
   As a nation, we made a decision to help poor children reach school age ready to succeed by creating the Head Start early childhood program. 
   In the last four decades, it has helped nearly 25 million children by providing them with high-quality, comprehensive education, health, and nutrition services. 
   Head Start remains a cornerstone in this country's efforts to help all children learn, to  combat poverty, and to provide all Americans with the opportunity to meet their fullest potential. 
   We know that Head Start works. Research shows that not only do Head Start students make important educational gains while they attend the program, they also continue to gain ground after they leave Head Start. 
   Research shows that by the end of kindergarten, Head Start graduates are ``essentially at national norms in early reading and writing'' and have further narrowed the achievement gap in vocabulary, general knowledge and early math. 
   In other words, Head Start is doing what we expect and demand that it should do--help prepare children to succeed in school and in life. 
   We also know that there are ways we can improve Head Start. 
   That is why I am so pleased to be here today with a bipartisan conference report to reauthorize and reinvigorate Head Start. 
   This bipartisan legislation improves teacher and classroom quality, expands access to Head Start for more children, improves comprehensive services that help children and their families, and ensures that taxpayer dollars only fund Head Start centers that are well-run and high quality. 
   First, this legislation builds on Head Start's success by integrating the best available science on child development to inform classroom instruction. 
   Each year we learn more and more about how children's brains develop. This legislation ensures that we improve teacher quality and update classroom practices based on what the research tells us. 
   It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to re-evaluate and update early learning standards and use of assessments with the best available science, including a forthcoming study from the National Academy of Sciences. 
   And it terminates further use of an inappropriate and ineffective testing regime for 4-year-olds. This wasteful testing regime cost taxpayers over $25 million dollars, it took up valuable classroom time and hasn't been useful for improving program quality. 
   Of course, Head Start is much more than an educational program. Head Start provides health, nutrition and parent education services in addition to a strong educational curriculum. 
   The conference report recognizes this by also strengthening Head Start's role in meeting these important needs of the children it serves. 
   This legislation takes important steps to ensure that Head Start centers are well-run and effectively managed. This will ensure that taxpayer dollars are used wisely and that every Head Start center is high quality. 
   The report allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to more quickly take funding away from bad programs. It requires that new and detailed fiscal management protocols be included in program reviews. 
   Finally, the legislation also expands access to Head Start in many important ways. 
   Expansion of Early Head Start is prioritized so more infants and toddlers can attend Head Start during the years their brains are growing the fastest. 
   And expansion of Migrant and Indian programs is prioritized so more of these children can have access to this important program. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I'd like to take a minute to thank Congressman MCKEON, Chairman KILDEE, Congressman CASTLE, Chairman KENNEDY, Senator ENZI, Senator DODD, and Senator ALEXANDER for their hard work in getting us to this point. 
   I'd also like to thank the staff for their work and expertise. 
   In particular, I'd like to thank Liz King and Jean Harmann with Legislative Counsel; Lloyd Horwich with Mr. KILDEE; James Bergeron, Susan Ross, Kirsten Duncan, and Jessica Gross with Mr. MCKEON and Mr. CASTLE; Roberto Rodriguez and David Johns with Senator KENNEDY; Catherine Hildum with Senator DODD; Lindsay Hunsicker and Beth Buehlmann with Senator Enzi; David Cleary and Sara Rittling with Senator Alexander; and from my own staff--Lamont Ivey, Molly Carter, Kate Scully, Stephanie Moore, and Ruth Friedman. 
   This bill will build on Head Start's past successes to create an even stronger program to provide Head Start children with a better future. 
   I am pleased that we are about to send this legislation to the President for his signature. 
   I thank my colleagues for their efforts.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman, and I thank him for taking this time. 
   As one who had the honor of serving under Gus Hawkins when he was Chair of the Education and Labor Committee, I would just like to say to my colleague that this was a man of great vision for young people, for students, and for working families. I knew Gus long before I came to the Congress. I knew him as a young man when he and my father served together in the State legislature and they were engaged in the great civil rights battles at that time, the great battles over education and school quality. Gus died when he was 100, but he was thinking about things 120 years from now because that's the way he always was. 
   Gus was always looking over the horizon for new opportunities and new ideas and new ways of doing things. He was a great pioneer, but he was also a great visionary and he honored us with his service in this body.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, today we have an opportunity to protect thousands of American workers from a serious, irreversible and deadly lung disease known as ``popcorn lung,'' a disease caused by a simple artificial butter flavoring chemical called diacetyl. 
   The alarm bells began ringing on this health crisis over 7 years ago when a Missouri doctor diagnosed several workers from the same popcorn production plant with this debilitating lung disease. In 2002, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health linked the lung disease to exposure to diacetyl used in the plant. 
   Scientists have called the effect of diacetyl on workers' lungs ``astonishingly grotesque'' and likened it to ``inhaling acid.'' Hundreds of workers in popcorn and flavor production have become ill, several have died of popcorn lung, and many of the workers are so sick they needed lung transplants. Dozens of workers have sued flavoring manufacturers, winning millions in lawsuits and settlements. 
   NIOSH first connected popcorn lung to this chemical in 2002. In 2003, NIOSH issued guidance recommending that workers' exposure be minimized. In 2004, the Food Extract Manufacturers Association, the trade association of the flavoring industry, issued similar guidelines. Yet 5 years later, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has failed to issue a standard to protect workers from exposure to diacetyl, preferring to rely on voluntary efforts. 
   Voluntary efforts, however, have not worked. Last year, California researchers found that despite the issuance of government and industry guidance for years before, many of those recommendations still have not been implemented in the flavor manufacturing facilities, and new cases of this debilitating lung disease have been identified. 
   How does this bill address the problem? H.R. 2693 would require OSHA to issue an interim final standard to minimize worker exposer to diacetyl. The  standard would contain provisions of engineering controls, respiratory protection, exposure monitoring, medical surveillance and worker training. The interim standard applies to popcorn manufacturing and packaging, as well as the food flavoring industry. 
   OSHA would then be required to issue a final standard within 2 years. This final standard would apply to all locations where workers are exposed to diacetyl and would include permissible exposure limit. 
   This bill should not be controversial. It is not another battle between workers and business about safety issues and alleged burdens of regulations. Over the past several months, we have built a wide coalition around this legislation from all sides, including industry, labor and scientists. The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, the association representing the companies that make these flavorings, has joined with the unions that represent the affected workers to strongly support this legislation. 
   In fact, the only outside dissenters from this coalition are the usual anti-OSHA ideologues spouting the same old ``sky is falling'' rhetoric about regulations. Such rhetoric may be music to the ears of the OSHA-hating ideologues in search of a talking point, but in the real world, this ideology leaves workers and their families to suffer from the preventable scourges of toxic chemicals. 
   There are many reasons why industry, labor and scientists agree on this legislation. They all agree that we don't need to wait any longer to act; indeed, we can't afford to wait. I have a list of almost 30 major studies and reports showing that diacetyl destroys workers' lungs. They agree that we know how to protect workers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health issued guidelines in 2003 laying out the basic measures that industry can take to prevent worker exposure to diacetyl. In 2004, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association outlined in even greater detail the measures that members can take to prevent the employees from getting sick. 
   This legislation is straightforward and merely requires that OSHA do what it could have done and should have already done, issue an emergency standard. There is precedent for this bill and for Congress stepping in when OSHA falters in its mission to protect American workers. In 1986, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 2000, Congress moved to require OSHA to issue health and safety standards. 
   Earlier this month, in response to a report that a consumer of microwave popcorn has contracted popcorn lung, a few popcorn manufacturers have announced that they intend to stop using diacetyl. This is welcome news. It highlights how serious this issue is, but it is not enough. Workers are still at risk because diacetyl will continue to be used in a variety of other food products. We can't wait for consumers to get sick and hit the companies in their pocketbooks before the industry changes. Workers are getting sick now, and have for many years, and will continue to get sick unless we act. Workers cannot wait any longer for our help. 
   In the past several years, we've seen hundreds of workers become sick from exposure to diacetyl, and we've heard about young workers who need lung transplants, who are not expected to live to see their small children grow up. 
   It is time for us to act. OSHA has failed over 5 years. They've been on notice to do this, they have failed to do this. The only time they have shown any movement is when we've called a hearing or had some congressional action, they have responded to it. 
   The time has come for Congress to act and pass this legislation and stop ignoring the needs of these workers' health and safety. And it's time to get OSHA to do the job that they were constituted to do, and that is, to protect these workers and their families from this preventable exposure to diacetyl as the toxic substance that it has become. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I certainly appreciate the situation my ranking member, Mr. McKeon, from California finds himself in, and I appreciate his remarks about the actions of OSHA in this situation. 
   The fact is that, again, earlier this month, in a commentary of the Dutch study on diacetyl workers which found it is unlikely that any other chemical is responsible for these cases, NIOSH scientist, Dr. Catherine Kreiss, wrote ``the collective evidence for diacetyl causing respiratory hazards supports actions to minimize exposure of diacetyl even if contributions by other flavoring chemicals exist.''     
   That is the situation we find ourselves in. This isn't a desire to rush to legislation. The fact is, as Mr. McKeon pointed out, on this side of the aisle also we are all terribly disappointed by the failure of OSHA to engage this problem and to engage the people who are coming forth now supporting this legislation to construct a solution. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey), who is the Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chair and who has handled this legislation.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, this isn't about confusion. This isn't about uncertainty. This is about the absolute failure of a Federal agency that has been established and designed to protect the health and the safety of American workers, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, and the absolutely failure of that agency to take action, the absolute failure of this administration, the Bush administration, to insist they take action in light of mounting and compelling evidence that workers in popcorn manufacturing facilities and workers maybe now in other food industries have been stricken with a horrible disease that has been directly related to diacetyl. 
   I appreciate they want to throw up all of the other reasons. Maybe it wasn't O.J., but the fact of the matter is, here it is diacetyl, and we have got to understand that because people are going in for lung transplants, people are losing their ability to earn a living, and people have died from the results of this, and manufacturers and others are paying out millions of dollars. 
   The other side wants to offer an amendment that is based upon very old information, 3 years old. In those 3 years, NIOSH has recommended that actions be taken. The actions were not taken. NIOSH based that on the information at that time. 
   Then the industry recommended that actions be taken to protect the lives and the health and the safety of these workers, and actions were not taken in many parts of that industry. And, lo and behold, on the day that we are arguing this bill on the floor, we find out that OSHA has finally taken action. 
   And what action has OSHA taken? It didn't take action in the absence of information. It specifically states that they are updating the material safety data sheets because they have to include newer health effects information, information they need to understand the hazards associated. The hazards associated. 
   This is OSHA as of today. OSHA couldn't figure it out yesterday, they couldn't figure it out last year or the year before or the year before. But because Congress is moving, they are now going to give people a data sheet that says diacetyl, in the data sheet from OSHA today, can cause damage to respiratory tract and lungs if inhaled, and it is highly flammable. 
   This isn't because we don't have information. This is because they refused to act earlier. 
   The gentleman from the other side wants to talk about the fact that they have put together a rulemaking process. No, what they announced was a one-day meeting, a one-day meeting of stakeholders, and then that was the end of it. We don't know whether they are going to go to the rest of the process or not. There is no indication in their past that they have. 
   They have forfeited their right to suggest that they will set the time and the tempo and the urgency of the protection of these workers and their families. They have forfeited that. We are stepping in here; and in the first interim standard we are asking NIOSH to do what they have already recommended that they do, based upon the evidence they have today. We are asking them to join with the manufacturers who have made these same recommendations based upon the evidence that they have today. 
   And what are they asking them to do? These are the first precautionary things that you do: Isolate the mixing room from the rest of the plant using walls, doors or other barriers; provide the mixing room with a separate ventilation system and ensure that negative air pressure relative to the rest of the plant is maintained in the mixing room. Yes, they are doing this because they have information that this can cause damage to your respiratory tracts and your lungs. 
   The other side wants to suggest in their amendment that if we just knew more, we could do better. It goes on and on. 
   They suggest reducing the operating temperature and holding the mixing tanks to the minimum temperature necessary, equipping the head space of the mixing and holding tanks with flavor added to oil and held in a pure form, automating the mixing process using closed processes to transfer flavorings. These are all designed to protect these workers, and they would not have happened but for this committee action, but for this floor time and this debate, and but for us voting this bill out of here. 
   This is the least we can do, to ask these agencies to do what was already recommended they should do in 2003, to do at least what the manufacturers have already recommended they do in 2004. And then we ask them to proceed with a permanent standard using their scientific evidence, their data, their knowledge, not ours. And that is the process by which these workers are going to get protection. 
   They are not going to get protection from the gentleman's amendment on the other side of the aisle, and they are not going to get it from stalling the Congress from going forward.  
   This is our opportunity to respond to an urgent medical crises in this industry by these workers and their families. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation when it comes time for final passage and to defeat the Wilson amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I find it rather incredible that the gentleman from Georgia would come down and ridicule the idea that Congress would act in this matter when there has been such malfeasance by OSHA, by the Bush administration, and by the oversight of this Congress. I guess you can try to make light of it if you don't want to take responsibility for your actions. 
   What we are recommending today in this legislation is what NIOSH recommended for the protection of these workers in 2003, and it didn't happen, and nobody on the other side of the aisle asked the question: Why? So now we have workers who have worked in popcorn factories and maybe now in other manufacturing facilities that are losing their lung capacity, that are seeking lung transplants, that have died and have a disease that is called ``grotesque'' by the medical profession and who suggest, when you get this, it is the equivalent of the damage to your lungs if you inhaled acid. 
   There may be something trite in that, there may be something cavalier in that, but I don't see it. I don't see it. These families, these workers, are asking for our help. These workers are dying.     
   The industry has tried and is asking for our help. The labor unions are asking for our help. The scientists are asking for our help. 
   The gentleman would make light of this. He ought to talk to the families who have had members who have died or who have been severely impaired or are hoping that they can get a lung transplant before they die so they might have a chance to see their children and their grandchildren grow up and enjoy their family. It's not to be made light of. 
   There's a great deal of malfeasance here by this administration, by OSHA, by the Department of Labor and by failure to have oversight on this in this committee. They ought not to come to this floor and make light of this measure. This is about people's lives and about their health and about their well-being, and we should pass this amendment. We should reject the next amendment and we should pass this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This amendment was offered in committee, and we rejected the amendment, and we offered to work with the gentleman. We've had a series of discussions, and he's been involved and staff have been involved in the discussions, but at the end of the day the simple fact was that they would not agree to any deadlines for NIOSH or OSHA to act in this amendment. 
   We think the timetables that are in the legislation are very important. If we take off these timetables, all of the past evidence suggests that OSHA and NIOSH will sort of turn to norm and, once again, we will have an open-ended process here where there isn't an urgency about the impacts of diacetyl. 
   We know what diacetyl does. That's become very clear. We don't know about everything else in the workplace. We don't know about everything else in the workplace, but we know what this very bad chemical can do to people and what it's causing for them to do it. 
   And so we lay out NIOSH to do it. They've already recommended the manufacturers are laid out. Then OSHA will do the final rulemaking. If they come back and say they can't do it, that's their scientific evidence.  We're not putting a legislative prescription on them, but what we are insisting is they address it and they address it now and they address it on the evidence that is here and emerging and that they make a decision and they protect these workers. 
   That's what this legislation is about, and that's what this amendment would negate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this legislation. It is an important piece of legislation. It does some very important things for families and individuals with mental health problems. 
   H.R. 6983 amends the Employer Retirement Income Security Act to prohibit employers and group health plans from imposing mental health or substance abuse treatment limitations, financial requirements or out-of-network coverage limitations, unless comparable limitation requirements are imposed upon medical surgical benefits. 
   Under this provision, if a mental health plan permits individuals to go to an emergency room for a medical condition without prior authorization or an out-of-network hospital or treatment center at in-network rates for a medical condition, then the plan must apply the same rules to an individual suffering from mental illness or substance abuse. 
   However, if a group plan does offer mental health or substance abuse benefits, there must be equity between the mental health or substance abuse coverage and all comparable medical and surgical benefits in the plan. Nothing  in H.R. 6983 is intended to preempt the stronger State mental health and substance abuse parity laws. 
   Having said that, I want to pay tribute to two of our colleagues. Jim Ramstad, who has been tireless in his effort to see this measure become law, and hopefully with our actions today it will be on its way to the President's desk and become law. I just want to thank you on behalf of so many families, not just my constituents who have mental health illness problems in their families, but so many families in America and individuals, for your work on this legislation. 
   And to Patrick Kennedy, our colleague who again has just done a remarkable job of rounding up support and votes for this legislation and getting to people to explain it to them, to get them to understand it and appreciate the problems that these families have when they try to get services from the insurance plans, from their health networks, and the barriers that are erected in front of them. 
   Hopefully this legislation will do what it is supposed to do to make sure that they can get treatment, they can get care, and they don't have to run all of the gauntlet that they today encounter with those barriers. 
   So to Congressman Ramstad, thank you so very much for all of your work, and to Patrick Kennedy, thank you so very, very much for all of your advocacy on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, yesterday on the occasion of his birthday people across this country took time to honor and celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King. Many of us participated in acts of community service and community rallies or took time out to listen to the  words of Martin Luther King and his speeches. We were reminded that the words and works of this great civil rights leader are still timely today. 
   In his writings Dr. King often cited examples of how the simple but courageous acts of one or two people to fight racial discrimination had far reaching implications for the future of this country. He talked about the persistence, the relentless persistence of average individuals to fight against discrimination, to fight against injustice, and to fight against inequalities. In his cell from the Birmingham jail, he writes of James Meredith and Rosa Parks, and how the simple but selfless acts of just one person helped change the course of this country. As he saw it, these acts and the destiny of African Americans were tied up with the destiny of America. 
   The resolution I bring forward today honors a group of men, the Mare Island 21ers, whose destiny was tied up when they bravely took action to end racial discrimination in naval shipyards in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1960s. 
   The Mare Island 21ers were a group of 21 African American shipyard workers employed at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. At that time minorities were mostly working in unskilled positions at Mare Island, as sandblasters, laborers and cleaners, with efforts to keep them out of certain positions. The discrimination was not restricted to withholding promotions and unfair hiring practices, according to one of the workers; they faced discrimination at every turn. 
   Long time denied opportunity for advancement, these workers decided to organize. Under the leadership of Willie Long, a journeyman pipefitter from Shop 56 who was also a World War II veteran and a Pearl Harbor survivor, the group met in complete secrecy to protect their safety and their jobs. 
   Not long after the group began to meet, President Kennedy issued his executive order establishing the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities and reaffirming the prohibition against discrimination against any employee of or application for employment by the Federal Government because of race, color, religion, or national origin. The order issued in March of 1961 also created a discrimination complaint process for Federal workers. 
   Learning of the President's executive order, the 21ers decided to file a complaint with the committee. The complaint covered deplorable conditions for African American workers at the shipyard, including the denial of promotions and access to the apprenticeship program, and general unfair treatment. 
   In their report they cited that there was an established unwritten practice at the Mare Island Shipyard not to upgrade third step mechanics no matter what the qualifications of the employee are at any given time. As a result, there are Negro employees with 15 or 20 years of experience still in this category while white workers with much less experience and time have moved rapidly up the ladder of promotion. They also said that Negro employees are systemically barred from supervisorial positions although many are entitled to such positions by reason of seniority and experience. There are two Negro lead men and sandblasters and one Negro leading man laborer out of a force of hundreds of supervisors, and the statistics proved this discrimination. He also said that Negroes who take examinations for advancement for the most part are flunked out on later oral interviews even though they passed the previous examination. The board is made up of the top three supervisors within the shop; and so long as this situation exists, Negroes will never be able to advance through examination. Young Negro men are refused the opportunity of apprenticeship training for the most part in Shop 56. No Negro apprentices have been hired in at least 3 years. In over 20 years at Mare Island, no Negro mechanic has ever received a superior accomplishment award, to our knowledge, which included cash bonuses for those who got it. Then, in fact when the time came for apprenticeship programs, they were not given credit for the training related to their jobs and they take on their own orders in advance of themselves. In fact, Negroes are discouraged from taking any training. And, of course, when the fleet started to change in this country and we went to atomic submarines, there were no Negroes who had been selected for the training of this program. 
   This was the kind of discrimination that this brave group of men who had to meet in secret, who had to be very careful that anybody at the workplace would not know that they were discussing this with their fellow workers when they met at home, they said, with all of the shades drawn, this is the discrimination that they were living under in the Naval Shipyard at that time and this is the discrimination that they cited to President Kennedy's employment board. It was a complaint among many that were received by the Committee on Equal Employment in the early days of its existence. Finally, the Navy was forced to pay attention to the long history of discrimination felt by the workers at Mare Island. In August of 1963, almost 2 years after the initial complaint was filed, the Navy put policies in place to affirmatively take action on behalf of minority workers. These heroic men included Willie Long, Boston Banks, Jr., Matthew Barnes, Louis Greer, Jake Sloan, Charles Fluker, Clarence Williams, James Davis, Thomas King, Robert E. Borden, James O. Hall, Matthew Luke, Herman Moore, Jimmy James, John L. McGhee, James J. Colbert, Virgil N. Herndon, Eddie Brady, Brodie Taylor, W.J. Price, Levi Jones, Herbert H. Lane, Kermit Day, and Charles Scales. 
   The actions of the Mare Island 21ers resulted in new employment opportunities for African Americans at other naval bases all across the Nation. 
   Despite these pioneering steps, their early civil rights efforts remained in obscurity until recently. The group's surviving members still talk about the movement, but the full story was buried in the 1960s and only recently came to light as a result of a series in the newspaper articles by the Vallejo Times Herald reporter Matthias Gafni. 
   Mr. Speaker, in tribute to these men and their fight to end racial discrimination in the workplace, it is proper for Congress to formally recognize the Mare Island Original 21ers and thank them for their heroic actions and their gift to this Nation to end discrimination in the naval shipyards. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his support of this. 
   This naval shipyard, it has been closed and it is going through the reused process, and it is a very, very exciting economic development plan for the city of Vallejo. It is in my district. And just down the way, down the river to San Francisco Bay is the Rosie the Riveter historic site. And at Rosie the Riveter, they talk about the various sites where we assembled the great American armada to carry supplies and troops to the Pacific during the Second World War. 
   In the town in which I was born, in Richmond, California, the Second World War and the Kaiser shipyards being located there overnight completed integrating the city. And of course we all know the story of women who went to work, women of all races went to work in those Kaiser shipyards; blacks went to work alongside white shipyard workers. Then they moved on, the shipyard, in peacetime at Mare Island, and that is where this discrimination took place. 
   Because of the actions of President Kennedy, because of the actions of people like the Mare Island 21ers and a lot of other brave people, today we look back at this as part of history in terms of workplace discrimination, certainly the Federal Government, one of the integrated workforces in the country. It is because of these kinds of actions that we can now speak of this, for the most part, as part of our historical past, but never losing sight of the sacrifice and the courage of ordinary people to move the dial toward integration from discrimination. 
   It wasn't easy in these communities; it wasn't easy in these workplaces. So when we see actions like this taken, I think it is quite fitting that the Congress would recognize this by passing this resolution commending the actions of courage of these 21 African American workers in the shipyard. 
   I thank my colleagues for support of this resolution. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his words in support of this resolution. I would hope that the House would adopt it unanimously. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   I want to thank the Speaker for speaking and endorsing and her participation in bringing this legislation together, but specifically, from our committee, the Education and Labor Committee, the matter that is dealing with green jobs. 
   And I want to thank Congresswoman HILDA SOLIS and Congressman JOHN TIERNEY for all of the work they did to create green jobs, both in our urban areas and in the rural areas, to build the expertise, to build the capital necessary to meet the demands of this legislation. 
   For too long, we have debated this issue as if it's the environment against economic growth and jobs. This legislation points to the fact, with the great support of labor unions in our country, that this is also about growing jobs here at home with new technologies, new industries, new innovation and new discovery. And I want to mention the support the Laborers International Union, Operating Engineers, the Brotherhood of Carpenters, the Boilermakers, the Steelworkers, and others. They participated in this joint effort to develop these green jobs provisions, building on very successful models across this country. 
   Again, I want to pay tribute to Congressman Tierney and Congresswoman Solis for their effort to pull together a coalition of people understanding the dynamics and the economic growth this can mean in both rural America and urban America to build the expertise, to build the talent, to build the job skills to deal with the new technologies that the other committees of jurisdiction are bringing forth. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2733, a bill to temporarily extend the programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. 
   Last month, we took the next step toward reauthorizing the Higher Education Act by passing H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, in the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. That bill builds on the law Congress enacted last year that put $20 billion in Federal student aid in the hands of those in most need, low- and middle-income students and families working hard to pay for the cost of college. 
   Now, as we work with the Senate towards the conference report to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, we are close to providing students and families with additional reforms needed to truly ensure that the doors of college remain open to all qualified students. 
   It is our goal to ensure that the final bill include vital provisions of H.R. 4137 that address the major obstacle families face in the path to college, from skyrocketing college tuition prices, to the needlessly complicated student aid application process, to predatory tactics by student lenders. 
   It has been nearly 10 years since the Higher Education Act last reauthorized, and I believe that Members on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers are eager to complete the work on a compromise bill this Congress. 
   This bipartisan reauthorization presents the best opportunity that we had to bring our higher education system into the 21st century. 
   The bill under consideration today, S. 2733, will extend the programs under the current Higher Education Act until April 30, 2008, to allow sufficient time for further deliberations to continue on the two bills passed in the House and Senate. And while that process of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act may be coming to a close, I would like to underscore that it does not mean that we will complete work on higher education altogether. The Education and Labor Committee will continue our efforts to ensure our higher education programs operate in the best interests of students and families, which include overseeing the proper implementation of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act and other provisions of the Higher Education Act. We will also examine how we can best ensure the availability of Federal student loans in the midst of volatility in our Nation's credit markets. 
   I look forward to completing this work with the respective Members so that we can continue to make college more affordable and accessible for our Nation's students and families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5563, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the first reauthorization of the national and community service laws and program since 1993. 
   The legislation we are considering today includes all of the amendments approved last week by voice vote. It also includes the provision on background checks from the Republican motion to recommit. This bill is a bipartisan product. 
   Through volunteer and community service programs, tens of millions of Americans of different generations have become inspired to build stronger, more vibrant communities to help children succeed in school and rebuild cities in times of disaster. 
   In 2006, more than 61 million Americans gave back to their communities through service. The GIVE Act recognizes this growing service movement that is taking place across the Nation. It builds upon the successful work being done by members of AmeriCorps, of Vista, of Senior Corps, and Learn and Serve America. 
   The GIVE Act would put us on a path to increasing the number of AmeriCorps members from 75,000 to 100,000 by 2012, with a focus on engaging low-income, disadvantaged, and at-risk young people. 
   The GIVE Act would also help AmeriCorps members pay for college by increasing the scholarship they earn in exchange for their service from $4,725 to $5,255 by 2012. 
   This bill would introduce young people to community service by creating a new Summer of Service initiative that will offer middle school and high school students the opportunity to spend a summer working to improve the communities while earning $500 toward college or college preparation. 
   Alumni of service programs remain a valuable resource to our communities. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf coast communities, AmeriCorps alumni played a key role in relief, recovery, and rebuilding efforts on the gulf coast.  
   To help tap into these resources in times of emergency, this bill would create an Alumni Reserve Corps to service alumni with previous disaster relief experience. 
   Each year, nearly a half a million older Americans participate in the Senior Corps programs, mentoring children of prisoners, providing independent living services to seniors, assisting victims of natural disaster, and mobilizing other volunteers. 
   The GIVE Act would expand the purpose of the Senior Corps programs by adding an emphasis on recruiting retired science, technology, health care, law enforcement, and military professionals to help with education, after-school, public safety, and technology needs. 
   I want to thank the many Members on both sides of the aisle who have worked on this bill, in particular, Representative McCarthy on our side of the aisle, Representative McKeon and Mr. Platts on the other side, who is handling the bill today for their leadership, as well as the Service Caucus for its support. 
   Let me also thank the Voices of Service and its member organizations which have been invaluable in helping us develop this legislation. 
   Service and volunteerism have played an important role in our Nation's history and will continue to help us meet the challenges and the needs of our communities. This legislation reflects the important role and builds upon it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I would just say in the two programs the gentleman from Arizona raised, it's exactly why we have the reauthorization so we can go back through those programs and, in fact, as a result of those reviews, the administration has insisted upon substantial changes in those programs which have been carried out and that is why the administration now supports this legislation.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a little hard to sit here and be lectured to by somebody from the other party that ran up an $8 trillion deficit in a matter of 8 years, about $1 trillion a year they succeeded in running up the deficit. But more importantly, I don't know if the gentleman from Illinois was absent last week or he doesn't remember, I don't know which, but we were here last Thursday considering this bill under the rules of the House, under essentially an open rule where every Republican amendment and every Democratic amendment that was requested, I believe, was offered. 
   The new programs were subjected to a vote of the House because we thought that was fair. They prevailed. We finished the business of this bill last week, and then people decided they wanted to play some games on the motions to recommit, and so that forced us to bring the bill up again this week. 
   We cannot go back to committee; that would be even more expensive, more time-consuming, and bring back the bill, so we have chosen to do it under suspension. But that's after all of the amendments have been given full consideration. That's why the administration supported the legislation. That's why it has bipartisan support, because it was bipartisan in the committee. I think it was 44-0 that it came out of the committee. It was bipartisan in the Rules Committee. It was bipartisan on the floor until the gentleman's party decided at the last minute that they wanted to try to somehow incorporate the FISA discussion into national service. That was out of order. That was not allowed. 
   And then Mr. Kuhl decided to offer an amendment, which we asked unanimous consent to accept at that time and we were not allowed to accept it. So, we're back here today. And we're trying to do it in the most expeditious fashion because it costs something to run the House. We shouldn't be back here today. But that's the history, in case the gentleman was absent last week. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I just want to, before we close debate, thank Mr. Platts and Mrs. McCarthy for all of their hard work. They were really the engines behind this legislation and getting it through the subcommittees and the committees for our consideration here on the floor. I want to thank them very much for that effort. 
   A couple of speakers suggested that somehow Americans volunteer, so we don't need this act. The fact of the matter is this act builds much more than just volunteers. I volunteer for the Habitat for Humanity. I volunteer in the schools in my district. I volunteer in Coastal Cleanup. I volunteer in community Weed and Seed programs. I volunteer in a lot of efforts. This is also about taking people who would never think of volunteering, young people who come from neighborhoods where that's not an opportunity that they may have necessarily. And it not only gets them into volunteering, but also builds skills. What people really like to have volunteer are people with skills come and volunteer. 
   It also builds leadership skills, so that those young people can either incorporate their skills in additional volunteering or organize other people to volunteer as they leave these programs. Many of these young people graduate and go into public service. In California, we will find people who will go from one of these programs to the California Conservation Corps to maybe the national parks program, where they end up working and rebuilding the infrastructure of our national parks or public lands or coastal areas of these States. 
   And when you ask the young people, when you run across them, where did they get their start, they got their start in AmeriCorps or the VISTA program or something like that. They end up maybe later, after they go to school, they come back and they work in the community. That's why one of the things that this legislation does is try to reach out to the alumni of this program, because we now realize how valuable they are to our communities and we want them to continue to participate and continue to organize people who have been the beneficiaries of this program and those who have participated in it as leaders and as participants so that we can build that core. 
   It's very interesting now, there's a number of people discussing the national defense level of this country, that one of the things we failed to do after 9/11 was build in a resiliency of this country in the event of other another attack. Tragically, after 9/11 the President told the country they didn't have to do anything, if they would just go shopping.  
   But now what we see is we still don't have the basic infrastructure in our communities to deal with natural disasters, to deal with possible terrorist attacks, to deal with regional-wide problems, whether they be fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, or any of that. In fact, what we need is we need volunteers and people with volunteer experience, people with organizing volunteers to start to come together to think about how a community would respond, whether it's a chemical spill, whether it's a chemical plant explosion, whether it's an earthquake or a fire, to respond to help those people, to help those first responders. We've never organized that. But we would like to start thinking about organizing that, and I'm sure when we do, we will be calling upon the professionals that were in VISTA, that were in AmeriCorps, that were in the Senior Corps, that have connections through their business connections, through their community involvement. 
   So, this program pays many dividends way beyond the idea that this is just about volunteering on a Saturday morning or a Sunday morning with your church. We all do that. But there has to be more. And there has to be avenues for people who aren't encouraged to volunteer, that we can provide that encouragement and we can encourage people to participate with populations that need that kind of assistance. That's the importance of this legislation. 
   It's unfortunate it has taken so long for us to reauthorize this bill. But what we know is Americans all across this country in every region of this country want to see a greater sense of people giving back to their communities, people volunteering in their communities, organizing people to volunteer, to provide services to their communities. That's what this legislation responds to. 
   It's been incredibly successful, when you meet the graduates of these programs, when you meet the alumni of these programs. They don't stop there. It becomes part of the ethic of their life. And they continue it in their business, in their professions. They continue that kind of activity because they see the value of it, they've participated in it. And I would hope that my colleagues would give this legislation overwhelming bipartisan support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I want to begin by thanking Mr. Kildee, Mr. McKeon and Mr. Castle and all of the members of the Education and Labor Committee for their hard work on this legislation, for all of their input and their suggestions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been a very long time coming. It has been coming to the floor of this House since 2003, and we have an opportunity tonight to begin the final part of that process, which is to go to conference on this legislation. This is an important piece of legislation, and this is an important program. In fact, it's this Nation's premier program with respect to the early education and the development of our children in this country, and it has been for more than 40 years. It has served more than 20 million children and their families in that time. 
   Head Start has remained during that time, and continues to remain today, as the cornerstone of this country's efforts to close the achievement gap, to combat poverty, to provide all of its citizens with an opportunity to thrive and to get parents more involved in the education of their children and to show them ways in which they can help in the development and the educational skills necessary for their children. 
   Head Start's design has always been a science-based program, and this reauthorization builds on the strong foundation by, again, turning to the best science to renew and improve the Head Start program. Both Head Start and Early Head Start programs prepare our country's most disadvantaged children to succeed in school and in life by addressing the needs of the whole child by providing services such as health and nutrition, in addition to the educational curriculum, because Head Start knows and discovered, and based upon fact, that the health and the nutritional well-being of these children determines the outcomes in the schools that they attend and the programs that they attend and in their participation. 
   Recent findings from the congressionally mandated impact study found that in less than a school year, Head Start narrowed the achievement gap by 45 percent in the prereading skills and by 28 percent in prewriting skills of the children that attended the program. 
   Head Start also works closely with parents, as I pointed out, empowering them to understand what their involvement can mean to the success of their child and to the long-term educational outcomes of that child. This reauthorization will help more children arrive in kindergarten ready to succeed by improving program quality and expanding the access to more children. We will improve teacher and classroom quality by strengthening the Head Start standards and supporting the best practices in the classroom. 
   We will end the inappropriate testing of 4-year-olds that has been undertaken by the administration in 2003 over the objections of hundreds of experts in child development and early education and over the bipartisan objection of many Members of Congress. 
   We will better target available funds to the underserved communities and prioritize the expansion of early Head Start so that more of our Nation's youngest children, will receive this program during the years when their brains are growing the fastest. We will strengthen program accountability at the Federal, regional, and local levels due to the changes made by the members of this committee and the operations of this program to assure that taxpayer dollars are being used wisely. In fact, in the example that was cited by Mr. McKeon, the senior Republican in the committee, is an example that was dealt with a number of years ago, hopefully by the administration but also in this legislation. Amendments that were offered in earlier iterations of this legislation are reoffered again as part of this bill as introduced by Mr. Kildee. 
   We have, I think, been very diligent in looking after that effort. I would hope that the administration, who has full authority on the oversight of the use of these funds, I wish they had been more diligent at that time. 
   As the GAO found, they failed in their oversight responsibility of the disbursements of this fund. But that is the past. We are assuming that the administration takes the wise use of these funds, the proper use of these funds very seriously, and that they pursue those who choose to do otherwise with these funds. Head Start dollars are very precious in the budget of this Nation. They are very precious to the families of these children, to these children and to those who dedicated their lives to the educational improvement, to the healthy child development of each and every one of these children. We are not to be frivolous with those dollars. 
   The minority has offered a motion to instruct. We agree with that motion. We think if there are differences, those differences are very narrow. They will be discussed; they will be voted upon in the conference committee, and that is our intent. We think that is consistent with the wording of the motion to instruct. When the proper time comes, we will urge Members to support that legislation. 
   Given the scarcity of these dollars, the importance of these dollars and the effectiveness of these dollars, we have no alternative but to be very tough on the accountability sections for this program. This is a trust not only of the children in the care of the Head Start program for the children of this Nation, it is a trust, too, for the taxpayer dollars, because this is a program that we have seen now over these 40 years has continued to receive bipartisan support, not only in the Congress but from every President of the United States. That's why this legislation is so important. 
   Hopefully, with this conference committee, we will be able to report back to the House and to the Senate legislation that can be sent to the President's desk hopefully in the next week or 10 days. That is our goal, and I thank the gentleman for his motion to instruct. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker and Members of the House, President Bush must take a strong stand on the actions of President Musharraf in Pakistan. The constitution of Pakistan must be restored, and democratic rule must be given back to the people. If we fail to do that, then democracy fails in Pakistan and we will see the exact environment in which the Taliban, terrorists, al Qaeda and others are born. Witness Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
   The restoration of democracy immediately must be high on the agenda of the Bush administration. Failure to do so turns Pakistan into an armed dictatorship with a nuclear weapon. 
   We have spent tens of billions of dollars in Pakistan to encourage their fight against terrorism and the Taliban. And what have we gotten in return? We now see that the military has started businesses with that money. They have used it to pad their retirement accounts. They have used it to run their private businesses rather than to defend the country and prosecute the war against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other terrorists that are now in northern Pakistan. 
   The choice is this administration's. They can speak out forcefully for democracy, or they can watch it wither on the vine and we will have another failed state in exactly a region where we don't need one.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report. I want to applaud the work of Chairman Gordon, the conferees and the staff for getting us to this historic place in time on behalf of this COMPETES Act, which will make a great difference in America's economy in the future.  
   The issue of competitiveness has been at the top of our agenda since November 2005 when the House Democrats under the leadership of Speaker PELOSI, unveiled the Innovation Agenda. 
   The Innovation Agenda, which was developed in consultation with the business community, is aimed at keeping America competitive in our ever growing global economy. 
   In addition to the work by the Speaker, the Committee on Education and Labor focused the first hearings of this Congress on how to address the challenges posed by the middle class squeeze. 
   Through the Innovation Agenda and through our hearings, a common denominator was the desire by the business community to engage in ways to create a more innovative workforce that is better prepared to enter the growing high tech industry. 
   This conference bill meets this objective through partnerships that will engage the business community with higher education to create programs that will educate and train individuals to meet the industry's needs. 
   Additionally, I am particularly pleased that the conference bill addresses another key goal of the Innovation Agenda, which is to ensure a highly qualified teacher is in every classroom. 
   The new programs in the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education, modeled after the successful UTEACH and CalTEACH programs, will go a long way to better preparing teachers for the classroom. 
   I am also pleased to see a true vision for education in this bill with programs that encourage math education, ensuring access to advanced placement/IB courses, and the creation of P-16 councils which will help states better understand where students start and where they need to go. 
   Again, I applaud the work of the conferees. I look forward to continue working on securing funding for these valuable programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 6358, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2008. 
   This legislation incorporates the bipartisan compromise amendment to H.R. 5876 that this House debated yesterday and supported by a vote of 422 in a recorded vote that was taken on the substitute amendments. 
   The ranking member, Mr. McKeon, and I worked together to develop this compromise legislation because we both agree that children's health and safety should never be a partisan issue. 
   The Government Accountability Office has found thousands of cases and allegations of child abuse and neglect, stretching back decades, to teen residential programs, including boot camps, wilderness camps, and therapeutic boarding schools. 
   The Education and Labor Committee has closely reviewed dozens of serious neglect and abuse cases, including cases that resulted in the death of a child. We have heard from parents of  children who died of preventable causes at the hands of untrained, uncaring staff members. We have heard from adults who attended these programs as teens. They too were the victims of physical and emotional abuse and witnessed other children being abused. These abuses have been allowed to go on because of the weak State and Federal rules governing teen residential programs. 
   An 18-month study by the Government Accountability Office showed that State licensing may exclude certain types of teen residential programs and thus place children at higher risk of abuse and neglect. In some States inconsistent licensing enables programs to define themselves out of the licensing altogether. According to GAO, in Texas a program that calls itself a residential treatment center would be required to obtain a license, but if that same program simply called itself a boarding school, it would not be required to have that license, and that's why this legislation is terribly important.     
   Parents send their children to these programs because they feel they have exhausted their alternatives. Their children may be abusing drugs or alcohol, attempting to run away or physically harm themselves, or otherwise acting out. They turn to these programs because the promise of staff members that will help their children straighten out their lives. And surely there are many cases in which programs do provide families the help they need. These parents are desperate and their children are in deep trouble. 
   But in far too many cases, when parents turn to those programs, they find they are getting conflicted information by people who have conflicts of interest in recommending the care for their children, financial conflicts of interest, ownership issues, and relationship issues that conflict that kind of advice. 
   We also know that we see programs that violate the trust that must be established between the parent and these programs and the programs and the children. It's very difficult for these parents to find good programs and to find accurate information, since the reporting requirements are so thin or nonexistent in so many States. 
   This legislation requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish minimum standards for residential programs, and to enforce them. Ultimately, however, the States will have primary responsibility for carrying out the work of this bill. 
   The legislation calls upon the States within 3 years to take up the role of setting standards and enforcing them at all programs, public and private. The Health and Human Services and the State standards would include prohibitions on physical, sexual, and mental abuse of children. The standards would require the programs to provide children with adequate food, water, and medical care. 
   They would require that programs have plans in place to handle medical emergencies. They would also include new training requirements for program staff, including the training on how to identify and report child abuse. 
   The legislation requires Health and Human Services to set up a toll-free hotline for people to call to report abuse in these programs. It also requires Health and Human Services to create a Web site for information about each program so that parents can look and see if substantiated cases of child abuse or a child fatality has occurred at the program that they are considering for their children. 
   Finally, the legislation requires programs to disclose to parents the qualifications, roles, and responsibilities of all current staff members, and requires programs to notify parents of substantiated child abuse or violations of health and safety laws. 
   Madam Speaker, we have the responsibility to keep children safe, no matter what setting they are in. Today, we are taking an important step to finally ending the horrific abuses that have gone on in these residential programs for teens. 
   I want to thank again Congresswoman McCarthy of New York for all of her help and work on this legislation, and Congressman McKeon for all of his work on this legislation. His suggestions as the bill left the committee made this a better piece of legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support the bipartisan legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3195, the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008. 
   Since 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act has made it possible for millions of productive, hardworking Americans to participate in our Nation's economy. Among other rights, the law guaranteed that workers with disabilities would be judged on their merits, not on their employer's prejudices. 
   But since the ADA's enactment, several Supreme Court rulings have dramatically reduced the number of workers with disabilities who are protected from discrimination under the law. Workers with diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, the very workers for whom the Americans with Disabilities Act was intended to protect, can be legally fired or passed over for promotion just because of their disability. 
   In January, the Education and Labor Committee heard testimony from Carey McClure. Although he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at age 15, Carey had been working as an electrician for more than 20 years. Like so many other Americans with disabilities, Carey was able to find his way to successfully perform his job and all of life's daily tasks despite his disability. 
   Carey received an initial job offer from General Motors pending a physical. During the physical, the doctor asked Carey to hold his arms above his head. Carey could not. The doctor asked how he would perform his job if it required reaching over his head. Carey gave a commonsense answer: he would use a ladder. When General Motors learned that Carey had a disability, it rescinded the job offer. Carey challenged General Motors' decision because he thought the Americans with Disabilities Act would protect him. He was wrong. The court ruled that, since Carey had adapted to his condition by modifying the way he performed everyday tasks, like washing his hair, he was not disabled; and, therefore, was not protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   Because of Supreme Court rulings, Carey and many others are now caught in a legal Catch-22. The court has determined that, for individuals whose disabilities do not ``prevent or severely restrict'' major life activities and for those who mitigate their impairments through means such as hearings aids or with medications, they should not be considered disabled. 
   In other words, an employer could fire or refuse to hire a fully qualified worker simply on the basis of his or her disability, while maintaining in court that the worker was not ``disabled enough'' to qualify for protection under the law. 
   H.R. 3195, the legislation before us today, a bipartisan legislation, was introduced by Majority Leader Hoyer and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, and it remedies this problem. The bill reverses the flawed court decision and restores the original congressional intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   H.R. 3195 clarifies the definition of a ``disability,'' ensuring that anyone with a physical or with a mental impairment that materially restricts a major life activity is covered under ADA. 
   In 2004, workers with disabilities lost 97 percent of the employment cases that went to trial. There has been no balance in the courts, putting workers at a distinct disadvantage. Too often, these cases have turned solely on the question of whether someone is an individual with a disability; too rarely have courts considered the merits of the discrimination claim itself. 
   H.R. 3195 stops the erosion of civil rights protections for people with disabilities while maintaining a reasonable solution supported by the business community.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I want to certainly thank the staffs of our committees on both sides of the aisle for all of their work. They put in a tremendous amount of time and intellectual power behind the amendments to the ADA and to put it back in the place that it should have after the court decisions damaged the intent and the purposes of this act. I certainly want to thank Sharon Lewis of the Committee on Education and Labor and Brian Kennedy and Thomas Webb, who is with us as an intern, for all of their work. 
   I am very proud to be a Member of Congress today and certainly of the House of Representatives as we pass this legislation. I was brought to the issues around the disability community when I first came to Congress, or perhaps a little before that when I was working in the State legislature in California by a hardy crew from California who were deeply involved in pursuing the civil rights of those with disabilities and the constitutional rights of those with disabilities and their place in the legislative process, and I want to thank them. And that is Judy Heuman from California and known to many; and Ed Roberts, a great champion of disability rights, a magnificent person; and Hale Zukor, who still resides in Berkeley and continues the battle; and Jim Donald, who is a wonderful attorney on behalf of many in the disability community; and so many others. 
   In my time in Congress, I have watched the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the battle over the 504 regulations; IDEA, at that time Education for All Handicapped Children, now IDEA; and the ADA; and today the restoration of the ADA to its proper position and power within the law. And I think it's a tribute to this Congress. While in many instances we have had very controversial fights and there have been eruptions over the implementation of these laws, we have continued to march forward and ensure the rights of the disabled, for their participation in American society. I think so many Members now and so many people in  our society recognize all that the members of the disability community have accomplished, all that they are accomplishing, and all that they will accomplish. 
   So today when we look at a young child seeking to be enrolled in school and to have an opportunity at the content and the curriculum that others have and to have the chance to participate in that school in a meaningful way and not be put off and sidestepped or in segregated classes; when we look at individuals who want to pursue a career, an activity, in our society and not be discriminated against; and when we now see employers recognizing the talents and the abilities and the contributions to be made by individuals with disabilities, we as a Nation are far better off, far richer, and far more understanding than we were prior to the struggles over these laws. And I hope that all Members will share the pride that I do when later on we will be able to vote to restore the ADA after the damage done by the court decisions. 
   And with that I thank all of my colleagues for their participation in this debate. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3180, a bill to temporarily extend programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. 
   At the beginning of February, the House took steps to reauthorize the Higher Education Act in passing H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. We now find ourselves in the near final phase of completing the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act as we work toward a compromise bill with the Senate to ensure that the doors of college are truly open to all qualified students. 
   It is our goal to ensure that a final bill encompasses the major issues addressed in H.R. 4137, including skyrocketing college prices, a needlessly complicated student aid application process, and predatory tactics by student lenders. 
   The bill under consideration today, S. 3180, will extend the programs under the Higher Education Act until July 31, 2008, to allow sufficient time for final deliberations on the two bills reported out of the respective Chambers. 
   It has been nearly 10 years since the Higher Education Act was last reauthorized, and I believe the Members on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers are anxious to complete the work on this bill in this Congress. We believe it can happen. 
   I look forward to joining my colleagues on the committees in both the House and the Senate in completing our work on behalf of this Nation's hardworking families and students. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (STOP MILITARY CASUALTIES -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, last night the President spoke to the Nation and presented his proposal to the Nation to increase the troop levels an additional 20,000 troops to be sent to Iraq to continue the war in Iraq. What the President didn't do was lay out the plan of how that would be successful, how that would be different than what we are currently doing, and how the results would be different. 
   The President, with his initial decision to invade Iraq, a decision that was his choice, and this was not a war of necessity, this was not a war to protect the vital interests of the United States, or the integrity of the United States or the safety of our homeland, this was a war where the President chose to go to war. 
   At the time he was considering going to war, he was advised by many. We all know this history of many saying not to do this and also saying that this would not work in Iraq with its history, with its culture, with its religious differences. But the President chose to go anyway, and we have been there now for 3 years. Over 3,000 young Americans have paid with their lives for this endeavor, and over 20,000 have been wounded, seriously wounded. 
   I have had the honor to visit with many of those soldiers as they have returned to Walter Reed Hospital with life-changing, life-changing wounds. It is remarkable that they would survive them at all, a great testimony to the medical care that is available to them, but nevertheless, life-changing injuries for these young men and women. 
   Now the President is suggesting, with his plan for escalation, that we will send another 20,000. The fact of the matter is that American soldiers have done all that they can for the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people, the Iraqi Government, has chosen not to take advantage of having the Americans in the country to resolve their political differences, to resolve their differences of culture and religion. They have chosen to continue to fight. 
   In fact, we find that our soldiers more and more now are simply the targets within the civil war that is going on in Iraq; and for all intents and purposes there is no reason to suggest that that is going to change. The President has suggested that somehow the current Iraqi Government will have to meet some thresholds. 
   Those thresholds are absolutely contrary to the interest of that government in terms of their survival. It is asking for a betrayal of that government against its Shi'a base, and it fails to recognize how fundamental, how fundamental the clash is between the Sunnis and the Shi'a, not just in Iraq, but throughout this region. If the President had taken time before the invasion, he might have been able to understand that. But it is a fundamental clash between these two factions in Islam. 
   Because of the actions of this President, he has unleashed the ability of that clash to present very real rewards and very high stakes for either sides. It is not just the oil in Iraq or the governance in Iraq, but it is really about the ability of the Shi'a to spread their influence beyond Iran, to spread their influence beyond being a majority minority in Iraq, to spread their influence beyond being a minority in Lebanon or in Syria; and these are fundamental, and they go back a long time in the history in the clashes between Sunni and Shi'a and how the Shi'a have been treated in countries where they are a minority whether it is in Jordan or whether it is in Saudi Arabia or other countries in the peninsula. 
   This is very, very fundamental, and the stakes are very high. At this moment our troops are a pawn in that game, in spite of what the President suggests that this is about the security of the region, this is about the blooming of democracy. It is not about any of that any longer. It may have been in his mind when he signed the order to send these troops to Iraq; but the fact of the matter is, it has been overwhelmed by history, by culture, by the nature of the region, all of which he made worse by this disastrous decision of his to choose to go to war in Iraq. 
   The idea now that contrary to the overwhelming desire of the American people to disengage from this area, and of this Congress that he would go forward, is arrogance that is so dangerous, so dangerous to our country, our standing in the world, and our troops in the region that immediately action should be taken in this Congress to stop this President from going forward with this very dangerous escalation that will do nothing more than add to the list of casualties by American soldiers in this region.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the disaster that we now see unfolding in the Middle East with the war in Iraq was set in motion when this President, against the advice of so many generals and military people, and against the advice of so many Middle East experts, made the decision to invade Iraq. 
   It was a war of choice, a choice not made by the American people, but a choice made by this President. And he set in motion the disaster that we now see. We understand that this decision that he made has been paid for by the lives and the injuries and the harm done to our men and women in uniform. 
   Last night he asked for a continuation of that disastrous choice with no new plan to change the outcome, but to simply extend the time in which our military will be engaged in Iraq. 
   It is foolhardy to believe that we should be sending our troops into Iraq based upon the theory that the Shia majority in Iraq for the first time in 100 years and the growing Shia majority across the Middle East is going to negotiate away their ability to act as a majority. This is a foolhardy trip, and we ought to vote against the President's proposal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank all of my colleagues who have spoken on this resolution and certainly to Barbara Lee, my colleague from California, who has been such a not only supporter and the author of this resolution but all of our efforts to change the situation in Darfur. 
   I had the honor to accompany Congresswoman Lee and our Speaker to Darfur a year ago February and saw the incredible devastation and the brutality and the genocide that is taking place there and vowed to do whatever I can to see if we can change it. I have been wearing this green band to save Darfur for over a year and a half. But this band will not save the people of Darfur, all of my constituents, thousands of my constituents who have marched throughout the Bay area, who have come across the country to march to save Darfur will not save Darfur. What will save Darfur is the nations of the world owing up to their responsibility to reject this genocide, to stop this genocide, to stop this holocaust against these people and get the government of Sudan to do so. 
   Of course today we are here to call upon the nation of China to owe up to its responsibilities, given its huge influence, its economic influence, its military influence, its resource influence in Sudan, to use that influence to get the government of Sudan to start to sit down and to negotiate with all of the parties to end the arms trade that is taking place, to stop the economic engagement until such time as these people in Darfur are once again made safe, until these people in Darfur are once again allowed to return to their villages, to their families and start to put their lives back together and to end the genocide. That's what is necessary to be done. 
   My colleague Mr. Goodlatte referred to the Olympics. It's hard to believe that the world is going to look upon the host of the Olympics and see there at the same time a nation that is underwriting a genocide. That is absolutely on a daily basis by its inaction and then by its positive actions underwriting and allowing the genocide to go forward. It's not that China can stop this alone, but in concert with the rest of the nations of the world that have called out for an end to this genocide, to take actions against the economic activity and the military activity in Sudan. 
   Congresswoman Lee has pushed the effort of divestiture that has been followed up in many States and cities and universities and other entities. This has got to continue to stop the genocide that now so many of my colleagues have witnessed firsthand on those terrible, terrible visits to Darfur where we see the worst of humanity and the violence against these individuals and their families and their children. It has got to stop. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this bipartisan resolution to the floor to help us try and end the genocide in Darfur.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   I don't know how many conversations Members of this House have had with corporate officers and leaders, but very often when you ask them why they will do something or not do something, they tell you that they are there because they have to take care of their shareholders, they have to protect their shareholders, and the shareholders control the corporation. 
   But when we get to executive pay, all of a sudden we find out that they really don't want to have this discussion among shareholders about executive pay. And here we are presented with an amendment that is designed to close down those discussions, and it is certainly designed to close down those discussions among average shareholders. 
   I don't know when the shareholder gets the determination of whether or not they have spent a de minimis amount of money or not. I don't know for a retiree, for a pensioner or a worker of that corporation, if they spend $100 or $500, if they give to a campaign, is that a de minimis amount? Maybe to them it is not, but it may be to the campaign. I don't know when that determination is made so that they can then speak out or not speak out or have their vote counted. 
   And when are they in jeopardy or not in jeopardy? I don't know. Are they responsible for the rest of the campaign if they simply decide to send money to a campaign and vote their vote because it is the only organization available when it is an organization if pensioners decide that they don't like the direction this company is going? 
   So what you are really doing here is, you are trying to chill the speech and freeze the speech by putting them and holding them responsible for the disclosure that they may not have any control over. They may not have any control over the entities, all persons or entities engaged in such a campaign, they may not know that. They may know they just don't like that executive compensation or they want a discussion of it. They don't necessarily know the activities engaged in to influence the vote. 
   You know, a lot of times people will hear about these campaigns in the newspaper because they are there, and they don't know the amount of money that is expended on the campaign. When do they get to vote? When do they get to vote? They don't have this information on their person, so to speak, but unless they can comply with this form, their vote is not counted. 
   Now, let's flip it over to the other side. The corporation can use corporate funds to make a general solicitation of proxies. They don't even have to speak about this campaign, they don't even have to speak about executive pay. They make a general solicitation. They say the shareholders' meeting is coming up, this is the agenda and this is what is going to be on it. Then they get to vote any way they want. What the hell is going on here? 
   I want to spend $100 or $500 because I think that this is not in the best interest of me. I am a shareholder, I own the stock, and I have got to jump over all the hoops; and the corporation just glides through an election and they have the proxies. This sounds like the problem with executive compensation; the decision is made at the corporate level, and nobody gets to second-guess it. 
   Send out a general solicitation. Maybe there is no campaign against executive pay at the time that the solicitation for proxies goes out. You know why? Because very often most people don't know what the executive pay is. You can read that form until you are blue in the face and you don't know what it is. 
   How many times have we heard executive compensation boards say, I was in the room, I didn't know we were paying them $37 million? I was in the room, I didn't know he got those stock options. I was in the room. That is why we started putting responsibility on people who were in the room. 
   But now this poor shareholder, this poor shareholder who is not in the room, who is not on the inside deal, this person has to jump through hoops. And then I guess what do you do? You petition to have them count your vote, and then in the petition you say, to the best of my knowledge, these are all persons who were engaged in the campaign, and to the best of my knowledge, this is what they did to influence a vote, to the best of my knowledge, this is the amount of money spent; and if it turns out to be wrong, your vote is thrown away. You call that democracy? That sounds like what they call democracy in Latin America or something.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. The point is this. The purpose of this legislation is to address a situation which has unfolded in this country in front of so many American workers, so many retirees, so many people who are close to retirement, when all of a sudden they see that, in the executive suites, they take care of themselves in the cloak of secrecy. And so when all of a sudden a major airline, a major automobile company or any other major corporation goes into bankruptcy, they find out that the executives, as part of their compensation, decided that they would have a bulletproof deferred retirement compensation plan, a bulletproof pension plan; while everybody else was in bankruptcy, that they created a trust, all part of executive compensation. And that is why people are now saying these shareholders, the vaunted basic fundamental makeup of the corporation, the shareholders should be engaged in this conversation. 
   This amendment comes to the forefront and really starts to strip away that discussion. Reminding you, this is a discussion, since this is a nonbinding advisory vote, so this is a discussion and a vote. And so the question really is, are we going to take the very same people who we pay great deference to when the corporation wants to tell you why they have to do something or they can't do something, it is because of the shareholders; but when it comes to executive compensation, we are going to shut down the ability of those individual shareholders and retirees and others to be able to have this discussion about executive compensation. And executive compensation is getting so large now that it in fact does impact the shareholders, because many corporations if you look at it, you think how much would they have to do to drive that amount of money to the bottom line? What would they have to do to drive that amount of money to the bottom line? This amendment should be rejected because it is contrary to the purpose and intent of this bill.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6159, the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act. 
   The Fouts Springs Youth facility has been managed by Solano County, Colusa County, and their partners for nearly fifty years. The bill before the House today guarantees that they can continue their good work. 
   Fouts Springs has helped rehabilitate California's young offenders, and provided youths from across the state with much-needed structure and significant vocational education opportunities. 
   Presently, Solano County operates Fouts Springs on behalf of several other California counties under a special use authorization. 
   H.R. 6159, the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act, will give Solano County the 82 acres that they use at Fouts Springs, and in exchange would give to the Mendocino National Forest 160 acres of nearby land known as Deafy Glade. 
   The Deafy Glade property has access to the Snow Mountain Wilderness Area, and has been a high priority for acquisition by the Forest Service since at least the early 1990s. As we learned in testimony before the Natural Resources Committee by Solano County Supervisor John Vasquez, the Deafy Glade parcels would be a key addition to the Mendocino National Forest's trail system. 
   The bill before the House today contains several small changes from the legislation as introduced, which should ensure that Solano County can continue to operate Fouts Springs as they do today. 
   I want to thank Chairman Nick Rahall, Subcommittee Chairman Raul Grijalva, and the Natural Resources Committee staff, for all of the time and energy they have spent with me and with my staff to improve this legislation and help move it forward. I also want to thank Ranking Members Don Young and Rob Bishop for their efforts. In particular, I want to recognize the efforts of Meghan Conklin and David Watkins from Chairman Grijalva's staff, as well as the work of my legislative director, Ben Miller. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act, and I look forward to passage of this legislation.

   In what started as a campaign to attain affordable healthcare for retired teachers, AARP founder Ethel Percy Andrus began a movement that has become a committed organization championing the needs of nearly 40 million members and all Americans over the age of 50. 
   The AARP has enjoyed 50 years of nonpartisan advocacy for consumer rights, has provided trusted research and information that continues to shape public policy, and has addressed consumer needs of the elderly, contributing immensely to the greater necessities of some of our most vulnerable citizens. 
   This national organization exemplifies the ideals of service and outreach, and has been a tremendous force in enhancing opportunities for older Americans in their search for quality healthcare, pension and retirement security, financial and overall well-being. 
   I would like to extend my congratulations and appreciation to the AARP for their exceptional dedication and service, and I wish this organization continued success in the great work that they do for years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, last night the House adopted the Altmire-Udall amendment to provide military families with very simple but much needed support while loved ones are away on combat duty. 
   Under the amendment that was agreed to, a worker can take family and medical leave to deal with the issues that arise as a result of a spouse, parent, or child's deployment to a combat zone like Iraq or Afghanistan. Under this amendment family members can use the leave to take care of issues like making legal and financial arrangements and making child care arrangements or other family obligations that arise and double when family members are on active duty deployments. 
   Supporting the troops is more than a bumper sticker. We must support the troops with all of the support that they need so their families can continue to function during the difficult times of deployment. These deployments and extended tours are not easy on families, and two-parent households can suddenly become a single-parent household and one parent is left alone to deal with paying the bills, going to the bank, picking up the kids from school, watching the kids, providing emotional support to the rest of the family. You have got to deal with these predeployment preparations. 
   This amendment is a good amendment. I hope that the House will support it with the passage of the legislation. Last year, tragically, it was thrown out in the conference committee and was given no consideration by the majority party of the last Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, how remarkable and refreshing this budget is. Finally a budget that ends the Republican commitment to endless seas of red ink and deficit spending. Finally a budget that ends the Republicans' commitment to squandering the $5 trillion that they inherited from the Clinton administration. 
   But more remarkable about this budget is it takes us in a new direction. It takes us in a direction where once again we see ourselves as a country and a national government investing in young people in this country, investing in their education, investing in the effort to make college more affordable for families and students who have to borrow money. That is what this budget does. 
   With a $9 billion increase over and above the President's budget, for the first time we are able to change the trendlines from reducing the expenditure on behalf of students with disabilities, on behalf of the elementary and secondary education of America's students, on behalf of job training. That is what this money does. This is an investment in the future of our young people. This is an investment in the elementary-secondary education system of young people in this country. This is an investment in reducing the cost of college. 
   That is a markedly different direction than we have been going over the last 6 years, where we just headed headlong into seas of red ink, where it overwhelmed everything else the government was about to do, where it started taking its toll on the education budgets of this country, where we denied the opportunities for people to have an affordable student loan, where we now see in excess of a quarter of a million young people deciding they won't be able to borrow the money, they won't be able to pay it back, and so they have decided maybe they will have to postpone or defer a college education permanently. 
   This budget also gives us the opportunity to address in a comprehensive fashion the reducing of the cost of college, to remake the student loan program, to get rid of these mindless, endless subsidies that the previous budgets have contained for the lenders, subsidies that fueled the corruption that we have seen in the program. 
   This is a remarkably refreshing, exciting budget for this country, for its young people and for its future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, today we take up the Head Start Improvement Act of 2007. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation, as it was last year when it was brought to the House floor. And in that vein, I certainly want to begin by thanking the staff on both sides of the aisle that have worked very hard to bring this legislation in this form with the cooperation of the members of both sides of the committee, the majority and the minority. I begin by thanking Mr. Lloyd Horwich, who is working for Mr. Kildee; Stephanie Milburn, with Mr. McKeon; Sarah Rittling, working with Mr. Castle; and Molly Carter and Ruth Friedman of the majority staff. This staff knows this program backwards and forwards. They have worked long and hard with the Head Start community, with the States, with Governors, with local communities, to make sure that, in fact, we have a program that we can be proud of, that we can continue to place our faith in, and does what we want, which is to give children from impoverished families and communities the opportunity to have a head start and to come to kindergarten school ready, if you will, with the skills necessary to take advantage of the opportunity that will be presented to them when they start school. 
   Head Start has been the premiere early education program in this country for more than 40 years. It has served more than 20 million children and families in that time. It is a highly successful research-based, comprehensive childhood development and early education program for low-income children from birth to 5 and for their families. 
   Both Head Start and Early Head Start help our country's most disadvantaged children become better prepared to succeed in school and in life by addressing the needs of the whole child and providing services such as  health and nutrition in addition to the educational curriculum. Its design has always been based in science, and the bill before us builds on the strong foundation again by turning to the best science to renew and improve the Head Start program. 
   Head Start remains a cornerstone of this country's effort to close the achievement gap, to combat poverty, and to provide all its citizens with the opportunity to thrive. 
   Today more than 12 million children in America live in poverty, 20 percent of them under the age of 6. Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to struggle in school, face physical and mental health problems, and see fewer economic opportunities throughout their life. 
   The bill before us is central to achieving the goals of No Child Left behind because the achievement gap that appears later on in elementary school begins before these children reach kindergarten. Head Start is one of the most evaluated Federal programs, and research concludes that Head Start works. Recent findings from the congressionally-mandated Impact Study found that after less than one school year, Head Start narrowed the achievement gap by 45 percent in prereading and 28 percent in prewriting. The study also found that Head Start helped to improve some of the important parenting practices, including helping to increase the frequency with which parents read to and with their children. 
   Another large-scale study on Head Start found that children made significant gains during the Head Start year, and made even greater gains over the kindergarten year.     
   By the end of kindergarten, Head Start graduates were essentially in the national norms in early reading and writing, narrowed by the achievement gap in vocabulary and general knowledge and early math. 
   I am encouraged that the research concludes that Head Start is doing what we expect and demand that it should do to help prepare children to succeed in school. However, this research shows that there are many new ways to improve Head Start, and I believe we accomplish that in the bill before us. The bill before us will help more children arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed by improving the program quality and expanding access to more children. 
   This bill includes many improvements to build on the latest research in brain and child development. The bill also recognizes that key to the first-class Head Start programs is teachers. This is absolutely imperative, and this bill works hard to make sure that we continue to provide for improvement and professional development of the teachers in the Head Start program. 
   We increase the teacher qualifications by directing the majority of new funds for program improvement activities, including significant new funds to increase teacher salaries; requiring that all programs use research-based practices to support children's preliteracy and vocabulary skills; requiring a full time staff to develop career ladders and professional development plans; directing the Health and Human Services agency to implement an observational assessment tool that will evaluate classroom quality and provide immediate feedback for programs on their strengths and weaknesses; improving the professional development and training and technical assistance systems so that they are better grounded in science and more responsive to local training needs; and requiring the Secretary to reevaluate and update current early learning standards and assessments using the best science available. 
   The point is this: This is a major revamping of the Head Start program, with an emphasis on quality, with an emphasis on outcomes, with an emphasis on the assessments and how these programs are doing so that we can provide the continuous improvement of these programs, and we can provide continuous high-quality programs to the children who are in need of these programs. It's only then that we can be assured that Head Start will continue to earn its reputation as the premier early childhood education and development program in this Nation. It is only then that we can say to the taxpayers that this continues to be a very wise investment of the dollars in the children of this Nation in providing them access to the kinds of programs that are necessary if they are going to be able to take advantage of the educational opportunities in K-12, if they are going to be able to close the gap between themselves and middle-income kids, if they are going to be able to go to school with those skills. 
   I believe that this legislation does that. This legislation builds on what was tried and worked on in the last session of Congress under the leadership of Mr. Castle, Mr. McKeon, Mr. Boehner, myself and Mr. Kildee. This is a continuation of that process, and that's why it received the overwhelming bipartisan support when it was reported from the committee. I hope that my colleagues will lend it the same kind of support at the end of this debate and the amendment process. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume and just to thank my colleagues who joined in the general debate and for their support for this legislation and, again, to thank the staffs on both sides of the aisle of both the subcommittee and the full committee without whose work and effort and knowledge this legislation would not be in the kind of shape it is today, with the support that it has from both Republicans and Democrats for the Head Start bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, we are here today to authorize the Head Start program. What this amendment would do would simply end Head Start in those eight States as we know it. There would be no requirement that those States would take the money that we have set aside, that we have worked hard to provide within the budget for the Head Start program and use it to implement a program that is anything like Head Start, because there would simply be no requirements on that money to provide the kind of comprehensive programs that are now required under the Head Start program that have demonstrated the success that we just spent an hour with speakers from both sides of the aisle attesting to in their own districts or on a national basis as members of the committee have talked about what we are doing in this reauthorization. These States would be eligible for these funds without demonstrating any expertise or commitment to the high quality of this proven preschool program. 
   Essentially that's the end of it in those eight States. Now, maybe one of those States will have a strong commitment to Head Start and all the rest of it. That's what Head Start is. That's what Head Start is. Why are we running this money through another filter system to recreate the Head Start program? We already require, and we went through a series of hearings about coordination with the States to make sure that Head Start coordinates with other State programs and State agencies. 
   But we also know that because of what we have done with Head Start over the years, where we have provided reauthorization after reauthorization, the continuous improvement of the programs that are integral to the success of Head Start and to the success of the children, where we have used scientific-based educational and performance standards, where we have provided for accountability and oversight and evaluation of the program, where we have provided for the parent policy councils, all of these things that have been integral to this program over this time to bring it to a point now where we can see that it demonstrates a marked impact on these young children in closing the achievement gap for these children and getting them ready and the skills that they will need for early reading, for early math, for early writing, that is what this program does. 
   There are not many States that do any of that. They have a lot of early childhood programs. They have a lot of child care programs, they have a lot of it. But they don't have this comprehensive program. That's why this is considered the premier program in the Nation for the education and the development of these young children. That is why we should not support this block grant amendment. 
   I daresay that we have watched over the last decades effort after effort be made to block grant programs. Generally, where they have been successful, they have been the first step to the budget cuts, to the loss of quality. That's what's involved here. 
   Again, when we structured this legislation, and in consideration of the budget and the increases in the money, we are putting 60 percent of the money into quality, into teacher and professional development, into salaries, because we recognize that we have to have that continuous update and that improvement of the Head Start program. 
   Voting for this amendment is not to vote for Head Start; it's to vote for something, but it's not to vote for Head Start. It's, in fact, detrimental because that money, then, is out of the Head Start system to be used for whatever purposes. In fact, you can take this Federal money and then withdraw the local money. There is no requirement in this amendment that there be a maintenance of effort by a State to do this. 
   What have you really done? You have taken money for the Federal taxpayers that paid into this program that we have decided on a bipartisan basis should go for the Head Start program. You said, oh, you can give it to a State, and they can draw their money out the bottom. So we put the taxpayers' money in at the top, and the State takes the money out of the bottom. 
   That is not going to improve quality. That is not going to improve access. Now, you can argue that maybe you can add a lot of children to a program, a program, not the Head Start program, because the Head Start program is expensive because we do it the way we should be doing, the way it has been scientifically analyzed and supported by the data. 
   You can put a lot of kids in low-quality programs, but that is not what we  are trying to achieve. We are trying to achieve high quality so we get the results that Head Start gets and most other States don't get. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that is exactly the point. Yes, it offers all services, but it doesn't require the same high-quality service we have now. You can do all of these things, but you end up doing these things on the cheap because the demand is for slots. We have seen that tension here all the time. 
   There are no requirements here that you have anything comparable to the quality and the requirements in the Head Start program, and yet you are you are taking money out of the program to give it for these other purposes. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, I rise in opposition to this amendment, simply for the simple fact that we are trying to balance, in this legislation, the best we can do to increase the number of teachers with a B.A. degree in child education, child development and at the same time meet the other needs of the program. And to accelerate that effort on behalf of more teachers with an M.A. upsets that balance. 
   It's not like, with all due respect to my friend on the other side, and he shares my concern for teacher quality, it's what I've spent my public life trying to do. The fact of the matter is this is a program that essentially has received less than the COLA, last year got a 1 percent cut. And the fact of the matter is we're trying to patch it back up, trying to bring it back to the level where it was around 2002, and recognizing that we want to increase the access to a number of children, so money has to go for slots, money has to go for professional development, money has to go for quality, and money has to go for the salaries, and that's the balance that we have put in this program. 
   The date that you have was the date that you had at the beginning of 2005 when we started considering this legislation. That legislation didn't get through. We're now 2 years later, so we moved it back 2 years so that the programs can balance, can rebuild the quality, can add additional slots for the million children who are now waiting, and that's the balance that we arrived at on both sides of the aisle. 
   You could offer an amendment and say, well, there's a million children waiting. Let's put all the money into slots. Then you just reduce the quality and the availability to pay teachers to have them to stay. 
   So this isn't a game where you can just pick out one part of the program and say, let's put the money there, and that's the reason why we did what we did. And I don't think that this amendment is helpful in terms of our ability to hold on to current staff that have B.A.'s, and that's the staff we're trying to build, and then to attract additional ones to be able to put some money into that pay quality, and the additional slots. And I would hope that we would oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).

This is what agencies have to do when the funding isn't sufficient and they are trying to hold on to the number of children, the hours of availability of the program and the quality of the teachers that are there. In the past when we had the cut, I believe the agency, HHS, allowed some local programs to do this. I would hope that this will not be a necessity. We are adding an additional $400 million to this program. I hope that the Appropriations Committee will be able to follow through.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for offering this amendment. 
   It is interesting that the other side would now oppose this amendment, but all day long they have been citing us the executive order with the exact same language in it as the basis for the right of faith-based organizations to participate in this program, a right that they have exercised now for more than 40 years. What your amendment does is to take it from the regulations and put it into the statute to guarantee them that right in the law, not just in the executive order and in the regulations. 
   In my own district, the First Baptist organization runs the Head Start program. They do a marvelous job. The reason they are kicking up the smokescreen around Mr. Shuler's amendment is that they want to protect themselves, because they are going to come here with an amendment that is going to try to give people the right to discriminate against people based upon their religion, the right to discriminate with Federal dollars on religion. 
   What Mr. Shuler's amendment does is to make sure that we do not weaken  the ability of faith-based organizations to participate, as they have over their proud history. That is why the broadest array of religious organizations will oppose what is going to be offered in the motion to recommit, but strongly support, strongly support, the Shuler amendment to add this language to the statute to provide this protection and to provide this recognition of the historical service and the ongoing service that these faith communities have provided to the children that are eligible for Head Start to provide that quality education year after year after year after year. 
   That is what this amendment does. We should welcome it. We should adopt it overwhelmingly in this House and get on with the debate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman and his cosponsors for offering this amendment.

I think the direction to the Secretary to review and to look at these barriers and to see what we can do to remove them so that we can assure both the participation of the children in the program and of their families and their parents as is designed by the law is important.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of final passage of S. 3406, the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008. 
   Since 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act has provided protection from discrimination for millions of productive, hardworking Americans so that they may fully participate in our Nation's schools, communities and workplace. Among other rights, the law guaranteed that workers with disabilities would be judged on their merits and not on an employer's prejudice. 
   But since the ADA's enactment, several Supreme Court rulings have dramatically reduced the number of individuals with disabilities who are protected from discrimination under the law. Workers like Carey McClure, an electrician with muscular dystrophy who testified before our committee in January, have not been hired or passed over for promotion by an employer regarding them as too disabled to do the job. Yet when these workers seek justice for this discrimination, the courts rule that they are not disabled enough to be protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. This is a terrible catch-22 that Congress will change with the passage of this bill today.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I fully understand the deep disappointment on behalf of the Republican Members, not all, but those who did not vote for the legislation last night to create a comprehensive energy policy for the future of this Nation. They were intent upon killing it. They fell short. They fell short because it was a bipartisan bill. A number of their Members crossed the aisle to vote for the legislation because they recognize this was about taking us to a new energy future, a future that no longer continued year after year after year, as we have under Republican control, increased dependence upon international oil from nations that are hostile to us in so many ways, of nations who inflate our economy in so many ways. 
   This legislation will make available billions of barrels of oil that is from the Minerals Management leasing, the administration of oil on the Outer Continental Shelf, more billions of barrels of oil in Alaska, in the National Petroleum Reserve that holds probably more oil than the OCS, that can be opened under legislation. And the royalties that are due this Nation will be put into a trust fund to create the research and the development of renewable and alternative energy resources that are so important if in fact we are going to break our dependence on foreign oil and on fossil fuels as a bedrock of the energy policy of this Nation. It is also going to stop the royalty holidays that oil companies who are making the largest record earnings in history are doing. 
   With that, I would like to return to the matter at hand and to thank the ranking member from across the aisle, Mr. McKeon, for all his work. I want to thank again Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Sensenbrenner. I certainly want to thank the staffs of this committee, on our side Sharon Lewis who demonstrated great leadership on this issue, Jody Calemine, Brian Kennedy, Chris Brown, our intern Tom Webb; on their side Jim Paretti, Ed Gilroy and Ken Sarafin; and Mr. Hoyer's staff, Michelle Stockwell and Keith Aboshar; and on the Judiciary staff Heather Sawyer and David Lockman.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Cummings, Mr. Clyburn, Mr. Scott and Mr. Cooper who have worked diligently to get this legislation to the floor. And I want to thank Mr. Keller and Mr. McKeon on the Republican side, and our House leadership and the Republican leadership for facilitating this. 
   The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital Financing Program was established by Congress in 1992 to help these schools fund capital projects to construct, rehabilitate, or renovate existing and new campus facilities. 
   Under current law, the HBCU Capital Financing Program has a legislative cap or limit to the total amount of bonds that the Secretary of Education may guarantee to provide loans to these schools to undertake their capital projects. 
   In dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Secretary exceeded, with congressional approval, the original cap that Congress imposed on the amount of bonds the Secretary could guarantee. Given the cap on such bonds was reached during the tragic events caused by Hurricane Katrina, the program is now unable to provide any loans to other schools. 
   The bill we are considering under suspension today will simply increase the lending authority of the Secretary and establish a new cap to ensure other HBCUs in the pipeline for consideration of such loans will receive those loans. This is a short-term solution to the capital needs of these schools, and we will continue to address the reauthorization in the Higher Education Act the Education and Labor Committee is currently considering. 
   So I want to thank all of those who participated in this legislation. 
   I also want to take a moment, as we are talking about historically black colleges, to remember a pioneer that we lost this last weekend, former Congressman Gus Hawkins, who is a former Chair of the Education and Labor Committee and a member of the California delegation. 
   He was a wonderful politician who had a great vision for this country on behalf of its students and workers. He fought every day of his public life to make their lives better in this country. He was a trailblazer in so many aspects, including advancing legislation that barred employment discrimination and increasing the minimum wage and access to colleges. 
   I had the honor of serving on the committee while Gus was the Chair and can attest to his passion and dedication to the issues that affect America's students and workers. 
   As a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the first African American to represent California in the Congress, he led the way for many legislators who are here today. 
   Gus was also the author of legislation which established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which continues to combat employment discrimination. Throughout his career, Gus Hawkins authored more than 300 pieces of State and Federal legislation, a feat that few can claim. 
   After retiring, he served as director of the Hawkins Family Memorial Foundation for Education, Research and Development, where Gus continued helping many young people find a path to college. 
   His voice is going to be missed, and I know my thoughts and thoughts of all of our colleagues are with the Hawkins family today. 
   I also want to say that Gus Hawkins was a wonderful friend of my mother and father when Gus and my father served together in the California legislature where they fought many of these same fights on the State level. They were a remarkable group of people who blazed these trails for justice, economic and social justice, in this country. Gus Hawkins set the bar and the standard very high for all of us, and I think it is fitting that we are also addressing the needs of the historically black colleges here on the day we  choose to remember him and the delegation will have an hour of remembrance and testimony to Gus and his great accomplishments tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, discrimination is anathema to everything this country stands for. It is anathema to the promise that is America. Regrettably, the recent Supreme Court's recent Ledbetter v. Goodyear decision threatens to turn back the clock on the progress we have made since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 more than 40 years ago. 
   The Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter severely restricts the right of employees to challenge pay discrimination. It ignores the realities of the workplace, prior precedent, and the clear intent of Congress. 
   Justice Ginsburg's dissent in this narrowly divided 5-4 decision called on Congress to reverse this decision, and that is what we are here to do today. 
   Lilly Ledbetter, the plaintiff in this case, worked for Goodyear for over 19 years. When she retired as a supervisor in 1998, she discovered that her salary was 20 percent lower than that of the lowest-paid male supervisor. Not only was Ms. Ledbetter earnings nearly $400 a month less than her male colleagues, she also retired, obviously, with a substantially smaller pension. 
   A jury found that Goodyear discriminated against Ms. Ledbetter, and she was awarded $3.8 million in back pay and damages. This amount was reduced to the $360,000 damage cap in title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
   Despite the jury's finding, the Supreme Court decided that while Goodyear discriminated against Ms. Ledbetter, and it is important that the Members understand that that is what the jury's determination was, they decided that her claim was made too late. Not that she was wrong, not that Goodyear was right. Her claim simply came too late. 
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act requires an employee to file an EEOC charge within 180 days of unlawful employment practices. Ms. Ledbetter filed within 180 days, as required, of receiving the discriminatory pay from Goodyear. In fact, she filed as soon as she found out that she was receiving discriminatory pay. She found out thanks to an anonymous note left in her mailbox. 
   But a slim majority of the Supreme Court found that, because Ms. Ledbetter did not file within 180 days of the discriminatory decision to write those discriminatory paychecks that she received for many, many years, her time had run out. She could not recover anything from Goodyear. 
   The majority's decision is absurd and entirely shuns the reason in order to satisfy this ideological agenda. 
   H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, is narrowly tailored and designed to restore the law on pay discrimination as it was before the Supreme Court's decision, the law as it was for some 35 years, the law as it was reaffirmed in circuit court after circuit court, as it was affirmed by the Congress of the United States. 
   This bill restores the law so that the 180-day statute of limitations clock runs when a discriminatory pay decision or practice is adopted, when a person becomes subject to the pay decision or practice, or when a person is affected by the pay decision or practice, including whenever she receives a discriminatory paycheck. In other words, every discriminatory paycheck is a violation of the act. That is as the law was for these many, many years. That is what we seek to do. 
   The bill makes it clear that a victim of pay discrimination is entitled to a full 2 years of back pay. That is as the law currently is. You are entitled to recover up to 2 years' back pay under title VII.     
   The bill ensures that these simple reforms extend to the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. H.R. 2831 restores the law to what it was for years before this recent Supreme Court decision in the Ledbetter case. 
   Circuit court after circuit courts have held that the receipt of a discriminatory paycheck is a new violation of the law. Lilly Ledbetter received her last discriminatory paycheck. She was then informed about it, and she filed within 180 days. That's what the law was, that's what she did, and then this Supreme Court decided somehow that she wasn't within her rights and that her claim came too late. 
   The EEOC, in its own compliance manual, states that ``discriminatory paychecks can be challenged so long as one is issued within the filing period, regardless of when the decision to issue them was made.'' Again, the law before the Supreme Court. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office reports that this would not establish a new cause of action for pay discrimination, it will not significantly effect the number of filings in the EEOC, and it will not significantly increase the cost of EEOC in other Federal courts. 
   Understand this: Unless Congress acts and employers who have made discriminatory pay decisions before 180 days ago, they will be allowed to lawfully continue discriminating against the people that they employ. If they can hide the discriminatory act for 180 days, they can then continue to discriminate far into the future if they got past the 180 days. That is why this is so important. 
   The law now tells employers it's okay to discriminate; if you can get away with it for 180 days, you're home free. All we're asking here is to restore the law as it was, which was that each paycheck was a discriminatory act, and under the law you had 180 days to file a claim. That's what this bill says. That's what the law said before. If you file that claim and you're successful, you can receive up to 2 years back pay to make up for that. That's what the law was. That's what we seek to do in this legislation. 
   This is the only decent thing to do. People say, well, she should have known or she should have asked around or she should have done this, should have done a lot of things. Except we know that also in many instances employers, in fact, have policies where they prohibit employees from asking another employee about their level of pay, about their compensation. 
   So the fact of the matter is this legislation is absolutely necessary to end these discriminatory practices on pay, be it against a woman, an African American, Hispanic, a person over 60. Whatever the conditions are, it should not be allowed to stand. We should return to the law as it was these many years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, let us understand something here. They can say it until the cows come home, but the fact of the matter is, this legislation restores the law to what it was before. Up until the Supreme Court made its ruling, each discriminatory check that was issued was a violation of the law, and you had 180 days from the issuance of that check when you discovered it to file a claim. This legislation would restore that law as it was. 
   If you file that claim, if you were successful in proving your claim, you could receive up to 2 years back pay. That was the law up until the Supreme Court decision. That would be the law if we passed this legislation. 
   Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that if we pass this law, the courts will be inundated with lawsuits. The people will wait 5, 10, 15, 20 to file a lawsuit, that there will be cases where the witnesses die and memories fade and long times will expire and we won't be able to have justice. It will be a huge cost on the business community. It will change our competitive stature in the world. It will limit economic growth. All of that from little Lilly Ledbetter.  
   What's the problem with that? If all of that was true, why haven't my colleagues come to the floor of the House in the 12 years they controlled the House of Representatives and the United States Senate and asked to change the law? Why hasn't the President of the United States, who's been in office for 6 1/2 years, asked to change the law? 
   Why hasn't that happened? Because none of the things you talked about happened under the previous law. It didn't change our competitiveness. They weren't involved in thousands of cases. People didn't wait 40 or 50 years to get 2 years back pay. No, none of those things happened. 
   But they want to scare people into believing if we go back to the law as it was before the Lilly Ledbetter case and the Supreme Court overturned all of these years of laws and justice and fairness and anti-discrimination provisions, that somehow all of these terrible things would happen, but they didn't happen, and that's been the law all of these years. 
   So, tomorrow we will get an opportunity to vote to restore the protections of every American citizen against pay discrimination, to restore justice to the workplace, to restore the right of an individual to be paid the same as those who are doing the same job for the same reasons and the same purposes. That's what we seek. That's all Lilly Ledbetter sought, but she couldn't get justice at the Supreme Court. No, she couldn't get it even though a jury found that that could be the situation. 
   So we're going to have to restore this for the people of this country, and again, we'll simply be restoring the law. You can tell the doomsday scenarios all day long. You can predict all of the things that are going to happen, but none of them have happened in the last 35 years. None of them have happened in the last 35 years. 
   So at least you ought to properly represent what the law was and what the law will be, and with that, I look forward to the conclusion of the debate tomorrow

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, as amended by the Senate. Earlier this month the House acted swiftly to pass this bipartisan legislation to ensure that students and families will be able to continue to access Federal loans they need to pay for college, regardless of what happens in the Nation's credit markets. 
   Over the past few weeks, the President has also voiced his support for this legislation. I am glad that the President has recognized the importance of this legislation, and am very pleased that with today's vote, we will have an opportunity to send to him this bill for his signature. 
   The bill we are considering today now includes some of the amendments added by the Senate to strengthen the purpose of the legislation. I want to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for all of their support for this legislation and all of their efforts to get it through the Senate on a timely basis. 
   Because today's vote is timely, the sooner we get this legislation to the President's desk, the sooner it can be implemented by the Department of Education. This week, many incoming freshmen will be reviewing their financial aid packages and making decisions on where they plan to attend college this fall. For many of these students, their families are already worried about paying bills in today's economy. They shouldn't also have to worry about whether Federal aid they depend on to pay for college will actually be there this fall when they need it. 
   Over the past few months, we have been closely monitoring what has been happening in the financial markets, and we have heard from stakeholders across the political and economic spectrum: The Department of Education, college financial aid officers, lenders, financial analysts, and students. Not surprising, we have heard varying predictions. Some believe that the lenders will continue to face trouble accessing capital for loans, and others believe that the markets will ease up. 
   Fortunately so far, the credit crunch has not prevented any student parent from getting the Federal loans for which they are eligible. But we believe that it is only prudent to prepare for the possibility that the ongoing stress in the Nation's financial markets could jeopardize access to student loans. 
   In addition to the provisions already passed overwhelmingly by the House  earlier this month, the legislation before us today includes additional measures approved by the Senate amendments. This amended legislation assures that loans made through the lender-of-last-resort program are made with similar terms and conditions as other FFELP loans. 
   It makes the Secretary's authority to designate entire institutions as a lender-of-last-resort program temporary. It ensures that guaranty agencies and lenders operating under the lender-of-last-resort program are subject to the same rules regarding inducements and conflicts of interest that other FFELP lenders are subject to.     
   It safeguards the lender-of-last-resort program from abuses by requiring guaranty agencies and lenders acting as lenders of last resort to report on loans made through the program. It protects taxpayers by requiring reporting on the cost of the lender-of-last-resort program as compared to the current loan program. Finally, the amended legislation reduces low-income students' reliance on Federal student loans by directing all loans generated by this legislation into the Academic Competitiveness and SMART grants. 
   I believe that these additions will enhance this bill by providing further protection for parent borrowers, boosting aid to low-income students, increasing accountability in the lender-of-last-resort program. 
   Now more than ever, families deserve every assurance that we are doing all that we can to make sure that they will continue to be able to finance their children's education. I am confident that our efforts, coupled with proper planning in the Department of Education, will help ensure that students are able to get the financial assistance they need to attend college this fall. 
   I would like to thank Mr. McKeon, our committee's senior Republican, Mr. Hinojosa, the subcommittee Chair, Mr. Keller, the senior Republican on the subcommittee, and all of their staff and all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their commitment to acting promptly on behalf of America's students and families. Again, thank you to Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their support. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in swiftly passing this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez), a member of the Education Committee. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, and thank my colleague, Congresswoman Slaughter, for her tireless work term after term to support this bill and ensure that it would eventually become law. 
   Over the past several years, genetic discoveries have progressed at a remarkable rate. Today, doctors and scientists have the ability to detect genes linked to common conditions like colon cancer and heart disease. Individuals who learn about their genetic risk factors can make lifestyle changes and begin treatments that prevent these conditions altogether. 
   But too many Americans don't take advantage of these amazing breakthroughs for a very practical reason. They fear that the information will be used to deny them health insurance or even a job. 
   While the best way to allay those fears would be to enact universal health care coverage for all, this bill is a fantastic first step. 
   By prohibiting discrimination on the basis of our genes, this bill will improve the chances that average Americans can benefit from cutting edge genetic science. It will promote better health care by helping Americans feel secure enough to learn about their genetic risk factors. 
   As the daughter of a father who suffers from Alzheimer's and a mother who suffers from arthritis, I personally understand the need to make genetic testing a positive step in understanding one's genetic predispositions and making health care choices. Genetic testing should not be a hindrance to getting or keeping one's job or health care benefits. 
   While this bill will accomplish many great things, I want to point out just two very important ones. Number 1, it will arm people with necessary and relevant information about their own health. And Number 2, it will ensure that people won't be penalized for seeking and using this valuable information. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we are celebrating, or we will shortly with a vote on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, known as GINA. And today we celebrate it with a great sense of unanimity and agreement about this legislation. But that clearly was not always true over more than the past decade. 
   This legislation has been controversial to some. It has had a shifting body of opponents to it over those many years. There are many who tried to ascribe attributes to this legislation that either wasn't intended to address or didn't exist at all. But the opposition was formidable. 
   But when we celebrate the passage of this legislation today, we must also celebrate the spirit of two women in the House of Representatives that persevered through all of the political debate, as hot it was from time to time, through all of the controversy, through much of the ignorance and misinformation about the legislation, but who, throughout that entire decade, understood the promise of this legislation,  both to those who would not be discriminated against in the future, but also the promise in terms of medical research and information that would become available to promote, not only cures and treatment, but greater scientific understanding of the genome and our make-ups and its impact on our health. 
   And those two women were Congresswoman Louise Slaughter from New York, and our colleague who is with us in the Chamber today, Judy Biggert from Illinois. 
   It's one thing to stand here and say we all agree today. But that wasn't the case, and that was what they kept pushing against year after year to get the Congress to understand the importance of this legislation. We come to that understanding rather late, when you consider that many of the States have taken the steps, many Nations have taken this step, but it's terribly important that we do it so people will be assured that no worker will be discriminated against because of his or her genetic information. 
   As I mentioned, 41 States have already led the way in passing laws to prohibit discrimination to individual health insurance markets. 34 States have passed laws to prohibit employers from discriminating in the workplace. And the Federal Government has banned discrimination against Federal Government employees. Every American deserves this protection. 
   In the last two decades we've seen incredible scientific advances in the diagnosis and the treatment of once untreatable, undetectable conditions. Scientists now have the incredible ability to identify genetic markers for disease that could and may never occur. Genetic testing can also help prevent diseases by identifying them early. 
   Despite this amazing potential of genetic testing, advancements have been stifled out of fear of what some may do with the results of those tests. Many Americans forego testing because of that fear, the fear of losing their jobs, the fear of losing their health insurance. 
   We pit that against the knowledge, the discovery and the treatment that would have been possible to those individuals, but the fear prevented them from coming forward. And this is not an isolated fear. 
   A 2006 research study showed that 85 percent of the respondents believe that without protections, employers would use genetic information to discriminate. 64 percent believe that insurers would use the information to deny critical coverage. 
   The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is clear. Title I of the bill prohibits group health plans and insurers from collecting or requesting genetic information with narrow exceptions. It also protects the privacy of this personal information. 
   Title II of the bill prohibits employers from collecting or using their employees' genetic information. It also prohibits employers from discriminating against employees in hiring, firing and other terms of conditions of employment based upon the genetic information. 
   This final bill makes it clear that, even though employers may not be held accountable for violations committed by health plans under title I, employers remain fully liable for any violations of title II, including violations involving health benefits. 
   It is well settled in this country's employment discrimination laws, such as title VII, the Age Discrimination Employment Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees in their health benefits. 
   We intend for the courts to continue to interpret employer obligations under GINA similarly to all other civil rights laws. GINA will protect workers like David Escher, a former worker at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad, who discovered his employer was trying to prove his injury was caused by a genetic disorder rather than work-related injury. This is precisely the type of discrimination and misuse of genetic information that we seek to prohibit in this bill. 
   The protections provided by GINA are long overdue, and Representatives Slaughter and Biggert have fought, over this last decade, for these important changes, these important provisions in the law. And I want to thank them for all of their hard work. 
   I also want to take a moment to thank the members of my staff, Michelle Varnhagen, Mark Zuckerman, Brian Kennedy, Jody Calemine and Michael Gaffin for all of their efforts. 
   From Congressman Andrews' staff, Carlos Fenwick. 
   Congresswoman Slaughter's staff, Michelle Adams, Cindy Pelligrini. 
   From Congresswoman Biggert's staff, Brian Petersen, Jaime Vickery. 
   And from Congressman McKeon's staff, Ed Gilroy and Jim Paretti. 
   From Congressman Dingell's staff, Pete Goodloe, Jeanne Ireland, Jessica McNiece, Gregg Rothchild, and John Ford. 
   From Congressman Frank Pallone's staff, Bobby Clark. 
   From Congressman Rangel's and Stark's staff, Cybele Bjorklund and Deb Mizeur for all of their assistance. 
   And in the Senate, from Senator Kennedy's staff, Dave Bowen, Portia Wu and Lauren McFerren. 
   And from Senator Snowe's staff, Bill Pewen. 
   And from Senator Enzi's staff, Ilyse Schuman and Keith Flannagan. And legislative counsel, Ed Grossman, Larry Johnson and Henry Christrup, for all of their assistance and all of the effort that they put in to making the changes and the distinctions between the actions in the House and the Senate, and all of the controversy that this brought with them. 
   With that, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time so that Ms. Biggert may make her closing remarks. And again, I want to thank her so much. Her membership on our committee makes us very proud. And her political toughness to see this through to the end, along with Louise Slaughter, is a wonderful story that we celebrate also with the passage of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (CORRECTING ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 493 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. This concurrent resolution makes two technical corrections to the GINA legislation just passed. First, with respect to the Department of Defense Labs, in our current bill, section 202(b)(6) and section 205(b)(6) of H.R. 493 provides an exclusion for an employer to conduct DNA analysis for law enforcement purposes as a forensic laboratory, which submits analyses to the Combined DNA Index System, known as CODIS, if the employer only uses that analysis of DNA identification markers for quality control to detect sample contamination. 
   However, we recently learned that the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, AFDIL, of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, which identifies soldiers' remains, would not be included in this exclusion because it does not submit DNA to the CODIS system. 
   It was not our intent to prevent the Armed Forces, AFDIL, from using DNA analysis for human remains identification. This technical change would allow them to continue their mission. 
   With respect to NAIC, the other change is a very minor one. Section 104 of the bill, dealing with Medigap, requires the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to modify their regulations to conform to GINA. The deadline for NAIC to make these modifications is June 30, 2008. If NAIC does not make these modifications by this timeframe, HHS would be required to make the modifications by October 1, 2008. 
   When this bill moved through the House last April, these deadlines were not a problem. However, with today being May 1, NAIC will not be able to meet the June deadline. Thus, the other change to this bill pushes back the NAIC and HHS deadlines until October 30, 2008, and July 1, 2009. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, in 1963 this Nation passed the Equal Pay Act, and it was passed to end discriminatory practices in paying men and women differently for performing the same job. The law's principle is that men and women should be paid based upon their merits, not upon an employer's prejudices. 
   Before the Equal Pay Act, women in the workplace were paid 59 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts for performing the same jobs. Although the wage gap between men and  women has narrowed since the Equal Pay Act was passed, gender-based pay wage discrimination remains a very significant problem for women. 
   According to the Census Bureau, women make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Just as disturbing is that African American women only earn 60 cents on the dollar, and Hispanic women earn an astonishing 55 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts. 
   Those figures do not just tell us what they lose in their wages on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, and on a monthly basis. But we must also understand that this wage disparity costs a woman anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million over a lifetime in lost wages and will follow her into retirement with lower retirement benefits, and will follow her into the Social Security system with lower Social Security benefits. 
   These women pay a great price because the law still allows employers to pay these individuals on a discriminatory basis for the jobs that they produce. But today this House has an opportunity to take a critical step to ensure that the Equal Pay Act lives up to its promise: equal work for equal pay, equal pay for equal work. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will strengthen the Equal Pay Act and close many of the loopholes that have allowed employers to avoid responsibility of engaging in discriminatory pay practices. Currently, an employer can refute a pay discrimination claim if he proves that the difference in pay is based upon any factor other than sex. They can pull any defense out of the air that they want, even if the factors are not related to the job. What we say is that they must provide a real business justification for not paying that equal wage. It must be related to the work. 
   They will have to show that any gender-based wage differential is job-related, not based on or derived from sex-based differentials, and is consistent with the business necessity. 
   H.R. 1338 will also prohibit employers from retaliating against employees who discuss their pay. We all remember the Lilly Ledbetter case. She did not know that she was being discriminated on every pay period because her fellow employees were unable to discuss their paychecks with her because that's the way the corporation kept the discriminatory practice secret and hidden from Lilly Ledbetter. We would not allow that to continue to happen. 
   The bill would also put gender-based discrimination sanctions on equal footing with other forms of discrimination by allowing women to sue for punitive damages, in addition to compensatory damages, just as business and workers may do under section 1981 for race or national origin discrimination. If we are serious about closing the gender pay gap, we must get serious about punishing those who would otherwise scoff at the current weak sanctions under the current law.     
   The Paycheck Fairness Act will require the Department of Labor to continue collecting pay information based upon gender. It also creates a program designed to help strengthen the negotiating skills of girls and women. 
   Any wage gap based upon gender is unacceptable, especially in these tough economic times. For families living near or under the poverty line, equal pay for women will make a significant difference in that family's well-being. 
   By allowing wage discrimination to continue, we hold down women, their families, and harm the American economy as a whole. Today, we have a chance to rectify those practices. Today, we have a chance to ensure that, in fact, women will receive equal pay for equal work as they do not now receive in the workplace because of the barriers that have been erected to their being able to prosecute those individuals who engage in a discriminatory practice. 
   Today, we are taking up this bill. And no one is more responsible for the House consideration of this legislation than Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro. I thank her for her tireless leadership on this bill, and the 230 cosponsors who are taking a strong stand against unequal pay. Congresswoman DeLauro has worked over a decade trying to get the Congress to pay attention to this problem that women face in the workplace, to this economic devastation that takes place against women in the workplace, the discriminatory practices that women face in the workplace, but there was no response in this body to her pleas. There was no response to the practices against these women in this body. Today there is. Today, this Congress, this House has an opportunity to finally enforce the Equal Pay Act and to make sure that women no longer have to suffer the discrimination of unequal pay. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4137, HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 4137, which strengthens and reauthorizes the Higher Education Act. In America, a college degree has always been the ticket to middle class. More and more, our future depends upon our ability to produce well-educated and skilled workers to take the jobs of the 21st century. 
   Over the past 2 years, this Congress has built a strong record of working in a bipartisan way to make college more affordable and accessible. Last year we enacted the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which provides for the single largest increase in Federal student aid since the GI Bill. 
   But we also know that there is still work to do to ensure that the doors of college are truly open to all qualified students who want to attend. The last time the Higher Education Act was authorized was 1998. In those 10 years that have passed, our world and our country have changed, and so have the needs of college-going students. 
   Today's students face a number of challenges on their path to college, from skyrocketing college tuition prices, to needlessly complicated student aid and application processes, to the predatory tactics of student lenders. This conference report will remove these obstacles and reshape our higher education programs in the best interests of students and families. 
   To address soaring costs, this legislation will increase the transparency and the accountability of the tuition pricing system, shining a bright light on the prices set by colleges and universities. It requires the Department of Education to create new, user friendly Web sites with helpful information on college prices and the factors that are driving these tuition increases. Colleges with the largest increases in tuition will be required to report their reasons for raising those prices. 
   This bill will also ensure that States hold up their end of the bargain in  funding higher education by establishing for the first time a maintenance-of-effort requirement on the States that receive Federal funds through the student loan program. This means while we are putting in money from the top from the Federal Government, the States will hopefully stop taking that money out of the bottom and leaving families and students who are borrowing loans to go to college no better off than they were before these actions. This is a dramatic change from the patterns of the past. 
   To better protect students while navigating the often murky world of college loans, this bill restores trust and accountability to the student loan programs by cleaning up the conflicts of interest between the lenders and the colleges. All Federal and private student lenders will be required to provide full and fair disclosure about the terms and conditions of the loans they offer. And to help borrowers' reliance on more expensive private loans, we will help ensure that students and families first exhaust the less expensive Federal loan and aid options before turning to private loans. 
   It will also help students manage their textbook costs. It provides students and faculties with complete pricing information before each semester so they can shop around for the most affordable deals. For the first time, textbook publishers will be required to offer less expensive versions of each expensive bundled textbook they sell. 
   This bicameral compromise also simplifies the Federal student aid application process and provides families with early estimates of their expected financial aid packages to help them better plan for their expenses a year ahead of the time. 
   In addition, H.R. 4137 will make Pell Grant scholarships available year-round for the first time. 
   It strengthens the TRIO and the GEAR UP college readiness and support programs that are critical to helping so many students stay in school and graduate. 
   It expands funding for graduate programs at historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and predominantly Black institutions. 
   It increases college aid and support programs for veterans and military families. 
   It ensures equal college opportunities and fair learning environments for students with disabilities. 
   It makes colleges safer for the entire campus community. 
   It encourages colleges and universities to adopt energy efficient and sustainable practices on their campuses. 
   I am confident that this legislation will improve the higher education system and make it more affordable, fairer and easier to navigate for students and families. Almost all of these students are borrowing money. Time is money, and time is effort, and we need to make this process more streamlined, fairer to families and fairer to students. 
   None of this, I want to say, would be possible without the leadership and the passion and the determination of Senator TED KENNEDY, and I would like to thank him for that.     
   Also, Senator Enzi and Senator Mikulski. Senator Mikulski stepped in when Senator Kennedy became ill and did a magnificent job of shepherding this bill and this conference report through the Senate. 
   I would also like to thank all the members of our committee for their hard work. And I would especially like to recognize Congressmen BUCK MCKEON, RUB&#201;N HINOJOSA, and RIC KELLER, and their staffs including Amy Raaf Jones, Moira Lenehan, and Ricardo Martinez. 
   And, finally, I would like to thank my staff for their tireless efforts on this reauthorization, including Mark Zuckerman, Alex Nock, Denise Forte, Stephanie Moore, Gaby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, Jeff Appel, Sharon Lewis, Margaret Young, Fred Jones, and Arman Rezaee. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, and members of the committee, I'm very proud of this legislation. I'm very proud of the members of my committee on both sides of the aisle. This legislation doesn't just belong to this committee at this time or to the majority party just at this time, this legislation has been worked on by many people on both sides of the aisle. 
   When the Republicans were in the majority and Mr. McKeon was the subcommittee chair, he pushed hard for this legislation. And Mr. Kildee has spent many years on our committee working on behalf of higher education. And Mr. Hinojosa authored legislation, along with Mr. McKeon, that made it through the House in the last session. 
   Why has that been true? Why is this legislation so broadly supported? Because we all understand the importance of a well-educated American population, and we all understand the urgency of this moment. At no time in our history has America needed a better educated population than it needs today. 
   And we understand the importance of a college education and what it means to America's families, what it means to young people as they start out in their careers, as they start out their families, and their ability to provide for themselves and go to jobs that are interesting, that work for them, that make sense for them, and yet be able to have the skills so they can continue in the American economic system. This legislation does all of those things. 
   This legislation helps to make college more affordable. It certainly helps to make it more accessible. And it has done that because of the agreements that we have reached on both sides of the aisle. Mr. McKeon has pushed long and hard for increases in the Pell Grants, long and hard for accountability in this system, and long and hard to make sure that the cost of college, that we have greater transparency, that we understand it better, that parents would be able to decipher, that students would be able to decipher and understand it. This legislation improves this act with respect to all of those provisions of the law. 
   I tried to recognize the contributions made by each Member on our side of the aisle and the programs that they worked on to increase access to college for so many populations that haven't been given the full opportunity in the past that will be able to take advantage of that opportunity. 
   And finally, this legislation makes it more affordable for many students. It's in combination with what we did in the reconciliation bill, where we provided $20 billion in new resources for students by cutting the interest rates, by providing forgiveness for loans, by increasing the Pell Grants, and providing real-time tuition assistance for those who want to go into teaching. 
   This is an important piece of legislation; it's important to the Congress, it's important to our Nation, it's important to families and students who struggle mightily to figure out how they can finance an education. 
   I think this is a big step in assuring that every qualified student should be able to afford college. They may have to borrow some money, but it's well worth that if they can achieve a college education. And I think it's going to make a major contribution to strengthening the American economy. 
   This is a moment in time legislation and authorization of the Higher Education Act. But for over 45 years, there has been a fixed star in increasing the opportunity for young people to go to college and increasing the wherewithal for families and students to afford a college education, and that was the Senator from Massachusetts, who, unfortunately, is not able to be with us as we pass this conference report today in the House and in the Senate, but he is with us in great spirit. He called the other day to congratulate us with great enthusiasm. He wasn't convinced we were actually going to get it done, and he said he was quite excited that we did. And he was looking forward to the passage of this legislation. 
   He has been a moving force for opportunity at all levels of society. But he, first and foremost, has understood the opportunity that education provides. Whether it's early childhood education, preschool education, elementary, secondary education, community colleges, 4-year colleges, graduate schools, Senator TED KENNEDY has been a champion of making sure that those doors are open to everybody in this society. And this legislation, I think, honors that commitment that Senator Kennedy has had for so many years as he has continued to sit on the Education Committee in the United States Senate and pound out this legislation that is so important to America's families, to America's students, and to America's economy. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I thanked them earlier, but I want to thank all the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank Mr. McKeon for his leadership on this issue, and certainly to all of the staff for their help. And happy birthday to Joe Novotny.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. It's a pleasure to yield 2 minutes to a member of our committee, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez). 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. I rise today in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act, to protect the right of all Americans to equal pay for equal work. I want to begin by thanking my colleague, Representative DeLauro, for introducing this bill, and Chairman Miller for steering it through committee and onto the floor. It is long overdue. 
   After years of neglect under the former majority, this House has boldly taken on the challenge of trying to solve longstanding economic problems so that hardworking families can really achieve the American Dream instead of just dreaming about the American Dream. 
   Women across America are still only paid 77 percent of what men are paid. Does this mean that women are only 77 percent as valuable as their male counterparts? Certainly not. It means there are, unfortunately, still lingering remnants of an earlier time in our history when women didn't have the same rights as men. 
   Though we have made great strides toward fair and equal treatment for women in the workplace, our work is still not done. This bill continues our progress by creating more opportunities for women and their families. Nearly 7 1/2 million of America's poverty-stricken children live in female-headed households. This bill will help those families rise out of poverty by ensuring the hard work of female-headed households is rewarded equally and fairly. 
   Much has been said about this bill lining the pockets of trial lawyers. Let's not lose focus of what this bill is about. It is saying to women that if you have been wronged, if you have  been discriminated against, you will have a fair day in court. 
   So, for yourselves, your wives, your sisters, your daughters, and the children of America, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on this important piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, we have come to the end of a long debate, but let's get something very clear. This is all about equal pay, and this is all about whether or not women are going to receive equal pay. What this legislation does is recognize the barriers that have been put up in front of women trying to enforce the existing law. 
   It is rather interesting that the Secretary of Labor sent us a letter, and in her random audits of businesses working with government contractors she found systematic discrimination and she collected $51 million, and this is a record year, and it is the third record year in a row because of systematic discrimination. 
   Now, everybody has come to the floor and said they are all against this discrimination. Yes, we all are against that. Nobody is suggesting that anybody isn't. But if you can't enforce your rights, then you suffer the discrimination. Random audits, $51 million was denied to these individuals. And these are just people working with government contractors. Think what it is nationwide, and the people don't get a random audit, they don't get the Secretary of Labor, they don't get the Department of Labor. What they get is discrimination in their pay. That is what they get. 
   Today, we are going to decide whether or not these women are going to be able to collect the pay that is owed them, whether they are going to be able to enforce the law that requires as a matter of national policy and law the equal pay for women. That is the issue here. It is not complicated. It is not complicated. 
   Study after study has determined that pay discrimination exists whether you are in the workforce 10 years, whether you are starting out in the workforce, no matter what your life experiences are. When they control for all of that, there still is discriminatory pay against women in the American workforce, and today this House is going to change that.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I would just join in what my colleagues have already said, that I don't think this needs further study. And I think, certainly, the idea of basing whether or not this law will be enacted on a single study by this Secretary of Labor within 90 days, when we have a decade of studies, very few that have been challenged for their accuracy, that continues to tell us that, while the situation has improved, we still have this huge disparity between the pay of men and women for the same jobs, for the same responsibilities. 
   And this legislation is designed to rid us of that disparity. It is designed to rid us of that discrimination, and it is designed to give women the tools that they need to go in and to enforce their rights. And I would hope that we would support this legislation, that we would reject this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

We think that these grants to increase the negotiating skills of young women and girls, all women, are very important.

   Mr. Flake has offered this language so that hopefully it would not be earmarked, and that language hopefully will be respected by other committees of the Congress, and we would accept the amendment.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. You gotta love these guys. They've argued all day that pay disparity doesn't exist in this country, in spite of all the studies by governmental agencies, by their own governmental agencies, the Department of Labor, the EEOC, and all the rest, that a woman today can still make 77 cents on the dollar for every dollar that a man earns. They've argued all day. 
   Now they've introduced a motion to recommit that accepts the fact of the existence of these pay disparities. They want to argue that they're exacerbated by high energy costs. We grant you that argument. 
   But then what do they want to do in their last act as they leave for August break? They want to suggest that a woman who has been discriminated against intentionally, unintentionally, discriminated against in pay, paid 77 cents for every dollar, or 20 cents for every, we don't know, that woman is going to have a cap on her attorneys' fees. 
   They put it at $1,000 to get your blood rushing. But you know who doesn't have a cap? The employer who discriminated against that woman doesn't have a cap on their attorneys' fees. That employer doesn't have a cap of $1,000. Is it $1,000 if it's a complicated case and that woman needs two attorneys or three attorneys or four or five experts to prove this discrimination?     
   She has a cap on those. The employer needs five experts, no cap; five attorneys, no cap. 
   Your last act of discrimination in denying discrimination is to make sure that they can't recover the wages that are due them, and you ought not to be able to do this. You ought not to be able to do that on the floor of this House. You simply should not be able to do that. 
   This is about whether or not women will have the tools necessary to get rid of the wage discrimination that costs them money every hour, every week, every month and every year, and it follows them into their retirement. You've heard it here today. It can cost them as much as $2 million in lost Social Security, in lost retirement benefits, in lost wages. And now they want to suggest that those women who may lose $2 million have a cap on their ability to recover. 
   I hope Ms. Lilly Ledbetter is watching you guys, because now she understands what your problem was.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, there is no more time. Time has run out. We have seen this discrimination documented time and again in all different kinds of businesses, all different kinds of occupations. It doesn't matter your education or your experience, this discrimination exists, and we have the opportunity with this vote tonight to put an end to it, to allow these women to enforce existing law. 
   We don't change the law. We give them the right to enforce the law. And if they don't have that right, they have no justice and the law means nothing. That is why we continue to see tens of thousands of cases of wage discrimination where women can't afford to go in and recover the wages. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote down this motion to recommit and with great pride vote for final passage of this legislation to end wage discrimination, and with that vote to recognize the phenomenal work of ROSA DELAURO in seeking out justice for women all across this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for all of his hard work in struggling on this issue and our troops and force strength, Mr. Speaker. 
   But I rise in strong support of this bipartisan resolution regarding the Iraq war. I rise in strong support to this resolution to say to the President, no more. I rise in strong support of this resolution to say to the President, your policy is wrong. Yes, you have tried the surge before, and the surge has not brought peace to Iraq. It has not brought an end to the insurgency. It has not brought an end to the sectarian war that is going on in that country every day. 
   Yes, this is the fourth time that the President tried this policy, and it has not worked in any of those times. When we pass this bipartisan resolution, the President should pause. Because, at that moment, the President will not have the support of the United States House of Representatives; and, at that moment, the President will not have the superintendent of the people of the United States. 
   The President better think long and hard about he really believes that he should commit these troops, and continue to commit these troops, without the authority of the people, without the authority of this Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, American men and women have been fighting in Iraq, and they will soon begin their fifth year. In 5 years, they have done all that we have asked them. But what we have asked them to do cannot be accomplished by the military. 
   We have known for some time that Iraq now requires a political solution, and it requires the Iraqi government, the Iraqi people, the Iraqi society and the communities to take hold of their country and to decide whether they want a future of continued sectarian violence or whether they want an orderly society. They must make that decision. 
   The President has had it wrong for many, many months, for many years. He has continued to say that, as the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down. Mr. President, you have it wrong. As we begin to stand down, they will begin to stand up. 
   The fact that our military troops are on the streets of Baghdad and Anwar Province and elsewhere enables people to continue a level of violence that randomly and wantonly takes the lives of men, women and children, innocent bystanders, for almost no good reason at all, no good reason at all. It allows that to continue because each knows, if it gets out of control, the American troops will ride to the rescue, the helicopters will come, and the missiles will fly. We are the enablers of the continuation of this violence. 
   Once they have to take responsibility for their actions, once we leave, this is no longer an insurgency. This is crime on crime, Iraqi against Iraqi. Somebody has got to take the responsibility for that, and that will not be us. We will not be able to bring it to an end. The Iraqi government will be. 
   The time has come for our troops to leave. The time has come for us to understand that we cannot cure what is wrong in Iraq. 
   But for these troops that are there and for the troops that are being sent in spite of the will of the American people and the will of the Congress, we ought to understand that they should be fully equipped. We should not repeat the history of this administration in this deployment where men and women were sent into the theater without proper vehicle armor, without proper body armor, without proper interpreters and without proper training. 
   Many Members have come to this floor for many hours now and said, what is the message you are sending to your troops? 
   What was the message the Congress is sending? 
   What was the message this Congress sent to the troops when the President allowed them to go to war without enough troops to secure the peace? 
   What was the message this Congress sent when it allowed the troops to go to combat without proper vehicle armor? 
   What was the message that the Congress sent when it allowed our troops to go into combat without proper protective armor?  
   What was the message this Congress sent to the troops when it allowed this President to continue this failed course with no adjustment over the past 4 years? 
   And what was the message that we sent to the troops when it allowed the President to effectively draft American volunteers by continuing their tours, shortening their time at home, shortening their time with their families and sending them back without proper training, shortened training and without proper equipment? 
   We cannot do that to the troops. The message of this resolution is we are not going to do that. We are not going to do that. We will make a pledge to you that we will not let you fight and die forever with no plan to get you out, with no exit plan for you, with no change in the policy that has led tragically to so many deaths and so many wounded. 
   That is what this resolution is about. That is the message we must send to the troops, and that is the message we must send to the Iraqi people, that they must take responsibility. 
   This surge is not an election-day surge. This isn't a constitutional-day surge. This is a surge for the purpose, this is an escalation for the purposes of door-to-door combat, street by street, block by block, house by house. 
   Yet today we see General Schoomaker saying in the paper that these troops that are getting engaged in this up-close battle in the midst of the Iraqi people will not have enough interpreters. They will not have civil affairs soldiers. They will not have enough translators. So now we are putting them again where they are at greatest risk, and this Congress is agreeing to go forward and repeat history and put them at risk when it is not necessary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to recognize the difficult choices that the Appropriations Committee had in dealing with the education portion of this legislation. At a time when this administration is almost $55 billion behind its promises to the American people, to the parents of this country, to the children of this country, to the educators of this country, of the resources that would be available in title I, we find that, in fact, we are only going to be able to add about $1 billion, a little over $1 billion this year, which is completely insufficient, at a time when schools and school districts are struggling to make the reforms required under No Child Left Behind. 
   But I want to thank the Appropriations Committee, because as difficult as that choice is to only provide that small amount of money, they were able to make of that portion of the money almost $500 million available to schools in need of improvement. These are schools that we were supposed to have started helping out 3 and 4 years ago. This is the first time this money has ever been put in this budget to help these schools that have been recognized as needing very substantial improvement to improve the opportunities of the children in those schools for a decent education, but this bill is the first time that we have done that. The administration has ignored that over the last 6 years. 
   I also see that the committee was able to restore some of the money for educational technology, a subject that is becoming more and more important in terms of improving our schools, improving the opportunity of students to learn, and improving opportunities for students to understand the technologies that they are going to have to grasp in the workplace and in higher education. The President's budget zeroed that money out. The Appropriations Committee, under the leadership of Mr. Obey, was able to restore almost all of it, the money that was available in the last year. 
   Now I see that we have been able to add $259 million to IDEA, which is able to take it above the President's request, which was a cut in education for students with disabilities. Once again, the Republicans, when they were in the minority, promised that they would fully fund IDEA because districts are struggling with the education of students with disabilities, and they signed letters, they passed resolutions, they did all of it. The day they came in power, they stopped funding IDEA. So it has been flat-funded while school districts struggle with both trying to deal with school reform and the education of students with disabilities. 
   So this committee, I think, made some good choices, difficult choices, insufficient choices. But if you look at what the President had recommended for educational technology, if you look at what the President had recommended to help schools with English learners in those schools, this is a dramatically better budget, but an insufficient budget for the education, but it is completely insufficient for the education of America's children. Don't go home and tell your constituents how well you understand the tools that they need to compete in a globalized world, in a globalized economy, because you have absolutely failed to provide them, and this administration has failed to provide them. 
   Fortunately, the Appropriations Committee has been able to recalibrate some of the numbers and to move some of the money around for these high-priority areas. I am only so sorry that we weren't able to do better by America's children and their families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House will take up H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007. 
   This legislation is sponsored by two of my distinguished colleagues, Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER, who has been waiting 10 years to debate this bill on the floor of the House of Representatives, and Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT, who has been a member of the committee which I chair, the Committee on Education and Labor, and I commend the sponsors for their hard work and for their perseverance. 
   This bill is long overdue. The Human Genome Project started the revolution in science and medicine nearly 20 years ago by identifying the specific chromosomes within the genes that make up the human body. Once the scientists identified and understood these genetic building blocks, they developed tests that identified genetic markers for diseases that could, but may never, occur. 
   We understand that this scientific revolution can and will save lives. It can save children from devastating illnesses, and once these tests and treatments become more widely available, they will help us live longer lives with less debilitating diseases. 
   The key to unlocking this scientific revolution is to assure individuals of genetic privacy and nondiscrimination when they undergo genetic testing and counseling. Many Americans already forgo testing for fear of losing their jobs and their health insurance. In a 2003 National Institutes of Health study, 39 percent of the individuals surveyed cited fear of losing their health insurance as the most distressing issues related to genetic testing.     
   There is a clear need for us to pass this law to protect genetic information from discriminatory uses. We all suffer if fears of lost jobs or health insurance stifle these scientific advances. 
   That is why 41 States have passed laws to prohibit discrimination in the individual health insurance market. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Given the importance of this legislation, it is hard to believe it has been stuck in the Congress of the United States for 10 years, but it has been. Maybe our reporting it today off of the floor is a tribute to a fresh start. 
   This is a very, very important piece of legislation to the health of the Nation and to the world. The advocacy of LOUISE SLAUGHTER has reminded us almost every day in those 10 years what we were missing by not passing this legislation and making it available so that we could get on with the wonderful discovery and the wonderful help that could be provided to individuals, to their families and to our communities. And the National Institutes of Health is to be commended, with all of the assistance they provided and all of the information provided to this Congress. 
   With that, I also want to thank the staffs of the three committees on both sides of the aisle for all of their work. They put in a lot of hours to get this resolved so that we could come to the floor and work over the differences that were there sometimes between the committees.

   Currently, there is no paid Federal parental leave policy. If Federal employees wish to start a family or expand their family, they must take unpaid leave or cash in their sick or vacation days so that they may continue receiving an income while they are at home. 
   With the rising prices of food and gas, unpaid leave poses an even greater economic hardship for working families, not to mention the extra costs that are associated with providing for a newborn. 
   Unfortunately, the absence of a family leave policy for Federal workers forces mothers and fathers choose what is more important: either stay at home with their infant and forgo a steady income or head back to work without spending adequate recovery or bonding time with their newborn. 
   The Federal Government lags behind the private sector in this area. The current lack of a parental leave policy for our Federal employees impairs efforts to hire and retain the best and the brightest our Nation has to offer. 
   Family-friendly policies like guaranteed paid leave not only help parents balance work and family, but will also help ease our, impending Federal personnel crisis. Federal employers will benefit from increased retention rates, decreased absenteeism, and improved productivity. 
   Several States have taken the lead to provide coverage for employees. In fact, over 6 years ago, California successfully enacted a paid parental leave law and it has been a great success. New Jersey recently passed a similar law in April and several other States even cover maternity under their disability insurance laws. 
   H.R. 5781 seeks to amend the current Federal family leave policy by allowing mothers and fathers up to 4 weeks of paid lave for the birth or adoption of a child. Federal employees should not have to make choice between their family and their job but should be covered under a fair, paid parental eave policy. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5781, The Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I rise in very strong support of H.R. 2262, and I congratulate its sponsor, Chairman NICK RAHALL.  
   The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 will finally end the give-away of our public lands and minerals. The bill secures a fair return for taxpayers on minerals taken from public lands, and it will provide for environmental standards and cleanup for hardrock mining. 
   For 135 years, American hardrock mining policy has given away public resources, and it has left each new generation a larger legacy of unreclaimed lands and degraded streams. 
   The 1872 mining law is long overdue for comprehensive reform. 
   The American taxpayers deserve an updated mining policy, and so does our natural environment. 
   Chairman RAHALL and I have been striving to update this antiquated law for decades, and thanks to his leadership, we are closer today to success than we have ever been. 
   The Natural Resources Committee's effort to reform mining law began in the early 1990s, when I chaired the committee, but we were derailed by the Republican rule. 
   Chairman RAHALL has spent 20 years introducing bills in this House to get to this point. He has persevered against indifference, opposition, and intensive lobbying. 
   Today, he has brought a bill to the floor of the House that takes a major step towards reform after many long years of struggle. 
   The 1872 mining law allows mining companies to take billions of dollars worth of gold, silver and other minerals from public lands for free. 
   We no longer treat any other resource that way--not coal, oil, or gas--yet under the archaic mining law, we still give away gold with no compensation to the taxpayers who own it. 
   And over the years, the price tag for mining cleanup has risen astronomically. Since the House last acted on reform legislation, more than 20 mines and mills have been added to the Superfund National Priority List. 
   The EPA Inspector General has warned of nearly $24 billion in cleanup costs for mine sites, some of which will require treatment ``in perpetuity.'' 
   The 1872 law's failings have had a serious impact on California and the West. The mining law has remained in effect while Northern California's Iron Mountain mine spewed out nearly a quarter of the copper and zinc discharged by industries to the Nation's surface waters; as historic lands of the Indian Pass area in the southern California desert faced destruction from the proposed Glamis mine; during decades of efforts to control acidic, metal-laden discharges from an old sulfur mine southeast of Tahoe; and as the city of Grass Valley spends millions to treat hazardous mine discharges and fight a giant mining corporation in court. 
   The bill that is before us today, the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007, will: put certain irreplaceable public lands off limits to mining, secure a fair return for taxpayers with a royalty on minerals taken from public lands, halt the sale of public lands to mining claimholders, adopt modern environmental standards for hardrock mining; and establish a program to clean up abandoned mines. 
   I congratulate the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, NICK RAHALL, and Energy Subcommittee Chairman JIM COSTA, our California colleague, for their leadership on this issue. 
   I also want to commend the staff of the Natural Resources committee for their years of hard work to get us to this point. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this major legislative accomplishment, which will be celebrated by future generations of Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. 
   America is still the number one economy in the world, and we can keep that leadership. But we can only do so with a level of determination and commitment that we have not shown in almost half a century. Other countries are making aggressive investments in a competitive workforce. We must exceed those efforts. 
   That is why--nearly 2 years ago--then-Minority Leader NANCY PELOSI laid down a challenge to Congress and the President to invest in innovation in order to create vibrant industries, a strong economy, and good jobs here at home. Now, with Speaker PELOSI at the helm and Democrats determining the agenda before Congress, we are acting on that challenge. 
   Working with leaders from the hi-tech and bio-tech industries, venture capitalists, and academics, Democrats laid out a plan to boost America's competitiveness. We made it clear to the American people that we take this challenge seriously. 
   Today, we are taking the next steps on our commitment. The bill before the House today is an important step for America's future economic strength and the strength of America's middle class. 
   Mr. GORDON's legislation is a strong step in reaching a key goal of our innovation agenda. This bill will educate 25,000 highly qualified math and science teachers by creating high quality programs that integrate the strong teaching of both education programs as well as strong research and content area instruction. 
   In the Education and Labor Committee, we are also working to create a new generation of innovators by ensuring that today's students are taught to high academic standards and receive the workplace skills that are necessary to prepare them as scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in a global high-tech economy. 
   The Committee will work toward the goals of innovation agenda by educating 100,000 new innovators in the next five years. We propose a new public-private partnership with the business community and higher education institutions to produce well-qualified, highly-skilled workers by establishing Congressional Science fellowships and interdisciplinary Master's programs in science, engineering, and math that include specialized training and internships with business partners, and loan forgiveness options.  
   Additionally, we will build on the work of Mr. GORDON by placing a highly qualified teacher in math, science, and technology K-12 classrooms by offering up-front tuition assistance to talented undergraduates majoring in math, science or engineering who agree to teach in a high-needs school and by partnering community colleges with 4-year institutions to improve the teacher pipeline. 
   Lastly, we need to enhance the ability of states to coordinate education and workforce goals, identify the challenges of recruiting students and retaining them in innovative fields, and develop collaborative solutions through statewide coalitions of education, business, and community leaders, such as P-16+ Councils. 
   America's entrepreneurial, innovative spirit is one of the key reasons for our strength in the world today. If we match that spirit to these substantial investments, our economy will stay strong for generations to come. I look forward to continuing to press forward with other elements of the Innovation Agenda and to make sure that America stays No. 1 in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (IRAQ RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, as already has been noted this evening, tomorrow the House will begin a 3-day debate on the question of whether or not we support the escalation of the war in Iraq by supporting the President's policy to send over 21,000 additional troops to Baghdad, what is called the surge, but is in fact an escalation of the war and of the exposure of our American troops in Iraq. 
   It is an important debate, and it will be an important vote. It will be a very simple proposition: Either you support the escalation or you do not. This is the vote that the American people have been asking for now for many, many months. They certainly expressed it in the election. They have expressed it since the election where we see time and again they are telling the country, they are telling those of us who are in the Congress of the United States that they do not support this policy; they want an exit plan; they want our young men and women brought home from Iraq; and they want the Iraqis to take responsibility for the political decisions that must be made if Iraq is in fact going to be a unified country, if Iraq in fact can proceed along a road to building democratic institutions and hopefully finally building a democracy.     
   But none of that, none of that will be done by the troops from America. None of that can be done by the troops from America. The fact of the matter is that that must be done by the Iraqi people.  
   But there will be those in this debate who will be defending the President's failed strategy in Iraq by attacking the President's critics. They ask, what message would America send to its troops in combat if Congress votes to repudiate the President's plan? What message, indeed? 
   Mr. Speaker, the question really is, what message did Congress send to our troops from the very beginning of this miserable war? 
   What message did Congress send to the troops in the beginning of this miserable war when they voted to go to war based upon the lack of proper evidence, false evidence, manipulated evidence and, in fact, outright lies to the American people and to the world about the situation in Iraq, and certainly a war that was not vital to the interest of the United States? 
   What message did Congress send when it allowed the President to go to war without enough troops to secure the peace? 
   What message did the Congress send when it allowed our troops to go into combat without proper armored vehicles? 
   What message did Congress send when it allowed our troops to go into combat without proper protective body armor? 
   And what message did the Congress send when it allowed the President to continue a failed course in Iraq with no adjustments in strategy? 
   What message did Congress send when it allowed the President to effectively draft American volunteers by continuing their tours of duty over and over again? 
   And what message did the Congress send to our troops, indeed? 
   But there is a new Congress now and there is a new message for our troops. By raising objections to the President's failed strategy, and by demanding a new course in Iraq and the immediate and responsible redeployment of our forces, we will send a new and clear message to our troops. Our message to the American forces in combat is that we will not let you fight and die forever in Iraq with no plan to get you out, with no exit plan. Our message is that we will insist that the Iraqis take responsibility for their country and the building of a democracy, and that soon American forces will be brought home or redeployed to fight the real war on terror. 
   Our message is that the American forces will not be used to fight Iraq's civil war. Our message to the President's few remaining supporters in the House and Senate is, do not exploit our brave troops in combat in a desperate and vain effort to bolster a weak President. Do not use our brave men and women serving in Iraq to cling to a misguided policy that is dangerous for America's interests and for its troops as well. 
   Join us in opposing the escalation of the war in Iraq, and when we see that history is now repeating itself, where once again the administration is prepared to send our soldiers into Iraq without proper equipment and without proper training, demand, instead, a new strategy to get America out of Iraq's civil war, to get Iraq to take responsibility for its own future, and to use our troops for the proper mission, to defend America.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, as the Chinese Government was repressing peaceful Tibetan protests last month, I visited Dharamshala, India--the recognized home of Tibetans in exile--with Speaker Pelosi and several of my colleagues. 
   I had the honor and privilege to meet His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, and I was moved by the infinite patience and courage he exudes in the face of overwhelming odds. I was touched by the large population of Tibetans in exile who worry about family members they have left behind. These are people who left their homeland due to repression of religion and language by the Chinese Government and the constant violations of basic human rights and dignity in their own land. 
   The Speaker, along with everyone else on our trip, was incensed at the atrocities conducted by China. Our first order of business upon returning to the United States was to draft this important resolution before the House today. 
   Through this resolution, we call on the Government of the People's Republic of China to end its crackdown on nonviolent Tibetan protestors and its continuing cultural, religious, economic, and linguistic repression inside Tibet and to begin a dialogue directly with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. 
   The freedom of press is something we take for granted in the United States but Tibetans unfortunately do not enjoy this privilege, as all press inside Tibet, and all of China in fact, is closely monitored and controlled by the state. This resolution calls on the Chinese Government to allow independent international monitors and journalists, free and unfettered access to Tibet. 
   It is clear by the conviction and sentencing of human rights activist Hu Jia, who has been an outspoken critic of the human rights record of the Chinese Government and called on the international community to hold Beijing responsible for the promises it made when bidding to host the Olympic games, that China has no intention of unilaterally changing it's human rights record. The government of China has been and continues to be an abuser of basic human rights despite the State Department decision to not include China in a list of countries that most systemically violate human rights. This resolution asks the United States Department of State to publicly issue a statement reconsidering its decision. 
   The cause of the Tibetan people is a desire for freedom of religion, freedom to speak their own language, and to express their unique identity. It is a cause every American can relate to. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this resolution--to vote in support of Tibet.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (END THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to give voice to tens of millions of Americans throughout our country who are looking for an end to the war in Iraq. I rise on behalf of our brave soldiers on our battlefield who have done everything our country has asked of them under terrible circumstances and who have made terrible sacrifices. 
   I rise on behalf of their families who have suffered great losses and who worry day and night for their safety and for the loved ones still in combat. I rise this evening to call on our President to give the Nation what it has deserved, a viable plan to safely bring this war to an end, to redeploy the American forces out of Iraq, and turn the future of Iraq over to the Iraqi people once and for all. 
   President Bush is soon expected to call for an escalation to the war in Iraq, seeking to deploy an additional 20,000 troops into combat. The President's plan would be just the latest in a series of flawed and tragic decisions that he has made regarding Iraq. 
   The President was advised at the outset of the war by one of his top generals to send a large American force in order to win. President Bush rejected that idea, and since then he has tried at different times a surge of American troops in an effort to win the war. Now, each time that effort has failed. 
   Now he appears ready to defy the odds and take great risks with the lives of others in order to try his plan one more time. The President has failed to make a compelling case for adding more troops into what is clearly the greatest American foreign policy disaster in half a century or even longer. 
   I applaud the efforts of House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader HARRY REID, who have called for a new course in Iraq. On Friday they wrote: ``Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next 4 to 6 months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.'' 
   I implore the President to seriously consider these views, and I implore him to also consider the views of the current and former military and political leaders of his own administration who have openly questioned sending additional troops to Iraq. For instance, on December 17 in 2006, former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, ``I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work.'' 
   On November 15 General Abizaid expressed, ``I've met with every divisional commander. General Casey, the Corps commander, General Dempsey--we all talked together. And I said, `In your professional opinion, if we were to bring more American troops now, does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in Iraq?' And they all said no.'' 
   The war in Iraq is a mistake from the beginning, and I voted against authorizing this war. But regardless of one's position then, clearly there is no sound basis now for increasing America's military presence in Iraq. The war has claimed the lives of over 3,000 American soldiers and has wounded more than 20,000, and it has clearly become a civil war. 
   It is unconscionable to ask one more American soldier to fight and die in a civil war in Iraq. The President must engage key nations like Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and others in an effort to create a political solution in Iraq. The Nation opposes the ongoing war in America. There is still time for the President to change course, to reconsider his call for 20,000 more troops in Iraq, and to begin the redeployment of our troops and our forces now. 
   I salute those who continue to serve in Iraq. I salute their families and pledge to them my unyielding support and respect as we try to safely bring the war to an end. 
   Mr. President, listen to the people of the Nation which you govern. They have spoken, and they have spoken overwhelmingly. They reject the prolonging of the war in Iraq. They want our soldiers redeployed and brought home safely, and they want it done now. 
   Please, Mr. President, listen to the people of this Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H. Con. Res. 74 sponsored by Congressman MIKE THOMPSON. Passage of this bill will express federal support for Hydrocephalus research. 
   Hydrocephalus, a chronic neurological condition that causes cerebrospinal fluid to build up in the brain cavity instead of being reabsorbed into the body, is a disease that affects over one million Americans. This disease can cause head enlargement and blurred vision, learning disabilities and impaired physical development and is fatal if untreated. 
   Like many other diseases that affect a relatively small portion of our population, Hydrocephalus research lacks proper funding. It is deplorable that the current standard treatment, which requires the insertion of a shunt into the brain to drain out the fluid, was designed in 1952. Shunts are extremely prone to infections and frequently require repair through major surgery. 
   Modem medicine can do better. I am certain that with federal support for additional research we can develop a better treatment, if not a cure, for those suffering from Hydrocephalus and help them live healthier, fuller lives.  
   I applaud my colleague, Mr. THOMPSON, for his efforts in this area and I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PELL GRANT EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 990, the Pell Grant Equity Act of 2007. 
   This is a bill that is designed to adjust an inequity in the current law that works against the interest of many college students in those States that have low tuition. 
   At a time when we have seen tuition and fees of public colleges and universities increase significantly, there is a notable exception to that trend, and that is that California community colleges recently decreased their tuition and fees from $26 a credit to $20 a credit. For a student taking 13 credits for two semesters, they save $520 in tuition for the year. This is almost unheard of in a day of skyrocketing college costs. Unfortunately, a provision in the Higher Education Act penalizes students attending low-cost institutions, such as California's community colleges. 
   The provision known as ``tuition sensitivity'' reduces the Pell Grant for the neediest of students attending higher education institutions with the lowest tuition. The result is that thousands of low-income students receive a lesser Pell Grant. 
   The Pell Grant Equity Act eliminates this discriminating provision in the law, ensuring that students receive the full amount of the Pell Grants they are entitled to receive. This is a very important bill for these students and for their families.  
   This is legislation that my colleague, Mr. McKeon, the senior Republican on the committee, worked very hard last year to get into the Higher Education Act. It was passed on the floor of the Congress. He worked very hard to bring this matter to the attention of all of the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, but as you know, that legislation was not passed in the end, and that is why we are here today because this has an immediate impact on those students who find themselves in this situation. And I want to thank him for all of the effort that he made to adjust this inequity in the law over the last couple of years as we have tried to deal with this within the Higher Education Act. 
   This bill is a 1-year fix, and we do so because we anticipate that this would cover the upcoming academic year. And we would hope to be able to make the permanent changes when we reauthorize the Higher Education Act in this Congress. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, our bill will help approximately 96,000 students receive an average of $100 more in a Pell Grant aid. Sometimes that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but in grant aid to these students and these families, this is an important amount of money because it is not just the tuition that is going down, it is other costs continue to go up. 
   This increase will help make a real difference for these students in meeting not just their tuition costs, but the costs of their books, their supplies, transportation, room and board, and expenses that quickly add up. 
   We know this is an issue because we have received letters and heard stories from the community colleges, from the students and from their families. It is a situation where you can find two siblings, one at Cal State school and another at a nearby community college. Both students take similar courses, enrolled full-time, live at home, commute to colleges, both have filed Federal financial aid forms and have an expected family contribution of zero. So both qualify for the maximum Pell Grant. Due to the current rules, the sibling attending the community college will receive $402 less, even though the educational costs overall are the same for those two individuals. 
   That is why we need to pass this legislation today. It has strong bipartisan support. And it will keep the Pell Grant as a strong part of our Federal student aid program targeted to those in the most need. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, earlier in the first few hours of this session, this Congress took a bipartisan vote to cut interest rates for the neediest students who are borrowing money. Those same group of students, many of them are still eligible for the Pell Grant. This action we take today, again on a bipartisan basis, I think will be very helpful to these students and to their families as, again, they try to put together the resources necessary so that they can begin their advanced education in the higher education system in this case. Hopefully in community colleges, they will continue to try to figure out, along with the State legislatures, how to lower the cost of that college. And this would provide an additional incentive, since they know now that those students will not be punished in a sense because they are going to a lower cost college at that time. 
   I would like to thank the staff of both committees for all of the work they did on this, for the senior Republican, Mr. Keller, on the subcommittee, and Mr. McKeon on the full committee, and to Mr. Hinojosa, the chairman of the subcommittee, for all of their work. We look forward to a quick passage here and hopefully a speedy passage in the Senate.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (GREEN THE CAPITOL INITIATIVE -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I want to thank you very much for taking this time to discuss what is almost now a year of the effort by Speaker Pelosi to provide for the greening of the Capitol and the surrounding areas here on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. 
   And her choice of Dan Beard as the Chief Administrative Officer to lead this effort is a wise choice. Dan Beard worked for the Resources Committee when I was Chair of that committee, and really led a transformation in western water usage throughout the western United States. When he was at the Committee, and later at the Bureau of Reclamation, he transformed those programs from huge, wasteful water projects into projects of conservation, ending subsidies that the taxpayers were paying in many cases, or reducing the subsidies that taxpayers were paying that led, again, to water conservation, to new technologies being brought onto the farmland, to level those lands, to provide for drip irrigation, to provide for computerization of irrigation, to mingle water with fertilizers or other things that were necessary for the growing of those crops. That has saved farmers a huge amount of money. It has provided for better utilization of the resource. Water was able to be recycled into fish and wildlife protection in other parts of the State and all through the Southwest, in Montana, in Utah and in California. So, he has a long experience for this. 
   When he left the Congress and the administration, he went on to work in dealing with public-private partnerships to bring about environmental solutions to very difficult problems and was able to engage the public sector, the private sector, the nonprofit sector to build teams, to build organizations to solve some very thorny problems around this country. 
   That's the expertise he brought to the greening of the Capitol. And as we've seen in this first year, many things that were just taken for granted here that were so wasteful of our environment, were so wasteful of energy, so wasteful of taxpayer dollars, that now has changed, or started to change. And it's a work in progress, but I think as Members see it, one, they're proud that they're part of this effort. We go back and we have town hall meetings with our constituents and we talk to them about the urgency and the necessity to do this. And sometimes maybe we don't lead as well as we should, but here we are leading in this wonderful, wonderful United States Capitol.     
   The other one is that this Capitol is part of a neighborhood, and to the extent in which we can reduce our reliance on coal-fired plants in this neighborhood, we improve the air quality from the people who live downwind from the plants that supply the power for the Capitol. The extent to which the Chief Administrative Officer that been able to role that into green energy is very, very important, to reduce the carbon footprint, which so many businesses now see as just not nice talk; it's really about hard decisions,  the yield, immense savings over relatively short periods of time, in many cases for those corporations, allow them to increase their investment in their businesses, their employees, or their own profits. And that's the kind of change that we need. It's the kind of change that we should be leading on. And under this effort to green the Capitol by the Speaker and the leadership with the Chief Administrative Officer, Dan Beard, we all see the benefits of it. 
   And, again, as Mr. Blumenauer was pointing out, these choices weren't difficult. They weren't costly. They weren't complex. But they weren't being made. And once they are made, people go on with their lives, and all of a sudden they are participating in reducing the tax that our activity puts on the environment, on the climate, on the resources of this Nation. 
   So I really want to thank you. I want to join and associate myself with your remarks that you've all made. All of you have been involved in this effort on a national basis with your leadership and the protection of the oceans and new forms and methods of transportation and for communities. And, Jay, certainly your efforts on alternative energy has led the way in this Congress. Hopefully, over the next couple of weeks, we will be able to go to even a broader initiative, which is the passage of the energy bill, which will lead to alternative energy sources being developed, alternative fuels, and the savings on the cafe standards so that people who are now looking at a $3.50 gasoline, $4 gasoline will be able to have the alternative of buying a more efficient automobile, a less polluting automobile. They'll feel good about it. Their pocketbook will feel good about it, and I think their children will really like the idea too. 
   So thank you so much for taking this time on the floor tonight.

And if you are still here I will watch you on C-SPAN. But it has been a great education, and I am sure this House staff would like to officially go home.

They don't change the way we do business or the way we eat at the cafeteria or wherever it is. It is just greener, better, smarter, and in many instances it saves us money.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, legislation that provides for cutting the interest rates on subsidized student loans from 6.8 to 3.4 percent over the next 5 years; that calls for the biggest increase in the Pell Grant in the history of the program, $1,000 new dollars over the next 5 years; that provides for an income-contingent payment plan where people will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their income on student loans; and if they go to public service, that loan can be forgiven for 10 years; and provides major support for the minority-serving institutions of this country. This is all done within the PAYGO rules because of the $20 billion in excessive subsidies that were being paid to lenders in this field, and so we comply with the Budget Act.  
   I rise in support of the conference report to H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. 
   Yesterday, we held a rally to highlight the benefits of this legislation for out nation's students and families. It is clear from listening to the students at the rally that one of the greatest challenges facing them today is the rising cost of college and high student loan debt. 
   With students returning to campuses, I can think of no better back to school gift than passing a bill that represents the greatest effort to help students and families pay for college since the GI Bill was passed more than fifty years ago. This is no ordinary gift. This is real money we are providing for students and families which translates into real relief. 
   As we have mentioned since the beginning of this process, these historic investments in education are being done in a fiscally responsible way. This conference report will fully comply with new House rules that require all federal spending to meet tough pay-as-you-go budget rules. 
   Additionally, the conference report will set aside $750 million in budget deficit reduction, demonstrating that with smart policy, we can be fiscally responsible and be responsive to the concerns of the American people. This conference agreement significantly increases the Pell Grant scholarship over the next five years to a maximum of $5,400. This investment--almost double the investment in the House bill, and the largest increase in the scholarship's history--will greatly restore the purchasing power of the scholarship for students with the most financial need, meet the President's 2008 budget request, and also address concerns raised by Mr. MCKEON during House consideration of this measure. 
   This agreement also: Cuts interest rates in half for need-based student loans from 6.8% to 3.4% over 4 years. When fully phased in it will save the typical student $4,400 over the life of the loan. This measure was overwhelmingly supported by this body in January; makes new investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other minority serving schools--to ensure that students will not only enter college, but remain and graduate; makes debt more manageable for students through an Income Based Repayment program; provides loan forgiveness and loan repayment options for those providing a public service; and ensures that we place a highly qualified teacher in every classroom through the creation of TEACH grants. 
   As mentioned before, this bill is fully paid for with cuts to lender subsidies. 
   It builds on proposals we passed in H.R. 5 and on proposals outlined by the President in his 2008 budget. 
   We believe the reasonable offsets in the final package meet our goal to ensure the continued participation by the lenders in the FFEL program as anticipated by the Congressional Budget Office. While a challenge, we believe this final package balances our commitment to minimizing the burden placed on lenders with our commitment to helping students. 
   As you can see, this conference agreement is a remarkable step forward in our efforts to help every qualified student go to college. This is a foundation we will continue to build on. As I mentioned at the conference meeting, I am committed to continuing these efforts when the House considers the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act this year. 
   Given that we have addressed many of the concerns raised by the Administration, I received confirmation yesterday from Secretary Spellings that the President is expected to sign the final bill. 
   I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will follow the lead of the White House and the Senate--who overwhelmingly passed this legislation not too long ago--and vote in favor of this carefully crafted compromise. 
   Rather than stand between our nation's students and their ability to access much needed financial relief, I urge all members to vote in favor of the conference report on the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. 
   Today this body is voting to do what is right for students, our economy, and our nation's future. Together we are putting the American Dream back within reach of every family in this country.  
   Madam Speaker, I now yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), the chairman of the Budget Committee.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman of our subcommittee, Rub&#233;n Hinojosa, and all of the members of the conference committee for their valuable contributions to this legislation. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Spratt, who spoke earlier, for providing the reconciliation process, and all of the work that their staff did to make sure that we complied with the reconciliation process and we complied with the PAYGO rules so that there would be no new costs to this legislation to provide these benefits to students and to their families. And I want to thank his staff, Tom Kahn and Sarah Abernathy and Lisa Venus. 
   I would also like to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their help and their staffs' work with us to have a successful conference and a conference report on this act. 
   And I'd like to thank the Education and Labor Committee staff, Mark Zuckerman, Alex Nock, Stephanie Moore, Denise Forte, Gaby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, Jeff Appel, Rachel Racusen, Lisette Partelow, Lamont Ivey, Sarah Dyson, Ricardo Martinez and Moira Lenehan of Representative Hinojosa's staff. 
   This work could not have happened without the long hours put in by a very diligent, committed legislative counsel, and I want to thank Steve Cope and Molly Lothamer. 
   Given that we must balance our numbers, we appreciate the significance of work provided by the staff at the Congressional Budget Office, including Paul Cullinan, Debb Kalcevic and Justin Humphrey. 
   The Congressional Research Service has been particularly supportive of our efforts, in particular, Adam Stoll, Charmaine Mercer, David Smole, Becky Skinner and Jeff Kuenzi. 
   I want to thank all of these individuals, and certainly I want to thank the students who, for so many years have tried to get the Congress to respond to their needs and to the needs of their families if they have to borrow money to go to school, to go to school and to achieve a higher education, to achieve the education that that provides. 
   I certainly want to thank USPIRG and the United States Student Association and many others who worked so hard over these past years. 
   We remember just a year ago, just a year ago we were here in the reconciliation process when $11.9 billion was taken out of this very same account, but rather than to use it for the benefit of the students, that $11.9 billion went to pay for the tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country. 
   We took $11.39 billion out of this same account and we gave that to the Pell Grant students, to the most needy students in this country who need it the most. That's the difference that an election makes. That's the difference that a year makes. That's the difference that a lot of hard work by the students across this country and their families have made as they've asked Members of Congress to address this issue. 
   This legislation, just earlier today, passed in the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 79-12.     
   It has now been stated that the President of the United States supports this legislation and will sign this legislation. 
   I would hope that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would understand the importance of this legislation, the value of this legislation to our students and to their families as we know so many of them struggle to put together the means by which they can pay for the college education of the students. One of the very great moments in a parent's life is when a student gets accepted into college, the students announce they want to go to college, and then you immediately start to think about how we are going to pay for this. 
   This legislation will make it a lot easier for a lot of parents and a lot of students who desperately need this help. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to support the conference report and let's join this bipartisan coalition and help America's families and students. I thank everybody for their cooperation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule to make in order the conference report on H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. 
   In this last election, we campaigned very hard on cutting the cost of college for students and making college more affordable for students and their families who are borrowing money to go to school. And it is clear that we intend to do that with the passage of this legislation today. 
   In the first 10 hours as part of our 6 for '06 agenda, we cut the interest rates in half on the subsidized student loans so that those low-income families and middle-income families who are struggling to meet the debt burden of sending their children to school will have some relief in that effort. And over the next 4 years in this conference report, we will cut those interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, which is a savings of the average indebted student upon graduation over the life of that loan of some $4,400. Also for the lowest-income students, the students most in need, we are increasing the Pell Grant up to a level over the next 5 years of $5,400. This is in keeping with what the President promised but never did, and this is in keeping with our promise that we would again restore the purchasing value of the Pell Grant. 
   And you can see from this chart, Mr. Speaker, the fact is over the last several years, the Pell Grant has been flat-lined in spite of promises each and every year that it was going to be increased; and this year for the first time Mr. Obey put money in, in the continuing resolution in the appropriations bill, and then this bill will continue to raise the Pell Grant to $5,400. This is the largest increase, certainly, in recent history. 
   It is important that these two populations, middle-income students and families and low-income students and families, have these resources available to them. And the reason it is important is we are now seeing increasing reports now estimated at more than a quarter of a million students who are fully qualified to go to school every year choose not to go to college, to postpone it, or not to go at all because they are worried about whether or not they will be able to manage the debt or afford the cost of college.     
   And it is our job to make sure that no student in America that is fully qualified to go to college is refused the opportunity to do so because of the cost of college. That has been the policy of this country since the GI Bill, and this is the largest investment since the GI Bill 50 years ago. But it was a policy of the Eisenhower administration, of the Kennedy administration, and essentially every administration on a bipartisan basis since then. But we now see college costs far outstripping the ability of families to pay for a college education, therefore requiring them to borrow money. 
   So in this legislation we take $20 billion away from the large lenders and other lenders of college loans, excessive subsidies that were paid for them, excessive subsidies that were identified in the President's legislation, and we recycle those monies to the benefit of the students and to their families, and we do so within pay-as-you-go, that each and every expenditure in this bill is paid for by the recycling of those excessive subsidies that were going to the lending institution. And in that way, we're able to deliver real money to these families in need in the form of a reduction in interest rates, in the form of an increase in the Pell Grants. 
   But we also do that so that those people who want to choose the profession of a policeman, a nurse, a fireman, a teacher, a special educator, a prosecutor, a public defender, that those individuals will be allowed to choose those careers and know that they will not have to make another choice because of the crushing debt of their college education. They, under this legislation, will not be required to pay any more than 15 percent of their income in any given year for these student loans. And what does that mean? That means they can start a career in nursing, in health care, in law enforcement, as a first responder, and they know that if they stay in that field for 10 years, that loan will be forgiven. That is a major advantage to those individuals who are seeking to go into those fields. 
   We also want to keep the promise of earlier actions in this Congress when we passed the COMPETES Act to have highly qualified teachers in math and science go into the classrooms. We're saying to those exemplary performers in college that if you'll go into teaching and you'll go into the most difficult schools, we will give you $4,000 a year up front while you're in school of tuition relief if you will agree to do that; 16,000 real dollars to those people because they're going to go in and teach in the most difficult schools, and the exemplary performers are going to have the skills and the talents to do that if they so choose to do it. 
   This legislation is the foundation of the cornerstone of our agenda on innovation for new discovery of this Nation, the next generation of discovery, of innovation, of economic growth and jobs here in America. This is the most valuable investment we can make. Every economist will tell you that the investment in education yields more back to the government, more back to the public sector, more back to civil society than any other investment we make. And that's what we're doing in this legislation. We promised we would do it. We started out in ``six for '06,'' and today, with this conference report, the House and the Senate is keeping its promise. 
   We've made changes in this legislation that were suggested by Mr. McKeon and by the administration. And I am proud to announce that the President, in spite of his suggested veto messages or his staff-suggested veto messages over the last couple of  months, the President has agreed to sign this legislation. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to join in support of this rule and to support the conference report when it comes before us. I hope that we will have a good bipartisan vote as they're now having in the Senate at this very moment. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for her support in this effort and for yielding the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conference Report on H.R. 2419, the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. 
   With the U.S. economy faltering and food prices rising, this conference agreement takes critical steps to reduce hunger, ensure that healthy foods are included in federal nutrition programs, and meet the nutritional needs of many low-income Americans. 
   To help low-income families hit especially hard by high food prices, this legislation invests more than $7.8 billion in the food stamp program, now renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
   This commitment will slow the erosion of food stamp benefits caused by increasing food prices, provide food assistance to recipients without requiring them to spend down their education savings accounts and retirement plan assets, and increase food assistance to households with high child care expenses. 
   The bill also invests $1.25 billion in commodity purchases for food banks, which will strengthen emergency food assistance programs' efforts to serve needy families. 
   Our nation is facing a growing child obesity epidemic--an issue that demands strong efforts to improve the quality and nutritional value of foods offered through school meal programs. 
   H.R. 2419 includes important provisions that will expand children's access to healthy foods during the school day, and that will help inform our efforts to reauthorize the nation's child nutrition programs next year. 
   I am also pleased that this report increases the volume of fresh fruits and vegetables available through federally-supported domestic nutrition programs, and, as part of that, invests more than one billion dollars in expanding the fruit and vegetable snack program. 
   Thanks to this significant investment, the snack program, targeted primarily to low- income children and to schools that disproportionately serve low-income families, will now provide thousands of students in every state with greater access to healthy foods. 
   This bill also supports local food systems and farm-to-school programs by encouraging child nutrition programs to use a geographic  preference when purchasing foods--allowing 
   schools and other programs to select more nutritious agricultural products such as fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products, eggs and meat. 
   In addition, it will require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to conduct a national survey of the foods purchased by the school lunch programs. 
   Science and research overwhelmingly tell us that providing our children with healthy, nutritious foods from the earliest years on is one of the best things we can do to help our children succeed. 
   I am very pleased that all of the child nutrition provisions throughout this bill retain a focus on providing healthier foods and nutritional benefits as supported by scientific research. 
   When we last reauthorized the child nutrition programs in 2004, we required children in low-income households receiving food stamps to be automatically enrolled for free meals at school through a process known as ``direct certification.'' 
   This simplification reduces work for school administrators, eliminates a duplicative application process for low-income families, and improves the accuracy of the school meal enrollment process. 
   We had hoped that school districts, states, and the USDA would do everything in their power to make sure that every eligible low-income child would benefit from this simplification. Unfortunately, the evidence to date indicates that the implementation of this provision has been inconsistent. 
   The USDA must act more aggressively to help states and school districts reach all children who could benefit from this coordination of efforts. This bill will ensure that we get information from USDA that will allow us to monitor this progress and promote best practices through their new annual reports on direct certification. 
   While this conference report contains many positive accomplishments, I am disappointed that it does not include a proposal from the House-passed bill that would ensure that public employees conduct eligibility determinations for food stamp benefits. 
   Without this proposal, the food stamp determination process will now be open to for-profit companies, many of which may be more focused on boosting efficiency and revenue than serving the best interests of vulnerable Americans. 
   The House provision would have re-established longstanding and productive public-private partnerships that help ensure that the right balance of private contractors and public employees are included in this process. It is frustrating that this was excluded from what is otherwise a very strong conference report. 
   By making the right investments to strengthen the quality of foods provided to our Nation's children, this bill is a down payment on a healthier future for this country. 
   I would especially like to thank Chairman Peterson, Congressman Goodlatte, and Senators Harkin and Chambliss for their hard work on this conference agreement. 
   The House Education and Labor Committee is committed to building on this effort to improve child nutrition in this country, and to ensure that the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast program, and the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (WIC) are available to all eligible children and families. 
   I urge the passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And I thank the Rules Committee for bringing this rule to the floor that will enable us to consider the Continued Access to Student Loans Act to help families and students who are struggling to pay for the cost of education. 
   One of the more successful programs in this country has been the system of student loans that we provide under Federal guarantees to families and to students to pay for those educations. That program now has been caught up  in the decline and the seizing of the American credit markets, and therefore, we're worried that there will not be loans available to families and students who are applying for school this coming fall. 
   As a result of that, we have been working with the Secretary of Education and with the entire committee on the Republican side and the Democratic side of the aisle to make sure that we have in place a number of provisions that will allow, if necessary, the Federal Government to step in and assure those families that they will have access to those loans so they will not have to miss classes that they need, miss a semester that they need, and compound their problems by extending the time that they will have to remain in college before they graduate. 
   We have been meeting with the traditional lending community within the student loan community, and many of them have told us that they expect to participate in the student loans for the coming year, but they also believe that there will be a gap, that the supply of those loans will not meet the demands because of the seizing of the credit market, that the credit markets have failed to function over the last many weeks not only for student loans, but for the municipal bond market, for various joint agencies of the government that have very high credit ratings. 
   In the case of student loans, these are government-backed loans, but the markets are not purchasing the old loans as they were in the past. For that reason, we are seeking to activate and have on standby authority the lender of last resort authority that the Secretary of Education has under current law where if, in fact, the money is not available for those loans, she will be able to go to the Secretary of Treasury and make a demand to fund those loans. 
   There will also be available the direct lending program that currently exists. Many universities and students use that program today. We have been talking with them and making sure that they would be able to expand the capacity. Should the universities decide to direct a number of the students to the direct lending program, they have assured us they that could clearly double their capacity and in a short time be able to go beyond that. 
   So we have the lender of last resort program in place because there is not enough money in the banks to provide for student loans. We have the direct lending program in place for those who choose to go there so they can keep their eligibility for school.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. And then we also, in this legislation, provide for the Secretary to purchase existing loans from those lenders so that they can recapitalize their liquidity situation and be able to make new loans to students and to families seeking those loans. 
   Those three tools should, in fact, provide a seamless system so if the private credit markets fail to provide the necessary resources, or the credit markets fail to provide the liquidity that's necessary, we will be able to stand in their place for a temporary period of time until the credit markets sort it out. 
   We also make provisions in this legislation to increase the amount of money that undergraduates can borrow in the program so that those students who have been using the private loan markets, which are in complete shambles, will be able to increase the amount of money that they may need to borrow for tuition and for school expenses and be able to continue their education. 
   I also want to acknowledge the fact that we've made provisions in here so that temporary problems that families may be having with home payments or with health care payments, those would be considered as exigent circumstances so that they can continue to be eligible for the loans under the government guaranteed program. Ms. Castor will be offering that amendment. And the gentleman from Vermont will be offering an amendment to really look at this link between increased tuition and increased resources made available to students. 
   This is an important package. It's a timely package. We hope that it won't be necessary to be used, but we need to have it in place so that we can backstop the failures of the credit market that are currently existing as an outflow of the subprime mortgage problem that is affecting the entire economy of this country and many other countries around the world. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Again, I want to thank the Rules Committee for recommending this bill to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. It was reported by the Committee on Education and Labor with unanimous bipartisan support, and I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for all of the effort they put into this legislation. It is a very important piece of legislation. 
   At a time when the turmoil in the Nation's credit markets has made it difficult for some lenders to access the capital they need to finance their student lending activity, this bipartisan bill will ensure that students and parents are able to continue to access the federal loans they need to pay for college. 
   For quite some time now, the worsening economic downturn has made life more difficult for many of America's families. But this downturn has its root in the housing crisis, which has led to significant tightening in the credit markets. What began as a challenge for home loan borrowers has now become a challenge for other borrowers, like those with credit card debt and automobile loans. 
   And in recent months, we have now seen questions raised about the availability of student loans for the coming year, especially when those who finance their loans through the auction rate securities, that system has ceased to function. 
   As a result, some lenders are reducing their lending activity in the federally guaranteed student loan programs, while other lenders are anticipating increasing their market share. 
   And while the stress in the credit markets is taking a toll on some lenders, students so far have not encountered serious difficulties in getting federal loans they need to pay for college. That's the good news. 
   But as we have seen too often, the shocks in the financial markets come as a surprise leaving those affected with little time to react. There is emergency authority already built into the current law which would maintain access to federal loans for families in the event of any of these surprises. 
   It is critical to make sure that this authority is ready to be implemented to ensure America's families can continue to access the federal college loans they are eligible for, regardless of what's happening in the credit markets. 
   As we work with Secretary Spellings to make sure these safeguards are ready to become operational at a moment's notice, we must also take additional steps on behalf of students and their families. 
   This legislation provides new protections, in addition to those in current law, to ensure that families can continue to access the loans they need to pay for college. 
   The bill reduces borrowers' reliance on costlier private loans while encouraging responsible borrowing by increasing the annual student loan limits for federal student loans by $2,000 for all students. It also increases the total amount of Federal loans students can borrow to $31,000 for dependent undergraduates and to $57,500 for independent undergraduates. 
   H.R. 5715 gives parent borrowers more time to pay off their federal parent PLUS loans by allowing families to delay entering repayment for up to 6 months after a student leaves school. It helps struggling home owners pay  for college by making sure that short-term delinquencies in mortgage payments don't prohibit otherwise eligible parents from being able to pay their PLUS loans. 
   It clarifies that existing law gives the Secretary of Education the authority to advance federal funds to guaranty agencies in the event that they do not have sufficient capital to originate new loans. It allows guaranty agencies to make lender-of-last-resort loans on a school-wide basis. 
   And the bill ensures that lenders can continue to access capital to originate new student loans by giving the Secretary of Education the temporary authority to purchase federally guaranteed student loans from lenders, if needed. 
   Finally, this legislation carries no new costs for taxpayers. 
   Especially in light of today's economic conditions, the high cost of a college education continues to be one of the primary worries facing American families. A recent poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS News found that 70 percent of the parents surveyed said they were ``very concerned'' about how they would finance their kids' college education. 
   Over the past year and a half, this Congress has worked vigorously to make college more affordable and accessible for students and families. Last year, we took the historic step towards this goal by providing more than $20 billion in financial assistance to low- and middle-income families over the next 5 years. 
   In February, the House passed bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, and we will soon be prepared to conclude the conference committee and bring that to the floor. 
   Now more than ever, families deserve every assurance that we are doing all that we can to make sure that they can continue to be able to finance their children's college education, regardless of what happens in the credit markets. 
   And I want to again thank Congressman Buck McKeon, Congressman Rub&#233;n Hinojosa and Congressman Ric Keller, the Chair and the ranking member of the subcommittee, and all of the staff for all of the work they have put into this legislation. This has been a very fast turnaround. It could not have happened without the bipartisan cooperation of all of those involved. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of proceeding with the conference negotiations on H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007. In appointing conferees today, I am proud to say that we will be taking the first step in making college more affordable and accessible for students. 
   Overall, this is an opportunity for the conference to look at both bills, consider concerns and put forth the best possible compromise; and that is our goal. During this process, not only have we looked carefully at what will work for students and families, but we have done our best to listen to and address the concerns brought to our attention. In an attempt at bipartisanship, we have met with the administration, as well as the staff from the other side of the aisle, in such discussions and with the administration, and we believe at the end of the day the conference will include provisions that have broad bipartisan support while maintaining some of our key priorities. These include the following: 
   Significant investment in Pell Grants. We heard the concern voiced on this floor by Members on the other side of the aisle, and we believe it is important to include a significant investment beyond the House bill in this conference. Understanding that increasing Pell Grants is also an issue included in President Bush's budget, we believe this goal can and should be met. 
   Cutting interest rates in half will remain a key priority for helping the middle class as well as ensuring debt relief for students and delivery of such needed financial support for Historical Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic serving institutions and other minority serving institutions. 
   I hope that we can continue the dialogue and work together on final passage in the conference. I am very proud to be here today to offer this motion to officially proceed in the conference with the Senate on legislation that will allow the Congress to do more to help Americans pay for the cost of college than any effort since the GI Bill at no cost to the taxpayers. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 will get us closer to the goal of ensuring access to higher education for all qualified students. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first speak to the motion to instruct. I have no problems with the motion to instruct. I don't quite know why it is on this bill, but the Senate chose to put this language into the legislation. The motion to instruct would ask the conferees to maintain that language in this legislation so those who are currently at Guantanamo Bay who are among some very dangerous people in the world not be brought to this country in the event that Guantanamo Bay should be closed. 
   As we know, that is a matter of active debate here in the United States and certainly around the world and within the Congress of the United States of exactly how we extricate ourselves from the situation we have at Guantanamo Bay. 
   Early on after 9/11, the use of Guantanamo Bay became a rallying point against the abuse of human rights. Earlier practices there violated the protection of human rights. As the gentleman from Michigan has pointed out, much has changed there, but all is not well there yet, and there have been calls to close that facility. In the event they would be successful, as I understand this language, this would prevent the prisoners from being transferred to facilities in the United States, and I concur in that language. 
   If I might return back to the legislation at hand or the motion at hand, which is to go to conference with the Senate and work out the differences in this legislation, and there are significant differences between the House and the Senate legislation, the staffs of the committee have been meeting on those differences, and we would hope to be able to report back to the House and to the Senate in the near future. 
   It is important that we do that. We stand here at the beginning of yet another school year, another college year, if you will, and we see that families are struggling harder than ever to meet the cost of college. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Bishop) who has been so active in this field pointed out this fact to the House. We must do what we can to address and help families meet this cost. 
   This legislation does it in a number of ways, both by providing increased grants to the lowest income families of students who seek to attend college who are fully qualified to go to college, but too often economic barriers keep them from doing so. 
   This legislation makes a substantial increase in the Pell Grants, some $500 over the coming years in that grant. It was the goal of this President to do that. Previous Congresses never did that, and we do that in this legislation, and that is going to be a great benefit to those students and to their families who are struggling with the cost of college. 
   We also make a reduction in the interest rates. We cut the interest rates  in half on money borrowed from the subsidized loan program which includes those very same Pell Grant recipients. I think 25 or 30 percent of them go on to borrow money from this program, and also middle income families who are feeling the financial strain of having one kid or two or three kids in college at the same time. 
   We estimate that the savings over the life of that loan will be above $4,000, almost $4,500 for those individuals. That is a very substantial savings, and it is what we know that the young people calculate what is going to be the cost of college, and that includes the interest rates that they are going to have to pay back. As we know, there is forbearance against the payment of interest rates while the students are in college, but upon graduation, they start paying that money back, and that interest rate is a significant cost for those students. 
   We also try to make sure that those individuals who have chosen to go into public service can understand that there will be some relief for their efforts through a loan forgiveness program for policemen, firemen, teachers, teachers of special ed, prosecutors, public defenders, all of whom enter professions that don't have the highest economic rewards at the outset, but we want them to go into those professions as services to our communities. And we want to make sure that they do so so we can continue to hold civil society together in this country and receive the benefits of their work and they will not be so burdened by the loans that they will choose to go elsewhere and leave society without the use of their talents, as I say, in health care, law enforcement, education, and so many other fields that are important to this. 
   And following on the passage of the COMPETES Act, we provide for highly qualified teachers in every classroom. In the TEACH Act, we recognize the importance of highly skilled math and science teachers, and we identify those people who are performing in an exemplary fashion in college and offer them tuition assistance if they go into teaching math and science and go into those schools in high need. That would provide $4,000 in up-front tuition assistance for those individuals. 
   We also make landmark investments of $500 million in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges, and Alaska/Hawaiian Native colleges. We have a problem of fully qualified minority students going to some of these colleges and really not being able to stay for a host of reasons. We have had discussions with the heads of State college systems and university systems and others about this problem, and the fact of the matter is we have to do more to support those students so they can successfully negotiate the college education that they seek to pursue. 
   So this legislation is comprehensive. It is important. We did it by taking away the excessive subsidies to the student lending agencies, subsidies that were identified as excessive a number of years ago in the President's budget and by the OMB, and we recycled those successive savings to the benefit of the students and their families who once again are going into great financial stress to make sure that their children will have an opportunity at a college education that we recognize is so important in terms of their future ability to fully participate in the American economy, the American society, and to provide for their families.     
   As we pointed out, this legislation is the largest commitment of Federal resources since the GI Bill of 1944. We think it's important. We would hope to have an affirmative vote to go to conference on the motion to instruct, and then we could proceed with the conference in the coming days. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. If the gentleman has no further speakers, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I just want to point out for a number of Members who have asked about what's the relationship of this reconciliation to the loan scandals that the Nation was witness to earlier this year, this legislation does not contain the language of the Sunshine Act that we passed overwhelmingly in May of this year. That will be contained in the Higher Education Act that the House and Senate plan to do soon. It's in the Senate bill, and we have passed the Sunshine Act. 
   As Members will recall, this was legislation that falls on the heels of public reports of colleges and lenders and their relationships between colleges and lenders and special relationships that were developed in some cases for the exchange of gifts, financial favors, holidays, special treatment to people working for the colleges that were steering people to a particular lender for their loans. Whether or not that was in the best interest of the student or not really didn't come into play. 
   These practices have gone on for a considerable period of time. In some cases, they've been brought to the attention of the Department of Education by the Inspector General. They were not properly dealt with, and the Attorney General of the State of New York, Mr. Cuomo, brought them to the Nation's attention with his investigation of some of the large lending institutions and these practices and entered into a number of consent agreements with those individuals. 
   We had hearings on this matter and the failure of oversight by both the Congress and the Department, and we passed the Sunshine Act in reaction to those hearings that we had, again, and was passed on a strong bipartisan vote. 
   We think these two things are connected. The terms are now removing the excessive subsidies that were used in many instances to grease these relationships for the benefit of the lenders and not for the benefit of the students and of their families who are borrowing the money to pay for their college education. 
   So I just wanted to bring the Members up to snuff on that matter. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, this is a great day for America's workers. 
   Today the House once again passes the minimum wage increase--and this time we expect this bill to be signed by the President. 
   America's minimum wage workers have been waiting a long time for a raise. The last time they saw an increase was nearly 10 years ago. Since that last increase, in 1997, the value of the minimum wage has dropped to its lowest level in over half a century. 
   Last summer, I had the honor to meet a woman named Sheryl Wade in Louisville, Kentucky. Sheryl told me at a forum about life at the minimum wage. She couldn't afford housing for herself and 3 sons. She had to move in and out with relatives and friends. Her boys had to constantly change schools and change friends. She could not afford health care. Sheryl is a hardworking American, sick and tired of barely living paycheck to paycheck, not making enough to get by. 
   Mr. Speaker, her day has come. 
   When we increase the minimum wage with this bill, from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour over 2 years, the poorest working families in this country will see a $4,400 increase in their annual income--enough to pay for 15 months of groceries for a family of three. 
   Thanks to this increase, in 2009, a family of four will move from 11 percent below the poverty line to 5 percent above the poverty line. 
   Thanks to this increase, 13 million workers will see their pay go up, directly or indirectly. That includes 7.7 million women and 3.4 million parents. Over 6.3 million children will see their parents' income rise. 
   This raise in wages is long overdue. Thanks to the hard work of religious, civil rights, labor, and community organizations--and American voters and working families--it is finally coming to pass. 
   I'm proud of the work this Democratic Congress has done. This House, under new leadership, is putting working families and America's middle class first. What a change that is--and we've only just begun.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (STOP CHILD ABUSE IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR TEENS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5876, the Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs For Teens Act of 2008. Last year, a 17-year-old boy in a Maryland residential program for teens became unresponsive after he was physically restrained by staff members. According to the press reports, prosecutors alleged that the staff members waited 41 minutes to call 911 because they thought the boy was faking. The boy died. A 15-year-old boy in a wilderness camp in Colorado died in May 2007 from a staph infection. According to the press reports, State authorities said the boy showed observable signs of infection that were neglected by the camp staff members. 
   Tragically, these recent deaths are not isolated cases. The Government Accountability Office has thousands of cases and allegations of child abuse and neglect stretching back decades in teen residential programs, including boot camps, wilderness camps and therapeutic boarding schools. 
   The Education and Labor Committee has closely examined a number of these neglect and abuse cases, including cases that resulted in the death of a child. We have heard stories about program staff members forcing children to remain in so-called stress positions for hours at a time, to stand with bags over their heads and nooses around their necks in mock hangings, to eat foods to which they were allergic, even as they got sick, or to eat their own vomit. We have heard from parents of children who died preventible deaths at the hands of untrained, uncaring staff members.     
   Bob Bacon testified that program staff members mocked his son, Aaron, when the 16-year-old boy asked for medical help, calling him a faker. For weeks, the staff deprived Aaron of adequate food and water even though his weight loss became frighteningly apparent. When Bob and his wife Sally went to the mortuary to see their son, they found scars of abuse and dried skin stretched taut over Aaron's bones. 
   Cynthia Harvey told the Education and Labor Committee that program staff members waited 45 minutes before summoning appropriate medical care for her daughter, Erica, who had collapsed and was having difficulty breathing. 
   Paul Lewis testified that program staff members ignored his son Ryan's obvious signs of emotional distress, denying him psychiatric care that could have saved his life. 
   In addition to wrenching stories like these parents told, the Education and Labor Committee has also heard from adults who attended these programs as teens. They too were victims of physical and emotional abuse and witnessed other children being abused. 
   Madam Chairman, these abuses have been allowed to continue unchecked because of the weak patchwork of State and Federal regulations governing teen residential programs. 
   An exhaustive 18-month study by the Government Accountability Office showed that State licensing programs may exclude certain types of teen residential programs, and thus place children at higher risk of abuse and neglect. In some States, inconsistent licensing enables programs to define themselves out of the licensing altogether. According to the GAO, in Texas a program that calls itself a residential treatment center would be required to obtain a license; but if that same program were simply called a boarding school, it would not require a license. Even when licensing exists, GAO found that there may not be minimum standards to effectively prevent child abuse and neglect. 
   Parents often send their children to these programs when they feel they have exhausted all their alternatives. Their children may be abusing drugs or alcohol, attempting to run away--or physically harm themselves--or otherwise acting out. Parents turn to these programs because of the promise that staff members will help their children straighten their lives out. And surely there are many cases in which programs do provide families with the help they need. In far too many cases, however, the very people entrusted with the safety, health, and welfare of these children are the ones who violate the trust in some of the most awful ways imaginable. 
   We have learned a great deal from the Government Accountability Office about programs' irresponsible operating practices that put kids at risk and about the deceitful marketing practices that programs use to lure parents desperate for help for their children. The Government Accountability Office also found examples of the shady network that programs sometimes relied on, such as referral service providers that claim to offer independent services to parents but that actually have close financial or personal ties to the very programs that they are ``independently recommending.'' 
   We know that there are many programs and people around the country who are committed to helping improve the lives of young people and who do good work every day. But, unfortunately, it has become extremely difficult for parents to tell the good programs from the bad. And I would remind you again that very often these parents seek nothing but the best for their children, children who are extremely difficult to handle, who have failed in other efforts and other programs to deal with their problems. So these parents have exhausted most of their options, and then they run into some of these programs which then endanger their child even though the parent is seeking the best for their child. 
   The legislation before us today, H.R. 5876, would help keep children safe in residential programs and help ensure that parents have information they need to make safer choices for their kids. The legislation requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to establish minimum standards for private programs to enforce those standards. 
   With children's health and safety at risk, this Federal rule is a necessary recognition that we are dealing with an emergency and we cannot wait for the States to act. These abuses have been going on for years. States have had time to act and in many instances they have failed to do so. 
   Ultimately, however, States will be primarily responsible for carrying out the work of this bill. The legislation calls for States within 3 years to take up the role of setting standards and enforcing them on all programs, both public and private. 
   The Health and Human Services Administration and the State standards would include prohibitions on physical, sexual, and mental abuse of children. The standards would require that programs provide children with adequate food, water, and medical care. They would require that programs have plans in place to handle medical emergencies. They would also include new training requirements for program staff members, including training on how to identify and report child abuse. 
   The legislation requires Health and Human Services to set up a toll-free hotline for people to call to report abuse in these programs. 
   As you can see, Madam Chair, these are minimum requirements for the health and the safety of the children that have been placed in this care. 
   It also requires Health and Human Services to create a Web site with information about each program so that parents can look and see if substantiated cases of abuse have occurred at a program that they are considering for their children. 
   Finally, the legislation helps prevent programs from using deceptive marketing tactics to target parents. Among other things, it requires programs to disclose to parents the qualifications, roles, and responsibilities of all current staff members, and requires programs to notify parents of substantiated reports of child abuse or violations of health and safety laws. 
   The legislation has the strong support of the American Association of Residential Centers. One of the association board members, Dr. Christopher Bellonci, testified in support of the legislation earlier this year. He said, and I quote, ``The goal of this legislation is to ensure that children are not abused in these treatment settings, not to limit access to appropriate, regulated, and licensed residential care for children who are in need of these services. All of us working in licensed residential centers should support this goal.'' 
   Madam Chairman, we have a responsibility to keep children safe no matter what setting they are in, and today we  are taking an important step towards finally ending the horrific abuses that have gone on far too long in residential programs for teens. 
   I want to thank Congresswoman McCarthy of our committee for her hard work on this legislation, and I want to thank Congressman McKeon for his effort. And we will be offering a manager's amendment later that I think will help make this bill bipartisan and helps deal with some of the concerns that people had with the legislation. So I want to thank Congressman McKeon and his staff. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   I rise in strong support of this manager's amendment, and I offer this manager's amendment on behalf of myself and Congressman McKeon, who worked with us on this amendment to improve the legislation. 
   It is the intent, as you have just heard from the debate on this legislation, to ensure that children are safe no matter what settings they are in. And this amendment further refines the legislation to improve the legislation. 
   The main changes that are offered in this amendment--and Mr. McKeon pushed for these changes and recognized the need for them--one is to broaden the Federal oversight to include public residential programs as well as private ones. It strikes the right provided under this Act for families to sue in Federal court for violations of the national standards. And it strikes the requirement that the Health and Human Services conduct site inspections of all covered programs at least every 2 years. 
   It was my belief that we continue and are able to maintain the intent and the purposes of this Act to make sure that children are safe in these varied settings, as we heard from Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania, children who are very difficult to handle in many instances and parents who have run out of the capacity to deal with these children seeking to have this care. 
   I believe that the manager's amendment further refines the legislation, strikes a better balance in the bill, and I want to again thank Mr. McKeon. 
   I reserve the balance of my time on the manager's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. (PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF OF PAKISTAN -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, this weekend a devastating blow was struck against the efforts to try to grow and make sustainable democracy in Pakistan when President Musharraf of Pakistan announced that he would have an emergency order which has essentially become martial law against all those in the country who disagreed with him; against all of those on the supreme court, all of those in the legal community, all of those in general society who disagree with him are now subject to arrest, are subject to beatings, are subject to imprisonment. That is wrong, and this country cannot look the other way. 
   For too long this administration and this Congress have looked the other way as President Musharraf has worked to limit and now crush democracy in Pakistan. Too many excuses have been offered to allow him to continue this trend against free and open elections, against a growing democracy, against a growing independent press and TV stations because we said he is helping us in Pakistan against the terrorists, the Taliban, in Afghanistan. 
   Of course, what we know is that he has played us over these many years as he has received billions of dollars in aid. He has continued to play us to suggest that he is really concentrating on the effort to rid both Afghanistan and Pakistan of terrorists, but in fact that is not what has been taking place. In fact, he has cut agreements, he has arranged for safe haven, for safe travel for the Taliban as they have moved back and forth against our troops and against people in Afghanistan who are trying to establish a democracy there. 
   Some months ago when I visited Afghanistan, we asked the commander of our troops there what was the biggest threat to our troops in Afghanistan, and he said the border with Pakistan. And that remains true today as the Taliban move back and forth, as recruits from al Qaeda move back and forth, and at a time when President Musharraf simply gives voice to the idea that he is going to stop this from happening, that he is going to create an environment where that will not be allowed to continue. That simply has not happened, because President Musharraf has been more interested in securing his reelection as the leader of Pakistan than he has been in getting rid of the extremists and the terrorists. In fact, he has allowed the extremists to grow even in Islamabad, where their presence wasn't known only a few years ago. 
   We must take a stand against these actions. We must speak out. The administration has spoken out now, but already questions are being raised as to whether or not we will condition aid, whether or not we will forcefully show Musharraf that we cannot have him crush democracy in Pakistan. Pakistan needs more democracy, not less. It needs democracy to strengthen that country so that it can reject ex-tremism and terrorists. It needs free elections so that the people will believe that they are represented, not by the continuing building of a dictatorship by President Musharraf who controls the military, who controls the intelligence, and now is using them against the very people that he is supposed to represent, and that is the people of Pakistan. We cannot stand by while he takes this extraordinary effort to crush democracy, to potentially postpone the elections, to seize the independent media, and to throw hundreds and hundreds so far of his citizens into jail because they simply seek to oppose him and seek a brighter future, a more democratic future for the country of Pakistan. 
   The time has come for this country to take a very strong stand against the corruption of this government and the growing dictatorship presented by the rule of President Musharraf.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I very much appreciate his remarks against this amendment to eliminate Davis-Bacon. 
   You cannot build good solid communities on the backs of poor people, and you can't build good solid communities on the back of poor wages, poor working conditions. This is about prevailing wages; it is not about a union wage. They constantly year after year come and mischaracterize this amendment; they mischaracterize the program. But the fact of the matter is the majority in this House understands how important this provision is to working people in this country and to the communities in which these projects are being built. In fact, all projects in this country where we invest taxpayer money, we should get good projects, good wages and good working conditions for the people on those projects. 
   I thank the gentleman for his statement.  
   I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Mr. KING of Iowa. 
   Here we have a bill to reauthorize the HOPE VI program. That program provides grants to localities for the construction, rehabilitation, and, in some cases, demolition of public housing units. That work is going to be done in some of the poorest neighborhoods in this country. That work is going to be done in areas with some of the highest unemployment in this country. 
   And what does the King amendment do? It eliminates prevailing wage requirements for this work. It gives the money to contractors who would be free to pay poverty wages and pocket the rest as profit. This amendment worsens the cycle of poverty in the very areas that need the most help. 
   But that's not all. This is taxpayer money. What do you get when you give taxpayer money to contractors who pay poverty wages and treat their workers poorly? You get shoddy work. And you have to spend more taxpayer money to fix it later. 
   Let's summarize: The King amendment uses taxpayer money to worsen the cycle of poverty in the poorest neighborhoods in this country. It uses taxpayer money to buy shoddy work that just increases the costs later on. It's difficult to tell who the amendment is trying to hurt the most--the poor neighborhoods, the workers, or the taxpayers. This Amendment is outrageous and should be roundly defeated by this House.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I would hope that all of our colleagues would oppose this amendment. 
   The student loan application that is in question here, the criticism of it and the concern with it is not because it is printed in Spanish or English. The real criticism is that it is so complicated that families have an incredibly difficult time in filling out this form. Our committee has been working, Mr. Emanuel and others have been working, to try to simplify this form to make it useful.     
   This form has more questions than if you went to the World Bank to get a loan. But to now suggest that a student may be denied access to a loan and the family may be denied access to financial support for that education solely on the basis of whether or not the parents speak English, they fill out the form right and whether or not the form is printed in Spanish, you know the old saying, I'm here from the Federal Government; I'm here to help you. This has nothing to do with the parents' status. Nothing to do with the status. It is a question of whether or not we make some effort to reach out to these individuals to make it easier for them to fill out the forms that are necessary for their young people, their children to go on to college and have the financial resources to do that. The question of whether it's printed in Spanish or not is simply now arbitrary. And as would they, if they don't fill out the form correctly, if they have do it with their child or somebody else trying to interpret the questions, interpret the answers to them, I think that's incredibly unfair to people who are here in this country. They're here legally, and they don't happen to speak English and they made need this assistance. 
   What we know about people trying to learn English is that in every city, in every part of this country, where there are classes to teach English, they're oversubscribed, they have waiting lists because these people understand that English is the language of this country. It's the currency of the country, it's the means by which you get ahead in this country, and that's why they want their children to learn English. To now come along and say that we're going to make it more difficult, based upon this characteristic that has nothing to do with your qualifications for the financial assistance, with the qualifications of your child to go to school, what they've accomplished with their lives, I think is outrageous and arbitrary. 
   I'd like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Honda).

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I think the gentleman makes a point. This is about American citizens who are here who are paying taxes, whose children have done well enough to go on to college. They're seeking the financial resources to do that. They may not speak English. And this is a service that we provide to those individuals so that they can accurately fill out a form. They can understand the form, they can understand the liabilities that they're taking on. They can understand the qualifications. 
   To arbitrarily come along and tell one group of citizens, based upon this question of whether or not they speak English, they will be able to have the same access to these resources as others or not seems to me to be very unfair, very un-American. It promotes a set of values that really aren't consistent with the values in this country. And it really is about whether or not the Federal Government is in the business of looking at the people they're trying to serve as customers, people who should be served. 
   I would hope that we would oppose this amendment. We continue to struggle to try to make this form comprehensible to those who speak English and understand English. And I think to make it more difficult now for those who don't is a very poor service to that part of American society. And I would urge opposition to this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank the Rules Committee for reporting this rule to the floor and I want to thank Mr. Cardoza for managing this legislation. He has spent his entire public life being concerned about children at risk. And clearly the children we seek to protect in this bill are at serious risk. 
   I also want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. McCarthy) for all of her effort on this legislation. She, too, has spent her entire time in Congress trying to make sure that our children are safe in whatever setting we have responsibility for, whether it is in high schools or colleges or in this case residential programs. 
   This legislation is designed to address in a reasonable manner a very serious problem that has come to the attention of the Education and Labor Committee this last year when we started looking at the abuse and neglect in teenage residential programs. Tragically, a number of these cases have resulted in the death of a child. 
   This legislation will help ensure that children are safe no matter what setting they are in. It will also provide parents with the information they need to make safe choices on behalf of their children. 
   The rule we are considering today is a fair one. It makes in order the Miller-McKeon manager's amendment and one other amendment offered by Ms. Shea-Porter, a member of the Education and Labor Committee. Mr. McKeon and his staff have worked alongside our staff to make sure that we could do this is in bipartisan fashion, and the manager's amendment reflects the changes to be made to improve the legislation since it left the committee. 
   Of the 10 amendments originally submitted to the Rules Committee, our bipartisan compromise incorporates and makes unnecessary seven of those amendments. It would be disingenuous for anyone to come to the floor and oppose this rule since it takes into consideration those concerns. 
   I want to thank Mr. McKeon for working on this legislation so that we would have a bill with few amendments but we would address the concerns of the Members. In the course of crafting the manager's amendment, we worked with several Members on provisions that are now reflected in the compromise. Representatives Cuellar, Rothman and Matheson each made valuable improvements to the manager's amendment, and we thank them for their input. 
   Mr. Bishop of Utah submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee which we believed raised legitimate concerns, and we made a number of changes in the manager's amendment to, we believe, fully address his concerns. Two other amendments on the other side of the aisle were made moot by the bipartisan agreement, and yet they were not withdrawn. 
   This should not be a partisan issue. The GAO has found thousands of documented cases and allegations of child abuse and neglected children--stretching back decades--in teen residential programs. 
   In hearings before our committee, we heard horrific stories about the way children in these programs were treated by uncaring, untrained, and abusive staff members. For example, children were forced to eat food to which they were known to be allergic. They were required to remain in so-called ``stress'' positions for hours, and to keep hiking even though it became clear they needed immediate medical attention. 
   Madam Speaker, the time for Congress to act is long past due. The weak patchwork of State laws and regulations governing teen residential programs have permitted these abuses to continue for far too long. We must act to prevent children from being put at risk. This bill will help keep children safe and help parents get information they need to make sound choices about the care of their children. I hope that we can adopt this rule. 
   Madam Speaker, let me just say this. I have been involved in this issue for almost 30 years. These abusive programs of children in wilderness camps and boot camps and whatever they call themselves, wagon trains to the future, have gone on for many years. There are many, many programs that take care of children in residential settings, very troubled children, and these programs offer specialized care to those children and treatment of those children, and many parents have written to Members of Congress and my friends and others who have sent their children to these programs, have experienced some success with the care of those children to get rid of addictive behavior and abusive behavior on behalf of those children. 
   But yet within this industry, there is a group of homes that continue to travel from State to State without awareness by the State or not caring by the State, or falling through the regulations, no Federal regulations, no State regulations, and those are the programs that have abused these children. 
   We have worked with professional associations. We have worked with trade associations. We have worked with individuals who run homes of high reputation to develop a set of regulations that make sure that parents will be aware of the placement of their children, the care they are likely to receive, and the skills and the training of the people who take care of them, because that is not true today. 
   As we found out in a GAO report, as Mrs. McCarthy pointed out, there are deceptive practices of people who have huge financial interest in the outcome of referring a family to those homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I thank the gentleman. 
   And that is what this is about. That is where we saw this incredibly abusive behavior, and in a number of instances, simply lethal, to these children. The children died in the care in which their parents had placed them because the parents were not aware of how poorly run these facilities were. In a couple of cases, referrals for criminal proceedings against those individuals have been made. 
   Why is this bill important, because these children are out-of-home placements, and we have to understand the responsibility of those individuals who represent themselves that they can provide treatment and they can provide care. If that's not true, the parents ought to know it. This is simple awareness by parents of the care their children are going to receive. 
   It is hard to believe that you could put your child into a program and the child could die of dehydration or die of simple neglect because people refuse to  call medical personnel to the care of these children because they said that the children were faking. No, they weren't faking, they were dying. They were dying, and people stood around and said they were faking it, don't touch them, don't go near them, and they died on the trail. They needed water. No, they were faking, and they pushed them on to hike out in the desert in the heat, and they died of dehydration. 
   Children standing in stress positions that look more like Guantanamo Bay than look like a care facility for American children. Children standing in a stress position with their hands out with a hood around their neck and a hangman's noose for hours while others children watched and participated in the treatment of those children. That's not the care of children. There is no professional organization that recognizes that kind of care for the treatment of children. And yet those homes blemish the reputation of facilities and organizations that are trying to care for very difficult children. 
   And as Carolyn McCarthy said, these parents are at their wit's end. They have tried almost everything. We need to make sure that the next thing they try is safe and well-organized for the care of their children.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, next week the administration is poised to give us and the American people a rosy assessment of the situation in Iraq. They are going to suggest that in fact there has been no escalation in Iraq, and that everything is just fine. Well, everything isn't just fine, and there is in fact an escalation going on in the violence all over Iraq. What the President's policy is is a bait-and-switch policy. 
   The American troops were sent to Iraq to fight al Qaeda, to fight terrorists. Now we see American troops inserted into combat, coming under fire, dying, and being wounded for the sake of one Shia political party that is afraid that it might lose an election in October. What are the American troops doing fighting for the electoral advantage of one Shia party over another? 
   Recently, the Pentagon suggested that this was all a sign of success of the surge. I think we should watch those words closely; you may miss something. This administration earlier told the people that the troop surge was for the purposes of decreasing the violence and creating an environment of political reconciliation. The people who were supposed to create political reconciliation are now shooting at one another because they think they might lose an election in October, and they want us to sacrifice American lives to impose the majority that they hope to have in that election.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Ohio (Ms. Sutton) for agreeing to handle this rule on this piece of legislation, and for her strong support of this legislation to provide for green high-performing public schools and the facilities in which our children learn. 
   This legislation comes along at a time when the record is very clear that in far too many instances our Nation's school buildings are literally crumbling around the students that we send to them every day. They're in desperate need of renovation; they're in desperate need of remodeling; they're in desperate need of modernization, so that our students who attend those schools every day can have a safe learning environment. 
   Not only will this bill help improve student achievement by providing students and teachers with modern, clean,  safe and healthy learning environment, but it will also give a boost to our economy and help make schools a part of the solution to the global warming crisis. 
   It is this kind of forward thinking and innovative policy that is needed to strengthen our Nation and help build a brighter future. By addressing a number of key challenges at once, this bill is a clear win for our children, for the workers and for our planet. 
   I would like to thank my colleagues who were instrumental in drafting this legislation and working on it many years. I want to thank Congressman Ben Chandler, the author of this bill, for the hard work and dedication of moving this legislation through the House. 
   I would also like to thank Congressman Dale Kildee, the Chair of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education for his work on this bill. Mr. Kildee has been a longtime champion of efforts to improve the physical conditions of our Nation's schools, and he deserves great credit for his leadership in this area. 
   I also want to thank Congressman Dave Loebsack, who joined the fight the moment he stepped foot into the Congress. Like Mr. Kildee, Mr. Loebsack is a former teacher, and he understands firsthand the difference that a top-notch facility, that a modern facility, that a safe facility, that a clean facility can mean to a child's education. That's the promise of this legislation. 
   And I would like to recognize the efforts of Congressmen Rush Holt, Charlie Rangel, Bob Etheridge and Congresswoman Darlene Hooley, who is the head of the Green Schools Caucus. 
   As study after study has told us, we don't have a choice when it comes to rebuilding our schools. We simply won't be able to provide every child with the world-class education they need and deserve unless we're willing to help the States and school districts improve the conditions of these buildings and facilities. It's not a question of if we should modernize and repair our Nation's schools; it's a matter of when. It's simply a decision that we have to make and we can make it today. 
   Today we have that opportunity to begin this investment, an investment that will yield great results for our children, our economy and our future. 
   Finally, I want to thank all of the members of the Rules Committee for the consideration of this rule, for the reporting of this rule, and to Chairwoman Slaughter for her diligence in making sure that this rule came to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, it's interesting that my colleagues on the other side railed against this legislation in the name of energy. 
   It doesn't do a lot of good to pump more energy into these schools, more air conditioning into these schools, more heat into these schools when the schools are such inefficient users of energy. It makes no sense to pump more and more electricity into the schools, to use lighting that's outdated, outmoded, harmful to the learning of these children.  
   The purpose of this legislation is to take a major institution in our country, our elementary secondary education system, and have the Federal Government lend some support to local efforts that are struggling now, trying to accelerate their programs to cut their energy costs in the running of their schools. 
   That's what this bill allows us to do. It allows us to put in place as they renovate, as they repair, as they remodel these schools, trying to recover, as all businesses are all across the country, as homeowners are all across the country, to reduce their energy costs. It allows us to partner up with them and to provide some assistance in doing that. 
   It's rather interesting that all they can talk about on the other side is somehow that they didn't get to go to Alaska. If they'd gone to Alaska, it probably would have made a penny or 2 cents or 3 cents a difference in a gallon of gasoline today. 
   But the fact of the matter is why would you go to Alaska and put it into cars that are getting 12 and 13 miles a gallon? But you never went to the question of efficiencies. You never went to the question of better automobiles. 
   We did. The first time in 30 years, this Congress improved the mileage standard for automobiles. Just think if we had done it when George Bush said he wanted it done. Today, it would have been an entire different industry. 
   But no, you listened to the oil industry and you listened to the automobile industry. Well, listen to them today as the chairman of General Motors has to admit that they didn't see it coming, they didn't see it was going to happen. They laid off 20,000 workers. They shut down four plants making SUVs and trucks. Why are we listening to those people? 
   If we continue to listen to them, we'll be the only people in the world that are listening to them. They've made one bad business decision, one bad energy decision after another for the last two decades, and it cost them almost 450,000 jobs to the workers. It cost them market share, it cost them productivity, it cost them profit. Now what are they doing? They're trying to play catch-up. 
   Well, we don't think the school districts in this country should play catch-up like General Motors. We think the school districts in this country ought to have an opportunity to make these facilities more efficient in the use of the energy, more efficient in the conservation of energy so that they can come into the modern age and they can make the changes that all of the studies indicate to us not only will save them energy, not only will make the facilities safer, cleaner and better for the learning environment that these children need, it will also dramatically change the cost of running these school districts. 
   It's happening, but too many school districts in too many areas don't have sufficient funds. We think the Federal Government ought to put its shoulder to the wheel and help these school districts conserve their energy.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I rise in very strong support of H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Facility Act, legislation that would invest in modernizing public schools across the country. 
   This legislation is an example of how well-crafted public policy can address a number of key challenges all at the same time. This bill has something in it for improving the education of our children, improving our economy, and improving the environment. 
   First, this legislation will help improve student achievement by providing more children and teachers with a modern, safe, healthy, clean, place for learning. Second, this legislation will give a boost to our economy by injecting demand into a faltering U.S. construction industry. And, third, this legislation will make our schools part of the solution to the global warming crisis by encouraging more energy efficiency as well as the use of renewable energy resources. 
   Any one of these three reasons alone would be enough to support this bill; but when you put all three of them together, this is a clear win for our children, for our communities, for workers, and for our planet. 
   For children and teachers, unfortunately, the reality is that in too many of our communities the schools are literally crumbling. In 2000, The National Center of Education Statistics said it would take $127 billion to bring schools into good condition, including that 75 percent of the schools were in various stages of disrepair. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave U.S. schools a D for national infrastructure report card. Just last month, the 21st Century School Fund called for a $140 billion Federal investment in school facilities to bring all school districts up to the level of the highest income districts followed by ongoing annual Federal investment. 
   The fact of the matter is that those children who have the most difficult time receiving an education are receiving that education in some of the worst schools in this Nation. This is an effort for us simply to partner with local school districts on a formula basis so that they can then carry out their plans to renovate, to repair, to remodel existing schools so that they can save energy, they can provide better lighting and a better atmosphere for the schools to learn. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

And at the same time that we are considering legislation which is designed to lower those energy costs for schools, they are arguing against the passage of this legislation. 
   This is a modest effort by the Federal Government to help these schools get on with the refurbishing, the repair, and the renovation of these schools so that they will lower their energy costs, whether it is heating or air conditioning, so that they can then put that money back into the educational program.

   It's wonderful to listen to this conversation among two people talking about fiscal responsibility back and forth to one another.

They never found the way to fund IDEA. And yet, somehow, they were fiscally responsible, and now they've run this economy and this country into a ditch, with $9 trillion of debt in 8 short years, and they inherited a $5 trillion surplus.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, all day long we have had an interesting double argument here from my colleagues on the other side. All day long they have insisted that school districts are in trouble because of increased energy costs, because of the increased cost of electricity, natural gas, air conditioning, heating, fuel for the buses, and all the rest of it. And they have spent all day long arguing against a bill that's designed exactly to deal with the energy costs of those schools, by helping those districts to refurbish, to rebuild, to remodel, to reconstruct old facilities that do not use energy efficiently, that do not have state-of-the-art facilities for the conservation of energy, for the better use of energy. 
   We are giving out tax cuts and have for many years in a very sensible program to help businesses come into the modern age in energy. Businesses, homeowners, and others are reaping huge savings. But schools aren't. 
   So this bill simply says that the Federal Government will join in a partnership with local districts who have already set out their priorities to provide for energy efficiency, to provide for new technologies so that they can provide the best learning environment for the children in those school districts. And when they do that, what we're seeing across the country is those schools that are fortunate enough to have the money are dramatically reducing the amount of their budgets that go to energy and they can use that on curriculum or extracurricular activities or teacher pay or whatever else it is.     
   But most schools can't afford to do that. And so what we are saying is we will simply partner up with those districts most in need and see if we can help them reduce their energy budgets over the years so they can put it into education. That is the bill that Mr. Chandler introduced. That is the bill that is designed and has been voted on on this floor today, because that is the need of the school districts. That is why the school districts, the State Superintendents of Schools, local school districts, are supporting this legislation, because it meets the need they have. 
   Now somehow after arguing all day long that this is too heavy of a hand, we now see an amendment that we've never see in committee, we didn't see on the floor, we didn't see in Rules Committee, that is suggesting somehow we just pay the ongoing maintenance cost of the districts. I don't know if that is what you wanted to sign up for. We thought we'd sign up to be a partner in district priorities to refurbish and rehab schools and improve the energy efficiency of those based upon the district policies. I didn't know we were going to sign up for a long-term grant for the maintenance of school districts. 
   I would like to yield now to the author of the bill, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Chandler).

   All day long in this Chamber we have had amendment after amendment saying that if we weren't putting money into school construction to refurbish these schools in need, they would put it in IDEA, they would put it in title I, they would put it in after-school care, they would put it in monitoring. You know what? When they had the money and they were in control, they didn't put it anywhere. 
   They inherited a $5 trillion surplus, a $5 trillion surplus, and when they had the money, they didn't put it anywhere. Now we have a $9 trillion debt and they still can't fund education. That is why we have got to stop it. We should reject this motion to recommit. This is enough to kill the bill. What we need is in fact more money for our schools.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Democrats have fought to bring America's addiction to oil to the forefront of our national attention for years. We must reduce our dependence on oil in order to stimulate the economy, to protect our country and to curb the harmful effects of global warming. 
   Since Democrats gained control of the Congress last year, we raised automobile fuel efficiency standards for the first time in over a quarter of a century, despite the opposition of President Bush. 
   And the House recently passed a comprehensive renewable energy bill. Our renewable energy bill will reduce America's dependence on oil. It will lower energy costs, protect the environment, and create hundreds of thousands of new skilled green jobs all across America. 
   While Congress is working hard to reduce our oil dependence, my constituents are working hard to do their part to battle rising energy prices and reduce their own carbon footprint. 
   I recently asked my constituents to tell me what they were doing to reduce their personal energy consumption and to reduce the cost of energy in their monthly lives, and I promised that I would share some of these best ideas right here on the House floor. 
   Here are some of the comments I've received so far. Many of my constituents are already following some of the more conventional but important methods of energy conservation, including replacing traditional light bulbs with compact fluorescent lights, unplugging appliances that aren't in  use, drying clothes outside in the California sun. Many more are taking advantage of public transportation options throughout Northern California and the San Francisco Bay area. 
   Patricia Kneisler of Benicia, California, gangs all of her errands together. By doing this, as she says, her ``gas guzzler,'' the 1995 SUV, is only used when absolutely necessary and in the most efficient manner. 
   Gina Hale's family in Pittsburg, California, attached ultraviolet blocking film on all of the house's windows to cut down on air conditioning costs during the summer. 
   Melissa Miller of Concord, California runs her dishwasher only when it is full and at night when the electricity rates go down after 7 p.m. 
   I have posted on my Web site sources of information about how consumers can reduce their energy consumption and save money and help protect the environment. I invite you to visit my Web site. While you're there, post your own comments about your ideas of saving energy. It's at www.georgemiller.house.gov. 
   Small changes have big impacts. Not only are my constituents reducing their own energy bills, but they're also contributing to our future energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress can and must continue to support all of the individuals who are working to reduce energy consumption. We must work to pass legislation that invests in renewable energy, encourages innovation and investment in green technology and supports the creation of green jobs. 
   Congress is obligated to move America into the future, into a modern energy policy, and stop the reliance on the past fossil fuels policy that has kept this country in bondage to the oil companies and to the suppliers from overseas. Our economy and our environment depend upon it. 
   It is a tragedy that President Bush and 12 years of a Republican Congress stood in the way of energy independence, stood in the way of a modern energy program. While the President told the Nation and Congress that we're addicted to oil, he did nothing to alter that addiction--nothing other than to call for more oil drilling. Spoken like a true addict. 
   Now is the time to move forward. The price of gas and oil is at a crisis to America's families, and we must act quickly and boldly to come to grips with this crisis. 
   Our future depends upon reducing our demand for oil, increasing energy efficiency, and providing sustainable energy sources to relieve consumers of the crippling energy costs that invade their lives on a daily basis and to stimulate the next generation of innovation. 
   I appreciate the contributions of my constituents, and I look forward to hearing from more of them and to bring them to the attention of the House to see what decisions they're making about reducing energy costs in their personal daily lives.

   This legislation would protect students and families from the corrupt practices and abuses that for too long have been allowed to run rampant within the student loan industry. 
   Ensuring that our Nation's student loan programs are working as effectively as possible to help students and parents pay for the cost of a college education, it is paramount to the goals of this Nation recognizing the importance of students' achieving a college education so they can fully participate in American society and the American economy. And working to make that more accessible and affordable has been the long-term goal of both parties of this government. 
   But now what we see is that this program has been badly corrupted. This program has started to be hollowed out by the activities of lenders, of universities, of individuals within the government, individuals within the university system, individuals within the lending community. For 6 years this administration has been put on notice of these activities taking place in the student lending program with ever-mounting evidence and public statements and concerns echoed by members within the administration from the previous administration calling to the problems that were occurring within the student loan programs. It is becoming increasingly clear that the student loan program has been hijacked by third parties who saw that they could run this program to their financial benefit. Unfortunately, that meant that it was being run to the detriment of the students and the families who are borrowing the money who are struggling to pay this money back so that they could achieve a college education. 
   We introduced this legislation first in February when it was disclosed by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo that he was expanding an investigation into the relationships between lenders and colleges and universities across the country. 
   Throughout the previous years, stories have surfaced about inducements and kickbacks and conflicts of interests, bribes and payoffs ranging from sending college employees on exotic vacations to staffing school financial aid offices during the busiest time of the student aid calendar. These inducements are offered by lenders to secure a spot on the preferred lender list, a list that supposedly presents to the students and to their families that this is a list of trust, that these are the best loans available for a number of reasons to those students. But we now learn that securing a position on a preferred lender list was really, in many instances with many universities and with many lenders, an act of corruption, not an act of transparency, not an act of honesty, not an act in the best interest of the students and/or their parents, and not in the best interest of achieving the lowest possible cost for those students' education. 
   But entry into the preferred lender meant more than just having this coveted spot. It meant a near guarantee of business. It meant an opportunity for lenders to prey on families and offer them private loans. It also meant that students weren't given the best information, the most accurate information. It also meant increased cost to the students and to their families. 
   Since we first introduced this bill, ongoing investigations at the Federal and State levels and by news organizations have shed new light on the scope of the corruption and the conflicts of interest surrounding these lists that are undermining the Federal student loan aid program that millions of borrowers have come to depend upon. We have learned more about the astonishing degree to which lenders buy their way into colleges and universities through excessive inducements, which is the polite word, or what might be termed ``bribery,'' which might be a better word, in order to boost their marginal profits. 
   All of this, all of this was known to the Department of Education. Suggested changes were left behind by the Clinton administration to this program. Department employees raised these concerns and others with the Department of Education, and no action was, in fact, taken. And what we see, of course, is that less protection was provided to students and to their families. 
   We have learned that these inducements include college officials being paid to serve on lender advisory boards and receiving stock in the companies. We have learned that these conflicts of interest do not end with college financial aid officers. It has been revealed that at least one public official in the Office of Federal Student Aid, the arm of the Department of Education that runs the student aid program, held hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock in a major student loan company.  
   But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Lenders and schools must be held accountable for any practice that compromises the trust that students and parents deserve to have in our Federal student aid program. Today, by passing the Student Aid Sunshine Act, we are taking clear and important actions to put an end to the corrupt practices and conflicts of interest that for too long have been allowed to dominate this industry.     
   We call on lenders, institutions and the Department of Education to also take appropriate action to end these practices, and we insist that they recognize their fiduciary responsibility to the students and their parents who are the borrowers of this money, the borrowing of money that they struggle to pay back for many years afterwards. 
   I am proud to be joined by my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee, Buck McKeon, the senior Republican, and, again, Rub&#233;n Hinojosa of the Subcommittee on Higher Education to bring to the floor a stronger, more comprehensive, bipartisan Student Loan Sunshine Act. This bill will prevent these egregious practices from occurring in the future by reinstating trust in our schools through strict codes of conduct, guaranteeing loan options and ensuring the best loan possible, ensuring equal and timely processing of loans, giving students full and fair information when taking out and repaying loans, protecting students from aggressive marketing practices and inserting the fiduciary responsibility for all parties to these agreements. 
   Further, this bill bans all gifts, participation on advisory boards and risk-sharing agreements between lenders and schools and ensures greater transparency and accountability when schools recommend lenders for the students. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join us in voting for this legislation. Today, I think we can take this critical step toward returning these programs to the very people they were intended to serve, students and parents who are borrowing this money. It's time to protect these students and parents and end the exploitation and the abuses of the student loan program. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleagues on the committee for all their assistance in drafting this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks and for his leadership on this. I thank Mr. McKeon and Mr. Keller for all of their cooperation, for their suggestions and for the introduction of the bill soon after this came to light by Mr. McKeon. I think it was very helpful in our discussions with Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. I certainly want to thank him for his diligence and the speed with which he responded to this information. 
   Tragically, much of this information has been available for a considerable period of time. Tragically, what we now are making against the law, the conduct we are now changing almost became the preferred way of doing business among many of the colleges and universities and the lenders which they utilized on behalf of their students. 
   It is just inconceivable that when people understand, and it is brought to our attention every day, the decisions that students and their families have to make about whether to pursue a college degree, the costs that are incurred, the sacrifices that are made by working families, by all families, by the students, many of whom then work part time and full time to augment the cost of that college, when that sacrifice and those determinations and decisions are made by those families, to have that process corrupted by some of the largest corporations in America, some of the wealthiest corporations in America, that they would see somehow a way to skim off, to skim off the profits and the costs at the expense of these students and of the taxpayers that put up the money. 
   The reason we guarantee these loans is to try to drive this money to the students and their families at the lowest possible cost so that they can afford to go to college; they can afford to take a job and pay back the cost of their college. That is the public purpose. Now that public purpose has absolutely been prostituted by the Department of Education, by many of the lending institutions and by many of the colleges and much of the personnel that works for them. 
   This legislation is a first step, a bipartisan step to stop those practices in their tracks, to get this program right side up for the benefit of the families and the students who are borrowing the money. To serve notice on the institutions, the lenders, the institutions of higher education and the people who work in these programs that this will no longer be tolerated. 
   Once again, this program has to come to the point where it is again serving the families and the students who are making this sacrifice to achieve a college education at the lowest possible cost. That is the public interest, that is the public purpose, and we will not have that corrupted. We will not have that corrupted, either by the public agencies or the private agencies that are engaged in this program. 
   The next step is to bar those agencies if they continue in this practice. That would be a horrible thing to do for those institutions, but we will not allow this to continue. And as we consider the Higher Education Act, we are going to continue to pursue ways in which we can reform this program and make it work for those for whom it was designed, the families and the students. 
   I want to thank the staff on both sides of the committee that were so helpful in understanding the programs and the changes that needed to be made, that went through the evidence and responded in this legislation, so that the House of Representatives could go on record that we will not allow this to happen on our watch.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, last January when the President was suggesting the need for the escalation of the numbers of troops in Iraq, he also told us that while we would provide the troops under his policy, the Iraqis would provide a series of  benchmarks which they would meet to end the insurgency and to bring their country together politically so that the insurgency can be dampened down or ended. 
   Now we are told by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it would be wrong to hold the Iraqi Government, the Malaki government, to those benchmarks because it would take away their flexibility, while President Bush said that if they did not meet these benchmarks in January, they would lose the confidence of the American people. 
   President Bush had it right. They haven't met the benchmarks. They are not holding up their end of the bargain. The Parliament is not meeting. A third of them are living in London, not in Iraq, and they have lost the confidence of the American people. 
   How is it that the Secretary of State and the President of the United States can continue to believe that we should continue to send American soldiers to die in Iraq when the Iraqi Government won't meet the benchmarks which were supposed to be the bedrock of this new policy, this new direction, that has turned out to be the same old stay-the-course policy where American soldiers die and the Iraqi Government dithers away day in and day out and not meeting the new policies to bring a unified Iraq together? 
   It is unacceptable to the American people. It is unacceptable to our soldiers. It is unacceptable to their families. And we ought to end this policy now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, and I want to thank the committee for bringing this bill to the floor and look forward to its passage.  
   In 2003, I opposed the President's prescription drug plan because it was clear that it would not help America's elderly and America's sick. 
   Instead, the bill guaranteed high prices to drug makers, by prohibiting the Federal Government from negotiating lower drug prices on behalf of seniors. 
   Today we have an opportunity to correct one of the wrongs instituted by that bill. The bill before us today is part of our ambitious agenda for the first 100 hours in this new Congress, and will start to put the interests of seniors before those of drug companies. 
   The states, the V.A., Fortune 500 companies, and large pharmacy chains all use their bargaining clout to obtain lower drug prices for their patients. Medicare beneficiaries deserve the same opportunity. 
   Giving HHS drug price negotiating authority for Medicare has overwhelming bipartisan support across the country; along with support from organizations like AARP, Consumers Union, and AFL-CIO. 
   Negotiating for lower prescription drug prices will be the first step towards fixing this highly flawed system and helping our seniors.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I just wanted to say that we did respond in this manager's amendment by making this process more transparent, encouraging greater communication and cooperation between the students, faculty, college bookstores, and publishers in providing an accurate description of what the revisions in the textbooks, what the new edition really means. 
   Very often we have been told by students and faculty and those concerned with this, as you are, that sometimes these changes are de minimis, but you have to have the new textbook; you can't use a used textbook. 
   We think this will be an improvement, and I thank you so much for hounding the committee on this subject. I think this is the beginning of increased transparency and concentration on this problem of rising textbook and educational material cost increases.

I think in the context of going to the conference committee, where we know the Senate has an auction provision, I think, well given even there, where we've done, we have this provision in the reconciliation bill to look at an auction to see whether we can do it and make it feasible, this may be helpful in us making some determinations about how we proceed on that effort and how the Department proceeds on that effort.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman from Wisconsin's amendment. I think having these parallel audits, these are two programs that, for the sake of the taxpayer, compete with one another, and I think that that's important. 
   I was encouraged to see in the President's 2009 budget that, for the first time, the taxpayer costs for student borrowing through the FFEL program are closer to the more efficient direct loan programs, taking into account what we did in the reconciliation bill. I was also interested to see that still we see that it costs only one-fourth as much to make a direct loan as it does to make a FFEL loan program. 
   So I think that we should be encouraged and we should be prepared to have these audits, because I think the taxpayer is winning this discussion, thanks in large part to the efforts of Mr. Petri over many years, to have this kind of comparison, this kind of discussion. Many of the recommendations that we made in the reconciliation bill were, in fact, the recommendations of the Bush administration from the office of OMB about the cost of that program. We were able to take that money out, recycle it in favor of students and families borrowing the money to drive down the cost of borrowing that money and increase the Pell Grants. Now we see that we are still 25 percent cheaper for the taxpayers than the FFEL program.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I rise in strong support of this amendment, and I thank the gentleman for offering it. 
   We now see that, almost like the subprime home mortgages, that these private student loans have been offered to a great number of people who it's questionable about whether or not they can pay it back. And we now see these private lenders retreating from this market because they know they've now made loans that they're not going to be able to sell off to others. They've made questionable loans. 
   These loans look more and more like consumer loans because there's no requirement that the people who take out these loans in the direct marketing to students, a student signs up, gets a loan, they don't have to pay their tuition, they don't have to pay their books, they don't have to pay their dormitory fees. They're consumer loans. They can buy beer and pizza, they can buy flat screened TVs, and they ought to be treated like those consumer loans. That's why this amendment is supported by the American Association of Community Colleges, the Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, the United States Students Association, the U.S. Public Interest Groups, because they all recognize that this is far different than the public loans that families and students take out where there's arrangements to work out and help those students if they get into trouble. That's not the case with the private loans. 
   Let the marketplace work. They are now charging these students 18 and 20 percent, and we ought to understand what that means to the future of these students. We ought to support the Davis amendment.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. I rise in support of Mr. Welch's amendment and thank Mr. Keller for his support of this amendment. Mr. Keller has laid it out quite correctly. 
   We have been struggling with this for a number of years. I think that this amendment helps with the transparency and with the information that we need to know as we continue to consider public policy. I say that because growing numbers of Members of Congress come up to me every week after they go home and talk about they have been asked the question about the increased costs of college. We know it is complex. We know it is difficult. And we know that it is not easily given to the idea that one policy fits all, one size fits all, whatever cliche you want to use. 
   But it must be addressed when we are asking the taxpayers to continue to step up and to provide the assistance to these families so that we can create a strong Nation and a strong economy and well-educated individuals that are critical to maintaining the democracy in a complex world. So I want to thank the gentleman for offering this amendment and ask my colleagues to support it.

   This linking of the data between the IRS and the Department of Education, we have been given excuse after excuse after excuse why this couldn't be done. The Doggett-Hayes amendment allows this to happen, requires that it happen. It's very important that we support this amendment and that it be part of the final bill when it comes out of the conference committee.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, one of the great coalitions we have in the Congress of the United States, supported by every school board, every teacher organization, every educational group in the country was to fully fund IDEA. It was bipartisan; letters went down with 200, 300, 350, 375 Members of Congress saying fully fund IDEA. 
   We got pounded on our side when we weren't in control of the Congress; that's the way it was. Everybody was for it, right up until the moment that they took control of the Congress of the United States, because in No Child Left Behind, when we asked to fully fund IDEA, the now-minority leader of the Republicans pulled the plug, and that great bipartisan coalition hasn't been heard of since. 
   I would be embarrassed too. I would try to struggle to come back because you disappointed the American public. You certainly disappointed the families of these children, and you certainly disappointed these children and those who struggle to give them an education every day. So now as they struggle to come back, what are they going to do? 
   They are going to say unless you fund IDEA, you can't spend any money on higher education under this bill. Folks, that's all money in higher education under this bill, which is under this bill. So you won't be able to provide loan forgiveness for firefighters and policemen and public defenders and prosecutors and nurses. You won't be able to help veterans reenter the higher education system when they come back with so many of the injuries that they are coming back from. 
   We won't be able to give them the assistance that's in this legislation. For those veterans who lost a family member, this bill says they are automatically entitled, the children are automatically entitled to the Pell Grant. Those veterans' families won't get that, a member of their family paid the supreme price in the defense of this country. They won't get that. 
   You are not going to get what we have been working for for so many years, led by Mr. McKeon, led by Rahm Emanuel, to simplify it so families can understand the access to the loan program so they can pay for their kids' education. For the first time in 25 years, we have a simplified system. But you won't get that; families won't get that. 
   What about safety on college campuses? We had a moment of silence here for those students. We had hearings all over Capitol Hill for those students, but we address campus safety on a bipartisan basis. We slugged it out, we worked it out, we did it. You won't get that. Those campuses won't get that kind of assistance. 
   What about now for the first time a master's program for the historically black colleges? You won't get that. Because you shirked your duties year after year after year for over a decade, you have now decided these are the people that you are going to punish. This is the tenet of this party on the other side of the aisle.

   Mr. Chairman and Members of the House, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, which was reported by the Committee on Education and Labor with unanimous bipartisan support. This legislation strengthens and reauthorizes our Nation's higher education program. 
   With our recent enactment of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, this Congress has already taken a historic step by providing the single largest increase in Federal student aid since the GI bill. 
   But we all know that there's still work to do to ensure that the doors of college are truly open to call qualified students. H.R. 4137 helps us reach this goal. 
   Today's students and families face a number of challenges on the path to college, from skyrocketing college prices, to needlessly complicated student aid application process, to predatory tactics by student lenders. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act will address these challenges by reshaping our higher education system so that, once again, it operates in the best interest of students and families. 
   The bill will create a higher education system that is more affordable and fair and easier to navigate for consumers.  
   For years, prices have been skyrocketing at colleges and universities around the country, and we can all agree that the increase in college aid was vital. But there's no question we must also begin to address these rising tuition prices. 
   This legislation would create a new user-friendly Web site for families with helpful information on college pricing and the factors driving tuition increases. 
   The Web site would also publish lists of the most expensive schools, the least expensive schools, and schools with the largest percentage increase in tuition prices. Colleges with the largest increases in tuition prices would be required to report their reasons for these price hikes and to create a task force to examine how they can work to keep their prices lower. 
   The bill would also ensure the States would hold up their end of the bargaining by providing higher education, by establishing State maintenance-of-effort requirements. We cannot just keep putting in Federal taxpayer dollars at the top and having States take money out of the bottom. 
   The bill would restore trust and accountability to the student loan program. It would also provide students and families with better protections when it comes to the often murky world of college loans. 
   The protections for students and parent borrowers in our bill form a bill of rights for college consumers, including fair disclosure loan terms to borrowers of Federal and private loans. 
   In addition, the bill would simplify the Federal student aid application process and provide families with extra time to plan for their college expenses. 
   The bill would also: 
   Make the Pell Grant scholarship available year round for the first time and would increase the authorization for that program; 
   Strengthen the TRIO and GEAR UP college readiness and support programs that are helping so many students discover that they not only can attend college, they can succeed in college and graduate; 
   Expand the funding for graduate programs at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-serving Institutions and minority serving schools; 
   Increase college aid and support programs for veterans and our men and women in uniform; 
   To ensure equal opportunities and a fair learning environment for students with disabilities; 
   And to make our college campuses safer. The bill does all of that, and it's an important change in the higher education responsibilities of the Federal Government and in the support for our higher education institutions and in our partnership with the States.     
   It has been a long time for this bill to come to the floor. It has been 10 years since we reauthorized this Act. And in recognizing that long time, I want to certainly point out the contributions made by Congressman BUCK MCKEON, the senior Republican on this committee; RUB&#201;N HINOJOSA and RIC KELLER of the subcommittee; and the Chairs and ranking members of the Higher Education Committee. 
   But I just want to say that much of this bill reflects a lot of work that was done by Mr. Keller, by Mr. McKeon. Certainly the provisions dealing with college costs reflect an awful lot of work that was done by Mr. McKeon when he was in the majority on the subcommittee and the full committee by Mr. Tierney, on our side of the committee, to bring this to fruition so finally we can start to not only make greater contributions in terms of assistance to families, but also help institutions rein in these costs, discuss these costs with parents and students so that they can make smart choices. 
   I would also like to thank my committee staff for helping us craft a strong bill, including Denise Forte, Stephanie Moore, Gaby Gomez, Julie Radocchia, Jeff Appel, Sharon Lewis, Julia Martin, and Rachel Racusen. 
   I would also like to thank the many students across the country whose voices have been so helpful in helping us to understand the changes that needed to be made and also to voice support for this legislation and are a very important part of this process. 
   I think the entire House can be proud of this legislation, and I think it will help us build a better future for our students and for our economy and for our country, both in terms of our economic security and our national security. And I think it will help fulfill the vision that all American families have for the members of their family to be able to participate in a higher education, to graduate and to pursue their hopes and aspirations, in making full contributions. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Chairman Skelton's bill to bring American forces home from Iraq and to begin to end this tragic war, a war borne of lies, ignorance and arrogance. The cost of this war has been high to our country, to our economy but, most importantly, to our men and women in uniform, for they have taken all of the sacrifice for our President's decision to take this country to war in Iraq. 
   Our military responded honorably to the President's decision, but he failed to honor their sense of duty and their courage with a plan that was designed to succeed. His failed policy has cost their families, their communities, and most tragically, it has cost them their limbs and their lives. 
   The war in Iraq cannot be won, and it cannot be lost. It can only be brought to an end. The President continues to display both sheer arrogance and tragic ignorance as he refuses to change policy. Over and over again, it says the same thing, to stay the same course, to give them more time and that success is just around the corner. 
   The American people realize that staying the course in Iraq was not a plan, and it is not going to work. I have known, as many of my Democratic colleagues have, that staying the course is not acceptable. We honor our troops when we have the courage to bring them home and end this war.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2857, the Generations Invigorating Volunteerism and Education Act, the first reauthorization of national and community service laws and programs since 1993. I am pleased that today this House is taking up this important measure that will take volunteerism and service into the 21st century. 
   It was in March of 1961 that President John F. Kennedy first challenged a generations of Americans to ask ``not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.'' By establishing the Peace Corps and the Volunteers in Service to America programs, he inspired millions of Americans to make a difference here at home and around the globe. He created a powerful legacy of hope and service that connects us as Americans. 
   Almost 50 years later, we should be very proud that volunteering in America is at a 30-year high. Through AmeriCorps and other service programs, new generations of Americans have become inspired to build stronger, more vibrant communities, help children succeed in schools, and rebuild cities in times of disaster. 
   In fact, in 2006, more than 61 million Americans gave back to their communities through service. That same year, volunteers in my home State of California contributed more than 858 million hours of service to our State economy, a value of more than $17 billion. In the 15 years since AmeriCorps was enacted into law, more than 500,000 Americans of all ages and backgrounds have participated in this program. 
   Our current and future generations of volunteers deserve our renewed support for their programs, just as President Kennedy first provided decades ago. The GIVE Act, this legislation, recognizes this growing service movement that is taking place across the Nation. It builds upon the successful work being done in communities across by members of AmeriCorps, VISTA, Senior Corps and Learn and Serve America. 
   AmeriCorps has become a successful model for public-private partnerships. Last year, the AmeriCorps program leveraged more than $200 million in matching funds, mobilized more than 1.4 million volunteers, and worked with 2,000 small and large faith-based and community-based organizations across the country. 
   The GIVE Act would strengthen the AmeriCorps service model by putting us on the path to increasing the number of AmeriCorps members from 75,000 to 100,000 by 2012 with a focus of engaging low-income, disadvantaged, and at-risk youth. 
   With soaring tuition prices making it more difficult for many students to get a college degree, the GIVE Act would help AmeriCorps members pay for college by increasing the scholarship that they earn in exchange for their service from $4,725 to $5,255 by 2012. 
   This bill would also introduce young people to community service by creating a new Summer of Service initiative that will offer middle school and high school students the opportunity to spend the summer working to improve their communities while earning a $500 education award that can be used for college or for college preparation. 
   Alumni of these programs remain valuable resources to our communities. More than 72 percent of AmeriCorps members continue to volunteer in their communities after their term of service ends. After Hurricane Katrina devastated gulf coast communities, AmeriCorps alumni played a key role in relief, recovery, and rebuilding efforts. 
   To help tap into these resources in times of emergency, this bill would expand the number of volunteers ready to respond by creating an Alumni Reserve Corps of service alumni with previous experience serving during disasters. 
   Volunteering also provides critical opportunities for older Americans to make a difference in their communities. Each year, nearly half a million older Americans participate in the Senior Corps programs, mentoring children of prisoners, providing independent living services to seniors, assisting victims of natural disasters, and mobilizing other volunteers. 
   The GIVE Act would expand the purpose of Senior Corps programs by adding an emphasis on recruiting retired STEM, health care, law enforcement and military professionals to help with education, after-school, public safety and technology needs. 
   In addition, it would phase in the competition for the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programs, an important part of the Senior Corps by 2013, allowing new grantees and volunteers to join the service movement and encouraging innovation and evolution among high-performing programs. I also want to thank the RSVP program for working with us to ensure a responsible transition. 
   I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle, in particular Representatives MCCARTHY, MCKEON and PLATTS, for their leadership, as well as the Service Caucus for their support. 
   I also want to thank our committee staff for their hard work on this bill, including Alex Ceja, Denise Forte, Stephanie Moore, Deborah Koolbeck with Mrs. McCarthy, Brad Thomas with Mr. McKeon, and Becky Wolfkiel with Mr. Platts. 
   Let me also thank Voices of Services and its member organizations, who were invaluable in helping us develop this legislation. 
   It is clear that service has played an important role in this country's history and will continue to help us meet the challenges and needs of our communities. It is clear that the interest in volunteering reaches across all generations: our young people, retiring baby boomers, and older Americans. The GIVE Act reflects their commitment, and our commitment, to building a stronger country through service. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort by supporting this legislation. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I insist upon my point of order. The gentleman again is speaking to the scheduling of the floor of the House. The bill, in its entirety, speaks to national voluntary service. The gentleman, I guess, is talking about the intelligence service. And the fact of the matter is, under the point of order there is nothing in this legislation within the jurisdiction of the committees, for the motion to recommit, of the Intelligence Committee or the Judiciary Committee, and I insist upon my point of order.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I insist on my point of order. Again, had we been involved with the committees of jurisdiction that the gentleman is referring to, the bill would have been referred by the Parliamentarian to those committees, and it was not. And let me just inform the gentleman. I know he's been out for a couple of days and he comes back with great vigor, and I admire his arguments. But there is nothing within the programs of Teach for America or the Boys and Girls Club of America or the Big Brothers Big Sisters program or the YouthBuild or the National Council on Aging or the Senior Citizen Nutrition Program or the American Red Cross, there is nothing in those programs that require that they eavesdrop or wiretap anybody's phones before they can deliver their services. And there is nothing within the jurisdiction of this legislation or of this committee that deals with those matters, and there is nothing in this bill that deals with the matters within the jurisdiction of those committees. And I insist upon my point of order.

   Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time. 
   I just want to say that this is unfortunate, because this is an amendment that we would agree to. It embodies the regulations supported by the Bush administration. It affects a program that has huge bipartisan support in all of our communities, that the President is in support of and is looking for the opportunity to sign this bill. But the gentleman insists upon making his motion in the form of ``promptly,'' so that the bill has to go back to committee, which makes everything much more complicated in terms of the passage of this bill.
