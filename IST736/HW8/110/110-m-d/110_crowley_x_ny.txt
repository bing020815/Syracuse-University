<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (WELCOMING RABBI STUART BERMAN -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure and an honor for me today to welcome our guest chaplain, Rabbi Stuart Berman, and to thank him for such a wonderful prayer this morning. 
   New York, and my community in particular, have been fortunate to have had someone so dedicated presiding in our area. Most recently, Rabbi Berman served at the Woodside Jewish Center. However, he has had a very accomplished and profound career throughout his lifetime. 
   The rabbi nobly served on the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the Presidential Transition Committee, the White House Conference on Children and Youth Drug Abuse Panel, as well as the White House Conference on Aging. 
   In 1985, Rabbi Berman made history in the State of Florida and became the first rabbi to ever be appointed a prison chaplain. 
   In New York, he again placed the community first and was appointed police-clergy liaison, City of New York Police Department, and Sanitation Department Chaplain. He is also a prolific author of numerous publications and articles, and he previously hosted a weekly television talk show on FAN-TV.  
   I would also point out that Rabbi Berman offered a prayer at the dedication of the post office renaming for my predecessor and his friend, our mutual friend, Congressman Tom Manton, when it was being named in his honor. 
   Rabbi Berman is joined today by his son, Nathaniel, and his sister, Zell. Audrey, his wife, who is an early childhood specialist with the New York City Board of Education, unfortunately could not be here with us and with him today. But we all know that she is very, very proud of her rabbi. 
   Thank you, Rabbi, for being here.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   Currently, more than 15.4 million workers in America are enjoying the right to unionize, earning an average 30 percent more than workers without unions. 
   New Yorkers make up approximately 2 million out of the 15.4 million unionized employees nationwide--making it the second most unionized state in the Nation. 
   But far too many workers looking to have collective bargaining rights are denied and the people who are often looking to organize are those working in the service industry--many of whom do not have access to collective bargaining, the right to affordable health care, or the ability to earn a living wage. 
   I encounter these people--working people--far too often in my own district in Queens and the Bronx, New York. 
   This bill will help get rid of many arcane tactics some employers use to prevent employee organization, thereby giving a helping hand to those workers and the groups who are trying to defend their rights to respect in the work place. That is why I support the Employee Free Choice Act.  
   There are far too many people in this country who work hard, play by the rules, and cannot get ahead--this bill is a helping hand to a better life for themselves and their families. 
   Opposing this bill is opposing the ability of Americans to attain the American Dream.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, last November the American people overwhelmingly called for change in Congress and a change in the direction of this country. In the first 100 hours after taking office the new Democratic majority answered that call by passing significant legislation to begin taking this Congress and this country in a new direction. 
   First, we passed groundbreaking ethics reform and fiscal responsibility rules to clean up the way Congress operates. Then we implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, a long overdue step towards making our Nation safer. We went on to raise the minimum wage for millions of working Americans, gave HHS the ability to negotiate cheaper prescription drug prices for millions of seniors, and made college tuition more affordable for millions of students. And just yesterday, we repealed Republican policies that gave corporate welfare to big oil companies instead of investing those funds in consumer relief alternative fuels and energy efficient technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democrats were elected because Americans wanted to see real change in Congress, and we have not let them down. The legislation we passed will make a real difference in the lives of all Americans, and we can all be proud of the great start that we have made right here in this House.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, a bill that will finally put our Nation in the correct direction, a new direction towards weaning ourselves off the addiction of oil and gas. This bill is about the future of America. 
   In the 1960s, President Kennedy challenged our country to dream the unthinkable and to put a man on the Moon. While President Bush has talked about the addiction to foreign oil, the Republican view of the treatment is to continue to pass tax cuts for oil companies, instead of focusing on innovation and new sources of energy. 
   By this investing in new technology, we have an opportunity for a win-win situation, more energy independence and more jobs for American citizens here in America. Who could be against that? 
   Please pass this bill. Create a clean energy trust fund and free the resourceful minds of the most resourceful people on Earth today to do what Americans do best, to create and innovate. 
   We can kick our addiction to foreign oil, and the first step in this is to pass H.R. 6.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution introduced by my friend from New Jersey, CHRIS SMITH. 
   I stand among my colleagues and say that it is a privilege to be an original cosponsor of this important statement by the House of Representatives. 
   The movement towards peace in the north of Ireland is moving at a steady but slow pace. It is the slowness of this pace which is regrettable. However, the movement forward is one which we can continue to commend and support. 
   The political parties of the north of Ireland must continue to overcome the obstacles for the sake of the people who they were elected to represent. The people of the north must be given the representation in government that they have sought out. 
   However, in order to continue to build and promote this ongoing peace process, we must make sure that the past atrocities have been fully investigated and those who are guilty, held responsible. 
   The British and the Irish Governments had agreed to hold public inquiries into high profile murders of human rights defenders like Pat Finucane. We must build better trust between the people of the north, and so it is time for the British to allow the truth to come out. 
   I wish to express my deepest sympathy to the family of Patrick Finucane at this time. After this brutal murder, justice must be pursued, and I wish to thank Geraldine and her son Michael for agreeing to testify before the committee of the House of Representatives. 
   The family of Pat Finucane has a right to know the full extent of collusion that existed and caused the death of this husband and father. 
   Under the Weston Park Agreement and the commitment made by Judge Cory, the British must live up to their obligations by reconsidering their position on the matter of inquiry into Pat Finucane's death and amending the Inquiries Act of 2005. 
   It is time for an independent, judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to strike the last word. 
   I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding me this time, and I want to thank my good friend from Massachusetts, the Chair of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, for bringing this legislation before us today. 
   In particular, I want to thank my colleague and friend from New York, Carolyn Maloney, who has done an outstanding job in moving this bill so quickly through the House this year, through the committee, and now to the floor. Carolyn, as myself, being from New York City, understands a number of issues as they come together here on this particular issue, that is, the need to make sure that our country is secure from the interests of terror, and, at the same time, wanting to ensure that our country is open to direct foreign investment. 
   Direct foreign investment is for two reasons, one, because it is good for America, it is good for New York, it is good for America. But also what we do here in the House of Representatives, and how we transform and change the CFIUS process, if we don't do it quickly and do it properly it can be reciprocated in other parts of the world against the interests of American corporations. 
   I also want to thank my good friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Blunt, a gentleman with whom I had an opportunity to work with last year on this very similar legislation, as well as Representative Pryce, for their hard work in ensuring that this bill came to the floor in such a fashion. 
   I have to harken back to last year just momentarily, and that is when we look at the overall issue of what brought this legislation to the floor right now, we have to understand the historical context that brought this legislation to the floor. What happened last year, what I call the Dubai Ports debacle, in the administration's inability to explain to the American people just what was happening and why it was in the interests of the United States to walk softly here. 
   But we have come a long ways since then. Last year, in a very politically contentious year, we would have passed unanimously out of committee very similar legislation as we have on the floor today and then passed unanimously out of the House that legislation, again, in a very hotly contested political year. 
   But this issue did not fade away because we failed to reach an agreement with the Senate last year and were never able to codify into law the CFIUS process, which was an executive order put into place in the early 1970s that has been amended several times, but never codified in a way which Mr. Frank wishes to do today, which I would certainly wholeheartedly support. 
   This bill is a good jobs bill, it is pro-business and it is pro-labor. That is why I want to support this bill. This bill is about keeping the flow in foreign investment coming into the United States and not driving these funds and subsequent jobs out of the United States. 
   But H.R. 556 includes new tough safeguards put in place to ensure the security of America first. This entire legislative initiative, which has been pursued in a bipartisan fashion, is the result of the botched handling, again, of the Dubai Ports deal. That transaction involved a government-owned company from Dubai buying into various port assets here in the United States. 
   As a result, a significant and appropriate focus of the committee's work has been to toughen the scrutiny for acquisition by government-owned companies, since some government-owned companies will make decisions based on government interests and not merely on commercial interests. 
   No job, no deal, no transaction, is worth threatening the safety of Americans, and this bill puts those conditions in place. 
   We all know this to be true, but, again, being from New York, it is even more true. This bill will provide strong new safeguards to ensure our Nation's security and to protect our critical infrastructure but also continues to give CFIUS the flexibility to exercise discretion, allows CFIUS to focus on the deals that raise real national security issues and not get bogged down into those deals with no national security ramifications whatsoever. 
   This is a good bill protecting national security, guaranteeing the continued flow of direct foreign investment in the U.S. and ensure we will not have a Dubai Ports debacle. 
   I therefore urge my colleagues to support this very worthy piece of legislation. Again, I want to thank the Chair of the committee, the ranking member for bringing this bill, Mr. Bachus, for bringing this bill so quickly to the floor; the gentlelady from New York, once again, Carolyn Maloney, for all of her work on this issue; my good friend, the minority whip, Mr. Blunt, for his work, as well as Representative Pryce. 
   This truly is a bipartisan piece of legislation and deserves every Member's support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I, too, want to rise in opposition to my good friend from Texas's amendment, which I believe is a noble attempt to improve the legislation. I just don't think it belongs here, as the gentlewoman from New York described as well. 
   What you are asking for, though, that is kind of interesting, is requiring CFIUS to report on the burdens placed upon potential companies entering into the United States through direct foreign investment. Where does this end? We could have an investigation on the burdens, on the burdens, on the burdens, creating more burden for both the companies that have to be investigated, asking them to give that information to CFIUS, as well as placing additional burdens on CFIUS. As the gentlewoman has said, diverting them from the attention that they need to focus on: national security. 
   And as the gentleman from Massachusetts has said, what is national security? What we have thought was an issue of national security 10 years ago no longer is today, and what we think of national security today may not be an issue of national security 10 years from now. It is ever changing and in flux. But clearly, creating more burden on direct foreign investment is not helpful in this process, I really believe. 
   Therefore, I would ask my colleagues to reject this amendment, to vote ``no'' on this amendment.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I will yield in a moment. 
   That is the role of the Commerce Department to do those kind of studies. They can do that. Let them spend the time. Let's not divert the attention of CFIUS, which is to allow for a steady stream of flow of foreign investment in the United States, and at the same time checking the national security interests of our country, making sure that state-owned businesses that are entering into foreign investment of the United States are not in some way compromising our national security, the private-owned industry that are making investments in the United States are not jeopardizing or compromising our national security. That is the role of CFIUS. 
   It is not for CFIUS to become the Commerce Department. They have a role to do as well. They can do studies on the implications of the CFIUS process and foreign investment and how it is affecting the growth or loss of jobs in the United States, not the role of CFIUS. 
   I would yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from Queens, New York, as well. I thank all of those who have worked so hard on this particular issue and this bill before us today. 
   I wish, quite frankly, that the discussion and focus wasn't on the New York delegation. I wish I could stand here today and I didn't have the burden of the New York State and New York City delegation to craft and help make this legislation better legislation. 
   And at the same time, I don't wish to transpose that burden upon the delegation from Chicago, Illinois, or Los Angeles, California, or Birmingham, Alabama. I wish not to transpose it to anybody else. We accept that responsibility. We accept it because we are the financial capital of the world, and the focus of so much of the attention and hate of the world, that New York has become that focus, we recognize our place here in the Congress. 
   Having said that, I will note that this bill is better than what the White House proposed, which was no advancement, no extension of TRIA. The President's working group as well as the GAO report said no extension. We got a 7-year extension. I count our blessings. The best should not be the enemy of the good. 
   But having said that, I think the rejection of a reset provision is a mistake.     
   And we will be back here, we will be back because we need to do this. We ought not leave a hole in the ground in Manhattan as a monument to Osama bin Laden. Six years out, and this is not the only reason why there hasn't been a redevelopment in Lower Manhattan. But 6 years out we still have not seen the development of the Freedom Towers. 
   There is a message here, and the message ought not to be to our enemies that if you strike us we will cower, we will not redevelop. That's the message that's going out right now. And we will have an opportunity to change that, and I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand this is not a New York City issue. This is not a New York issue, but an American issue; and to move forward we have to work together to see that come to fruition.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my good friend and colleague and the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee which I so proudly serve on. 
   I want to thank all those involved in this debate this evening. This has been a very good debate and one that I think has been fairly conducted. 
   I think, though, it is important to look back on the historic nature of this particular agreement. I say that coming to you as one who has not been a purist on this. I have not been blind in voting for or against free trade agreements. I have looked at free trade agreements and I have weighed them and I have balanced them. 
   I want to remind my colleagues, some of whom are new and don't know who I am and what I am about, I did not support WTO for China. I did not support PNT for China. I did not support a number of the free trade agreements in the past. But when you look at this free trade agreement as I have, I support this fair trade agreement, this fair trade agreement, because it is the right thing to do. 
   This is a good agreement. It is worthy of the support of every Member of this House. On May 10 of this year, the chairman of this committee and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, along with our Speaker, reached agreement on a new template moving trade forward in this Congress. You have to remember that the agreement with Peru was reached in the last Congress. The Peruvian government agreed to that agreement. We had a change in government. We adopted a new template. The Peruvian government took that template, reopened their agreement and passed it again this year. 
   They adopted the labor standards and the environmental standards. The  labor standards include freedom of association, the right to collectively bargain, elimination of forced and compulsory labor, abolition of child labor, and elimination of employment discrimination, not to mention the advancements we have made in environmental protection. They are not just environmental and labor rights, they are part and parcel with human rights.     
   They are part of their rights and the values of our country that we'd like to have. 
   Now, just briefly on Peru. Peru has been a country that has been developing, and this is an opportunity for them to develop a middle class, a stronger middle class that will want more of our U.S. products. 
   As we mentioned earlier, they already have duty-free and quarter-free access to the United States. This is about opening up their borders to what we make. 
   Once again I want to thank the chairman for your hard work, Mr. Levin as well, the Speaker and the other side of the aisle for this joint effort that's been made in a bipartisan way. I wholeheartedly support this agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation and want to commend you and the ranking member and your staffs for the hard work that has been put into this bill. I would also like to engage you, as you mentioned, in a colloquy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased the committee included $15.8 million to hire and train new air traffic controllers. This will go a long way in helping to ensure the safety of our skies. However, I believe that more needs to be done. 
   I note that we have 1,100 fewer fully certified air traffic controllers than we did on 9/11. 
   Mr. Chairman, my concerns were underscored by a recent incident at La Guardia Airport, which is in my district in the Seventh Congressional District in Queens. As you know, La Guardia Airport is one of the busiest airports in the Nation. Over 1,000 flights a day and 27 million passengers a year frequent the airport. 
   On July 5 of this year, two planes nearly crashed on the runway. While a catastrophe was narrowly avoided this time, many questions remain as to the cause of the incident, including whether it was due to a staffing shortage, a lack of well-qualified air traffic controllers, or simply pure human error. 
   I believe we must examine the incident at La Guardia while we also examine the larger issue, which is determining how we must address the impending air traffic controller shortage. That is why I believe that Congress must fund a study by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   This study would examine what factors are contributing to air traffic safety concerns, including human factors, increased traffic activity, and the technology and equipment at our Nation's airports. Ultimately the report will recommend how to address this issue, particularly with regard to staffing standards and whether we need to train more air traffic controllers. 
   I intended to offer an amendment today to fund this study, but it would have been subject to a point of order. So instead, Mr. Chairman, I am hoping we can agree to work together as this legislation moves forward to find a way to address this issue and potentially fund this study.

   Madam Speaker, this is not a rescue package solely for Wall Street nor is it for New York City nor for New York State. In fact, I would argue with you, all of my colleagues, that it will take many years for New York City and New York State to recover from the downturn of Wall Street. 
   This is more about our country, about the United States, and our economic woes today. It's about 401(K) plans, about investment plans of my mother on 65th Street in Woodside, Queens. She saw that decline just a few days ago. This is about all of our constituents who have seen a loss over the past few days. It's about the health of our entire economy. And ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues, this is not just the United States. The entire world is looking at us today and looking to see us vote in favor of this bill. 
   Would we like the luxury of more time to hold more hearings and have more due process? Of course we would. We'd like to have months to do that. But we simply don't have the time. We don't have that luxury. We cannot afford that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what we are doing here today. This is important, I think, for the American people to understand the critical role that Congress plays here in providing transparency and openness and helping corporate America do what they do best, and that is to generate and grow our economy. 
   But I rise in opposition to my friend, the gentleman from Georgia's, amendment. And I do so because, it is interesting, there seems to be a double-speak, Mr. Chairman, coming from the other side of the aisle. On the one hand they say that there is too much government involvement, and at the same time their amendment would add another layer of government involvement, a further study that would slow this whole process down. 
   I don't understand what is wrong with transparency. Transparency in our markets is what makes our markets so attractive to investors, to investors who want to know what is going on within that publicly traded company. 
   This amendment would make the effective date of the bill conditional on the SEC's performance of a study to determine the effect of shareholder vote requirements on the ability of issuers to recruit and retain executives. The bill would not take effect if the SEC finds the vote would ``significantly hinder issuers' recruitment and retention of executives.''  
   In effect, this is a way to kill the bill without voting against the bill. It would permit the SEC and the business executives to effectively veto the Congress with a study. 
   This amendment would make nonbinding shareholder votes on compensation subject to an SEC study and the SEC's finding. 
   And I should just remind our friends on the other side that Congress does not generally make laws that apply only if agencies make certain findings. 
   I would also note for the record that this amendment was defeated in committee by a vote of 27 yeas to 32 nays with 1 present, therefore a vote against this amendment. 
   And again I just want to come back to what I talked about before, and it relates as well to the Putnam amendment, and that is what is wrong with transparency? What is wrong with those individuals, moms and pops, moms who are soccer field moms, understanding what their investment is doing, how their investment dollars are being spent? 
   If the other side of the aisle wants to continue to align themselves with the Bob Nardellis and the Ken Lays of the world over Joe and Mary Six-Pack, so be it. But I would just point out that I think that the American stockholders would like to know what is happening in corporate America. 
   I wonder how many stockholders in GE understood that when Jack Welch retired as a CEO, what that package actually entailed. GE shareholders would provide him with a ``lifetime access to company facilities and services comparable to those which are currently made available to him by the company,'' that they are unconditional and irrevocable. And don't forget about the use of an $80,000 per month Manhattan apartment owned by the company, aka the shareholders. I wonder how many shareholders know that they are supplying a rent-free apartment for Jack Welch in Manhattan; courtside seats at the New York Knicks and U.S. Open; seats at Wimbledon; box seats, and, Mr. Frank, I hope you will forgive me, at the Red Sox-Yankees baseball games; country club fees. 
   Who paid for all this and who continues to pay for all this? The shareholders, who are the individual citizens, pension funds, 401(k)s. We the people who invest in these public corporations are the ones who pay for all this. Is it right that we pay for this and have no ability to learn about it or no ability to really hold these public corporations accountable? I don't think so. 
   The other side of the aisle seems to think that is okay and that is how corporate America should conduct itself. 
   I believe that shareholders have the right to know what the full compensation packages, the total compensation packages, of the employees running their, the shareholders', companies. And it goes back to Mr. Putnam's amendment again. What we need to oppose is this amendment, as well as the Putnam amendment, because it injects the government too far into the board rooms, creates new hassles for corporate America, and it disrespects and ignores the owners of shareholders, the constituency of those executives as well as our constituents that we represent. 
   So I oppose this and the Putnam amendment.

   Madam Speaker, I rise not as a representative of Wall Street in New York but of 65th Street in Woodside, Queens, New York. 
   First, let me state that everyone is angry that we're here this afternoon enacting this piece of legislation, but immediate action must be taken or our Nation's credit system and banking system will dry up. What that means is pension plans and retirement savings will be threatened by the wild fluctuations of the stock market. It will mean  the tightening of credit, which means even the most creditworthy Americans won't be able to afford homes or be able to refinance their homes. Student loans will evaporate, making college more expensive. Auto loans will dry up and, finally, salaries. If employers cannot access banks and credit, they will not be able to meet their payroll, and layoffs will begin. 
   This was a 3-page bill when we first got it, ladies and gentlemen, but we, the Democrats, made this a better bill. We added both the civil and criminal accountability of Wall Street executives. Government should be giving out metal bracelets, ankle bracelets, and not golden parachutes.

   As many of you know, this initiative, also referred to as the Urban Area Security Initiative, is the only homeland security initiative specifically targeted to assist the cities and States most vulnerable to a terror attack. 
   The Urban Area Security Initiative was created by myself and my fellow New Yorker, Representative Fossella, in the months following the attack of 9/11. Its creation was a bipartisan effort, and it continues to be a bipartisanly supported program. Specifically, I want to thank Representative Price, chairman of the Homeland Security appropriations subcommittee, and the Democratic majority of the Homeland Security authorization committee for their hard work and dedication to the urban area initiative and to keeping Americans safe. Both of these committees understand the threats that America faces, both here at home as well as abroad, and they are working to make the investments that we need to make in order to secure our Nation. 
   Although the majority of this Congress understands the threats in the world that we face, I believe some of my colleagues do not fully understand them. There are some Members in this Chamber who oppose the urban area initiative and all homeland security grant initiatives, calling them, and I quote, revenue sharing, unquote, or secret earmarks. I think that's nonsense. Would my colleagues prefer we return to the pre-9/11 days? As someone who has known personal loss from that day, I for one do not want to. 
   The chief role for the Federal Government is to protect its citizens from attack and the Urban Area Security Initiative, like many other of the important domestic security programs in this bill, help to accomplish this. While some on the other side may try to play cute games with words, our Nation's security is more important than word games or photo ops. 
   I come from the State of New York where my hometown was hit and knows firsthand the act of terror. My own family knows firsthand the striking of terror. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in strengthening the Urban Area Grant Initiative as a way to maintain our vigilance in the face of continuing threats against America that are both at home and abroad.     
   This amendment is about making targeted, smart and necessary investments to keep our country safe. The Urban Area Security Initiative works. It provides needed resources to the communities at greatest risk of an attack, and it helps to keep those who are defending us on our front lines of terror, our first responders, our fire fighters, EMTs, and police officers safe and protected. 
   This initiative has been a success, and I urge my colleagues to support the Crowley-Fossella-Matsui-Garrett amendment so we can continue to make the right investments in the protection of our homeland.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I want to thank my friend, Mr. Rahall, for yielding me this time. 
   Let me just remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when this bill passes and when it becomes law, after passage of the Democratic energy bill, 85 percent of the total oil available offshore will be open for exploration and drilling. My colleagues on the other side simply can't take yes for an answer, and I am perplexed by that. 
   We continue to come back, and I know that my friend Mr. Flake made reference once again, to a provision in this bill that would restructure the 9/11 New York Liberty Zone bonds. We had a more extensive debate about this earlier today, and I don't want to necessarily go back into that. 
   But I think it is important to note for the record, on May 15 of this year, under questioning within the Ways and Means Committee, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, Karen Sowell, stated that the President would oppose earmarks, but supports restructuring the New York Liberty Zone bonds and that the language included in his budget reflects that, that this is not an earmark. 
   Once again, I repeat: The 9/11 restructuring money is not an earmark. It is part of the $20 billion that you, that we, promised New York after the attacks of 9/11, $18 billion of which has already been delivered, or thereabouts. $2 billion has yet to be used, and, quite frankly, in the form it is in today, is not usable, and that is why we are doing this. This is not something new. We have already passed this four previous times. We just have not yet been able to get it enacted into law. 
   So I would just remind my colleagues once again that this is not an earmark. In fact, your former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Thomas, he is the person who put this into law. We are trying to fulfill a promise that you made.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentlelady from New York for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have often wondered what the capacity for remembering my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have. Apparently, it extends no further than 7 years and 5 days. Seven years and 5 days ago, my city, the City of New York, was attacked on 9/11. Have you forgotten that? 
   For the purposes of your point of order in opposition to this bill coming to the floor, it's the lack of someone taking responsibility for the $1.2 billion that you call an earmark. It's Crowley, C-r-o-w-l-e-y. It's the U.S. Congress that did this 7 years ago, after our country was attacked on 9/11, 7 years and 5 days ago. 
   I, 5 days ago, stood out on the steps of the Capitol and sang ``God Bless America'' with both my colleagues from the Republican side of the aisle and this side of the aisle. What we are doing today is simply fulfilling a promise, a promise. 
   This is not an earmark. This is already law. We are adapting it, we are changing it so New York can use the money. But I need to remind my colleagues on this side of the aisle, there is still a 16 1/2 or 17-acre hole in lower Manhattan. We need to do all we can to help rebuild that, rebuild the economy of New York. 
   I daresay my colleagues from New York on the other side of the aisle, they are opposed to this point of order. They will oppose your position on this point of order, because they know this is not an earmark. 
   They know this is going to help rebuild New York. It's a promise that was made by the administration. The President does not call it an earmark. It is in the President's budget. 
   I would also object to what my friend, the colleague from Virginia, said about the chief of staff on the Joint Tax Committee. Ed Kleinbard, on May 15 of this year, stated that on the issue of limited tax benefits, the answer is that this is a matter wholly within the prerogative of the chairman. He alone decides this issue. 
   Mr. Rangel does not call it an earmark; I don't call it an earmark. I daresay, many of your colleagues on your side of the aisle do not call it an earmark. This is not an earmark. This is to help New York City rebuild after 9/11. 
   With all that's going on, as we read in the papers today about the markets, New York City is under tremendous duress. Don't add to that. Don't add to that today by bringing up this type of tactic to limit the ability of New York City to rebuild itself.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, let me just remind my colleague regarding accusations as to who is responsible for this particular piece of legislation being added to this bill. Initially this was air-dropped into the overall bill to help New York recover after 9/11 by Chairman Thomas. So I guess to some degree Chairman Thomas is responsible for this particular provision being here today, without consultation with not only the ranking member, CHARLIE RANGEL at the time, or MIKE MCNULTY from New York State. Even his own colleague from the Republican side of the aisle, Amo Houghton at the time who was a Member, was not consulted about the addition of this into the legislation.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the gentleman. I thank him for his leadership here this evening. 
   On July 18, 2005, our government and the government of India entered into an agreement that we are here today seeing through. The joint statement laid the groundwork for the cooperation of our two countries for the engagement of our two countries throughout this next century. And today, we're taking the final step needed to put this agreement into place. 
   This agreement will end India's nuclear isolation and allow them to be brought into the nonproliferation tent with the rest of the responsible states who seek safe and efficient civilian nuclear technology. 
   Passage of the agreement is common sense. We are united in the world's oldest and the world's largest democracies in an effort to expand peaceful and responsible development of nuclear technology. If we expect India to be our ally in the 21st century, we must treat them as an equal, which is what this cooperation deal does. 
   India has never proliferated beyond her borders, unlike her neighbor, and I believe that this is an important relationship, an important aspect of this relationship that needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating this legislation before us. 
   I trust my colleagues will recognize what our future with India holds and vote for final passage of this historic legislation.

   I also just want to express briefly the support of my constituents in Queens and The Bronx in New York. Their hearts and prayers are today in Virginia with the students and faculty and parents of Virginia Tech students. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Taxpayer Protection Act, a bill that will work to protect and empower taxpayers. 
   I want to specifically recognize and thank Chairman Rangel not only for crafting a solid, bipartisan bill, but also for continuing the comity that has, this year, become the hallmark of our committee. 
   I would also like to express my gratitude to you, as well as to Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Lewis and Ranking Member Ramstad for including important new provisions dealing with the earned income tax credit. The EITC has been a great benefit to my constituents, with almost 114,000 of them claiming this credit, bringing home to Queens and The Bronx $270 million. While impressive, I still have almost 23,000 constituents in my district who are eligible, but do not seek this credit, thereby missing out on an estimated $54 million in revenue, money these people need for everyday living and money that can be turned back into our communities. 
   During both the oversight hearing on EITC and, later, the full committee hearing with IRS Commissioner Everson, I highlighted the need for the IRS to work with those who qualify for the EITC to make the process of restating past returns easier. This bill does that. 
   Additionally, during private and, later, under committee questioning, I asked Commissioner Everson about ways to outreach EITC to more people, including those who may not file returns. 
   Again, the sponsors heard the concerns of many of us on this committee and crafted a bill today that also mandates the IRS undertake this outing by using IRS' existing resources and data to dig deeper and find these eligible people. 
   The people who qualify and receive the earned income tax credit, the people I am talking about, are the working poor, again poor people who work, and they need our help. This bill provides them an important helping hand. I thank the sponsors for putting working people first in this legislation. 
   I also want to thank many of the not-for-profit groups that are helping our constituents access EITC. Just yesterday, I met with the leadership in New York City of ACORN, and they are starting a program to help our mutual constituents reach out so that they can make access of the EITC, the earned income tax credit. 
   I once again thank the sponsors of this legislation. I welcome this new direction in Congress and in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I want to thank my friend from Connecticut for managing the time on the minority side for this important resolution. In particular, I want to thank my good friend from New York State, Vito Fossella, for introducing this important resolution commemorating and celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Archdiocese of New York, a history that is replete with so many tales, not tales but facts, about the contribution of Catholics in New York, in particular about the institution known as the Archdiocese of New York, having at one time encompassed the entire State of New York and New Jersey, and now having a smaller imprint, but no less significant an imprint today. 
   We think of the storied individuals who fervently shepherded their flock in the Archdiocese of New York, starting with R. Luke Concanen in 1808-1810; to present day, Edward Michael Cardinal Egan, who took the reins of control in 2000 and continues to this day. 
   We look back historically, particularly during the Civil War, the Archdiocese had a very long history going back to that point in time, and during  the war Archbishop John Hughes, who was a fervent defender of the Union and a personal friend of then-President Abraham Lincoln, he wrote to President Lincoln and Secretary Seward about the most effectual means for carrying on that war. At the Union's request, he visited Europe to exert his personal influence, especially in high circles in France, for the benefit of the national cause at that time. 
   Another national cause the Archdiocese was strongly involved in was with the first wave of immigrants, predominantly Irish immigrants, to New York. The archdiocese developed programs to care for and assimilate those new immigrants to America, and was a precursor to the Irish Emigrant Savings Bank, later to become known as the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank and Emigrant Savings Bank today. 
   These organizations over the years have developed into a strong base of charitable giving to keep the traditions of protecting the poor and the neglected, something that the Archdiocese of New York continues to do today. In fact, the Cardinal and the archdiocese have been very outspoken proponents of comprehensive immigration reform to help those least amongst us in society today, something they continue to do in the strong 200-year tradition of the Archdiocese of New York. 
   It was also mentioned before that Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first saint born in the United States, also a New Yorker and the founder of the New York City Catholic school system, and the contributions that system has made to our country. Speaking as a product of there, having graduated from Power Memorial High School in 1980, which is no longer with us, but there are still many high schools that bear the names of the many cardinals and leaders of the archdiocese throughout the years, and others who have made significant impacts on the Archdiocese of New York, a tremendous system that to this day continues to produce some of the brightest minds in not only the city of New York, but in the country, and also continues to provide access to the least amongst us to give them opportunities that others had before them. 
   So I stand here on the floor congratulating Mr. Fossella for introducing this resolution and to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Archdiocese of New York, a diocese that will go on for many, many years to come. We congratulate Cardinal Egan, Cardinal O'Connor, Cardinal Cooke, and all those who came before them, and all the men women who have contributed in so many ways to its survival and its flourishing throughout the history of New York City and our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2 to increase the minimum wage for working Americans. 
   After years of providing tax cuts to the richest people in our country, and raise after raise to Members of Congress, I am pleased to see that in the first 100 hours of Democratic control of Congress, Democrats are giving a raise to the working poor. 
   I firmly believe that increasing the minimum wage is a necessity to help working people provide for their families. In 6 years of Bush-onomics, gas prices have gone out of sight, college tuitions are unaffordable for millions of working families, and the price of homeownership is escaping far too many people. 
   The lack of a basic wage increase has put an even greater hardship on the lives of many of my constituents--people who are actually working every day and playing by the rules. 
   Just the other day a constituent of mine from Jackson Heights stated the obvious in  support of a minimum wage increase--an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. 
   I completely agree with him. 
   In fact, 90 percent of minimum wage workers in New York City are adults, and two-thirds of them work full-time. Over four out of five New York City minimum wage workers are people of color: 41 percent are Hispanic, 25 percent are Black non-Hispanic, and 16 percent are Asian. 
   Additionally, while women represent 49 percent of New York City workers, they are 59 percent of minimum wage workers. It's clear minimum wage earnings are vital to many low-income households in New York City. In fact, 60 percent of increased minimum wage earnings would go to the lowest-earning 40 percent of New York City households. 
   Furthermore, with 15.5 percent of my constituents living below poverty, it's long past due to raise the wages of working people. 
   After raise after raise for Congress and the White House, it is amazing to me that the Republicans do not think that people who actually work 5 days a week do not deserve a raise. 
   That is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2. 
   Under the Democrats America really is going in a new direction--and that direction is forward.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5, a bill to lower the cost of college for millions of middle class Americans. 
   Tuition all over the country has sky-rocketed. The State University of New York (SUNY) costs over $12,000 a year to attend for a commuter and almost $17,000 a year to live on campus. 
   And these are resident in state tuition figures. 
   The GOP's response to the sky-rocketing price of college tuition: Last year, Republicans cut $12 billion from student aid. To add insult to injury on December 23, 2004 with a Christmas gift only worthy of the Grinch, the Republicans actually cut back college grant programs to 1.3 million students. 
   Democrats offer a New Direction. Our American direction is designed to make college more affordable for Americans by cutting the current interest rate for student loans in half. Our bill will save middle class families in New York and nationwide approximately $4,400 over the life of their loan. 
   Democrats are putting our money where our mouth is and passing legislation to actually benefit middle class families. I urge my colleagues to pass this common sense legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume 
   Bangladesh is going through an important time in its history as she attempts to move back to a representational government. Since October 2006, Bangladesh has been under the control of two different caretaker governments. After the January 2007 elections were postponed, a second caretaker government, backed by the military, came into power, and since then has been attempting to deal with what has become rampant corruption, violence and political instability. 
   Once in power, the caretaker government instituted a state of emergency that suspended fundamental rights guaranteed by the Bangladeshi constitution. They subsequently detained a large number of politicians and others on suspicion of involvement in corruption and other crimes. 
   While I continue to remain concerned about the arrests of so many under the emergency powers rule, I must commend the caretaker government for establishing institutions to fight corruption and bring about national reconciliation between the political parties. But these gains have been marred by serious reports of human rights violations of those held in custody. Bangladesh must respect all the rights of her people and prosecute cases before her to the letter of the law. 
   The next step is getting people back the power in Bangladesh. Nearly 2 years after the postponement of elections and the state of emergency was declared, the caretaker government is following through with a roadmap towards elections that they have presented. 
   Just this past weekend, the chief adviser of the caretaker government announced that parliamentary elections will be held on December 18, 2008. This is an important step, but an election held under a state of emergency is a questionable approach to establishing democratic governance in Bangladesh. 
   The bill before us calls on the caretaker government to relax or suspend the state of emergency to ensure that public gatherings during the campaign are allowed to take place. This election is about bringing true democracy back to Bangladesh, and it must be held with all the freedoms their constitution grants her people. 
   Bangladesh has been a strong friend and ally of the United States and is a moderate Muslim nation, and we should do what we can to foster continued growth of democracy, not only in the nation of Bangladesh, but throughout that region. We must work to ensure that the elections held in Bangladesh are free, fair, credible, peaceful and transparent. 
   I introduced this legislation in July to set out what we, the United States Congress, expect of Bangladesh and we the people of the United States expect of Bangladesh. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. It has the backing of the Bangladesh Caucus, which I chair here in the House of Representatives. 
   I believe that with fair, free, transparent and open elections, Bangladesh will move towards a more Democratic society.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I just wanted to add a couple of more points for the record. 
   In order to ensure the transparency of these elections, I believe it's imperative that the Government of Bangladesh, the present caretaker government, invite foreign governments and nongovernment organizations to observe and monitor the elections of December 18, 2008. 
   The restoration of democracy, though, in Bangladesh, is not the only challenge that Bangladesh is facing. Just last year, Cyclone Sidr caused massive devastation in Bangladesh and destroyed the annual rice harvest in parts of the country. The global rise in fuel prices has also had a major effect on the livelihoods of all the people of Bangladesh over the last year. 
   The Congress, therefore, strongly supports the continuation of a robust economic support and humanitarian program for the people of Bangladesh, particularly in helping the nation get back on its feet after the cyclone. But free, fair, and transparent and open elections, together with the continuation of American assistance to Bangladesh, will serve to further strengthen the relationship between our two countries. With the restoration of democracy, the political, economic and strategic ties between the United States and Bangladesh will become even stronger. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, as well as Congressman Brad Miller, for urging the condemnation of the most vicious crime imaginable, the systematic rape and mutilation committed against women, girls and boys taking place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, known as the DRC. 
   The conflict in the DRC has been called the deadliest since World War II. Within the last 10 years, more than 5 million people have died, and the numbers keep rising. In fact, more people have died because of war in the DRC than in Iraq, Afghanistan and Darfur combined. As in other wars, women in the DRC are overwhelmingly the target of military aggression. Rape and mutilation are the perpetrators' preferred weapon of choice. Unlike other wars, the scale and systematic nature of rape in the DRC is unparalleled. In some villages, as many as 90 percent of the women and girls have been raped. 
   This important resolution encourages the Secretary of State to work with the DRC Government to develop a strategy to address and end the large-scale sexual violence in the DRC. Our State Department and our American embassy in the DRC should have this extremely important mission.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank our colleague, Mr. Ferguson of New Jersey, for introducing this resolution that draws congressional attention to an ongoing dispute in Lithuania about construction on the grounds of a former Jewish cemetery in that country. I would also like to thank my good friend, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership on this issue, and recognize the efforts of Representative Shimkus in seeking to find a constructive solution to this problem. 
   One of many tragic consequences of the Holocaust was the decimation of Jewish populations that would otherwise have cared for communal property that represents an important part of Europe's history. The Jewish cemetery in the Snipiskes area of Vilnius, Lithuania, is just one example. Archival documents suggest it was established as Vilnius's first Jewish cemetery in the 15th century, served as the burial place for more than 50,000 Jews, and was closed by Czarist Russia in 1831. 
   As part of our ongoing dialogue with Lithuania regarding the 2002 U.S.-Lithuanian agreement on the preservation of the cultural property of the victims of the Nazi regime, Congress has been concerned about construction on perceived boundary lines of this cemetery.  Despite repeated requests by the U.S. Embassy in Vilnius and Jewish organizations to the Lithuanian Government to address this issue, there has been little movement in recent years. 
   Congress welcomed the decision by the Government of Lithuania to conduct a geological survey and archaeological investigation of the site this past summer to establish these cemetery boundaries. While the Government's designation of the area as a cultural heritage site is also a helpful step, the fact that the entire site remains in the hands of a private developer raises concerns about the prospects of future construction on the site. 
   Congress feels very strongly that the Lithuanian Government should take steps to guarantee the permanent preservation of the Snipiskes cemetery, including the possibility of placing the land under government ownership. The government should also consider the recommendations of the International Experts Commission regarding the preservation of these sacred grounds. 
   The United States greatly values its long friendship with Lithuania, which could be further enhanced by a prompt and sensitive resolution to this difficult situation. 
   I strongly support this resolution and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to support this resolution which recognizes the long overdue ratification of an international agreement that will open access to records of the Holocaust and Nazi war crimes. And I would like to commend my good friend and distinguished colleague, Alcee Hastings of Florida, for introducing this measure before us today. 
   On January 27, designated by the United Nations as the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the world paused to honor the victims of this terrible crime and to vow never again to allow such atrocities to happen. 
   For many victims and relatives of the Holocaust, 2008 may provide the first opportunity to obtain access to information about their own treatment as well as the fate of their loved ones in Nazi death camps. 
   In 1955, 11 member countries signed the Bonn Accords to establish an International Commission responsible for overseeing the administration by the  International Tracing Service of Holocaust archives. 
   The service is based in Bad Arolsen, Germany, and is directed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.     
   Madam Speaker, the archive holds over 85,000 feet of records, listing victims' names, transport details, medical records, and in some cases the only history of those who died at the hands of the Nazis. The records contain over 50 million reference cards for over 17.5 million people. 
   For over 60 years, ITS has limited access to its records to survivors of Nazi crimes and their descendants. Aging Holocaust survivors have criticized ITS for delayed responses or a complete failure to provide them with any information. By 2006 ITS had recorded a backlog of over 400,000 requests. 
   Following years of delay, the 11 parties to the Bonn Accords Treaty signed amendments in May 2006 to ensure the records were fully opened to survivors as well as researchers. This process was to be enhanced by the distribution of digitized records to member countries. 
   While the United States, Israel, Poland, and the Netherlands were the first signatories to ratify the amendments, Holocaust survivors were forced to wait still longer until the remaining countries completed their ratification procedures. In April 2007, this House passed H. Res. 240 calling on the remaining seven countries to ratify the amendments by the May 2007 deadline. 
   The resolution before us today expresses appreciation to all member countries for having ratified the amendments, allowing survivors the opportunity to find peace in the material contained in these archives. The resolution highlights the key roles played by the United States Holocaust Museum, the Department of State, and the International Community of the Red Cross in achieving this outcome. And it calls on the Holocaust Museum and the Red Cross to create the necessary conditions by which survivors and their families can promptly obtain long-sought-after information regarding Holocaust-era atrocities. While the ratification of these amendments is tragically too late for many victims, the hope is that it provides answers for many others. 
   I support this resolution, Madam Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (RECOGNIZING THE 187TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING GREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to support this resolution marking the 187th anniversary of Greek independence, and I would like to thank my good friend and ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership in ensuring that the House mark this important date. The world owes the Greeks a debt of gratitude for having developed the concept of democracy, which has enabled so much of the world to live in peaceful prosperity. 
   The story of Greek independence remains a remarkable tale about the revival of an ancient and great people through deep commitment, personal sacrifice, and an abiding love of freedom. Indeed, Western Civilization is deeply indebted to the Greek nation for its immense contributions in the fields of science, medicine, philosophy and art, just to name a few. 
   In 2004, the world celebrated this rich history and heritage as the Summer Olympics came home to Greece. This beautiful Mediterranean country showcased the best of its culture and hospitality. 
   In modern times, Greece has remained one of the United States' most important and enduring allies. Greece is one of the relatively few nations that stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States in every major war of the 20th century. The close links between our countries increased after World War II as the Truman Doctrine helped save Greece from communism, while the Marshall Plan aided its economic regeneration. 
   When Greece joined NATO in 1952, it formalized the deep mutual commitment that it shared with the Western world to safeguard freedom. After becoming a member of the European Union in 1981, Greece further deepened its relations with its European neighbors. It also underwent a notable economic transformation with the exchange of the drachma for the euro in 2002, highlighting its economic prosperity. 
   Greece has remained a strategic partner in the post-Cold War world, notably helping to promote peace and stability in the Balkans. The January 2008 visit by Greece Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis to Turkey, the first such official visit in 49 years, was a welcome development in these countries' efforts to resolve their differences. 
   Since the tragic attacks on the United States on 9/11, Greece has remained a steadfast ally in the fight against violent extremism. Plagued for many years by domestic acts of terror, Greece knows only too well the financial, mental, and physical toll that terrorism can wreak on a nation. 
   In closing, it is also important to highlight the rich contributions that Greek immigrants and their descendants have made to the United States; I know this firsthand, representing a great number in the County of Queens, New York. For over a century, they have traveled across the ocean, bringing their success to our shores, and in doing so serving as a bridge between our two nations. Today, some 5 million Americans claim Greek ancestry. We are grateful for the wisdom, energy, and talent they continue to bestow upon our great Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Greek people on the 187th anniversary of their independence from Ottoman rule. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on their tremendous contributions to world civilization and in celebrating the enduring Greek-American friendship. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (COMMEMORATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, as the lead Democratic sponsor of this legislation, I want to thank my friend and distinguished colleague from Illinois, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment, Mr. Don Manzullo, for introducing this resolution before us today. 
   In 1833, 2 years before the publication of Alexis de Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America'' and 3 years before the Battle of the Alamo, the United States and Kingdom of Thailand signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, making the Kingdom of Thailand the United States' first treaty ally in the Asia-Pacific region. 
   Now, 175 years later, Thailand remains our oldest Asia-Pacific ally. 
   During this time, the relationship between our two countries has strengthened as it has changed with the times, and the friendship between our two peoples has grown deep and enduring. 
   Our military partnership, which began when King Mongkut offered combat elephants to President Lincoln during the Civil War, is now one of the closest in Asia. 
   Thai soldiers fought alongside U.S. military personnel in World War I, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Today, Thailand is one of only a handful of our major non-NATO allies and is a crucial partner in our efforts to combat international terrorism. Thailand is also the host country of Cobra Gold, U.S. Pacific Command's annual multinational military training exercise. 
   Our economic relationship is similarly robust, with bilateral trade topping $30 billion annually. 
   On the political front, traditionally Thailand has been an anchor of stability and democracy in the volatile region of Southeast Asia. While it has been tested repeatedly by its own political upheavals, the Thai people have consistently responded by renewing their dedication to democracy. 
   The country has had 18 coup attempts since World War II, and Thailand's December elections only recently ended the latest coup government, which had come to power in 2006.  
   We all hope and believe that Thailand can move beyond the differences which led to the coup and return to its position as a democratic leader in Southeast Asia. 
   Key to resilience of the Thai political system is the strength and pride of the Thai people. 
   No one epitomizes the spirit of Thai people more than their beloved king, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. 
   On December 5, 2006, the king turned 80 years old. We in Congress join the Thai people in celebrating this landmark birthday and wishing the king a continued long life. 
   This resolution commemorates the 175th anniversary of the special relationship between the United States and Thailand and congratulates Thailand on maintaining its commitment to democracy by holding national elections and returning to a civilian-led government. 
   I strongly support this resolution and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   And with that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of federally funded ethical stem cell research. This important legislation would lift the ban on which stem cell lines can be researched using Federal dollars. It provides sound rules and regulations to govern the research of stem cells, rules such as preventing human cloning for embryos or the deliberate destruction of embryos. This legislation will give doctors and scientists the ability to perform more research, to find new cures for degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, and diabetes. We as a country excel in so much. Let us push forward on important research rather than regressing. 
   With embryonic stem cell research, we could potentially save or extend the lives of an estimated 100 million Americans. While this bill has overwhelming support from our country's leading scientists, biomedical researchers, patient advocacy groups and health organizations, along with many religious leaders, and 72 percent of all Americans. 
   In the past, President Bush has emphatically stated that he will veto this legislation. I hope that this time around the President listens to the overall majority of Americans and approves this important legislation. I support this legislation and stand with my colleagues here in the House. 
   To President Bush, I ask you to reconsider your stance on stem cell research. Don't make your second veto of your administration as detrimental as your first. Democrats promised America a new direction, and we are delivering a new direction forward. 
   I thank the gentlelady from Colorado.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MIKE M<em>c</em>NULTY -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I want to thank my good friend, Congressman Ackerman, for holding this Special Order this evening. 
   It's late; it's 9:30. And I want to thank all my colleagues from New York who are here on the floor right now. I would venture to say that if it was a little earlier, Michael, we would have every New Yorker here this evening. And, who knows, before the evening is out, we may just have that, or close to it. But it's only a reflection of the time of the evening we're doing this Special Order, Michael, and not a reflection upon you because I think the heartfelt appreciation of all your colleagues will be made known to you at some point. But we, from the New York delegation, want to take this opportunity to let you know what you know already, how special you are to all of us. 
   I have known Mike McNulty--although you may not know this--for 24 years. In fact, Mike was present in the Chamber when I was sworn in as a freshman member of the New York State Assembly. He was there as backup to swear me in in case Dick Connor didn't show or Stan Lundine, who was then the Lieutenant Governor, who was going to come in. Both did make it, but Mike was there as well. 
   I didn't really know Mike at the time, but Mike is an institutional guy, and being one of the local legislators, was there to make sure that the legislature performed in a ceremonial way as well, as it did in terms of an efficient way in terms of doing the people's business. And Mike has a great appreciation for the history of the New York State legislature and the House of Representatives as well. 
   I have traveled the world with Mike McNulty. My first trip with Mike McNulty--he may not remember this--was not to what he may be thinking as Ireland, but it was actually Israel some 21, 22 years ago. And what a great trip that was, both of our first exposure to the Holy Land and to Israel and to experience that together, not only Jerusalem, but Galilee and all the important places from an historical and a religious aspect that I know he appreciated tremendously. 
   And that brings me to another issue, and that is international again, it is Ireland. There are many people in the Democratic and Republican Caucus who take their rightful place in terms of their input in bringing peace with justice--and we continue in that vein--to northern Ireland, the whole island of Ireland. But Mike McNulty takes second seat to no one on that issue. From his days in the legislature in his support of the McBride principles--and Mike McNulty was there when Sean McBride came to the New York legislature and addressed the New York Assembly. It was there, when the New York Senate refused to even let him on the floor of the Senate, but Mike, through his moral suasion, was able really to accommodate Sean McBride on the floor of the House of the State Assembly, along with his colleagues, and how historic that was, the champion of the McBride principles Mike McNulty was in the New York State legislature. 
   One of the founding members of the Irish Legislative Society--I know he is still a frequent visitor to their meetings, I know how much it means to him. But Mike and I also had the chance to travel to Ireland on two occasions. Probably the most special occasion was with former President Clinton in year 2000 as he was ending his term as President. And we were there for the Thank You Tour, the Farewell Tour. And what a great opportunity that was for both of us to be in our ancestral homeland to see America so appreciated by another country for what we did to bring peace and justice to northern Ireland. We continue in that vein, and we will do so in Mike's honor. 
   Mike has been no stranger to trials and tribulations himself. On a personal level, he has known physical difficulties. And whenever we see Michael struggle, we all say, thank you, God, that I don't have that. And Mike has carried that for not only himself, but for all of us and for any person who has known a disability in this country. He has done it in a quiet and a dignified way, and it's something that I want him to know I've always admired you for, Michael. 
   He has also known the loss of a brother, a brother who was killed during the Vietnam War. But Michael has taken every ounce of anger and frustration and he has channeled it for the betterment of our country. We can all take a lesson, a page out of Michael McNulty's life. And if we could all do just a little bit of what Mike McNulty has done with the channeling of his own life experiences, we would all be a better Nation for it. 
   And I would just say lastly about Mike--and I know my other colleagues want to speak as well--but I had the great honor this year to serve as the third member of the Ways and Means; there's Charlie Rangel, there's Mike McNulty, downstate and upstate, and now Joe Crowley. But Mike welcomed me to the committee. 
   And there is a certain decorum that goes on in the committee, a certain way of doing things. It has its own Sergeant at Arms, its own little way of life. And knowing that Mike McNulty was on the committee was of great comfort to me--not that I'm afraid of new beginnings, but it was a little challenging at first. I don't serve on the subcommittee that Mike serves as chair on, but Michael knows that I've sat in on a number of his hearings this year and last year and got to see Michael in action as he asked piercing questions of people who came before the committee. 
   Mike McNulty was always prepared. Mike McNulty was not caught off  guard too often. Mike McNulty was always prepared when it came to his committee work, but also when it came to votes on the floor. Mike was always thoughtful about every position he took. He wasn't someone you just could come up to and say, Mike, I need your vote. It was, well, let me tell you why I'm not voting that way, or let me tell you why I'm supporting you. That's the kind of legislator Mike McNulty was--from Green Island, New York. 
   And I know Mike's dad and his family are incredibly proud of the career that Mike McNulty has had, serving 
   both in the House of Representatives and the State Assembly and as Mayor of Green Island, that MIKE's career is not over. It is a new beginning for Mike McNulty, maybe it's going back to his hometown, maybe it's going back to the Capitol region that he has served so well all these years. Mike has many, many, many more years of contributions to make both to the State of New York and to our country. 
   MIKE, I love you. You are a great man. And you will always be my friend. So thank you for your years of service.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I just want to simply rise to congratulate my colleagues, both Mr. McNerney as well as Ms. Giffords, both leaders on the Science Committee on this issue, in advancing our Democratic innovative agenda. 
   This amendment will benefit Hispanic-serving institutions throughout our Nation to inspire more of our young people to seek careers in industries that will foster the growth in mathematics and science among primarily Hispanic-serving institutions.     
   And I stand wholeheartedly behind this amendment. This will include over 10,000 students in my district who will directly benefit from this amendment. Let me just read some of the institutions in Queens and the Bronx, including Lehman College, Bronx Community College, Hostos Community College, LaGuardia Community College, Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology at LaGuardia Airport, and the College of Mount Saint Vincent. They are just a few of the colleges that will benefit from this amendment. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, I wholeheartedly support it and ask my colleagues to support this amendment as well.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the McNerney-Giffords amendment. This amendment establishes a new competitive grants program specifically for Hispanic-Serving Institutions at the National Science Foundation.  
   I would like to thank Representative MCNERNEY and Representative GIFFORDS for their leadership in offering this amendment, which will increase opportunities for so many undergraduate students. 
   This amendment will focus attention on the need to involve more Hispanic students in the science field by creating a specific program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions to receive infrastructure development funding. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman GORDON, Subcommittee Chairman BAIRD, and the staff at the Science and Technology Committee for their assistance in drafting this amendment, and for their commitment to increasing participation of minorities in the science and technology fields. 
   Hispanic-Serving Institutions serve the majority of the nearly two million Hispanic students enrolled in college today, and many of these institutions offer associate, undergraduate, and graduate programs and degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. 
   The Hispanic-Serving Institutions Undergraduate Program created by this amendment will allow these colleges and universities to access the funding they need to enhance their educational programs. 
   In my district alone, about 10,000 students attend Hispanic-Serving Institutions offering degrees in these science fields. Students at institutions throughout Queens and the Bronx, including Lehman College, Bronx Community College, Hostos Community College, LaGuardia Community College, Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, and the College of Mount Saint Vincent, like those all across the country, will benefit from increased access to funding to improve these degree programs. 
   This amendment corrects a long-standing inequality at the National Science Foundation. 
   Unlike their counterparts of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions have not benefited from a specific program to provide them with grants for research, curriculum, and infrastructure development. 
   Without access to targeted capacity-building grants, Hispanic-Serving Institutions have difficulty increasing the ranks of Hispanics in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, where they have been historically underrepresented. Studies show that Hispanics earn less than 3 percent of doctorates in these areas, compared to more than 50 percent by non-Hispanic whites. 
   This amendment also goes to the heart of the Innovation Agenda spearheaded by Speaker PELOSI and the new Democratic Coalition in the House to increase our Nation's competitiveness and create more math and science graduates. 
   To maintain our global competitiveness, we need to increase our pool of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. 
   We can do this by ensuring that Hispanics, the youngest and fastest-growing ethnic population group in the nation, are prepared with the knowledge and skills that will contribute to our Nation's future economic strength, security and global leadership. 
   This grants program will educate and train a new generation of experts in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas. By engaging Hispanic-Serving Institutions in this process, we can reach out to and involve more of the Hispanic educational community. 
   The National Science Foundation, through its undergraduate and graduate programs, can assist Hispanic-Serving Institutions in developing programs to prepare current and future generations of Hispanics and other minority professionals in the sciences. 
   I applaud the establishment of a Hispanic-Serving Institutions Undergraduate Program to achieve these goals, and I urge passage of this excellent amendment by Representatives MCNERNEY and GIFFORDS.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. 
   I had a wonderful speech I was prepared to read to you today, but, quite frankly, I'm outraged by the discussion that has taken place here. 
   There is the discussion of 19 days left to get this legislation passed as though a gun is put to our heads that either we pass the Senate bill or this does not get extended. That's hogwash. That's not the way in which we should make legislation. The notion that 100 Senators came to the floor and passed this bill is hogwash. They hot-lined this bill. It went to the floor without debate. The only debate that has taken place on this issue has taken place here on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   Chairman Frank in cooperation with the ranking member on the minority have worked diligently to get a qualified bill to this floor, that New York wants, that our country wants and deserves. We should not allow a hole in the middle of Manhattan to lie as a monument to Osama bin Laden, because that's what we're doing by not allowing for a reset provision in this legislation. This is not about New York City. That provision is the Osama bin Laden protection provision. 
   We should pass the House version of this bill and reject the Senate bill. Pass the House version. I would also note that not one Republican Member from New York State has been to the floor to defend your position on this issue.  
   During negotiations on providing appropriations for Fiscal Year 2008, the Republicans have opposed providing the emergency service workers who are sick from the pollution they were exposed to at Ground Zero with the care they need. 
   And today, many are expected to oppose this legislation, which would enable New York City to rebuild at Ground Zero. 
   But I hope that does not happen. 
   Because Americans believe that those who served on the frontlines at Ground Zero, and are sick due to their service, should be cared for. 
   Because Americans believe that New York City must be rebuilt--stronger, prouder and better protected. 
   Because Americans believe that in doing so we will send a message to al-qaeda that we won't back down.  
   And that's what today's legislation is about--letting every terrorist organization know that you cannot break us. And if you try, we will only grow stronger. 
   Let us take note, it was Chairman Frank's work on the terrorism risk insurance act that has moved the Bush Administration from an absolute position of opposition to being supportive of extending this program for 7 years. 
   He successfully moved a bi-partisan bill earlier this year, in light of many Republicans ready to acquiesce to the President to kill this terrorism Insurance program. 
   I welcome the new positions of the White House and many Republicans in this chamber today to finally support a real terrorism insurance bill, it is a welcome change. 
   Now, let's talk some basic facts. 
   We all know the Government will step in if there is another large scale attack like 9-11 on our country again. 
   What TRIA does is actually put the private insurance markets on the hook to pay part of the damages, meaning TRIA is a cost savings to the taxpayer and ensure that the insurance industry does what it is suppose to do--insure. 
   TRIA saves taxpayers money. 
   Now onto a specific provision of to day's bill that I want to highlight. 
   Part of today's bill includes a provision to honor those who were killed on 9-11, and protect the memories of others who, God forbid, may be killed in future attacks on our soil. 
   This new language, language that was included in the House-passed TRIA bill, creates a re-assurance to insurers and developers to rebuild on previously hit sites. 
   This is important because we all know al-Qaeda returns to the scene of their crime; they hit the Twin Towers in 1993, and they returned in 2001. And knowing their mentality, they will try to return again. 
   Those that ignore that, ignore history and fact. 
   The impacted site in Lower Manhattan cannot continue to be a hole in the ground, or a sick tribute or trophy to Osama bin Laden--wherever he may be. 
   Rather, we need to rebuild there, letting the terrorists know they can knock us down, but we will always pick ourselves up stronger. 
   We need to pass this bill and get the Senate working on a strong compromise bill to ensure a real TRIA, one that won't let Osama bin Laden continue to use the pictures at Ground Zero as a recruiting tool against our soldiers in Afghanistan or for attacks against Americans in this country or anywhere in the world. 
   We have seen the White House veto threat against this bill as it is ``expanding'' the terrorism insurance program. 
   Rebuilding at previously hit sites is not expanding the terrorism insurance program--it is the reason for the terrorism insurance program. 
   If you are serious about supporting TRIA, vote for this bill and ensure Osama bin Laden and his evil partners view September 11, 2001 as the worst day in their lives, not the best.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, there are a few key numbers to remember today: 25 million, the number of American families who will be hit by the AMT this year without any action; $2,000, the minimum increase in income taxes for those 25 million Americans hit by the AMT; $9 trillion, our national debt today; $30,000, the share of the national debt by every man, woman, and child in America due to the reckless fiscal policies of President Bush; $0, the cost of this Democratic tax cut to the American public as Democrats are weaning this country off credit card-onomics; four, the number of votes so far this year on legislation to fix the AMT in 2007; zero, the number of votes Republicans in the House have taken to provide tax relief to those 25 million Americans. 
   The game is up. The American people are watching. Either we are going to stand together today to provide 25 million middle-class Americans a tax cut while not adding to the share of the deficit owned by our children and grandchildren, or we can stick with the failed policy of the past and continue to stall and do nothing. 
   The choice is easy. America can no longer live off credit card-onomics. We need to manage our House like we expect our constituents to manage their homes. Support this bill. It is tax relief without tax recklessness.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California, and I rise to thank our young men and women in our armed services and their families, those who have understood the sacrifices that they have made on behalf of our great Nation. 
   But Mr. Speaker, I also rise to speak out in strong opposition to President Bush's misguided escalation of troops in the Iraq War and to commend the Democratic leadership of this House for holding a real debate on our involvement in Iraq. 
   Since January 4, when Speaker Pelosi took the gavel, the Democratic majority has delivered on its pledge of oversight and accountability of this war in Iraq, and Democrats have changed the direction of the discussion and have changed this war to lead us to the ultimate goal of all Americans, that is, to bring our troops home. 
   For too long, Congress has taken a backseat on the President's handling of this war, but this majority has held more hearings on Iraq than the Republican-controlled Congress did since this war began.     
   This debate is about not about trying to embarrass our President for political purposes. We are debating the escalation because the American people have demanded a change in direction. The President has failed to recognize the will of the people and many of the top military and foreign policy thinkers around the country who view this escalation with little hope of success. 
   Our constituents spoke with their voices loudly on Election Day, and they have been even more vocal since about the dissatisfaction with the way this war has been managed. Many in this country want to see a deescalation of America's forces, not the increase the President has proposed. 
   The President and his advisors created this problem, and it is now on the Congress to find a way to disengage Iraq without causing the country and the region to be engulfed in a further outbreak of violence. 
   In the last week, we have seen some of the most horrific bombings that cost the lives of hundreds of Iraqis and the downing of several U.S. helicopters. Over 3,000 of our young American men and women have lost their lives; tens and thousands have been physically and mentally maimed; and hundreds of Iraqi citizens, the vast majority of them trying to live normal lives, have been killed or injured. 
   This was not how this war was to be conducted. 
   Four years ago, when this President came to the Congress for authorization to invade Iraq, he stated that Iraq posed a clear and present danger. He talked about how invading Iraq was part of the greater war on terror and how, if Saddam Hussein was not toppled, he would attack our allies and maybe even on our own soil. 
   After seeing the death and destruction al Qaeda did to my city on 9/11 and to our Nation, I wanted to trust our President and all the President's men and women. When I sat across the table in the Roosevelt Room in the White House from Condoleezza Rice and then-CIA-Director George Tenet, I thought I could trust them. Because of them and the false intelligence they gave, I voted for authorization of this war. 
   As the only Member of this Congress to lose a relative on 9/11 and as someone who has lost 125 constituents to the attacks of the Twin Towers, I do believe that America must always act to defeat threats before those threats act against us. 
   As they say, in life, there are no do-overs; and if I could turn back time, I am sure that most of the Members of this House and most of my colleagues in this House would never have given this President this authority to wage this war in Iraq.  
   This war has cost us a fortune from our national treasury, a fortune in American lives lost and ruined, and a fortune in our ability as a Congress to trust our Commander in Chief and our President. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to stand as a group and to say what our constituents want us to say, to say what the Army generals want us to say, to say what many of them, those men and women in our Armed Services in uniform on the front line want us to say: ``Mr. President, adding more troops is not the answer. Adding more troops to fight what has become a civil war is not the answer.'' 
   The answer is we need to start to begin to bring our troops home, reducing our presence in Iraq, and create the conditions for the Iraqi people themselves to stand up and secure their own country. 
   The Iraq Study Group set out a plan that many of us support, but the President continues to believe that history will judge him favorably. 
   As the Iraqi government attempts to clamp down on the Shi'a and Sunni militias, it has become abundantly clear these forces are not as strong as we have been led to believe, those being the Iraqi government's forces. I believe we need to look strongly on redeploying our troops in Iraq along the border and in the Kurdish north, removing American citizens from harm's way in Baghdad and Anbar Province, and forcing the Iraqis, both politically and militarily, to secure these areas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 976. 
   This is a smart bill that is good for workers and their employers. 
   Representing Queens and the Bronx, I serve a large number of people who work full time jobs for the minimum wage, and they deserve a raise. 
   But their employers, like the small restaurants that dot 74th Street in Jackson Heights should not be hit with a new tax. 
   This bill will allow congress to start in motion the process of increasing the minimum wage, while protecting important employer tax benefits like enhancing the tip credit and expanding and increasing expensing deductions. 
   This bill also extends and expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to encourage businesses to hire people who were formerly on welfare. 
   Today, we are showing the American people that the Congress works. 
   This bill is good for workers and business and I urge everyone to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'd like to recognize the service of our former colleague, a Member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Hyde, who served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 2007, and served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as well as chairman of the International Relations Committee. 
   Mr. Hyde's life was a good, long life and a complex life as well. Mr. Hyde graduated from high school and earned a scholarship to play basketball at Georgetown University. He participated in the 1942 NCAA basketball tournament. As a college basketball fan, I think that may be the height of his career. But that was only the beginning. 
   He went on to serve valorously in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946 in the South Pacific, New Guinea, the Guinean Gulf, and continued in the Reserves well into the 1960s. 
   Mr. Hyde was elected to serve his constituents in Illinois' Sixth Congressional District, I think where he certainly contributed mightily and tremendously to the advancement of the Congress, as well as our country. 
   I had the great opportunity to serve with Henry Hyde as a member of the International Relations Committee, a somewhat junior member, then a mid bench member. I always enjoyed the banter with the chairman; quick-witted, and incredibly intelligent, steeped in history, understood every bill that was before him, and understood where he stood on those issues. 
   And although Mr. Hyde and I did not agree on every political issue, I admired his tenacity. I admired his demeanor. I admired the way in which he handled himself, both in committee, on the floor, and as a person. 
   I also had the opportunity to travel with Mr. Hyde on a trip to a country that is near and dear to both himself and myself, the country of our ancestry, Ireland. I know that he was proud of the work of the advancement of peace and justice in Ireland, in all of Ireland, and worked mightily towards that end. 
   But Mr. Hyde had numerous accomplishments. And I'll leave that to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to advance today. But I would urge the adoption of this resolution, as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on our side and will close, and I will just say that it's been noted to me that it's highly unusual for us to have a House resolution honoring a former Member but maybe appropriate in this particular case because Henry Hyde was an unusual person, and I will just go back again to my experience with him on the committee. 
   I found him to be very fair, very just, a very abiding chairman, and was concerned as much about the decorum of the committee and how we conducted the business of our committee as well would be done in a fair and just way. That's something that I will certainly remember Henry Hyde for. 
   I hope as we move forward, not only today or next year, but in Congresses to come, that that rapport between Members of both sides, regardless as to where we find ourselves on issues, can conduct ourselves in a way which would make Chairman Hyde proud. 
   The last time I saw Chairman Hyde was where I more often saw him sitting, next to the portrait of Lafayette here in the House of Representatives in a wheelchair and remarking to him, as always I did, Mr. Chairman, how are you, even though he was no longer chairman of a standing committee here in the House. For many of us on our side, as well as yours, he was always the Chairman, and we say to Chairman Hyde, God bless and Godspeed.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (AWARDING CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of awarding Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the founding of our country, this Congress has awarded more than 300 people and organizations the Congressional Gold Medal. We have bestowed this honor on those who have performed outstanding deeds and acts of service. Past recipients include the Dalai Lama, for his contributions to peace, nonviolence, human rights and religious understanding; Elie Wiesel, one of the foremost spokesmen of the victims of the Holocaust; the Reverend Francis X. Quinn, pastor of the Church of the Guardian Angel in New York City, who risked his own life in persuading an armed gunman to surrender to police and free an elderly couple he was holding hostage; Mother Teresa of Calcutta; and Nelson Mandela of South Africa.     
   Like those who have received this award before, Aung San Suu Kyi embodies the spirit of the Congressional Gold Medal, dedicating her life to the cause of freedom and democracy by fighting to establish peace in her home country of Burma. 
   Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Burma in 1945, and 2 years after her birth her father negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom and was then assassinated by his rivals that very same year. 
   Like father, like daughter, Ms. Suu Kyi has spent most of her life working to better her native country. Although Burma established democratic rule after becoming an independent republic in 1947, a military coup toppled the government in 1962, and since then the government has been effectively under military control. 
   For more than 20 years, Ms. Suu Kyi has led the effort to end military rule in her country. In 1988, she helped form the National League for Democracy, also known as the NLD, which advocates nonviolence. She is currently the NLD's general secretary. In 1990, despite being under house arrest, she led her political party to a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, gaining 82 percent of the seats in Parliament. The military junta snubbed the will of the Burmese people by nullifying the results of the election and, subsequently, ruling with an iron fist. 
   Throughout her political career, Aung San Suu Kyi has been in and out of house arrest, but this has only solidified her determination to secure democracy for the people of Burma. And, when offered the chance to leave the country and live in exile, she said ``no,'' choosing instead to stand with her fellow citizens of Burma. 
   In August, her struggles and the struggles of the Burmese people were thrust onto the international stage when pictures of monks protesting the military junta were shown all over the world. Despite the junta's violent crackdown on dissidents, protesters have remained committed to peaceful protests, inspired by their rightful leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who met with foreign leaders and junta officials from her home to work for a peaceful way forward after the bloody nationwide crackdown. 
   Their efforts prompted new calls for democracy within the global community. The United Nations' Secretary was outspoken in calling on the junta to allow for democracy to take place in Burma. And First Lady Laura Bush continues to make public statements in support of the democratic movement in Burma, and we are all grateful to the First Lady's efforts in trying to bring about democratization within Burma; yet, the nation is still under military control and Aung San Suu Kyi's fight for democratic rule continues. 
   Burma is a nation in the heart of southeast Asia. It is bordered by China, Laos, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. In a region that is working to establish firm stability, Burma is a cancer whose main exports are illegal drugs, diseases like HIV and AIDS, and refugees pouring into neighboring countries. 
   The people of Burma and Southeast Asia deserve to live in a stable and thriving region. That is why the United States must continue to support efforts to establish peace and democratic rule in Burma. And it is my hope that by honoring Aung San Suu Kyi with the Congressional Gold Medal, we will continue to pressure the junta to release her and bring freedom and democracy to the people of Burma. 
   Aung San Suu Kyi's work on behalf of the Burmese people has already been recognized by many on the international stage. She has won over 60 international awards, including the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Union, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States, and the Nobel Peace Prize. She is also the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient, spending more than 12 of the last 17 years under house arrest. 
   Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma are leading a courageous nonviolent struggle for human rights and democracy, values we share as Americans. Her passionate, nonviolent approach and commitment to a free democratic Burma has won the hearts and minds of the people of Burma and, I dare say, the rest of the free world. Today I believe we should show her and the rest of the world that she is also in the hearts and minds of the Members of the U.S. Congress. 
   A number of my colleagues deserve special thanks for helping me bring this message to the floor today, including my good friend from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) for working with me to make this a bipartisan measure. Also, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Financial Services Committee Chairman BARNEY FRANK and Ranking Member Bachus deserve my thanks and our thanks in helping to ensure speedy consideration of the bill. Additionally, at the staff level, I want to thank Nien Su, Joe Pinder, Jonathan Obee and Greg Sheiowitz from my staff for their help. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank once again Mr. Manzullo for his support and efforts in helping to bring this legislation in a bipartisan spirit to the floor today. I want to thank my friend again Mr. Faleomavaega for his comments and work as well. 
   There is no question that the situation in Burma is complex. One only needs to read today's Washington Post to understand again the complexity of this in terms of the ethnic diversity within Burma. Also, in reading that article today, one could also understand that there's incredible turmoil within that country where there are more child soldiers than any other country today; where every day, daily, young boys are coerced and enslaved by conditions into becoming soldiers as young boys and children. There are over 2,000 political prisoners that we know of today in Burma. And that same article today alluded to the destruction of villages in Burma. Let me just point out that over 200 ethnic minority villages have been destroyed by the military junta, forcing 1.5 million people to flee their homes, some to flee the country, in a country where rape is used as a weapon by the military regime against the ethnic minorities within that country, documented and well known. 
   Aung San Suu Kyi, if she receives this award this year, will receive the award the same year that we just gave this to the Dalai Lama, the same award, the Gold Medal. She is known in Burma and throughout the world as the Nelson Mandela of Burma. She is known as the Gandhi of Burma.     
   I think it is appropriate that this year she share the limelight in some way with the Dalai Lama who himself has brought attention to the cause of the people of his own land. 
   Let me close by saying just one other point about Aung San Suu Kyi and the sacrifices she has had to make, giving up of her personal freedom and opportunity to live in Great Britain, India or elsewhere. She has turned that down to be with her own people who are suffering to the point where she is not permitted to see her family members because of her involvement in human rights activities.  
   In 1999, when her husband was dying, the military regime refused to allow him to live with her during that time. She had to spend those terrible days in isolation from the person she loved more than anyone else, her dying husband. 
   It is also important to note that Aung San Suu Kyi received the Nobel Peace Prize. But quite frankly, that was done in 1991, a very long time ago; some 16 years ago she received that award. So I believe that the work that the administration is doing, the work that the First Lady, and again I want to congratulate First Lady Laura Bush for her continued effort to bringing light and attention to this particular issue, I think it is having an effect on the world. I think more of the world is interested in what is happening in Burma and paying attention to it. 
   I would also like to take this time to ask our friends in India to play more of an active role in bringing about a constructive solution to the issues of Burma. And again to China, a country that I believe has continued to turn its face away from atrocities, no longer should China turn her face away from what is happening in Burma. China, India, Bangladesh, all of the countries in the region need to be concerned about what is happening in Burma today. Again, it is about what makes America America, standing up for those countries that stand up for democracy and human rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this legislation to the House floor and hope my colleagues support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in January 1998 a devastating ice storm struck the northern New England border region. Damage to the region's infrastructure was considerable, and millions spent days in the dark on both sides of the border between the U.S. and Canada. When the lights came back on, there were over 30 dead. 
   This tragedy resulted in an effort in cross-border cooperation that has yielded the mutual assistance compact we have before us today. The International Emergency Management Assistance Memorandum of Understanding provides a legal framework for cooperation between the States of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, with the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. 
   The compact allows for management of any emergency or disaster arising from natural disaster, technological disaster, man-made disaster, or civil emergency. It seeks to regularize plan and program formulation; assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing jurisdictional boundaries; ensure critical delivery of services as well as medicines, water, food, energy and fuel; and to clarify search and rescue protocols and issues related to evacuation. 
   The Senate has already passed their version of the resolution; and passage today in the House, as required by the Constitution, will permit this compact to come into effect. 
   It is worth noting, as well, that several years ago the Senate passed a similar resolution, but the House failed to act and the moment faded. We must not let this happen again. This is the kind of international cooperation that makes it safer and stronger. 
   I thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), particularly, for his strong leadership on this important compact and for his diligence in trying to ensure greater cooperation with Canada on emergency issues. This resolution deserves our support, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in doing so. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We've come a long way in 232 years. It's about time we get a protocol in place that ensures that lives are saved during times of disaster, whether manmade or natural. I commend my friend again for sponsoring this legislation, and I urge its adoption.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from California for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was not here in Washington 6 years ago this evening. I was stuck in New York. Because of such bad weather, we couldn't get out of New York. I was forced to be on a plane the next morning. At 9:10 in the morning I was two planes from take-off at La Guardia, speaking about the Port Authority of New York, when we were informed the plane would be turned around and brought back to the terminal because of the attacks of two planes on the World Trade Center in New York. 
   In many respects my thoughts are, life goes on. We see it all around us. Life does go on, but it doesn't diminish the loss that we all suffered on that fateful day 6 years ago, as a Nation, as to me as a New Yorker, more personally for me, as my first cousin Battalion Chief John Moran who was killed that day. 
   Though on that day we saw the ugliest side of humankind, we also saw the brilliance of the human spirit, of the American spirit, and, if you allow me to say, the spirit of New York. We more than pulled through since that day 6 years ago. We see it today in the eyes and the faces of our servicemen and women who today around the world defend our freedoms. 
   But I, for one, am not satisfied that Osama bin Laden is being hunted like a dog and is living in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan. I, for one, believe that 6 years is long enough to have let this animal roam freely in those areas. 
   We need to bring that man to justice and all those who are responsible for this, that vicious attack on our country that day. We, as Americans, should not lose sight of that or be distracted. We need to find Osama bin Laden and all those responsible for the attack that day and bring them to justice.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I want to thank my good friend from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) for yielding me this time. 
   My colleagues, this is a good bill, and I ask all my colleagues to support this worthy effort. 
   And Chairman Lewis, I want to thank you personally, and your staff. You went out of your way to include language that I had concerns of and wanted to include in this bill to increase the access of eligible taxpayers to the EITC, the earned income tax credit. So I want to personally thank you and your staff for your outreach to our office and including that. Ronald Reagan himself referred to the EITC as the greatest anti-poverty program in the history of our country, so I think it deserves worthy bipartisan support. 
   Madam Speaker, we heard in testimony last week in the Committee on Ways and Means from the Taxpayer Advocate of the United States that identity fraud against taxpayers is skyrocketing. This bill establishes some of the strongest protections for taxpayers against identity theft scams, especially those at greatest risk of fraud, our seniors and veterans filing this year to claim the economic stimulus rebate check. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, my Republican colleagues and the Bush Administration, are adamantly opposed to this taxpayer protection act because they're opposed to the offset that we provide.     
   No one can argue that some of my Republican colleagues philosophically oppose paying for anything and support the continuation of what I believe was 7 years of Republican economic theory of ``borrow and spend.'' And in case you're keeping count, the results of the Republican borrow and spend credit card economic policy is a $30,000 birth tax on every person born in this country today. In fact, in my own home, it's at $90,000 because I have an 8-, 7-, and 2-year-old. I can't imagine that they would be very happy if they understood what the birth tax was that was placed upon them by irresponsible and reckless fiscal policies over the last 7 years.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, that's why Democrats are trying to be responsible and we implemented the pay-as-you-go principles, meaning all new tax cuts and new spending increases need to be paid for as we move forward. 
   In regards to the health savings account, I really don't understand the opposition here. What we're simply asking for is accountability. We know that health savings accounts have been spent for country club membership, massage parlors, women's lingerie shops, casinos and gambling, dating and escort services. 
   Let's really put this all in perspective. What we're talking about is accountability in health savings accounts. We're not saying they shouldn't be used for health purposes, but they should be held accountable. 
   People right now, hardworking, honest, faith-loving Americans that want to donate to a charity or to their church with after-tax payments have to account for that charitable contribution before they can take a tax deduction. When it comes to health savings accounts, there is not that requirement. And we're talking about pretax dollars on health savings accounts. There's something wrong here. I wish my Republican colleagues would better understand it. It's simply absurd that they don't support simple accountability.

   Mr. CROWLEY. It is simply absurd to me that my Republican colleagues can't understand that we're simply asking for accountability, that we're not looking to eliminate them, that if they are using it for legitimate health purposes, that's fine. 
   Now, I did note that the HSA, the Health Savings Account Council, says that the IRS has the authority to audit these accounts. Are they suggesting that the IRS audit every health savings account to make sure that health savings accounts are being used for health reasons? I daresay that the IRS is looking at probably more often than not the charitable contributions that hardworking Americans make and making sure that those are legitimate charities before they're able to deduct them from their taxes. 
   So what we are looking for is a little balance here in terms of what really are legitimate tax savings purposes in health savings accounts. That's really simply what the Democrats are looking for.

   I perused the motion to recommit by Mr. Herger. I think it is interesting, the other side has pointed out we have chosen today, Tax Day, to bring this bill to the floor. It is also interesting they take this motion to recommit the same day that the Pope has arrived here in the United States, who is with the President right now at the White House; the same Pope who has decried the xenophobic nature of some of the legislation that has been coming out of this House by the other side of the aisle. 
   I think it is interesting to note that no illegal aliens will be hurt by this motion to recommit. In fact, it will be the elderly woman who relies upon her opportunities to buy these bonds for their income later in life. I would also point out it is quite possible that New York State and California, the States of two of the gentleman here today, could potentially be hurt by this motion to recommit. 
   I think it is foolhardy. It obviously is an attempt to kill the bill by requiring it be promptly reported back to committee, and therefore the attempt is clear, once again to use anti-immigrant rhetoric to kill the bill and to use ``promptly'' to kill the bill.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, first of all I think my friend from Georgia needs some responding to in terms of the issue of the price of gas today. I just want to point out that what is false is Republicans, not Democrats, advocated and tried to pass legislation to increase the gas tax on Americans, offering legislation that would cost American drivers $800 million. That was a GOP motion to recommit on H.R. 2776 on August 4, 2007. And that data comes from the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
   The fact is not a single member of the Democratic Caucus supported the Republican effort to increase the gas tax on American families. That comes from rollcall vote 834. 
   The fact is that the Democratic leadership has not brought forward a bill to increase the gas tax on drivers, only your side of the aisle. 
   Another point dealing with the pay-fors in this legislation. I just want to point out one of the pay-fors, the worldwide interest allocation, would bring in $24 billion raised to help pay for what we're attempting to do here. 
   I know my friend, Mr. Hastings, was making reference to this, that these are simply tax increases. The provision that we're talking about specifically in worldwide interest allocation, $29 billion, if so, if this is a tax increase, I just want to remind the gentleman that in H.R. 3221, the Ways and Means amendment to the Democratic homeownership rescue bill, that the same provision was included in that bill in which 95 members of your party supported it, including Mr. Hayes, Mr. Porter, Mr. Ramstad, Mr. Hulshof, Mr. Reichert, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Camp, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Chabot, Mr. Diaz-Balart, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Keller, Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Shays, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Linder, Mr. Walberg, Mrs. Drake, Mr. English, Mr. Fossella, Mr. Gerlach, Mr. Murphy----

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Representative Faleomavaega, for not only yielding me the time but for working with us on this important resolution. I also want to thank his staff who has worked with my staff in an expeditious way to get this resolution to the floor as soon as possible. I want to thank the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as well, Congressman Berman, and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, and the other members of the committee for their quick movement on this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest condolences and sympathy to the people of Burma for the grave loss of life and vast destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis. 
   Burma was hit by the cyclone more than 10 days ago, and its impact has been nothing but devastating. To date, it has claimed an estimated 100,000 lives. It has robbed more than a million people of their homes, and tens of thousands of people are still missing and unaccounted for, while millions are struggling to survive without access to clean water, food, or shelter. 
   Shamefully, the military junta of Burma, showing no regard for the lives of their fellow Burmese, did little to warn the people in the cyclone's path that the cyclone was coming, and they have done little to help their own people in the aftermath of this natural disaster. 
   Instead of providing much-needed emergency humanitarian aid to its people, the junta pushed forward with an election to pass their sham constitutional referendum. At a time when all resources should have been focused on saving the lives of survivors struggling  to find food and clean water to stave off starvation, disease and death, the regime deployed personnel to campaign in favor of the referendum, man polling stations, and fill state television with images of dancing girls urging people to vote in favor of their referendum. 
   Aside from failing to use their own resources to help the people, the junta would not even accept outside resources to aid the devastated communities in the aftermath of the cyclone. 
   Immediately after the cyclone hit, the United States embassy in Burma authorized $250,000 in emergency assistance, as it does whenever such an emergency takes place around the world.     
   President Bush also swiftly followed by pledging an additional $3 million, the assistance of the U.S. Navy assets in the region, a disaster assessment team and any additional aid that would be needed. And the United States Agency For International Development Administrator Henrietta H. Fore announced an additional $13 million in aid to Burma, bringing the total value of U.S. Government assistance to more than $16.3 million. 
   Yet most of those funds and offers have gone unaccepted. To date the junta has allowed only one plane load of U.S. emergency aid to enter the country, and it is unclear if that reached the survivors at all. 
   While estimates from the international humanitarian organization in Burma reveal that more than 1.5 million people are on the brink of death unless aid reaches them immediately, the Burmese military regime continues to deny international aid workers entry in the country. 
   Yesterday, at a meeting in Rangoon, a Burmese cabinet minister told relief agencies that foreign aid workers are prohibited from entering the disaster zone, and must present all of their supplies to the military for distribution. 
   The regime does not have the capacity or skills to handle this major humanitarian crisis, yet it continues to deny visas to disaster assessment teams that can help. It has allowed only the smallest trickle of international aid into the country. At this point, in the post-tsunami relief operation, the hard hit region of Aceh was receiving one aid flight every single hour. In Burma, the regime is only allowing three or four flights a day, after not allowing any in the first five days after the cyclone hit. 
   Efforts to ensure aid reaches the survivors of the cyclone are continually hampered by military officials who will not allow aid workers, foreigners, diplomats or journalists, or even ordinary Burmese who want to help their fellow citizens access to the hardest hit areas. Many of the affected communities have received no aid from the regime or any aid agency. 
   To make matters worse, it is being reported that the junta is also selling aid supplies to local markets. Mr. Speaker, that is simply unacceptable. 
   Just yesterday, China experienced its own natural disaster, a massive earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, and our hearts go out to the victims of that disaster. But China, unlike the junta in Burma, immediately acted to help the victims and the citizens of its country. 
   Countries that have the capacity to react to a natural disaster and provide aid to its citizens have a moral obligation to do so. China's actions in the United Nations Security Council to prevent efforts to invoke the responsibility to protect in Burma is appalling. 
   It is truly saddening, but not surprising, to see the Burmese junta turn a blind eye to its own people. The United States, along with the international community, understands the gravity of the situation, even if the military regime in Burma does not. Even in the wake of one of the most deadly natural disasters they refused to provide the proper humanitarian assistance needed to ensure the health and survival of their own citizens. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us is about making clear to the people of Burma that we stand with them, and that we will continue push the junta to accept our assistance to help those in need.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the people of the State of Israel and the greater Jewish community on the 60th anniversary of their independence. 
   The United States supported the establishment of the Jewish State in 1948, and our two countries have been the closest of friends and strong allies ever since. 
   Our friendship is rooted in some deeply shared beliefs. We believe in freedom of religion, in freedom of the press, and in freedom of speech. We believe in free and fair elections. And we believe that extremism and terrorism have no place in the global community. 
   Since its Independence, Israel has endured unstable and troubling conditions in the Middle East. They have been subject to violence and unwarranted attacks. They have been asked to compromise their borders. They have had missile strikes threatening the lives of innocent citizens on an almost daily basis. Yet, the Israeli people remain united and strong--continuing to stand up for their beliefs and for their country. 
   Israel is a modern success story. It is the only Democracy in the Middle East. It is the only Middle Eastern country where Arabs have the right to vote for their elected officials and their political leaders. And, it is one of the only Middle Eastern nations without oil wealth that has transformed itself from an agrarian based economy to a high tech economic powerhouse. 
   Israel's detractors, and those who hide their anti-Semitism behind anti-Zionism, must not and will not denigrate the success of Israel. That is why I stand here today. 
   I believe the survival of the Jewish state is paramount. I believe her existence, while  small in geographic size, is the one of largest symbols of humankind's continued faith in God, enduring spirit to survive, and belief in freedom and democracy. 
   And, I believe the United States must continue to stand with Israel and support her efforts to defend her citizens. I am proud to be one of Israel's strongest friends in Congress. And today, I want to join my colleagues in Congress in wishing Israel a hearty Mazel Tov on 60 years of Independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Queens and Nassau County, Mr. Ackerman, for yielding me this time. 
   I listened very closely to my colleague from Staten Island, Mr. Fossella, and his concerns about any disadvantage that New York may suffer under passage of this legislation. It is not our intention or anyone's intention to have New York be disadvantaged in any way, shape or form. And I will continue to work with him, as we have done in previous Congresses, to help make sure that New York is not disadvantaged. 
   But Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1. After the awful events of September 11, our Nation joined together to construct ways to prevent this from happening again and for better protecting our homeland. 
   But this administration, the Bush administration, and Congress then refused to act or to listen properly. The Republicans refused to implement commonsense recommendations ensuring Federal Homeland Security dollars went to places where they were actually needed. 
   The Republicans did not take threat or risk assessment into account for protecting our homeland. Rather, the Republicans took politics into account. 
   Democrats are fixing these problems and providing real security to all 300 million Americans, regardless of political persuasion. Democrats are making sure all of our first responders in harm's way are given the training they need to perform and protect our citizens. Democrats are cracking down on loose nukes and strengthening nuclear proliferation to keep weapons out of the wrong hands. 
   For over 5 years I have heard the Republicans play politics with homeland security and with the lives and the memories of the 3,000 people who were murdered on 9/11. Their scare tactics expired this November when the American people demanded real change. 
   Homeland security is about protecting the homeland and not politics or 30-second ads. We Democrats recognize that. 
   After 6 years, America is moving in a new direction. It is moving forward, Mr. Speaker. Let's protect America. Let's implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and let us move forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, let me just for a moment talk about where we are at this point with immigration reform, as from my observation I see the Senate has done some of the work. It negotiated the bill that they will then bring before their house, and further negotiations will take place, and bill amendments will be made to that legislation. Ultimately they will pass a bill on immigration reform in their house. 
   We will then have an opportunity on our side to do a similar measure. It will be different from the Senate when they go to conference. In that conference, hopefully we will be able to get to a bill we can all agree upon, we can send to the President, and the President can sign into law. 
   Let's not rush to judgment on what that legislation will be. This bill is not going to be amnesty. This bill is going to be one that will secure our borders, that will create a virtual fence, one that will address the issues of illegal immigration, but also address the issue of the 12 million undocumented, those who find themselves in illegal status here in the United States today. The human element is as much an important part of how we move forward to deal with this issue, and I hope that all my colleagues keep an open mind as the debate moves forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the Speaker for affording me this opportunity. And to the new Democratic coalition, to have an opportunity to speak a few moments on the new template that has been created as we move forward on trade here in the House of Representatives. 
   I want to take this opportunity again to applaud the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, my chairman, Mr. Rangel, as well as chair of the Subcommittee on Trade, Mr. Levin, as well as the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the entire Democratic leadership for what I believe was forcing the Bush administration to agree to a framework that will encompass all future trade agreements, a framework that will ensure that our trade pacts with other nations respect labor, both here in the United States and abroad; that respect the environment both here and abroad; and respect our Nation's future economic success. And specifically, the new Democratic majority achieved a long sought-after goal that our trade agreements will include enforceable labor and environmental standards. 
   I think it is incredible that our caucus, that charged our leadership and Mr. Rangel with the authority to negotiate on behalf of our caucus with the administration, with the USTR, the principles that we laid out for him and for our leadership. And what is remarkable is the success that Mr. Rangel and our other leaders met in those negotiations. 
   This new framework, this new template, as I said before, illustrates how Democrats, in response to public demands to work in a bipartisan way, how we were able to achieve our goals by working cooperatively with Republicans without compromising what we stand for as Democrats--and that, in large contrast to the stalemates that we saw in recent past Congresses. 
   I think it is a new day in many respects for the Ways and Means Committee and for the House of Representatives. I hope it goes beyond this new template for fair and free trade agreements: that this can be used as an example in other areas; that we can hopefully work in a more bipartisan spirit, not always agreeing, not always getting along, but working in the spirit of cooperation on behalf of all our constituents, be that Democrat, Republican or Independent. 
   This new trade policy achieves the core Democratic principles and goes far beyond the provisions in any previous free trade agreement. All pending free trade agreements will be amended to incorporate key Democratic priorities and will be fully enforceable. Key demands that were met are fundamental labor and environmental protections included in trade agreements that are fully enforceable. 
   I think it is important to note here, after years of opposition, this administration and the former Republican-controlled Congress agreed to include in the text of the agreement the five ILO worker rights: first, the right to association. Secondly, the right to collectively bargain. It also prohibits child labor. It prohibits slave labor. It prohibits discrimination. For the first time, environmental standards cannot be lowered, and will be fully enforceable in free trade agreements going forward. 
   The agreement upon framework expands access to life-saving medicines in developing countries as well. Trade agreements with South Korea and Colombia present additional and distinct obstacles that need to be addressed. This is a framework; it is not carte blanche for every free trade agreement moving forward. 
   The framework is about leveling the playing field for America's workers, for our farmers and businesses, and promoting a trade policy that advances U.S. economic interests around the world, but also advances what we stand for as Americans. 
   Democrats will continue to work across the aisle to make sure our country stays in the forefront of this globalizing economy and this globalizing world. Working across the aisle, Democrats will educate our youth and upgrade worker skills on the job, and stimulate science, education and research as we move forward. 
   Democrats are committed to moving beyond the current trade adjustment assistance, TAA system, to provide meaningful support, training and revitalization programs for entire communities which have been hurt by the effects of trade and technology. This bipartisan framework will keep America as a global economic leader and a champion for the principles Americans all believe in. 
   I am so happy to be joined this evening by a fellow member of the New Democratic Coalition, ALLYSON SCHWARTZ from Philadelphia, who would also like to share her thoughts about this new template that we have been able to create here in the House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. One of the things that I think is remarkable about the template is that this is the base. This is not the ceiling. This is where we start from. And it is also precedent-setting. We have been asking, I wouldn't say begging, but we have been pleading with the other side to include these ILO declarations for many, many, many years now. 
   Unless you have served in the House for the past few years, you may not have the same appreciation for the dysfunctionality of the Ways and Means Committee and how it was or was not working in the past. It was either you take the agreement and you vote for it, or you don't. That is not a way, I think, to build bipartisanship. That is not a way to build consensus on any issue, let alone an issue that is as contentious as trade is for both Democrats and Republicans. 
   I think the American people, Allison, I think you will agree, want to see us  working together. It doesn't mean we always have to agree on everything, but they want to see us working together and crafting a template like this, that there is a give and take on all sides. I think when anyone enters into negotiation on behalf of any party, the understanding is there will be some give and take. 
   There will be some who are not entirely happy with every aspect of an agreement, but I think on the whole, we have to look at what Mr. Rangel and Mr. Levin have been able to craft here and understand that just about everything we wanted as Democrats is in this template. 
   It doesn't mean that we will all, either Democrat or Republican, support all of the free trade agreements moving forward, but it is the floor and not the ceiling, and it gives us a great place, I think, to start. 
   One thing to also recount is that many of the nations that we have talked to, whether it was Peru or Panama or even Colombia, have said they have no problem with us including these provisions. They had no problem if the former Congresses would have included them, but they didn't include them. 
   Under this new Congress, this new Democratically controlled House and Senate, we said, no more. It will no longer be the way it used to be. It will no longer be a rubber stamp. We are going to impose a new template that incorporates some of the things that we believe are core standards for the American worker, but also for us as Democrats and for the environment. 
   We have been joined as well by our colleague from Wisconsin Mr. Kind, a cochair of the New Democratic Coalition. I know he would like to participate.

   Mr. CROWLEY. I think one of the aspects of the template that we are talking about this evening, dealing primarily with the environment, for instance, is something that has not gotten as much attention as the labor and the ILO declaration has gotten in terms of its incorporation within the template. 
   But I think it is important to note for the Record that the policy, as it moves forward under this template that the Democrats have created, will require our trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on the books, that they have agreed to, and comply with several multilateral environmental agreements, MEAs, which would include: the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species; the Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances; Convention on Marine Pollution, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Convention; the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands; the International Whaling Convention; and the Convention on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

   Mr. CROWLEY. We are talking about uplifting these other countries, as well, by transposing our core values as it pertains to labor standards, as it pertains to the environment. I think that is something that should not be lost on anyone when we look at what we are attempting to do here. 
   Talking about Kennedy, talking about anyone who has looked to the hemisphere that we are in, as well as the Southern Hemisphere, in many respects you cannot move that hemisphere elsewhere. We are connected by land mass. 
   I think as we move forward on the immigration debate and we discuss this more and more, many of us believe we should be helping those countries with direct aid and assistance, to help them become better democracies or become democracies. 
   We see what is happening in some of those countries in South America that are trying to experiment with other forms of government that we don't necessarily agree with. It is not the way that we would prefer to see South America move. I think that is why being able to bolster some of those countries down there and show that there is a positive benefit to be gained by having a positive relationship with the United States in this template in trade and moving forward could very well be an example that could be set for other countries in the region. 
   We have been joined by our friend and colleague from New York, Congressman Meeks, who has certainly been engaged on many trade and immigration issues, and has worked with Venezuela and other countries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, it is indeed an honor for me to rise here today on the floor of the House of Representatives to pay tribute and to say thank you to a very close personal friend of mine, Ms. Mary Lu Plunkett, one of the most influential people in my life for the past 25 years and one of the most valued members of the community of Queens County in New York State and New York City for more than the last 50 years. 
   I was blessed to meet Mary Lu Plunkett in my early 20s, when I stepped into the Queens County Democratic headquarters while running errands at the time for my then-Uncle Walter Crowley. That day was the start of one of the most important friendships in my personal and political life, Madam Speaker. But long before Mary Lu became a valued part of my life, she was already a valued and well-established force in Queens County and in Queens County Democratic politics. 
   Mary Lu was born in Brooklyn, and she moved to Jackson Heights, Queens, in 1949 with her husband Jack. Mary Lu was quick to engage in her community and in her local church, and we were just as quick to forgive Mary Lu for her Brooklyn past. 
   Mary Lu's foray into politics started when she joined the Amerind Democratic Club. She went on to volunteer at Queens County Democratic Headquarters, where she became a full-time member of the staff in 1956. While working at county headquarters, Mary Lu served some of Queens County's finest political leaders, including Moses Weinstein, Jim Roe, and my predecessor Tom Manton, and her influence on them and our community was felt and has been felt by all of us since. 
   No political event or dinner has been held without Mary Lu and her charm. She helped to welcome such dignitaries and luminaries as John Kennedy, TED  KENNEDY, Jimmy Carter, Governor Hugh Carey, Mario Cuomo, Mayor Ed Koch, David Dinkins and President Bill and Senator HILLARY CLINTON and welcomed them into our Queens County home. 
   Her intelligence, her warmth and kindness have made everyone who has come into contact with her feel welcome and comfortable. 
   However, Mary Lu's reach went well beyond local politics. You have to keep in mind, Madam Speaker, that Queens County has 2.3 million people who live in just that county alone. When she was not at county headquarters, she was working to create a better Queens, and in particular, a better Rockaway, her hometown in Queens County. For example, every year she hosted an annual fundraiser that was a must-attend event to help the children of St. Gertrude's Parish in Far Rockaway. 
   On top of all she has done for others, most important to her, I think, is her role as a mother and as a grandmother. There is nothing that Mary Lu won't do or hasn't done for her two children, Steve and Jamie; and her three grandchildren, Matthew, Christopher, and Caroline; and their mom, Nancy. 
   I have tremendous respect for Mary Lu and all she has accomplished throughout her years, but as her friend, I'm most proud of how she has led her family life, and I have always considered myself an extended member of that family, often enjoying many personal moments in the Rockaways, getting sand in my shoes with the Plunkett family. 
   In the coming weeks, my fellow friends and colleagues in Queens County will gather to honor Mary Lu for her lifetime of service to our great borough and to our great city and to our great country. We will applaud her for her charity, her wit and political skill, and I want to thank her for being a mentor and a friend. 
   Mary Lu, we love you and we congratulate you on your lifetime of achievement.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (NATIONAL FOSTER PARENTS DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 179, which calls for the establishment of a National Foster Parents Day. We should establish this day to recognize and appreciate our country's foster parents--the pillars of our child welfare system. 
   These are the men and women who go out of their way to help children in need--children who have been maltreated or who had to be removed from dangerous home situations. Foster parents open their hearts and their homes to these children, providing them with so much more than shelter. They allow these children to feel safe and secure once again, and help them to begin the healing process. 
   Children placed in foster care often come from some of the worst conditions imaginable. They have been abused, neglected, and broken down in ways beyond the physical. Many of these children enter foster care with serious emotional damage as well. They have learned that their home, the one place where they should feel safe, can actually be more dangerous than the world outside. It is the foster parent who helps build these children back up, reminding them how love and attention feel, and reassuring them that home can once again be a comfort. 
   Far beyond helping a single child, quality foster care is also an investment in our communities. We have learned that being abused or neglected dramatically increases the risk that kids will grow up to commit violent crimes, which is why it is so important to have a strong foster care system to place children in as soon as possible. Research has shown that abused and neglected children who became wards of the court and initially remained at home, but were later placed in foster care because of continuing abuse or neglect, were more likely to become violent criminals than abused or neglected children who were placed in a safe foster home right away. 
   This is why we must continue to support our foster parents. No child should be forced to remain in a dangerous situation because there are not enough available foster homes. We must make sure that funding for foster care is never capped or reduced so that our foster families can continue to receive the resources they need to provide supportive, loving spaces for these children in need. 
   Additionally, we must increase our investment in preventing child abuse and neglect through programs such as the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program and in-home parent coaching programs. We also need to ensure that children in foster care find safe, permanent homes, either by reuniting them with their families or by adoption. 
   The success of our foster care system is vital to protecting our children, and our child welfare system relies on people like foster parents to run smoothly. These men and women on the front lines of the child welfare fight deserve all the recognition they can get. It is my hope that a National Foster Parents Day will also draw attention to the need for quality foster care and capable foster parents, and allow this system to continue benefiting our children in need. 
   I thank Representative BOYDA for sponsoring this legislation, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud the bravery of a young man, Hassan Askari. On December 9 of this year, Hassan Askari risked his own safety and his life to defend a group of strangers who were attacked on a New York City subway. 
   What started as an exchange of Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah between two fellow passengers ignited into a violent exchange of anti-Semitic slurs and violence. 
   A group of men and women attacked the Jewish passengers, and only one passenger came to their defense, Hassan Askari. Hassan, like the men he was trying to help, was beaten and pummeled by the attackers. But as he said with regard to his actions, ``I believe we are all members of one family, and my religion teaches me always to come to the aid of my fellow man in distress.'' 
   Hassan is a Muslim from Bangladesh. He was taught, as we all should be, that we are humans first, first and foremost. And no matter what our faith or race, we should treat each other with respect. 
   Hassan's actions on the subway were human nature at its best, and I applaud him for interceding to stop a senseless act of violence and hate. I hope his actions will serve as an example for all of us.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I am sure I will not use all that time, and I thank the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, for giving me this time on the floor. I want to thank my friend and colleague from Florida, Congressman Bilirakis, for his working with me to further expand the resolution that we have on the floor today to include all media outlets that promote hate and intolerance in the Middle East. This is a bipartisan resolution, and I greatly appreciate his input and his support on this legislation today. 
   I initially introduced this legislation in response to reports that Hamas was using and is using their television network, al-Aqsa TV, to depict violence and acts of hatred on a show called ``Tomorrow's Pioneers.'' The show has Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny look-alikes telling their children viewers that they will ``finish off the Jews and eat them.'' Another puppet show also on the network, as was mentioned earlier, acted out the murder of President Bush on that network. 
   The use of children's programming to send these kinds of messages is despicable and deplorable, and we cannot stand by and let this blatant propaganda continue because, at best, it perpetuates misinformation and, at its worst, it will serve to indoctrinate children, incite them towards hatred and violence against our ally Israel and possibly others, including the United States, and undermine efforts to firmly establish peace in the Middle East for generations to come. 
   Instead of promoting violence, our children should be taught to respect and accept all people, no matter their faith or their nationality. 
   If we are going to establish lasting peace in the Middle East, and it is all of our fervent hope that we do that, it will require far more than an end to military hostilities between warring factions. It will require the creation of an environment where people can live side by side in peace. 
   Today, we send a clear message to our friends and foes alike in the Middle East that we do not tolerate the indoctrination of hate in children. The next leaders of our world should not be brainwashed into hating the West and Israel. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL BLACK HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. 
   HIV/AIDS is one of the worst epidemics we have ever seen in the United States. More than 900,000 cases of AIDS have been reported in the US since 1981. Nearly 1,000,000 people may be infected with HIV, one quarter of them is unaware about their infection. 
   In my hometown New York City more than 100,000 people are living with HIV. Approximately 1 in 70 New Yorkers is infected with HIV.  
   Statistics just help us to number the dimension of HIV/AIDS in our country but every single number reflects more, reflects the life and the living with HIV/AIDS of one of our fellow citizen. 
   While we are far away from curing AIDS, science has made enormous progress. 
   Today, we can say that early and correct treatment enables people to live longer and to live with HIV/AIDS more as a chronic illness than a definitive death sentence. 
   Even with these opportunities, we face new challenges. 
   The African-American community is disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. 
   According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, black women are 9 times more likely to die of AIDS than white women; black men in New York City are 6 times more likely to die of AIDS than white men. 
   This is another sign of the massive health disparities that exist in our nation. We need to work together, all of us in Congress, to address and eliminate the disparities in health and health care between the people of our country. 
   That is why I strongly support the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, celebrated on February, 7. 
   The goal of this day is clear to all of us: We have to fight against both the stigma and the spread of HIV/AIDS in our African-American community, and I would add, in every American community. 
   Groups like Bronx AIDS Services and the AIDS Center of Queens County do excellent work, but we in Washington need to back them up with the right support. 
   This includes full funding for Ryan White, ensuring the housing needs of those afflicted are met through the HOPWA program, and eliminating the stigmas attached to the illness. 
   We also need to allow each community group to speak to and target those at greatest risk of exposure in the most effective ways possible. 
   But overall, we know that educating about and against HIV/AIDS, engaging in safe sex, and getting tested are the main elements of comprehensive prevention efforts. 
   Closing, I like to emphasize the importance of the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day by quoting its goals: 
   Get tested to know about your HIV status. 
   Get educated about HIV/AIDS. 
   Get involved in your local community. 
   Get treated if you are currently living with HIV. 
   It is these missions that we must work to achieve. 
   I thank the gentle lady for her resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (HONORING THE LIFE OF HRANT DINK -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to solemnly remember the life of journalist and activist Hrant Dink. 
   On January 19, 2007, Mr. Dink was gunned down by a Turkish ultranationalist outside his newspaper office in Istanbul, Turkey. 
   Hrant Dink was a man who called for tolerance, peaceful dialogue, and greater civil rights for all Turkish citizens. He was a fierce defender of freedom and believed all people have equal rights under the law. He believed that everyone should have the right to know the truth about their Nation's past, however dark that past may be. 
   Hrant Dink had been prosecuted by the Turkish Government under penal code 301, a law that bans free speech and was used to suppress a wide range of dissenting opinion, from criticism of Turkish Government institutions to opposing official Turkish denial of the Ottoman campaign of genocide against its Armenian population. Under the all-encompassing phrase ``insulting Turkishness,'' a citizen in Turkey can receive a prison sentence of up to 3 years with the offense being increased by 50 percent if the so-called offense is committed abroad. 
   Nearly 100 journalists and intellectuals have been prosecuted under article 301, including Nobel Prize author Orhan Pamuk. Many informed observers believe Hrant Dink's prosecution under article 301 opened him up to a campaign of harassment and death threats from ultranationalists, which eventually led to his murder. To this day, citizens of Turkey live under threat of this gag law, with Hrant Dink's own son prosecuted under this law because he reprinted his father's newspaper articles. 
   This is not the action of a true democracy. It is reflective of how a totalitarian state would behave, and this is not the Turkey we, the United States of America, have aligned our country with. 
   Amnesty International has called for a complete repeal of this punitive legislation. The European Commission has repeatedly asked for its repeal. 
   Unfortunately, indications now suggest that the Government of Turkey is only tinkering with changes, making this gag rule even more ambiguous. Today, I ask the House to support calls for the Turkish Government to immediately repeal article 301. 
   One year ago, Members of Congress, their staffers and several members, and members of several communities, came together to watch ``Screamers,'' a film about genocide in the last century, featuring, among others, Hrant Dink. Here, in the Halls of Congress, we watched as Hrant Dink discussed the problems of article 301. 
   Just 2 days after the film's premiere, Hrant Dink was shot dead, a man who only wanted to speak the truth about historical facts as he saw them, a man who wanted every citizen to be treated equally, a man we should applaud here  in America for his courage and dedication to democracy. 
   I believe that if Turkey wants to further explore the opportunities that she wishes to do within the present European Union, she must address the issue of article 301. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the memory of Hrant Dink and continue to urge the repeal of article 301.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5270 extends the financing and spending authority for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The trust fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on March 1, 2008. H.R. 5270 extends these taxes at current rates through June 30 of 2008. 
   On January 29, 2008, the acting administrator of the FAA sent a letter to the Committee on Ways and Means indicating the ability of the FAA to provide services in 2008 will be impeded if this extension is not enacted. I will include this letter from the FAA for the Record. 
   The Committee on Ways and Means reported out a previous extension bill with bipartisan support. This bill will keep the Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes and operations in place until the long-term FAA reauthorization act is signed into law. I urge the full support of my colleagues for this measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan agreement that will reauthorize PEPFAR for an additional 5 years. I want to thank both the Chair of the committee, Howard Berman, the new and very capable chair of the committee, Howard Berman, as well as my long-time friend, the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their crafting of the legislation and in naming it the Tom Lantos/Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Reauthorization Act of 2008. And in so doing, I think it enhances the legacy of both of these fine gentlemen. 
   Let me say from the start, I support the strong program and will urge my colleagues to do the same. The first 5 years of PEPFAR have provided unprecedented prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS for millions around the world. By passing this bill we can, and we will, do more. 
   Through PEPFAR, the United States has spearheaded the global fight against HIV/AIDS by supporting services to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. These services have helped women during more than 10 million pregnancies and led to the prevention of more than 150,000 infant infections. It has supported life-saving treatment for almost 1.5 million men, women, and children. In the focus countries, over 60 percent of those receiving treatment are women and girls. 
   It is my honor to say that I have supported this program when it was first introduced before this body, and I worked to ensure that PEPFAR was as effective and as efficient as possible. An example of this bipartisan effort was the inclusion of language, which I championed, to emphasize education on gender equality and respect for women and girls. The reauthorization act strengthens these provisions by calling for the empowerment of women and youth and by promoting changes in male behavior and attitudes that respect the human rights of women and youth and that support and foster gender equity.     
   However, let me be equally clear, this bill could do so much more and could prevent many more infections if it improved a critical partnership with these programs in the fields that have served women and their families for over four decades, and that is in the field of family planning providers.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Chairman, the House version of the U.S. Global AIDS Act contains language suggesting that only family planning programs compliant with the global gag rule will be eligible to receive PEPFAR funds to provide HIV education, counseling, and testing. I believe that this would be a new restriction. No such requirement exists in current law or policy. And I believe if we are serious about preventing the most new infections, we need to put aside our political differences on the merits of the global gag rule and ensure that the very best in the field have the support of the U.S. to do what they need to do, and that is prevent the spreading of HIV/AIDS.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from California for yielding such time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4, bipartisan legislation that will correct a glaring flaw in the prescription drug law. 
   This commonsense bill will require the Federal Government to negotiate for lower drug prices for American seniors and people with disabilities in the Medicare program. 
   It sounds like common sense, right? But the Republicans actually wrote into law language explicitly prohibiting the government from negotiating for lower prices for American seniors. Instead of using the bully pulpit of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to lower costs, they put a muzzle on him, banning any negotiations. 
   There has never been legislation passed in law prior to that that strictly prohibits any agency from negotiating. From war planes to medical equipment, the Federal Government has always been able to negotiate. 
   Furthermore, 85 percent of respondents in a recent Kaiser Family poll support legislation to allow the government to negotiate lower drug prices. 
   The ability to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs purchased through the Medicare program has the potential to constitute a tremendous savings for recipients, and therefore for all taxpayers. 
   I am pleased that within the first 100 hours of Democratic control of Congress, we are moving to help alleviate the high price of prescription drugs on our seniors. 
   America is going in a new direction, and that direction is forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the H.R. 4 to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate the price of drugs for our nation's seniors. 
   This legislation would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, and would also require the Secretary to report back to Congress on his negotiations, effectively giving us the right of oversight. 
   But I support this legislation because it has the ability to save our nation's seniors millions of dollars in drugs they use every day. 
   There is evidence to show that this bill could potentially save our seniors significant savings  on their prescription drugs. According to Families USA, the average senior could potentially save 58 percent on their drugs. 
   Additionally, according a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, eighty-five percent of respondents feel that the government should be given the ability to negotiate lower prices for senior citizens. 
   However, this bill, while a step in the right direction is by no means the end to this debate. Congress should hold hearings, and briefings to further discuss how to lower prices for medication without eliminating access to vital medications for our nation's seniors. 
   In order to accomplish more access to medications, and an over all improvement in the healthcare system, the answer does not lie in pointing fingers at each other, but rather the un-obstructed dialogue between constituents, elected officials on both sides of the aisle, and all interested parties. 
   I know that I am willing to work with all parties in this debate if it helps my constituents obtain much needed medicine, and access to doctors. 
   Let's stop blaming each other, and prohibiting each other from trying something new. Instead, let's attempt something that could possibly be revolutionary. Former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said ``It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.'' 
   I agree with him, prevail or not, at least we can say we tried to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans. 
   I urge all my colleagues to work together to get this legislation passed, both in Congress and out.

<DOCNO>Mr. CROWLEY. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that will reward community college students who are serving an important role in all of our communities. 
   Specifically, it will provide community college students who mentor at-risk children with $10 of their student loan forgiveness for every hour, for each hour of mentoring they complete. Not only will this loan forgiveness help our college students afford their student loans, but it will also help recruit mentors for at-risk children. 
   I am proud that this Congress is so committed to creating loan forgiveness programs for students who work in areas of national need after graduation. Teachers, nurses, police officers, and child welfare workers are just some professions that will have more opportunities for loan forgiveness under the legislation we are considering today. 
   I applaud the Education and Labor Committee, particularly Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon, for their work on this legislation. 
   However, unlike many of the existing programs, my amendment offers loan forgiveness to students for volunteer work they complete while they are still in school, not for entering a specific profession upon graduation. For most, mentoring children is a volunteer effort and not a full-time job, and their reward is not monetary. With the realization that this kind of work makes a real difference, not only in the life of the young person they are mentoring or in their own lives, but, in fact, it helps our entire community. 
   Caring adults can make a difference in children's lives, and research shows the many positive effects of mentoring. Children that have mentors have better relationships with adults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more confidence to achieve their goals. Mentoring programs are a cost-effective approach to reducing teen pregnancy, substance abuse, incarceration, and violence. 
   For at-risk children who are already susceptible to these dangers, the need for a mentor is even greater. Unfortunately, mentors are not always easy to recruit, and finding mentors that are able to develop long-term relationships with children can be even more difficult. 
   I believe that by providing a small incentive, we will compel others to engage in this kind of volunteerism. That is why I am offering this amendment to provide an incentive for college students to begin mentoring now, which will hopefully lead them to continue serving as a mentor long after they have graduated. 
   Community college students are ideal targets for mentoring recruitment because they tend to have existing relationships within the surrounding community and are likely to remain in the area after completing their studies. This encourages a consistent mentor relationship, which provides the most stability for at-risk children. 
   Of course, potential mentors can be found in many places, and I hope that in the future we will be able to expand this program to all colleges and universities. I know that many institutions are working on ways to encourage their student body to get more involved in volunteering, and I am certain that passing this amendment today will lead to future success. 
   I would ask my colleagues to please join me in supporting this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

And I thank both of you, and all of my colleagues, for supporting this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CROWLEY. I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding me this time. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for expressing their support for what I believe is a very valuable piece of legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the renewal of the sanctions on the Burmese junta. I am proud to follow in the footsteps of the previous author of this important legislation, the late Tom Lantos. It was Tom's drive and energy that ensured that this legislation was passed in the past Congresses, and I am now pleased that I am able to pick up the mantle and to be the lead sponsor of this legislation as it moves forward. 
   Like Mr. Lantos, I believe that the United States has a moral obligation to stand up for those citizens of the world who cannot stand up for themselves. For many years now, the Burmese military junta has committed endless atrocities toward rival factions and ethnic groups inside their borders. Over 1 million of the Burmese people have been forced to relocate from their homes. More than 2,700 villages have been annihilated while junta leaders deny much-needed humanitarian aid to reach refugees as a result of Cyclone Nargis. Millions have been subjugated into forced labor, what the International Labor Organization calls, and I quote, a modern form of slavery. 
   The junta is one of the few remaining repressive regimes still in power in the 21st century. The entire world witnessed the repression that existed only last fall in Burma when the military junta smashed a burgeoning democracy movement. Once again, it was demonstrated when the military junta denied humanitarian assistance to its own people during Cyclone Nargis. 
   President Bush and the First Lady continue to bring attention to the people of Burma's struggle for freedom and democracy, and I congratulate and commend both of them for that.     
   Most recently, the President signed the Congressional Gold Medal of Freedom for Aung San Suu Kyi, which again further demonstrates the commitment of the President and of Congress in terms of bringing notoriety to her cause. But we need to pressure our allies, specifically the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, as well as, I believe, China and India, to do more to clamp down on the junta's finances and international travel. 
   If we ignore this terrible situation, it will only continue to worsen. The time to act against these Burmese atrocities is upon us. Times such as now are when a strong voice is needed to push the world in the right direction. As a collective group, we can come together to save lives and to save a culture from being swallowed by inhumanity. 
   I want to again thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who may have some skeptical thoughts about the imposition of sanctions, but I think you've already alluded to other countries and what they're doing now as a result of what we did, maybe unilaterally. But we are making a difference by not ignoring the plight of the people of Burma, who are being held, in many respects, in bondage by their own government. 
   And so I applaud you for recognizing the effects that these sanctions have had and will continue to have and will grow. We're looking for more partners in this effort. And I believe by passing this legislation today, it demonstrates our further commitment towards the people of Burma, who have very few people in the world looking out for them but the United States. So I congratulate you all for supporting this legislation and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my good friend from New York, Ms. Lowey, the chair of the Subcommittee on the State Foreign Operations Committee. 
   And I think we have to make something really clear, perfectly clear; that in this bill, in this bill there are 10 provisions, 10 provisions that specifically outlaw or prohibit the use of U.S. funds in foreig n assistance for abortion or the promotion of abortion. We have it right here on these charts. Ten provisions, in total, that prohibit the spending of any U.S. funds on the promotion of abortion or abortion. 
   This amendment and this legislation is not about abortion. It is about prevention. And there's an opportunity here for our colleagues to support prevention. Here we have the gentlelady from New York, what she's trying to do is prevent 52 million unplanned pregnancies each year, 29 million abortions each year, 1.4 million infant deaths each year, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths each year, and over a half a million children from losing their mothers each year. That's what this amendment is about. That's what the gentlelady is trying to accomplish. 
   The other side of the aisle is saying that they're for family planning. Well, here is your opportunity to demonstrate that. Here is your opportunity to show, not only the Congress, but the United States and the world, and especially the developing world, that you are for family planning and helping to extend not only life, but the quality of life in many of these countries. 
   I think we ought to be applauding what the gentlelady from New York is trying to do today, as opposed to trying to derail that. If you are for family planning, here is your opportunity. If you're for prevention of transmittable sexual diseases here is your opportunity to stand up. Stand up for family planning and support the gentlelady from New York in her motion, in her amendment an d the underlying bill as well.
