<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1528, introduced by our friend and colleague, Representative John Olver.  
   This is a straightforward bill which would enhance the protection and interpretation of a network of trails that have been in existence for more than 50 years. This trail system is extremely popular and is managed and maintained by an enthusiastic army of volunteers. 
   The route that would be added to the National Trails System carries hikers through the heart of Massachusetts and Connecticut, past scenic vistas, unique geological formations, dinosaur footprints, and rare plants and animals. The trail provides recreation and relaxation for visitors from near and far, and valued open space for the many communities along the way. 
   H.R. 1528 has strong, bipartisan support and is important not only to the people of Massachusetts and Connecticut but also to visitors from around the world wishing to experience the beauty of New England on foot. 
   Given the popularity of the existing trail and the support for a federal designation, it is surprising that anyone would oppose H.R. 1528. In our view, such opposition is based on a misunderstanding of this legislation. 
   In the first place, the bill is based on a National Park Service study that found no need--let me repeat--no need, for direct Federal trail ownership or direct Federal trail management. The trail will be managed by state and local groups under cooperative agreements with the National Park Service. 
   Further, the bill itself expressly states, and I quote: ``The United States shall not acquire for the trail any land or interest in land without the consent of the owner.'' 
   It is perfectly clear that this bill does not threaten property rights. In fact, the trails groups who have managed this trail network for half a century or more have gone out of their way to avoid those conflicts. There is no Federal land involved, and no Federal acquisition anticipated. 
   I strongly support this bill, and I want to take this opportunity to thank the bill's sponsor, Representative Olver, for his hard work on the legislation, as well as his nine cosponsors from Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
   In the end, this is about providing Federal recognition and support to local, non-profit, volunteer organizations who want nothing more than to help people take an enjoyable walk through the woods. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1528.

   I would like to ask the distinguished chairman, the gentleman from Michigan, a question about the provision of the bill that requires the FDA, to the extent feasible, to enter into contracts with States for the inspection of tobacco retailers within their borders. It is my understanding that this contracting provision applies to Indian tribes in the same way as the provision applies to States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our freshmen Democratic members and in concert with the Democratic leadership, I am pleased to bring to the floor today the Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands Act, the DRILL bill. 
   Let there be no mistake about it. As Democrats, we are pro drilling. I repeat that for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We are pro drilling. We are for drilling now. And we are for drilling in areas that bring near-term relief to the American public. 
   As others put forth bumper-sticker energy policies, today, House Democrats are bringing forth prudent legislation aimed at unleashing the vast potential of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, this section to the far right on the map behind me. That is to be distinguished very clearly and separately from the ANWR, over on my far left. 
   Where better to drill than in the National Petroleum Reserve? That is what it's for. The National Petroleum Reserve. That is why it was set aside. The National Petroleum Reserve. 
   Now, my colleagues, the National Petroleum Reserve, situated on the North Slope of Alaska--this reserve is no pipe dream like ANWR way over here, which is a bumper sticker approach to our energy woes--the National Petroleum Reserve is open for leasing. It has been. It will be. Twenty-three million acres. The National Petroleum Reserve is open for leasing, open for business, now, today, 23 million acres containing an estimated 6.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. There is more than over here in ANWR, which is not even open for leasing at this point in time. It is a pipe dream over here in ANWR. 
   Far more than ANWR, the National Petroleum Reserve, as I said, has much more recoverable oil than ANWR. And if ANWR were fully open, we still would be 20 years before we could have any oil in production. The Energy Information estimates show that the only effect on the price at the pump would be 1.8 cents 20 years from now. 
   As opposed to that, we have the National Petroleum Reserve set aside for drilling. In Alaska, 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas has been stranded. Think about that: 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas stranded over in the National Petroleum Reserve because there is no pipeline available to bring it to market over here being the major pipeline. For oil only, I might add. 
   Elsewhere, there are 68 million acres of land onshore and offshore in the Outer Continental Shelf in the lower 48 under oil and gas leases that are not producing. They may be subject to speculation. They may be purely being warehoused. We don't know. 
   I say here today, drill. Drill. Drill. Drill here in America. Drill now. Let's drill. 
   The DRILL Act, Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands Act, would unleash the vast potential of the National Petroleum Reserve by requiring annual Federal oil and gas lease sales and by facilitating the construction of pipelines to connect the NPR-A with the existing central North Slope arteries that will bring it on down to the American consumers in the lower 48. That includes Prudhoe Bay, connecting it over here to Prudhoe Bay, the transportation infrastructure and trans-Alaska Pipeline that comes down here, we do need still a gas pipeline. There is, of course, already existing an oil pipeline. 
   But it makes as a matter of Presidential priority, the DRILL Act makes the construction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline a priority so that stranded gas, that stranded gas in the National Petroleum Reserve, can be transported to the lower 48. 
   It requires project labor agreements be entered into for construction of these pipelines so they would be good-paying American jobs. It requires that the trans-Alaska Pipeline, the NPR pipeline that connects, that is right here, a 5-mile segment connecting NPR over to the existing oil and gas leasing being done in the Prudhoe Bay area, that they be maintained and operated in an efficient manner to ensure an uninterrupted flow of oil and natural gas. And the DRILL Act reinstitutes the ban of the exportation of Alaskan oil to other countries so that this Alaskan oil, American oil, can be used by Americans for their relief.     
   It is a commonsense approach to our near-term energy woes. We know very clearly we must transition ourselves from oil dependency. We must wean ourselves from oil addiction. Alternative fuels, coal-to-liquids, carbon sequestration, other noncorn-based alternatives, renewables, all of the above should be on the table. It is the only way to secure America's energy independence from foreign crude. 
   But in the near term, we need to drill. We are saying in this bill today drill, drill, drill. Drill it now. Drill it here. Drill it where the oil is and where it is already available, not wait 20 years from now, as the President proposes to lift some moratorium on the OCS and up here in the ANWR that, as I have already said, won't affect any near-term relief at the pump for American consumers. 
   Let me observe that there are those who display a fundamental misunderstanding of parts of this legislation. We do of course incorporate the use it or lose it that has already been passed by a majority in this body which requires the diligent development of Federal oil and gas leases during their primary term, which is normally 10 years. What that means is during that period, we are requesting that the oil companies do something with these leases to explore for energy. If a discovery is made, and we hope that it will be, apply for the permit. 
   Now, I understand drilling. I think most of my colleagues know I am from the State of West Virginia, by golly, the great State of West Virginia. We know something about energy woes in that State. We are not a NIMBY State by any stretch of the imagination. We do not shirk from our responsibility to contribute to the Nation's need for energy. We have mining. We have drilling. 
   I understand that complications can take place while trying to develop a lease, environmental challenges, bureaucratic delays, but this constitutes due diligence. This constitutes the development of a lease. This constitutes moving toward meeting our energy woes. Diligent development does not mean the lease is producing, I understand that. It means that a company is doing something with the lease to determine whether it can be brought into production or not. That is a good thing. That is diligent development. 
   I understand it is a lengthy process, but I am saying to Mr. Big Oil, please do something on these leases. Do something. If you have to go out and buy a Black & Decker drill to drill it to move forward, do that. 
   Vote for this legislation. A vote for this legislation will mean that we are trying to bring energy immediately to the American people, that we are voting for American good-paying jobs, and that we are voting to prevent American energy from being exported to foreign markets. 
   As I conclude, I say, drill, drill, drill. Drill here. Drill now. Drill so we can meet our energy supply-side demands here with American resources. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   If he was listening to my opening statement and my earlier comments on this issue, I fully understand it's a lengthy process. The regulatory framework was put into place in this and many other laws of this land for a very specific reason, to protect the public health and safety and the environment. 
   It's a lengthy process to go through this leasing. I must tell the gentleman, and he knows it, once you obtain that lease you have overcome most of the hard obstacle of achieving production. The lands we are talking about are mostly lands already under lease. Therefore, a lot of that burden has already been overcome.

   But in regard to the issue of litigation lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits to which you refer, if I might respond. In regard to the NPRA, the National Petroleum Reserve, ConocoPhillips currently holds 183 leases up there making them one of the largest leaseholders. As of July 16, 2008, I believe that's yesterday, ConocoPhillips has told my staff, ``There are no lawsuits, litigation, on any ConocoPhillips leases in the NPRA nor have there been.''  
   According to several other sources, there are no lawsuits pending to stop lease sales, exploration, or development of the NPRA, the National Petroleum Reserve.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, the New River Gorge National River in southern West Virginia was designated as a unit of the National Park System in 1978. At times referred to as the ``Grand Canyon of the East,'' we in West Virginia refer to the Grand Canyon as the ``New River Gorge of the West.'' 
   The national river is comprised of over 70,000 acres of mostly rugged terrain and is renowned as a destination for its world-class whitewater recreation, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities. But it is also a place where generations of West Virginians have hunted and fished. 
   Unfortunately, the National Park Service, as part of the development of a new general management plan for the park unit, has included a no-hunting alternative. It is doing so because legislation which establishes the New River Gorge National River states that hunting ``may'' be permitted. 
   The enabling statute for the nearby Gauley River National Recreation Area, on the other hand, states that hunting ``shall'' be allowed. In fact, this is the case for the vast majority of the 62 units of the National Park System in which hunting is permitted. 
   The bill we are considering today simply changes the ``may'' to a ``shall'' in the law which established the New River Gorge National River. While there is no doubt in my mind that the current superintendent of this park unit will do the right thing and allow hunting to continue in the final general management plan, this is too important of an issue to remain at the discretion of future managers of the park unit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   To my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this measure, which would extend Federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, is long overdue. For over 115 years, this tribe has sought Federal recognition only. When Congress finally stepped in to take action on this matter, it was in the midst of the termination era, an era in which the Federal Government was in the process of terminating its relationship with existing federally recognized tribes. As a result, Congress recognized the Lumbee Tribe in 1956, but in the same breath it terminated its relationship with the tribe. 
   At no time has the Department of the Interior ever opposed Federal recognition for this tribe based on a belief that the Lumbees are not entitled to such status. Indeed, several studies undertaken by the Department of the Interior have consistently concluded that the Lumbees are a distinct, self-governing Indian community historically located on Drowning Creek, now the Lumber River, in North Carolina. 
   Although the State of North Carolina has recognized the tribe for over 100 years, it has done so under various names. The State of North Carolina, not the Lumbees, is responsible for the various names imposed upon the tribe. 
   It was not until the tribe pressured the State that the tribe was authorized to conduct a referendum to choose its own name. When it did so in 1951, it chose the name ``Lumbee Indians of North Carolina.'' This is the only name ever selected by the tribe, and it is this name by which Congress, in 1956, recognized the Lumbees. 
   Some have expressed a concern about the cost of this bill. I want to note that the cost of this bill is for discretionary programs only. There is no mandatory spending. Any actual cost of this bill is subject to appropriations. 
   Others have expressed concern that the size of the Lumbee Tribe will unduly impact the tribes in their districts. This is not a reason to single out the Lumbees. 
   The Lumbees are Indians organized as a tribe, and they deserve Federal recognition and access to the benefits and services in the same manner as other federally recognized tribes. Congress should not determine whether or not to honor its responsibilities to Indian tribes based on cost. 
   To address claims that the tribe is only interested in Federal recognition so they may conduct gaming, the tribe supported an outright gaming prohibition which has been included in this bill. The gaming prohibition precludes the Lumbee Tribe from engaging in, licensing, or regulating gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or any other Federal law. 
   Extending Federal recognition to the tribe at this time is not something new nor does it bypass the administrative process established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
   Congress first recognized the tribe in 1956. But because of our actions at that time, the tribe is not eligible for the administrative process. Congress is solely responsible for the injustice committed on this tribe. Now, after over 50 years, it is up to us to correct the wrong that Congress imposed so many years ago. 
   This legislation is sponsored by our colleague, Representative Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, and enjoys bipartisan support, including North Carolina Representatives BUTTERFIELD, ETHERIDGE, PRICE, COBLE, HAYES, MILLER and WATT. 
   I certainly commend Representative MIKE MCINTYRE of North Carolina for his dedication, his persistence, and his devotion to the Lumbee Indian Tribe. They have no better friend in the Congress of the United States. 
   I, too, am a cosponsor of H.R. 65; and I am pleased that Natural Resources ranking member, Mr. Don Young, is also a strong supporter. 
   Importantly, the Governor of North Carolina, Mike Easley, supports this measure, as do two former Governors, former Republican Governor Martin and former Democratic Governor Hunt. 
   The pending measure was reported by the Natural Resources Committee by a roll call vote of 24-7. 
   In closing, I again commend the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre) for his dedication to this issue. Through his tireless efforts, the bill before us today has 215 cosponsors. 
   So let us join in this effort to grant the Lumbee Tribe the recognition they  have long deserved. As Coach Kelvin Sampson, basketball coach at Indiana University noted in his testimony at our hearing, the Lumbees do not need our permission to call themselves Native American, but, unfortunately in today's world, they need our validation. It is up to us to do the right thing by extending Federal recognition to the tribe. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the pending measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, during general debate, I addressed the issue that is the subject of this motion, as did the ranking member, Mr. Young; as did the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre). The administrative process is for those groups where it needs to be determined whether or not they are an Indian tribe. That is not the case here.     
   Congress passed the Lumbee Recognition Act in 1956, 51 years ago, but in recognizing the tribe, Congress also made them ineligible for Federal services that are normally accorded to recognized tribes. Indeed, the 1956 Act also barred the Lumbee Tribe from going through the Federal acknowledgment process. And let me note that this tribe first sought Federal recognition in 1899, 108 years ago. To now subject them to a process that may take 20 more years is simply an injustice. 
   I urge rejection of this motion.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor Committee for yielding me this time, and commend him for his career, lifelong service of dedication to our working men and women of this country. Chairman George Miller has certainly shown over his career in this body that there is no person that will take a second seat to him as far as protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our working men and women. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are those who have argued on the other side that this measure, coming on the heels of major mine safety legislation in 2006, is too much too soon. They argue that the Mine Safety and Health Administration is struggling to fix numerous problems and must be allowed to implement one bill before additional legislative mandates are hefted upon them. 
   Now, that argument has a valid point. And yes, the industry is making strides to improve safety, especially in my home State of West Virginia. 
   But an equally valid argument can be made that the Congress should not simply sit back and hope that MSHA follows through on needed improvements. To do so would be to neglect our duty to serve as a check, and we must not return to the hands-off mentality that allowed MSHA to slip into its recent dismal state of decline. 
   This legislation seeks to return to MSHA the business of protecting our Nation's miners, plain and simple. This should be our overall goal. MSHA has strayed too far from its mission, and the MINER Act did not touch some challenges that most agree need to be addressed. This bill supports a course correction that now is taking place. It sets a high bar because its purpose is the highest: the protection of the lives of our coal miners. And in this regard, we can never be too vigilant when it comes to protecting the health and safety and well-being of our Nation's coal miners. 
   Most coal companies in my State work hard to ensure improved workplace safety, and they are making significant investment, for which they deserve commendation. Likewise, most of the employees of MSHA, including those in my home State, are well-intentioned, dedicated and hardworking. These individuals put their lives on the line to save other lives, and they should be recognized for that. 
   As well, my home State of West Virginia, above all others, has taken the challenge of improving mine conditions seriously. But none of this excuses the management of MSHA from doing its job, and it certainly does not excuse the Federal legislative branch from its responsibility to ensure that the senior Federal agency charged with the safety of our coal miners fulfills its statutory mission. 
   First and foremost, MSHA is supposed to inspect mines to ensure that they are abiding by the law to operate as safely as possible. That is its most fundamental job, its reason for existence. But yet, we found that MSHA last year failed to complete more than 40 percent of its required quarterly inspections in my own congressional district alone. That fact speaks most compellingly for the need for this legislation. 
   This bill would address that deadly lack of inspections at mines in southern West Virginia. It aims to provide for badly needed increases in the ranks of highly trained inspectors, including bringing experienced retirees back into service and directing limited resources into the field where they are needed most. 
   So given these conditions, Mr. Chairman, again I commend Chairman Miller and urge passage of this legislation.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this Republican substitute. 
   Pure and simple, the substitute kills the bill. It guts all of the bill's health and safety protections that the committee has worked so long and hard on and upon which the committee has heard expert testimony and heard testimony from our Nation's coal miners. So the fact that this legislation has been developed as it has shows that the committee has utmost in its consideration the protection of the health, safety and well-being of our Nation's coal miners. 
   This Republican substitute requires a one-size-fits-all mandatory drug testing program, for example, with a national blacklist of miners. It creates company dominated safety committees to stifle miners' voices; whereas, the committee bill, crafted as well as it has been, does allow for all sides to be represented in these safety committee deliberations. That is most important, because it is important that these committees have the involvement of coal miners that are on the job working, those who know the mines and the particular features of each mine, because, as we all know, not all coal mines are structured in the same fashion. 
   It is worthy to note as well that all of those that work in our Nation's mines, the United Mine Workers of America, the AFL, the Food and Commercial Workers, all of our Nation's unions that are concerned with the health and safety of our coal miners, oppose this Republican substitute amendment. 
   So, as I conclude, I say to my colleagues, just remember, this is an effort to gut the bill, pure and simple, and we all know that this bill still has a process through which it has to travel, including the other body. And if the administration cannot see in its wisdom and compassion to sign the bill, then certainly we have a basis upon which to proceed for further safety measures in the next Congress. I would urge rejection of this Republican substitute.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 1011, the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act, was introduced by my friend and neighboring colleague, Representative Rick Boucher. 
   The bill designates nearly 40,000 acres in the Jefferson National Forest as wilderness and nearly 12,000 acres as National Scenic Areas. These natural spaces represent some of the true wild gems of the Commonwealth of Virginia and my State of West Virginia. 
   H.R. 1011 is a strong bipartisan measure that is cosponsored by several other representatives from Virginia. H.R. 1011 also has broad support from Governor Tim Kaine, both Virginia Senators, four county boards of supervisors, local businesses, State organizations, hunters and faith groups. 
   Each of the areas within H.R. 1011 were either recommended for wilderness designation in the 2004 Jefferson National Forest Plan or have been endorsed by the local board of supervisors of the relevant county. All the areas of H.R. 1011 are located within the district of Representative Boucher, who has been a true leader and fighter for this legislation and deserves the commendation of us all. 
   All are located within his District, as I said, with the exception of a 555 wilderness-acre addition that I am proud to note is in my congressional district in Monroe County, West Virginia. Wilderness designation is not new to this portion of Virginia. In addition to designating six new wilderness areas, the legislation provides for additions to six existing wilderness areas. 
   The people of this area are well acquainted with wilderness, and H.R. 1011 reflects their desire to preserve these natural treasures. By designating wilderness, the Congress has long recognized that there are some places that should be left to the management of Mother Nature and that the all-knowing Creator's careful handiwork is something worth conserving and cherishing. 
   H.R. 1011 is a well-crafted and meritorious measure that has broad support for those who live in the area and their elected officials. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill in the House today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for yielding me the time and certainly commend him for his leadership as well as that of the full committee chairman, Mr. Obey. 
   Mr. Chairman, for over a decade while our Government lingered in Republican control, America's investment in itself, in those programs that provide for the most fundamental needs of our citizens, has been literally on the chopping block. As a result, Americans are coping with diminishing services and declining opportunities. Those programs that fall under the purview of the Natural Resources Committee, which I chair, are no exception. In fact, they have been particularly hard hit. As a result, our ability to preserve for future generations these unique places that are a rich part of America's past is diminishing. Our means of ensuring the thoughtful conservation and balanced development of our resources has been undercut. And our ability to protect our treasured natural vistas and irreplaceable wildlife has suffered mightily. 
   But this year we have turned the corner and that is due in large part, as I have said, because of the leadership of our distinguished appropriations Chair, Dave Obey, and the chairman of the Interior appropriations subcommittee, my classmate and dear friend, Norm Dicks. I thank and commend Chairman Dicks for his outstanding efforts on the bill before us today. It is a good bill, it's a great bill that will move us in a positive direction. 
   It is most remarkable for its differences from Interior bills of recent years. It has been a very long time since we have seen a bill that provides funding levels that come anywhere close to providing for the Nation's real and growing conservation needs. And while this bill is constrained by the government's overall budgetary limitations, it is an honest effort that provides needed nourishment to important accounts that were on a forced starvation diet. 
   I am particularly pleased and encouraged to see that Chairman Dicks has substantially increased funding for our national parks, these national treasures that hold a special place in the hearts of many Americans, but recent funding for them has not reflected their true value. This bill reverses years of disinvestment, helping to ensure that parks funding does not come at the expense of other programs. It also reverses a decline in staffing and visitor services, providing an increase in seasonal and permanent employees. 
   In addition, support is improved for the endangered species program and other accounts that are critical to saving God's creatures from extinction. This money will go a long way toward ensuring the Endangered Species Act is implemented as it was originally intended. 
   In what signals one of the most obvious and commendable departures from Republican priorities of recent years, this bill includes a 13 percent increase for the office of the Inspector General at Interior. That increase responds to the kinds of gross problems that I have been probing in our committee hearings this year with respect to Interior's inexcusable failure to collect moneys due the American people from Big Oil. 
   This appropriation measure also honors our Federal trust responsibilities to Native Americans. It restores badly needed dollars for the Indian Health Improvement Fund and the Urban Indian Health Care Program. It also recognizes, Mr. Chairman, the importance of the Indian Housing Improvement Program by ensuring that the program is not eliminated as the administration had proposed. The tribes have suffered under the bare-bones budget of recent years, but this bill thankfully attempts to set things back on the right course. 
   Finally, I am very encouraged to see funding increases for the long-neglected Land and Water Conservation Fund as well as for Payment in Lieu of Taxes. The stateside grants, in particular, have suffered greatly at the hands of the administration budget butchers.  
   Again, I commend Chairman Norm Dicks for crafting a serious appropriation bill that helps our Federal agencies conserve our natural and cultural heritage for generations to come, and I commend the ranking member, Mr. Todd Tiahrt, for his working with our chairman as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we know, the House is considering a part of the 100-hours agenda, H.R. 6, the Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation Act. 
   This legislation seeks to end the unwarranted tax breaks and subsidies which have been lavished on Big Oil over the last several years, and done so at a time of record prices at the gas pump and record oil industry profits. 
   Big Oil is hitting the American taxpayer not once, not twice, but three times. They are hitting them at the pump, they are hitting them at the Treasury through the Tax Code, and they are hitting them with royalty holidays put into oil in 1995 and again in 2005. 
   Meanwhile, our people back home stand in their work boots pumping precious, costly gas into their tanks, while energy lobbyists have scuttled about in Armani suits wanting more. 
   Indeed, over the last few years we have suffered an unprecedented assault on America's resources and on American taxpayer pockets under the guise of contributing to our energy security. It almost seems like Albert Fall's ghost walks the halls of the Interior Department. 
   Now, as you remember, Fall was the Secretary of the Interior who embroiled the administration of Warren Harding in the infamous Teapot Dome scandal. Without competitive bidding, Fall leased the Federal oil reserves at Teapot Dome and the Naval oil reserves at Elk Hills in exchange for $404,000 in gifts from the oilmen. In those days, that was a hefty sum of money, but a princely sum back in 1992. 
   Today, we have a situation at the Interior Department where the OCS oil and gas leasing program is hemorrhaging money as a result of unwarranted royalty relief, royalty underpayments, inadequate audits and potential fraud. The GAO and the Interior Department's Inspector General, Earl Devaney, in particular, have issued scathing reports on these matters. 
   Last year, in testimony before the House Government Reform Committee hearing on the bureaucratic bungling of oil and gas leases, Devaney went so far as to say: ``Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest level of the Department of the Interior.'' 
   This is no small matter. These are public resources. The names of every American are on the deeds to these public lands and waters where these drillings for oil and natural gas take place. Royalties from this production contribute a significant amount to the Treasury, nearly $8 billion in the last fiscal year, and it would be more if it were not for all the mismanagement at the Department of the Interior. 
   The pending legislation represents the beginning of the exorcism of Albert's Fall's ghost from the Interior Department by dealing with one egregious aspect of the OCS leasing program. I can assure my colleagues that the Natural Resources Committee will follow up with aggressive hearings into other areas of this program in the near future. 
   The situation that we seek to address in the pending bill, of course, harkens back to the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995, which Congress passed over the objections of many on this side of the aisle. That act sought to encourage oil companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico by allowing them to avoid paying royalties on oil and gas production of publicly owned resources. 
   As many of us warned at the time, this was nothing but an unwarranted giveaway of public resources, paying the companies to do what they would do anyway, drill for oil. To make matters worse, the Interior Department botched the administration of the law. They failed to include provisions in leases issued between 1998 and 1999 to cut off royalty relief when market prices are high. In other words, these leases did not contain any threshold, any threshold, for when royalty relief would kick in. According to GAO, the failure to include price cutoffs for royalty relief in the 1998-99 gulf leases could cost the Treasury up to $10 billion. H.R. 6 would fix these abuses. 
   The bill would establish thresholds in the 1998-1999 leases for royalty relief. The holders of these royalty-free leases would be required to either agree to negotiate with the Interior Department to pay royalties when market prices reach those thresholds, or pay a new conservation resource fee established in the bill. In addition, H.R. 6 would impose an annual per-acre fee on nonproducing OCS oil and gas leases. According to CBO, these provisions would raise $6.3 billion over 10 years, money that could be used to finance renewable and alternative energy initiatives. 
   There are two items that I would like to emphasize with respect to these provisions. First, this legislation is not violating any contractual arrangements. The leases in question were issued with a clause that allows the Federal Government to impose new requirements on them in the future, such  as the conservation resource fee being proposed in this bill. 
   Second, the House is already on record as supporting provisions of this nature. Provisions of this legislation as they relate to the OCS leases have been addressed by amendments offered in the past by MAURICE HINCHEY, ED MARKEY, RON KIND, and RA&#218;L GRIJALVA over the years. Further, the Jindal-Pombo OCS leasing bill that passed the House last year also included the imposition of a fee on the 1998 and 1999 royalty-free leases. So I would point out that none of the oil companies complained about their contracts being violated at that time. 
   Finally, H.R. 6 would repeal the extension of the original 1995 royalty relief provision that was contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and also reform several other royalty relief and special benefit provisions in that law. Amendments offered in the past by RON KIND and RA&#218;L GRIJALVA over the last two Congresses to various of our energy legislation attempted to strike these provisions. 
   So now, as I conclude, Mr. Speaker, it is time to stand up and be counted: to vote for the integrity of America's resources, to vote for the end of corporate welfare, to vote for a new dawn, a new era, in the management of our public energy resources. And that is to vote for H.R. 6. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Authorizations to go fish, yes. But hard-core appropriation dollars for clean coal technology, no. Thanks to my senior colleague in the other body, yes, we did that, but not through any actions of energy policy acts of this Congress in the past. 
   And, besides, how can we get anything from coal when we are so addicted to the oil diet? Because we give tax incentives and royalty holidays and other grants to the oil industry without any mention of coal in these pieces of legislation.

   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, in response to the declaration of the gentleman from Louisiana that this is a tax increase on the oil and gas industry, this bill is not a tax increase, I say to my colleagues. What we are doing is repealing subsidies, repealing royalties, and asking the oil and gas industry to pay their fair share. There is no tax increase whatsoever in this bill. 
   The meat and potatoes of this legislation, H.R. 6, came through our Natural Resources Committee. It was drafted by our committee in consultation with the leadership. This committee is the same committee chaired in a previous Congress by our former colleague, Chairman Richard Pombo. Much of the legislation in this bill, H.R. 6, has been debated, has had hearings held therein, and has even been voted upon by the House of Representatives in the previous Congress. 
   So I would suggest to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to go back and look at those votes that were held in a previous Congress in order to be consistent today. 
   For example, the new conservation fee of $9 per barrel that is set up in this bill if the companies choose to pay no royalties. That was set up in the Jindal-Pombo bill of the last session of Congress and supported by a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   Reference has been made to these notorious leases of 1998 and 1999, where the American taxpayers got socked the most; that these were instituted and allowed to take place under the Clinton administration. True, President Clinton was President of the United States at that time. But I would also remind my colleagues who make this charge that in 2000 we elected President George Bush as President of the United States, and the last time I looked at the calendar, this is 2007. Six years with no action by the current Department of the Interior to correct these abuses. And, I might say, until December 31 of this year, Republicans controlled the Congress as well, yet no action was taken. 
   So what we are doing here is an attempt to correct mistakes, correct bungling by the Department of the Interior, mismanagement, whatever word you want to call it, on these 1998-1999 leases where there were no royalties collected, where the price of oil has certainly gone above the threshold that was established in the 1995 Deep Royalty Relief Act, again passed by a Republican Congress, and which was overlooked in the implementation and collection on these 1998-1999 leases. 
   To those who charge that we are breaching contracts today, there is ample precedent and reservation of power in the U.S. to impose fees for the conservation of resources both in the  statute in the Outer Continental Lands Act, and reserved specifically in the leases that are issued in the Gulf of Mexico. Again, these leases issued in 1998 and 1999 are royalty free regardless of market, and that is when we impose this conservation fee passed by the Republican Congress in the past but failed to be enacted into law. So we have set ample precedent here. 
   As I conclude, let me say that I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan fashion, as we have voted before on this legislation, to pass H.R. 6 for the sake of the American taxpayers. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McDermott.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I wish to commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), for his excellent leadership on this issue. He is the sponsor of it. I rise as chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources to lend my strong support thereto. 
   The National Landscape Conservation System was administratively established 8 years ago. It is comprised of Western public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management that have been placed in conservation status either by presidential proclamation or by acts of Congress. 
   The BLM refers to the NLCS as ``Landscapes of the American Spirit.'' And the agency is enthusiastic about this system. And rightly so because it works. It works to highlight some of the unique features of these lands, and it helps BLM shed its imagine of simply being the Bureau of Livestock and Mining. 
   The pending legislation is supported by the Bush administration. I know that may raise some suspicion in certain quarters, but I can assure those of my colleagues who may have reservations with the bill due to this fact that the Natural Resources Committee has thoroughly examined the legislation. And under Chairman Grijalva's leadership, I'm here to assure you that there are no hidden provisions of this legislation to grow even more oil rigs on our already pressed public lands or to overthrow past presidential proclamations creating national monuments. This bill is a congressional stamp of approval of the existing NLCS system. 
   Each of the 850 or so areas that are part of this system came into it through different avenues. Many were designated by Congress as wilderness areas or national wild and scenic rivers, national conservation areas, or national historic and scenic trails. Others were designated by Presidents as national monuments under the Antiquities Act. As such, each element of the NLCS carries with it its own management regime. There is no one size fits all. The pending legislation does not change that.  
   And to make that point crystal clear, the bill contains a savings clause. It is a sweeping savings clause stating that nothing in this legislation enhances, diminishes, or modifies any law or proclamation under which the various components of the NLCS were established. 
   Later during debate on this bill, an amendment will be offered by the floor manager, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), which will further elaborate on the savings clause by specifying nothing in this legislation can impede Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues to support that amendment. In addition, there will be an amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. JASON ALTMIRE, to further elaborate on the savings clause as it relates to hunting, fishing, trapping, and recreational shooting that may take place on NLCS lands. This is a constructive amendment and one which we worked with my good friends at the National Rifle Association, and I urge my colleagues to support that amendment as well. 
   There are other amendments which fall under the category of putting forth a solution in search of a problem which simply does not exist, and I would urge opposition to those amendments. 
   So in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the bill and again commend the gentleman from Arizona for managing it on the floor today, for his sponsorship, and his valuable leadership.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, scripture tells us, ``David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader.'' Throughout the war in Iraq, the President has failed to adequately consult with the American people and their Congress or other countries in the region whose best interests are also served by a stable Iraq. He has long recognized that staying the course in Iraq is not working, yet he stubbornly stays the course. 
   The Congress has a duty to make sure once sent into harm's way for good cause, our troops are equipped and supplied with everything necessary to accomplish a given mission. The Congress has an equal duty to change or end a given mission, when circumstances, realities and rationales demand it. 
   We in Congress want to work with him to bring our troops home from a more stable  Iraq. We should not only ensure that the people are given a full accounting of what the President is expecting of our troops in the coming months, and how much it will cost our Treasury, but we must also demand accounting of what the war in Iraq has cost the U.S., and our men and women in uniform, over the last four years.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS COVENANT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3079, a bill which would extend U.S. immigration laws to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and also authorize a non-voting Delegate from the Northern Marianas to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   At the start of the 110th Congress, as the Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, I set out an agenda which included revisiting the CNMI's control and enforcement over immigration policy. Many in this House will recall that for at least two decades, our government and this Congress expressed our concerns with how immigration policy in the CNMI was envisioned and implemented. 
   When the Northern Marianas was transitioned from being a trust territory of the United Nations to a U.S. territory under our stars and stripes, temporary control over immigration and minimum wage laws were placed in the hands of the new local government. This was done in light of their small, mostly indigenous, population and their undeveloped economy. Their control was never meant to be a permanent fixture of their government. 
   Throughout the 1990s the CNMI economy grew by taking advantage of its control over immigration and wage policy. A garment industry, much of it owned by nationals of China, saw fit to make the CNMI their new home. In so doing, the industry was able to fill practically every position in their operations with a foreign worker at a minimal cost to their operations. 
   In 2000, garment exports from the CNMI to the U.S. were estimated to be worth about $1 billion annually. To support this industry, the U.S. Census estimated the foreign guest worker population at 40,000 outnumbering the local population by at least 10,000 and because of lax protections of foreign guest workers under CNMI law many were subject to abuses by their employers. Much of this abuse had been documented by our national media, human rights organizations, and our Committee's former Chairman GEORGE MILLER. 
   In that decade of the 90s and into the 21st century, despite the clear need to reform the system in the CNMI, any attempts at extending U.S. 
   immigration law or minimum wage laws were met with resistance in Congress. 
   I loathe thinking that Members of this body would want such a system to flourish. Or that anyone would view what occurred in the CNMI as an economic experiment, grown in a ``petri dish'' because of the CNMI's distance and relative isolation from the U.S. mainland. 
   Mr. Speaker, with the enactment of H.R. 3079, the dismal and degrading decade of the 90's will be put to rest--never to repeat itself again. 
   H.R. 3079 would also authorize a non-voting Delegate from the CNMI to be a Member of the House of Representatives. In previous Congresses, similar legislation has passed the Natural Resources Committee more than once and with broad bipartisan support. This goodwill and collaboration has continued in this Congress with the inclusion of the Northern Mariana Island Delegate Act as Title II of H.R. 3079. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentle lady from the Virgin Islands, Mrs. Christensen, for her leadership throughout this process. As the chairman of Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, she took on this very complex issue at the start of this Congress. Her Subcommittee has been very active on this issue and made every attempt to address concerns raised by different interests in the CNMI before bringing this legislation to the Floor. 
   I would also like to thank the leadership of the Judiciary Committee who collaborated with us on this legislation. We do appreciate their involvement with this bill and their constructive input as we prepared to have it considered under the suspension calendar. 
   I support H.R. 3079 and urge its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (THOMASINA E. JORDAN INDIAN TRIBES OF VIRGINIA FEDERAL RECOGNITION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle I would observe that this is one of those rare moments in this body when history itself seems to hold its breath. 
   We are here today 400 years after the first English settlers landed in what became Jamestown, Virginia, to finally acknowledge a government-to-government relationship with some of the Indian tribes who greeted those early settlers. Reflect upon that for a moment. The ancestors of the members of these Indian tribes were there 400 years ago at Jamestown and facilitated the very founding and early development of this Nation. Spanning the entire history of this Nation, they have been here, and they have endured extreme adversity. 
   These Indian tribes have taken part in ceremonies with the visiting Queen of England commemorating this 400th anniversary of the establishment of Jamestown, and they are a vital part of the official activities continuing this week. 
   I can think of no better time than this week for Congress to step up to its responsibility by using its constitutional authority to acknowledge these Indian tribes. Simply put, the pending legislation would extend Federal recognition to six Indian tribes located within the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
   It is sponsored by our colleague Jim Moran of Virginia and enjoys bipartisan support, including Virginia Representatives Bobby Scott, Jo Ann Davis and Tom Davis. I, too, am a cosponsor of H.R. 1294, and I am pleased that the Natural Resources ranking republican member with us today, Mr. Don Young, is also a strong supporter. 
   Importantly, both former Virginia Governors George Allen and Mark Warner, as well as current Governor Tim Kaine, have endorsed the tribes' recognition and status as sovereign governments. The Virginia Council of Churches supports the measure as well. 
   The authority to recognize a government-to-government relationship with an Indian tribe is a very solemn one for the Congress. It is necessary in this case because the members of these six tribes have faced hundreds of years of discrimination, abuse, and outright attempts to extinguish their very existence and rob them of their heritage. 
   From 1912 to 1947, Dr. Walter Plecker, a white supremacist, set out to rid the Commonwealth of Virginia of any records that proved the existence of Indians or Indian tribes. He was instrumental in ensuring passage of the Racial Integrity Act in 1924, making it illegal for individuals to classify themselves or their newborn children as ``Indian.'' But it went further than that, spending decades changing the race designation on birth certificates and other legal documents from ``Indian'' to ``colored,'' ``Negro,'' or ``free issue.'' Throughout it all, the Virginia Indians did not break, but they held firm to their culture and to their identity. 
   I would note that this bill is named for Thomasina ``Red Hawk Woman'' Jordan, whose lifelong pursuit of advancing Native American rights encompassed ensuring the promise of education for all Indians and securing Federal recognition of Virginia Indian tribes. 
   The pending measure was reported by the Natural Resources Committee by voice vote. 
   To address claims that the tribes are only interested in Federal recognition so that they may conduct gaming, all six tribes supported an outright gaming prohibition which was included in this bill. This gaming prohibition precludes the Virginia tribes from engaging in, licensing or regulating gambling pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act on their lands. 
   In closing, I would like to pay special homage to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) who has spent several years tirelessly working to achieve Federal recognition for Virginia's First Americans. He, Representative Bobby Scott and others I mentioned, Tom Davis and Jo Ann Davis, have been before our Committee on Natural Resources and testified on this issue, and I salute their superb leadership as well. 
   It is because of this dedication to this issue that this legislation is before us today during this historic occasion marking the 400th anniversary of Jamestown. It is time to put this issue to rest and do the right thing by extending Federal recognition to these tribes. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the pending measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today this body is considering responsible legislation aimed at compelling the oil industry to do what it should do best, drill for oil and bring relief to Americans at the pumps. 
   That may seem like an odd notion, and certainly we will hear criticism from our Republican colleagues who continue to coddle Big Oil and pander to the industry's political agenda. And there are many in the industry who will not want to hear this side of the aisle say we are for drilling for oil. My approach is slightly different. Big Oil does not need to be coddled, it needs a swift kick in the backside. 
   While Democrats in Congress know that we cannot drill our way to energy independence and continue to advocate for the development of alternative fuels and increased energy conservation, we also know that we must increase our supply of oil in the interim. I repeat; in this legislation we are not against drilling for oil. That is why today, with this legislation, we are saying ``Drill it or lose it.'' 
   The Federal Government makes vast swaths of public lands, both onshore and underlying the Gulf of Mexico, available for oil and gas development. What we are finding, however, is that the industry is stockpiling these oil and gas leases. At present, 68 million acres of Federal lands are being held by oil and gas companies with no production occurring on these leases. That acreage is equal to the size of Colorado. 
   Considering today's oil prices, you would think that they would either diligently develop that acreage, bring any oil found into production, or relinquish the leases. The pending legislation would require this diligent development during the term of an oil and gas lease, and if it does not occur, the  leaseholder would not be allowed to lease even more Federal lands. It's simple, ``use it or lose it,'' and allow another company to make a go at that leased land. 
   Obviously, we have a much better chance to bring relief at the pump by producing oil on Federal lands already held by the oil companies much quicker than having to go through the environmental lawsuits of leasing and permitting required if we were to take the President's method and just open up OCS and ANWR immediately. We have a much better chance, Mr. Speaker, to help Americans grapple with the high cost of fuel by drilling in those Federal lands and waters already open to development. 
   Over 80 percent of estimated oil and gas resources on Federal lands, both onshore and offshore, are available for development or will be shortly, pending the completion of planning documents. The amount of oil which could be produced from these areas represents 14 years of current domestic oil consumption. Think about that, 14 years; yet President Bush and his Republican allies continue to rally behind the oil industry's political agenda, advocating opening more of America's Federal land, including coastal areas and pristine environmental areas, to drilling. 
   In response to this scheme I say to Big Oil and its allies, ``You've got 'em. Use 'em.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. I'm glad my colleague from West Virginia answered the previous speaker on the Republican side and explained the bill. But let me further clarify what the bill does and does not do, and current law. 
   Currently, the law allows leaseholders 10 years to develop oil or gas. Our bill used to cut it down to 5 years. We have now upped it back up to the 10 years to try to satisfy some of the critics concerned with this legislation. Yet, they are still not pleased, of course. 
   Existing leases can be cancelled if leaseholders fail to comply with lease provisions, such as public safety and environmental requirements. Yet, there's no law or regulation that requires diligent development on Federal oil and gas leases. That is what we are doing here, is requiring this due diligence. As long as the leaseholders paid the required annual rental fee, the government cannot compel diligent development of the leased lands. 
   Our bill requires oil and gas operators to diligently develop oil and gas leases, as is currently required of coal leaseholders, I might remind my colleague from West Virginia. We had this same regime in place for Federal coal leasing. It was put in place when coal was in its boom days. 
   What we are doing for oil and gas now is what we have done with coal and other commodities that are produced on the land that the people of the United States own.

   A comprehensive energy policy is something that this Congress will address using in a bipartisan fashion the talents of this body and the talents of American ingenuity and willpower. 
   This pending legislation is a responsible bill that seeks to say to the oil companies: Use what you already have or show where you are moving toward producing that oil; otherwise, give somebody else a chance that may want to competitively bid on that same lease. 
   This is a use it or lose it. And I urge a ``yes'' vote for this responsible piece of legislation.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year's fire season in California started in unprecedented fashion, when 1,700 fires erupted in a 48-hour period beginning June 21. Already, just over 3 weeks later, fires have burned more than 960 square miles in California. 
   And as of yesterday afternoon, 330 fires were still actively burning there, when citizens received the ominous warning that conditions are right for, as the National Weather Service described it, ``explosive fire growth.'' 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Big Sur, Santa Barbara County, and other areas up and down the coast, who are experiencing devastating wildfires as we speak. 
   Those California fires are only the most recent example of the dramatic and tragic expansion of our Nation's wildland fire season. For the last decade, the United States has experienced a growth in the destructive nature of fire seasons that have taken American lives, eliminated homes and businesses, and scorched thousands of acres of our treasured public lands.  
   And this is not only occurring in the West. I well recall several years ago when the New River Gorge in my home State of West Virginia was burning. I had the honor to meet with Federal firefighters who flew in from across the country to battle the blazes. 
   Indeed, the Federal Government has, time and time again, answered the call and mobilized legions of brave firefighters to beat back the flames and protect our lands and our communities. 
   But as a result, the government has also dramatically shifted spending priorities, rapidly increasing funding for fire fighting, while axing moneys for other necessary programs. And ironically, some of those programs that have been gutted were created to actually prevent fires. 
   There is little reason to hope that fire seasons for the foreseeable future will be any less catastrophic than those of the last decade. The trend has certainly been working toward more destruction. Knowing that, we must be better prepared. 
   The FLAME Act, which my colleagues Mr. Ra&#250;l Grijalva, Mr. Norm Dicks and myself introduced, is an effort to correct course, to get out in front at the start of these fire seasons. 
   The bill has received broad, bipartisan support from 56 Members of Congress, including the ranking member of our Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Young. 
   As well, it enjoys the support of the five former Chiefs of the Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters, the National Association of Counties, the National Federation of Federal Employees, the Western Governors' Association, and nearly 40 other organizations. 
   Within the Forest Service, wildland fire activities now account for approximately 48 percent of the agency's budget, causing the Service to cut back on other important programs to cover the escalating costs of fire suppression. 
   The FLAME Act would help to address that funding problem, as well as the funding issues faced by other Federal agencies that are contributing funds from their limited accounts to fight these fires. 
   The Act would establish a dedicated Federal fund for catastrophic, emergency wildland fire suppression activities, separate from appropriated agency fire fighting funding. 
   The bill would also require the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to present to Congress a long-overdue, comprehensive strategy for combating wildland fire, a strategy that would address the troubling shortcomings in the agencies' response to fires as identified by the Government Accountability Office and the Agriculture Department's Inspector General. 
   I cannot overstate the importance of today's action on the FLAME Act. Without a doubt, this is one of the most serious issues facing our Federal land management agencies, and it is one that, if not addressed properly and appropriately, will continue to cost homes, businesses, communities, public lands, and American lives. 
   The FLAME Act will allow the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to respond to these dangerous fires while also accomplishing other important aspects of their missions, including those that will prevent fires from devastating our communities in the future. 
   I ask my colleagues to support passage of the FLAME Act. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, since June 20, 2008, as we have heard the distinguished Speaker tell us, there have been 1,781 wildfires in the State of California, over 600,000 acres of land have burned, and there are 323 fires still burning in the State.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. I thank my colleague from California (Ms. Woolsey) for yielding and for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   I also can sympathize and empathize with what my colleagues Mr. Matheson and Mr. Bishop and Mr. Cannon have said and the experience through which they have been the last month or longer.  
   Mr. Speaker, coal mining is a dangerous occupation. Many of these individuals, these brave, courageous individuals that work in coal fields across our Nation and especially those in the Appalachian coal fields that I have the honor of representing will go to work before the sun comes up. They will not see their loved ones again until after the sun has gone down. They will do this for 5, 6, even 7 days a week, never seeing the light of day so that our Nation, as the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon) has said, will be able to have light, so that those in the big cities who automatically turn on their air conditioning and their lights every morning can reflect on from where that power comes. 
   We in West Virginia have known our share of tragedies, and it is unfortunate that when we look back over the history of our mine safety laws in this Nation that it has taken a tragedy for the Congress to act. It is unfortunate that every mine safety and health law on the books today is written with the blood of our Nation's coal miners. Congress has responded. We did respond, as has been referred to already, in passing the MINER Act after the West Virginia disasters of Sago and Aracoma in my district, and I hope that we will respond again. 
   The gentlewoman from California has referred to the mine safety legislation introduced by the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Miller, and myself and several other Members of Congress in a bipartisan fashion. This builds upon the MINER Act that this Congress passed and, yes, President Bush signed into law. While I agree we do not know the causes of this latest disaster and we know a little more about the causes of the West Virginia disasters over a year ago, it is important that we take a look at those responsible for enforcing our mine safety laws in this country, those at MSHA, currently serving under a recess appointment director. And it is important that we beef up that agency, that we do all we can within this Congress's power to give them the morale, the authority, and the knowledge that they must enforce our mine safety laws without fears of retribution, that there cannot be the cozy relationships that perhaps have existed in the past between those who inspect our mines and those who operate our mines. That relationship, if it has existed, must no longer exist. 
   But that is getting into what comes down the pipe later on. What we are here today to do is to praise those miners that lost their lives, all of our Nation's coal miners, in fact, and to pray for their families. We also especially recognize those three brave individuals that went into the bowels of this Earth to try to rescue and find their friends and their fellow workers and lost their lives in the process of trying to save other lives, those mine rescuers. That tragedy was most unfortunate and only made the original tragedy that much worse. 
   So I join with my colleagues in offering our prayers, in offering our sympathies to the families of the lost miners as well as the rescuers because myself, having spent time with coal miners' families while they wait word from below as to the fate of their loved ones, it is a cruel experience that no individual should have to experience. But, unfortunately, unless the Congress acts and even when we do act, it may yet occur again because mining is a dangerous occupation.

   Madam Speaker, I rise with all Americans, and indeed with most of the civilized world, in marking the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and in doing so, remember the thousands of innocent Americans who lost their lives that day, and extend the Nation's highest prayers to their families, friends, and loved ones. I thank God for the freedom which Americans enjoy, a freedom for which American lives were lost. 
   Like so many of my colleagues, I attended a dedication ceremony this morning of the 9/11 Memorial at the Pentagon, where I joined Huntington, West Virginia, residents Dr. Ken and Sharon Ambrose, whose son, Dr. Paul Ambrose, was one of the 184 lives lost in the Pentagon on that American Airlines Flight 77 during that fateful day of September 11, 2001. 
   Indeed, Dr. Paul Ambrose was the first name called this morning when the bells were rung for each of the victims at the Pentagon. The viewing of his memorial, so beautifully etched in the grounds of the Pentagon, will truly bless his memory eternally. 
   This ceremony and countless others around the Nation today continue to remind us that freedom does not come free. Thousands of Americans--first responders, military service, and Guard members, law enforcement personnel, medical personnel, volunteers--continue this very day to devote themselves day in and day out to protecting the innocent in times of disaster and tragedy, risking their own lives to do so. 
   Over the last 7 years, thousands of Americans, both in and out of government, have worked tirelessly to improve the security of our Nation. Much progress has been made, but more work remains to be done. Our number one duties as Members of Congress, of course, are to protect the people of this country and to ensure that such a terrible tragedy never happens again. As we move forward, we all will work hard to continue to keep our homeland secure and to seek out and defeat terrorist organizations around the world. 
   I thank the gentleman again for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (CARL SANDBURG HOME NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE BOUNDARY REVISION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to commend the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Grijalva, the respected chairman of the Subcommittee on Parks, Forests and Public Lands, for his efforts in managing the bill on the floor today and bringing this legislation before us. 
   I, of course, do rise in support of H.R. 1100, introduced by one of our newest colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee, a very respected member of our committee, Representative HEATH SHULER. I commend Mr. Shuler for his work on this legislation as well as his dedication to his constituents, who stand firmly behind this bill to protect and interpret a local resource that has national importance. Some may call it pork. Whatever you want. But the last time I checked, we are the people's House of Representatives. We represent the people that sent us here. And perhaps because Mr. Shuler is doing such an effective job of that, it raises the ire of some in this body. But he has worked diligently to guide this bill through the legislative process. I applaud him for those efforts. 
   Carl Sandburg was an American poet, a biographer, novelist, and songwriter. Today the farm he owned is preserved as the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, managed by the National Park Service for all Americans to visit and learn about the life and works of one of America's most beloved authors. 
   During the 22 years Sandburg spent at the farm until his death in 1967, he published more than ten volumes of poetry and prose, including a novel and an autobiography. And it was this farm he returned to after winning his second Pulitzer Prize in 1951. 
   The pending measure is important to the future protection and interpretation of the Sandburg farm. The 115-acre boundary adjustment will allow for the construction of a much-needed visitor center and parking lot. As important, the boundary adjustment will provide the opportunity to protect the views  from the Sandburg estate that the author and his family cherished and that today's visitors so richly enjoy. 
   The State of North Carolina's Department of Cultural Resources has recognized the importance of protecting the views from Sandburg's estate by purchasing 22 acres within the proposed boundary expansion area. They intend to donate these acres to the National Park Service upon authorization of the boundary adjustment. All of the other affected landowners have agreed to have their properties included within the proposed boundary adjustment. 
   This is a straightforward bill, as the chairman of the subcommittee has said. It enjoys bipartisan support, and I urge that it be approved by all of our colleagues on the House floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 249 is important legislation with broad, bipartisan support. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by my colleague, the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Ed Whitfield, and a number of other Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   This Congress is tasked with the stewardship of much that is invaluable, our breathtaking natural wonders, our healthy rivers and streams, icons of American history; and it is our responsibility as public stewards of our land to manage these resources for the good of future generations. It is a responsibility as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee that I take very seriously. 
   The proper care and preservation of wild horses which roam public lands in the West fall within our stewardship, and we are failing to live up to our responsibility. I say that because in 1971 Congress formally protected these wild horses and mandated that they cannot be sold or processed into commercial products, in effect, slaughtered.     
   Since that time when the Bureau of Land Management has determined that the wild horse population is excessive to the ability of the range to support them, captured animals have been offered to the public through adoption. 
   But all that changed as a result of a rider tucked away into a massive omnibus appropriation bill enacted during December 2004. 
   The so-called Burns rider overturned 33 years of national policy on the care and management of wild horses and burros by repealing the prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of these animals that had been in law. In effect, Mr. Chairman, these animals were earmarked for death. 
   Since that time, some of these animals, which belong to all Americans I might add, and which represent the very spirit of the American West, have been rounded up for slaughter and shipped overseas. 
   And to what end? So their meat can end up on menus in France, Belgium and Japan, where it is considered a delicacy. 
   Incredible. It is truly and simply incredible. We do not allow the commercial sale of horseflesh in this country for human consumption, but we are exporting horse meat for that very purpose abroad. 
   Since I first introduced this legislation during the last Congress, I have received an impressive volume of heartfelt letters and e-mails from across the Nation. 
   The very notion that wild horses, wild American horses, would be slaughtered as a food source for foreign gourmets has struck a chord with the American people. They see in this issue the pioneering spirit and the ideals of freedom. And the current policy has created disillusionment with many over how their government works and what their elected leaders stand for. 
   The measure we are now considering will halt that practice. The sale and slaughter of wild horses and burros must stop not only because it is wrong, but also because the program is a failure. 
   While the Bureau of Land Management, the Federal agency which oversees the program, may sincerely hope that these animals do not end up on menus in France or Japan or Belgium, the Burns rider severely handicaps efforts to protect these herds. 
   Now, some will say the sale authority is necessary because the agency costs of managing the program have grown too high, but this is an issue of the BLM's own making. Each year they round up more animals than can be adopted. The excess animals are sent to holding facilities where their numbers simply increase per year, year after year, driving up management costs. If the agency wants to save money without selling these animals, it needs only to get its round-ups and adoptions in sync. 
   There are also those who say we need to allow these animals to be sold off because there are too many of them on the public lands and they are causing massive resource damage. 
   First of all, it should be noted that there are significantly fewer wild horses and burros on public lands today than there were just 25 years ago. 
   Second, compared to the 3 to 4 million cattle that graze these same acres, wild horses and burros are hardly the most serious threat to our public rangelands. 
   All I seek to do in this legislation, with H.R. 249, is to return the law to the way it existed for 33 years prior to the Burns rider. The House has twice gone on record supporting a prohibition on the commercial sale and slaughter of wild horses and burros. 
   So I conclude by asking my colleagues' support once again today. It's time to do right by these living icons of the American West. 
   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, in response to several arguments that have been brought up about BLM's management of these lands and the cost of the program, I would respond that if there is a cost problem with the management of wild horses and burros, it is one, as I said in my opening remarks, of the BLM's own making. 
   Each year the Bureau of Land Management rounds up more animals than can be adopted. The excess animals are then sent to holding facilities, where their numbers increase year after year. That drives up the cost of the program. If the BLM wants to save more money, then as I've said, it needs only to get its round-ups and its adoptions in sync. There are ways other than the sale and slaughter of wild horses to save money. For example, a 2004 USGS study found that in the wild, use of contraceptive measures alone would save $7.7 million. So I don't think we should blame the wild horses and the burros for BLM's mismanagement of the program. 
   And as far as the map the gentleman from Utah presented about where these lands exist, that's true, they exist out West. But it's also true that the title to these lands is in the holding of every American taxpayer, as they are the lands of the public, and our names are on that deed for these lands. 
   I would note also, in conclusion, that on a similar amendment to last year's Interior appropriation bill, in which language was written to prohibit any such funds, the amendment did pass the House of Representatives by a vote of 249-159, and on this side of the aisle, the majority today, there were only 19 noes on that particular amendment to the Interior appropriation bill. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to vote ``aye,'' again, to help us protect an icon of the American West, and to provide for the humane consideration and treatment of these wild horses and burros.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Price of Georgia amendment. The gentleman is attempting to put PAYGO requirements on a bill that neither authorizes nor contains any spending. I repeat that. The gentleman is attempting to put PAYGO provisions on a bill that neither authorizes nor contains any spending. 
   H.R. 249 merely returns the law the way it existed for 33 years prior to changes made in the law by an appropriations writer in 2004. Both the CBO and the Budget Committee have determined that there are no PAYGO implications with H.R. 249. 
   What the gentleman from Georgia is proposing to do is an unnecessary, unwise addition to the legislation. He has attempted it many times before. It has been rejected by the Homeland Security many times before. Those times include identical amendments to H.R. 569 and H.R. 700 which were considered by the House in March, and in both cases the House rejected the Price amendments, the first time by a vote of 166-260, and the second time by a vote of 176-256. 
   So again, I repeat, there should be no PAYGO requirements because it neither authorizes nor contains any spending. 
   I would urge the House to reject this unwise and unnecessary amendment.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, first, I will respond to the gentleman from Georgia that this was an open rule. All Members knew that, and I cannot understand why the gentleman would not have offered this as an amendment during the normal process of legislative consideration of this bill. Instead, he comes at the last moment in the recommittal, which is true to his nature on previous legislation that has passed this body. 
   The gentleman's motion to recommit would change the effective date until 60 days after the date on which the Secretary of the Interior certifies to Congress that the long-term care of all unsold wild horses and burros as a result of this act does not exceed $500,000 annually. There is no time limit placed on that period during which the Secretary of the Interior has to certify. I am assuming that the gentleman is entrusting the same Federal agency, the Bureau of Land Management, that has so mismanaged this whole process in the beginning, entrusting with that agency the same responsibility to do such certification. Again, there is no time limit. It could be 30 days, it could be 30 years, it could be 300 years before the Secretary so certifies. 
   So the amendment is purely a killer amendment. The Members know that is the intent of the gentleman from Georgia, and I would urge its rejection. 
   In addition, as I have emphasized so many times on this bill, there is no PAYGO issue with this bill. The CBO estimated that the administrative cost of this bill is less than $500,000. 
   Third, the impact of this amendment is to allow slaughter for another 60 days, at the minimum, but more likely, indefinitely, as I said, because there is no time limit on the certification procedure stated in the motion to recommit. There is no time frame. The certification is open-ended. We have no idea as to how long that process will take. 
   Again, I respond to the gentleman from Georgia, this is a killer amendment. Every Member that voted against the previous amendment and has voted for this legislation in the past knows that is such. 
   I would urge opposition to the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 505, the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. Without the hard work, dogged determination, persistence and leadership of our colleagues from Hawaii, we would not be where we are today on this legislation. Indeed, Mr. NEIL ABERCROMBIE has been at this for many years, and it is because of his dedication to his people that I have also agreed to strongly support this bill. I also want to commend MAZIE HIRONO for her work, and the entire delegation deserves words of praise for their leadership. 
   This bill has been years in the making and Mr. Abercrombie, in particular, never failed to take every opportunity to educate and encourage the rest of us on the need for this important legislation. 
   H.R. 505 would establish a process by which the Native Hawaiian governing body would be reorganized and the political and legal relationship with the United States would once again be reaffirmed. 
   Starting in 1920, Congress began passing legislation specifically for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. To date, over 160 laws have been enacted authorizing Native Hawaiian participation in government programs ranging from housing to the repatriation of Hawaiian bones from our Nation's museums. 
   Recent court challenges have necessitated the need for this legislation to codify a government-to-government relationship with the indigenous peoples of Hawaii. Simply put, this legislation will finally bring parity to the way the United States relates to Indian tribes, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. 
   I will tell you a bit about what H.R. 505 does not do: 
   It does not allow for gaming of any kind. It does not provide for additional land to be transferred to Native Hawaiians. It does not change any current civil or criminal jurisdiction by the State or Federal Government.     
   It does not provide for any new eligibility for Native Hawaiians into Indian programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress's authority to address the conditions of the aboriginal indigenous people, regardless of how organized, stems from our United States Constitution. In recognition of this authority, we passed similar legislation in the House under the suspension of the rules during the 106th Congress. My committee, the Committee on Natural Resources, has passed similar legislation three times, each time with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   We need to make a clear statement. We need to pass H.R. 505 overwhelmingly, and I would urge all my colleagues to vote ``yea'' on this important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, according to the American Bar Association, ``The right of Native Hawaiians to use of property held in trust for them and the right to govern those assets is not in conflict with the equal protection clause since it rests on independent constitutional authority regarding the rights of native nations contained within articles I and II of the Constitution.'' 
   The ABA further adds, ``Our courts have upheld Congress' power to recognize indigenous nations and has specifically recognized that this power includes the power to re-recognize nations whose recognition has been compromised in the historical past.'' 
   Indeed, I would note that this body, the Congress, has recognized 530 of the 561 federally recognized Indian tribes. It is clear that we have this power and this authority and that is simply what we are doing today with respect to Native Hawaiians. 
   I again want to commend the delegation from Hawaii, Mr. Abercrombie and Ms. Hirono, for the work that they have put into this legislation. I commend our Committee on Natural Resources and the staff that have worked so hard to, once again, bring this effort to the floor of the House in a nonpartisan, bipartisan piece of legislation. I join my colleague from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) in hoping that the motion to recommit is not offered by the gentleman from Arizona. But should it be offered, then I hope my colleagues will certainly recognize that what we are attempting to prevent by arguing against that motion is a discrimination against Native Hawaiians. And we are asking that we treat them no differently than other Indians. 
   I would close by again urging my colleagues to join, once again, in supporting this legislation in a strong bipartisan manner and I would urge a ``no'' on any motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, as America continues to grapple with the war and citizens throughout these United States deal with their daily struggles, I think it is important for us to harken back to our heritage and to celebrate our culture. 
   From the coalfields of southern West Virginia to the Land of Lincoln in Illinois; from the awesome beauty of Niagara Falls to the Muscle Shoals of Alabama; from the hallowed ground of the Virginia Piedmont, where battles were fought to unify this Nation, to the Santa Cruz Valley of New Mexico, this is the fabric of America. This is her heartbeat. Let us take time to listen to it and to celebrate it. 
   The legislation we are considering today was introduced by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Ohio, Representative Ralph Regula, who has been a strong and effective advocate for heritage areas, not only in the area he represents but also throughout the country, and I commend and salute him for that leadership. 
   Heritage areas help to preserve and interpret the geological history, the natural history and the human history of an area in a comprehensive fashion so that we and our children will better understand how our land has shaped our history and how our history has shaped our land. 
   National heritage areas are local community-driven preservation projects. Most of them arise out of the concerns of a core group of committed,  local folks who want to work together to preserve the places and resources that make their country or town or region unique. These citizens bring their proposals to their elected representatives in Congress because they need technical and planning assistance from their government and matching funds to use as seed money to help get their program off the ground. 
   Now, 23 years after the first national heritage area was designated, the program is at a crossroads. The Congress can either provide the program with the tools and support it needs to continue, maturing into a successful preservation model, or the Congress can turn our backs on heritage areas and leave local communities to fend for themselves as they try to save those things that make them special, that make America special. 
   We are moving this legislation today because we support national heritage areas and we want to see them succeed. Ever since Congress established the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor in 1984, heritage tourism has been growing, and today it is a significant economic engine. These areas are worthwhile, not only as a way to help local economies, but also as a crucial tool for preserving our communities' and our people's links to the past. 
   By providing Federal recognition and financial support, we encourage preservation and interpretation of important periods in our Nation's history in a way that traditional units of the national park system cannot do.     
   Our initial investment ``primes the pump,'' if you will, and ensures that those areas get a solid start toward financial and operational independence. Given that each Federal dollar is matched by local funds, the Federal investment in the heritage area program is money well spent. 
   In addressing the Rules Committee Monday, my colleague Mr. Regula noted that the $8 million made in his heritage area has yielded more than $270 million in non-Federal funding. For affected local communities, heritage areas are a program that works. 
   H.R. 1483, as amended, would establish six new heritage areas, increase the funding authorization for nonexisting areas, and make mostly technical changes in the establishing legislation for several of those areas. The bill also includes a study of the Northern Neck of Virginia, requested by our late colleague, Representative Jo Ann Davis. 
   Bringing this bill before the House today responds to the frequent and energetic requests of numerous Members on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats. In total, H.R. 1483 includes bills that are cosponsored by dozens of Members in both parties, including the entire House delegation in Illinois and New Jersey. 
   We also had very helpful input from the administration on this legislation, including detailed studies of the suitability of each new heritage area. Most of the changes being made to existing heritage areas were added at the request of the National Park Service. 
   This is a good bill, Mr. Speaker, and I want to commend the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) for his commitment and leadership on heritage areas. We support passage of H.R. 1483 and urge its adoption by the House today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, with the development of such strong bipartisan legislation of this nature, it obviously takes a lot of work by Members' staffs on both sides of the aisle and by members of the originating committee, our Committee on Natural Resources, as well. 
   I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Raul Grijalva, one of those gentlemen that has taken the reins of leadership this year as chairman of our Parks Subcommittee and done a tremendous job.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, in summation, these are not good times for the ratings of the United States Congress in the public opinion polls. We all know that in this body; yet I think if the American people would see Congress in action this very moment that those poll ratings might very well go up. 
   We've seen examples on this legislation of Members on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan, nonpartisan manner, working to preserve what is the best of America. I look at the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), I look at the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), I look at the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) on the other side of the aisle, and I look at the many Members on this side of the aisle from different parts of the country, south, north, west, that have joined together in bringing this legislation to the floor today. 
   Yes, we have respectful disagreements, and I respect the gentleman from Utah's position, but we also have worked very hard in what I think the American people want to see, and that is a nonpartisan effort to solve this country's problems. 
   Now, if you looked up the word ``red herring'' in Webster's Dictionary, the definition would be the property rights arguments that the critics of this bill are using against this legislation. 
   Heritage areas have no regulatory authority. Over 60 million Americans live in heritage areas. The entire State of Tennessee, for example, the entire State of Tennessee is a heritage area. Almost my entire congressional district is a heritage area. There have been no impacts on private property rights, mining, road building, economic development. I believe we've done quite well in each of those areas in my congressional district, most of which is a heritage area. 
   And the gentleman from Arizona, the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, brought out very well where we've seen no instances where there have been private property issues, no instances where such problems have occurred. 
   Now, those that have expressed concern about property provisions in this bill, let me be clear. In the 20 years plus of this program's existence, opponents have not been able to identify one single instance in which someone has been deprived of the use of their property as a result of such designations as we're considering in this bill. 
   And nevertheless, as the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) has quoted, we do, in this legislation, provide extensive property, private property provisions. These private property protections are the same language approved by the Senate, the same language proposed by the administration in heritage area systems bills under consideration in this Congress, and the same language included in heritage areas bills passed by the previous Congress under the other party's control. 
   The history of this program, as we have seen in repeated debate on the floor and in committee, not to mention the GAO report which has been referenced, has proven that there are simply no legitimate private property issues here. It's time to move on, stop flogging this dead horse and bringing up this red herring. 
   Now, the gentleman from Utah mentioned our late colleague, the gentleman that was elected to Congress with me, the late Representative Bruce Vento, the former chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. And the gentleman from Utah mentioned that he did not intend for the Federal heritage areas to last longer than 10 years. I'm reasonably sure, however, that our late colleague did not foresee these areas having to contend with close to $90 a barrel oil and the other increase in costs, I might add, that the numerous heritage areas created under Republican Congresses that were all authorized for 15 years. We have provided an increase in authorized funding for heritage areas to ensure that heritage areas have enough funds to get on their feet. 
   So the issue here is not private property rights. The issue is not gaming in these areas. The issue is not earmarks. I would say to my colleagues, imagine, for example, if Yellowstone National Park did not exist and Members of Congress introduced legislation to provide for such a crown jewel of our national park system. Would that be called an earmark? 
   The issue is not lobbying by local people, our local legislators. They have a right to try to secure that additional State and local funding necessary to match Federal funding. We provide  protections. Federal law prohibits any other lobbying by local groups. 
   So the issue, as I conclude, Mr. Speaker, is not about earmarking, not about lobbying, not about private property rights; it's about the American people and protection of what is theirs and providing our American people a place in which they can take their families, can spend quality time of life in these times when it's so hard to spend quantity time together, that they spend quality time together. And that's what we're talking about in this legislation. That's what we're talking about in our heritage areas, in America's heritage. 
   So I conclude by urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue the nonpartisan, bipartisan spirit that has brought this bill to the floor and pass this legislation by a tremendous margin.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, this is an issue, as is typical of a minority of the minority, that has not been mentioned one iota in any of today's debate, in any of the committee debate developed on a bipartisan, nonpartisan nature in bringing this bill to the floor, not in any way brought up in any of the extensive hearings held by our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, and is brought up at this last second out of the clear blue, which, again, I say should not be surprising because it is typical of a minority of the minority to make such efforts. 
   But I would ask the gentleman from Utah, is he referring to all Federal lands? Because as I am sure he knows, the heritage areas are not part of the national park system, the chart that he just brought forward, nor are they under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. The heritage areas are part of a collaborative effort between Federal and State and local people with local governing units with matching dollars, not all Federal dollars, as I am sure the gentleman knows. 
   So I ask that question. Are you intending this language for all Federal lands?

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1433, I call up the bill (H.R. 6899) to advance the national security interests of the United States by reducing its dependency on oil through renewable and clean, alternative fuel technologies while building a bridge to the future through expanded access to Federal oil and natural gas resources, revising the relationship between the oil and gas industry and the consumers who own those resources and deserve a fair return from the development of publicly owned oil and gas, ending tax subsidies for large oil and gas companies, and facilitating energy efficiencies in the building, housing, and transportation sectors, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the pending legislation, H.R. 6899, has as its additional cosponsors the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), and the gentleman from Michigan, the dean of the House, Mr. JOHN DINGELL. 
   My colleagues, today we stand at a crossroads, and the two paths before us are crystal clear. Those of us supporting the pending legislation bring with us the new-age conviction that in order for this Nation to be truly secure, we must bridge the gap between our addiction to oil, to a future empowered by more secure, safe, and reliable sources of power, that we must shatter the shackles of the past and remove the bonds that have placed such a burden on the American people and on our security as a Nation. 
   The other path is less enlightened. It carries with it the belief that a subservience to the policies of the past can sustain the country in the years and decades ahead. It would sacrifice America's energy security on the altar of Big Oil's profits and its profiteering. The choice is quite clear. 
   Before us today is landmark legislation that would, for the first time since 1982, sweep away moratoria precluding oil and gas leasing in much of the Federal waters off America's coastlines. 
   As a result of the pending measure, roughly 85 percent of all oil on the Outer Continental Shelf will be available for production. We are opening up to 400 million acres off the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts to drilling. We are expanding the availability of oil by at least 2 billion barrels of oil, enough to power 1 million cars for 60 years. 
   But in doing so, we have built in safeguards. I repeat that: we have built in safeguards. We do not undermine the defense posture of this country and the Defense Department's need to engage in military operations in America's waters. 
   We protect national marine monuments and sanctuaries, and we provide for the consideration of the interests of the coastal marine and human environment. And importantly, we are cracking down on the incredible failure of the Interior Department to ensure that Americans are getting paid a fair rate of return for the production of their, and I emphasize their, Federal oil and gas reserves and resources. These reserves are not owned by Chevron or Shell or by Exxon; they are owned by all Americans. They are owned by all Americans by birthright. 
   Yesterday, another former Interior Department official who was in charge of collecting Federal oil and gas royalties pleaded guilty to rigging bids. Last week reports were released by the Interior Department's Inspector General which found ``a culture of ethical failure'' in a division of the Minerals Management Service as part of what I believe to be a burgeoning scandal. This is an agency that is supposed to safeguard one of the largest non-IRS streams of revenue to the Treasury. It is almost like Teapot Dome all over again. 
   At the same time, Government Accountability Office reports were released that found that the United States receives one of the smallest shares of oil and gas revenue in the world. Think about that. We receive one of the smallest shares of oil and gas revenues of any country in the world. 
   The reports also found that Federal oil and gas leases are not being diligently developed. We on this side of the aisle have been saying that for months. Production is only occurring on 12 percent of offshore leases and 5 percent of onshore leases. And as I have been bringing to light through a number of hearings held by the Natural Resources Committee, the Interior Department is unable to provide certainty that companies are paying the royalties owed to the American people, a culture of ethical failure, indeed. 
   The legislation before us contains bold initiatives to crack down on this legacy of abuse. It would require the diligent development of Federal oil and gas leases, require that prompt, transparent and accurate royalty payments are made, and would tackle the ethical failures occurring at the Interior Department. Leading the vanguard in our march to a more energy self-reliant and secure future is this legislation's establishment of a strategic energy efficiency and renewable reserve.     
   This initiative would finance the development of renewable and alternative energy technologies, provide increased assistance for low-income  home energy and weatherization programs, and advance carbon capture and storage, among other items. And we are dedicating over $6 billion to this fund over the next 10 years. 
   All of the above. All of the above. How often have we heard that in this debate? All of the above. It is here my friends: oil, natural gas, oil shale, wind, solar, coal energy efficiencies and energy conservation. 
   As I noted earlier, today we are at a crossroads. The difference is clear between those of us supporting this measure and some of those on the other side of the aisle who have been trumpeting their bumper sticker ``drill here, drill now'' approach to our serious energy situation. 
   They would open up everything to Big Oil. Perhaps some of them would even open up the National Mall if they could to drilling rigs. They would give away the store, no accountability, no safeguards, no expectation of a return in terms of energy or revenue. 
   We, on this side, instead, seek to protect America's interests in American resources. Make more Federal oil and gas available to drilling? Yes. That's what we're doing in this bill. But we're doing so in a manner that safeguards our environment, ensures the diligent development of those energy resources, and demands that the American taxpayer gets a fair return. Royalties due, royalties paid. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   It's interesting to note that the gentleman from Texas has just spoken about that we should have a straight up-or-down--or, I'm sorry, that we should have amendments, that he's complaining about the closed rule as other Members on that side have. Yet their mantra over the last several months has been, Let's have a straight up-or-down vote; let's have a straight up-or-down vote. I would say that's what we're getting to before this evening is over with. 
   I would note also the lack of hearings to which we've been charged. This energy debate has gone on ad infinitum on numerous pieces of legislation, often bills having nothing to do with energy, during 1-minutes, during Special Orders. Even when the House was not in session, the other side had their energy debate. 
   So I would say there are various parts of this bill that have passed the House before, have been debated on ad infinitum in committees and/or on this floor. So there is really nothing new in this piece of legislation, and it's a piece of legislation that has been debated over and over. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished chairman of our Education and Labor Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), and also a cosponsor of this legislation.

I would note that his Presidential nominee is opposed opening ANWR as well. 
   This legislation, however, increases domestic oil production in Alaska by mandating annual lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve which has more than 10 billion barrels of oil, more oil than the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.

   The gentleman from Louisiana has just described the revenue program as ``typical'' and that we are doing away with the ``typical revenue sharing.'' I would remind my colleagues, that is not an accurate statement. 
   The OCS Lands Lease Act passed in 1954 had zero revenue sharing in it. Zero revenue sharing. It was only in 2006 when this Congress passed revenue sharing to allow four States to share in that money, due to hurricane relief, those four States being Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Revenue sharing was a one-shot deal. 
   So for the gentleman from Louisiana to describe it as typical, and many on that side have attacked this bill because there is no revenue sharing, a bribe to the States, if you will, to opt in, is just not an accurate description of this legislation. Revenue sharing has never been typical of leasing and the Outer Continental Shelf.

   Mr. Speaker, reading the legislation will show that the strategic energy efficiency renewable reserve fund that we've set up--we explained the funding mechanism and how much earlier--would go toward accelerating the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels. And an understanding of what alternative fuels is would lead one to know that that includes coal-to-liquid and clean coal technologies. 
   In addition, we have a separate section that increases research, development, and demonstration of carbon capture and sequestration techniques, also clearly spelled out in the legislation. 
   Furthermore, when we're talking about carbon capture and sequestration in this legislation, we do have language that specifically sets aside how the process is, that these grants will be made from this fund to go toward carbon capture and sequestration. 
   We provide $1.1 billion of tax credits for the creation of advanced coal electricity projects and certain coal classification projects and we explain how that will be awarded. 
   In addition, we ensure the solvency of the black lung disability trust fund, not a laughing matter to West Virginians.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this has been a good debate that we've conducted today. It's been a debate that as we've heard for several months over the last time period in this body, we've had extensive debates in the House over the energy issue. We've had it on the House floor during consideration of various energy bills. We've had the debate during 1-minutes. We've had it during Special Orders. We've had it on bills that we've considered that have had nothing to do with energy, and we've even had a debate when the House was not in session. 
   We've heard repeatedly that the Republican Members want a straight up-or-down vote. That's what we're giving them by this rule today, and we're about to near that point. 
   It's regrettable that oftentimes the debate today has used the words hoax, sham, bait and switch, not serious, political gains, and I could go on and on about the venom that has been spewed from the other side. When it comes to political games and the bait and switch tactics that we've been alleged to be employing, I would say what is wrong when we're trying to represent the crying need and the desperate need of the American people. 
   We are politicians in this body. We know what the art of compromise is all about, or at least we should know what the art of compromise is all about. We know the diversity that exists within both sides, both caucuses in this body, and the diversity that exists among the American people. But we all are united. We all are united in trying to resolve the crying need that the American people are telling us today needs to be addressed. 
   This bill has worked with both sides of the aisle. In working with Representatives Abercrombie and Peterson, that has been working with the other side of the aisle. 
   We have also taken a lot of this language, not a lot of it, but elements of this proposal come from the so-called Senate Gang of 10 or 15, however many it is from the other body. Those that say this is dead on arrival over there, I think, are a little premature in their predictions. 
   In working with my colleagues that are cosponsors, Representative Gene Green, Representative George Miller and Representative John Dingell, we have certainly reached out. Speaker Pelosi has been tremendous in her of efforts, and as well as the leadership of Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, Chris Van Hollen and Rahm Emanuel, and I certainly want to thank each and every one of them. 
   Charges have been made today that this bill does nothing to increase energy production. Indeed, the minority leader just said that. And I want to quote, by the way, in an August 2005 debate on this floor, when Minority Leader John Boehner said that the GOP energy bill, remember that bill, the GOP energy bill of 2005 would bring down prices, writing, and I quote from Minority Leader Boehner at that time. ``So what is being done to bring gas prices down? The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a balanced bipartisan bill that will ultimately lower energy prices for consumers and spur our economy.'' End quote from Minority Leader John Boehner addressing our energy concerns on August 19 of 2005. 
   The results speak for themselves. This legislation will increase domestic production of oil and gas. The offshore drilling provisions opened up from 63 to 80 percent. That's 309 up to 404 million acres of land off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts that are currently off limits to drilling. It depends, of course, on what the States decide. It goes beyond the bipartisan compromise proposal in the Senate, opening up the West Coast and the Northeast to drilling. 
   The offshore drilling provisions expands oil available by at least 2 billion barrels of oil, nearly 4 years worth of oil produced offshore in America and enough to power 1 million cars for 60 years. It also makes available enough natural gas to heat 6 million homes for over 42 years. 
   Now am I going to sit here and say that passage of this legislation is going to bring down the price of gas tomorrow or next month or next year? No, I'm not going to say that; just as the other side cannot say, no matter what is in their recommittal motion, that is not going to bring down the price of gas tomorrow, next month or next year either. 
   We need a comprehensive energy plan. This bipartisan effort, this, as we will see by the final vote on this bill, shows that we are making efforts to begin the road toward a comprehensive energy package. We have provisions in here for carbon mitigation, for carbon capture and sequestration for those who say there's no coal. 
   We provide $1.1 billion of tax credits for the creation of advanced coal electricity projects and certain coal gasification projects that demonstrate the greatest potential for carbon capture and sequestration. Of these $1.1 billion of incentives, $950 million would be awarded to advance electricity projects and $150 million would be awarded to  certain coal gasification projects. Coming from a coal State, as I do, this provision is important. 
   We also provide for the solvency for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund in this legislation, something that is not inconsequential to those from coal States as well. 
   On the revenue sharing point, we have not provided for revenue sharing in this bill because these are the people's resources. These are the resources that belong to the American people by birthright and, therefore, the money gained through royalties should be shared with the American people, and revenue sharing is not a commonly accepted method of providing the revenues from royalty collection. I refer to the OCS legislation passed in 1954 which provided for no revenue sharing. 
   The only time Congress has provided for revenue sharing from these royalty leases is, as I said earlier, during Hurricane Katrina when the four States involved were in dire need of help to get back on their feet. So revenue sharing is not provided in this bill because we do not think a bribe is necessary for the States to opt in. The offer of new jobs, a new economy and all the related businesses thereto should be enough for a State if they want to opt in to this program to provide them incentives to opt in. 
   In regard to the fiasco that's recently been revealed to the American people, what has taken place in the Office of the Minerals Management Service in their Denver office, these are public servants entrusted with fiduciary responsibilities of ensuring that the American people receive a just return for the use of their resources. 
   This legislation sets up ethical codes of conduct. It prohibits acceptance of gifts and ski vacations and other extravaganzas that were being heaped upon these royalty collectors by big oil companies. This Committee on Natural Resources will have a hearing next Thursday and delve further into these hearings to see how much the American taxpayers were, once again, ripped off by the big oil companies. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me comment generally about this bill and the need to pass it this evening. It is a real comprehensive effort based on the need to move toward a comprehensive energy bill. Are we all happy with this? No. 
   As I said earlier, we are legislators. We know what the art of compromise is, and we know that this is a compromise between the ``no drillers anywhere'' and the ``drill everywherers.'' That's what this bill is all about. 
   We cannot have opening all lands, all of our national monuments and other areas in this country to drilling and be fair with the American people. We must assure accountability. That's what we're doing with this legislation. As with all compromises, it does require both sides to give. And in return for a responsible opening of more of our offshore areas for drilling, our bill requires oil companies to pay their fair share so that we can make a historic commitment to renewable energy future and alternative fuels and jobs for our people. 
   This bill puts us on the path toward energy independence. It protects our consumers. It provides transparency and accountability for the big oil companies. It strengthens our national security, it helps reduce global warming, the goals and the key ingredients that are needed for a comprehensive national strategy. 
   And I say to my colleagues, let's look forward of where this bill can go provided that there is that spirit of compromise from the other side, from the other body and from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. And I think, when all is said at the end of the day, rather than shut the government down, we will see that those in the middle, those who truly feel compromise is part of the legislative process, that compromise is what the American people are yearning for these days, in order to meet their high energy costs, that that is where we will be when all is said and done on the pending bill. 
   Again, I want to salute all of my colleagues that have worked so hard on this legislation on both sides of the aisle. I do not ignore the fact that there are certainly good-minded and fair-minded and compromise-minded individuals on the other side of the aisle. If only they were allowed to work their will as well. 
   So this is a good bill. I again salute everybody that has been involved, and I ask for its passage and a defeat of the motion to recommit.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, it should be noted that the recommittal motion, in taking the Abercrombie and Peterson language as it has word for word, does repeal the military mission law protection that we worked so hard to keep in for the Florida delegation. 
   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) raised that issue on the floor. He had the map, and I would say to him that because of the importance of this to our military training, our aviation training, our national security defenses, we protect this area in our bill. 
   The Abercrombie-Peterson measure, as read by the Clerk of the House just now, repeals the section 104 that provides for the protection of this Florida area. 
   So I would urge my colleagues from the State of Florida to particularly take this into recognition, as well as all of my colleagues, because this is a national security area. The Air Force uses the eastern gulf for training maneuvers. It has become crucial for maintaining our military readiness, especially after the closure of Vieques, and our compromise bill does protect this area for important defense training and exercises. 
   So I would hope Members would note that, and I do, of course, rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. Well, I do know where it came from, and as I said, I respect the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) for working with Mr. Abercrombie, and he has stated his reasons for opposing this language as well. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to oppose this motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the American people want us to solve the energy problems facing our country in a bipartisan way. They're looking to the Congress for answers, but they realize that the Congress cannot provide the only answers. 
   No less than T. Boone Pickens has said that we cannot drill our way out of this mess. The plan that we bring to the floor today is a comprehensive energy plan that does do all of the above. It's a compromise between the drill nowhere crowd and the drill everywhere crowd. And let's face it, there are some on the minority side in this body that would drill everywhere and they're not going to settle for anything less, including under the National Mall if they could. They would want to drill every inch of this land, and that is not a responsible way. 
   Our plan provides for reliance upon domestically produced energy sources, all of the above. It requires oil companies to be responsible and transparent in the collection of royalties. It provides for a new ethics code for the people at the Minerals Management Service to operate under so that the American taxpayer can receive a fair return for the disposition of their resources. These are public resources deserving public accountability.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Chairman, title VII of the pending legislation is the Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007, which was produced by our Committee on Natural Resources. The fundamental premise behind this title of H.R. 3221 is that we must restore accountability and integrity in the Federal onshore and offshore energy leasing programs and ensure that the public interest is upheld when it comes to managing energy development on Federal lands, while advancing alternative energy strategies, preserving coal's role in a global climate-sensitive world, and addressing the impacts on wildlife, coastal areas, and our oceans as a result of climate change. 
   There are many issues contained in this title, but at this time I would highlight subtitle D. That would initiate a framework for enabling our Nation to sequester carbon dioxide under the ground to ensure the future use of fuel, such as coal, in an environmentally responsible fashion. 
   We can talk about ethanol and other biofuels and wind and solar, et cetera, all we want, but the fact of the matter is that coal, which produces half of our electricity in this country, will continue to be a mainstay through the foreseeable future. At the same time, any of us representing coalfields in this country recognize that we must, as a Nation, aggressively pursue strategies and technologies to capture and store the carbon dioxide. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Chairman, title VII of the pending legislation is the ``Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007'' which was produced by the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   It is the product of 14 hearings held this year, input from over 100 witnesses, results from several Government Accountability Office reports and Interior Department Inspector General investigations, and a marathon markup session during which 46 amendments were considered. 
   The fundamental premise behind this title of H.R. 3221 is that we must restore accountability and integrity in the Federal onshore and offshore energy leasing programs and ensure that the public interest is upheld when it comes to managing energy development on federal lands, while advancing alternative energy strategies, preserving coal's role in a global-climate-sensitive world, and addressing impacts on wildlife, coastal areas and our oceans as a result of climate change. 
   I would like, at this time, to express my deep appreciation to the Members of the Natural Resources Committee who assisted in crafting this legislation. To Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Chairman JIM COSTA for the many long hours he put into the hearing process. To RAUL GRIJALVA, Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands who also conducted hearings and aggressively fought for public interest provisions in this legislation. To Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans Chairwoman MADELEINE BORDALLO for her vision in seeking to address issues relating to wildlife and our oceans in this measure. And to GRACE NAPOLITANO, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power for her contributions as they relate to western water resources as well. 
   Last, but certainly not least, I would like to express my deep appreciation to the Speaker of the House, NANCY PELOSI, for her intimate involvement with the provisions reported by the Natural Resources Committee during the process of compiling H.R. 3221. 
   Others will speak to the many issues contained in this title, but at this time, I will focus on two. 
   Subtitle D of this title will initiate a framework for enabling our Nation to sequester carbon dioxide under the ground to ensure the future use of fuels, such as coal, in an environmentally responsible fashion. 
   We can talk about ethanol and other biofuels, and wind, and solar all we want, but the fact of the matter is that coal--which produces half of our electricity in this country--will continue to be a mainstay throughout the foreseeable future. At the same time, many of us representing the coalfields of this country recognize that we must--as a Nation--aggressively pursue strategies and technologies to capture and store the carbon dioxide that results from coal combustion. 
   There are three provisions of this title which seek to accomplish that goal. The first is a national assessment of the geologic capacity for carbon storage, focusing on deep saline formations, unmineable coal seams, or oil and gas reservoirs capable of accommodating industrial carbon dioxide. 
   The second directs the Interior Department to devise a regulatory framework for conducting geological carbon sequestration activities on federal lands. This is extremely important. In the event a suitable geologic formation is identified on federal lands, there currently exists no clear-cut authority to allow the activity to go forward. 
   The third is the biomass utilization program established by this title. One of the purposes of this program is to develop biomass utilization for energy, including through combustion with other fuels such as coal, to achieve cleaner emissions. This is especially important in our continued efforts to develop a viable coal-to-liquids industry in this country to counter imported oil. Expert studies and tests show that when coal is mixed with biomass in the coal-to-liquids production process it will produce a cleaner fuel at the tailpipe than conventional gasoline. 
   The other area of this title which I would like to highlight relates to restoring the public interest in the management of our Federal oil and gas resources. A number of GAO and Interior Inspector General investigations make it abundantly clear that the taxpayers are not receiving a fair return for the disposition of these resources as a result of royalty underpayments, various schemes and outright fraud. 
   The Natural Resources Committee, under my chairmanship, has been very aggressive in pursuing these matters. There is a fiduciary responsibility to the American people involved here, and if the Interior Department will not fully exercise it then the Congress will. 
   Provisions of this title will bolster federal audits and provide expanded tools for requiring compliance with the payment of federal oil and gas royalties. 
   This is simply good government, and it belongs in this energy bill.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time for the Committee on Natural Resources. 
   Mr. Chairman, to follow on my previous comments and to respond to many of the comments made on the minority side, there are those on the majority side representing coal fields of this country that recognize that we must as a Nation aggressively pursue strategies and technologies to capture and store the carbon dioxide that results from coal combustion. 
   There are three provisions in the natural resources title which seek to accomplish that goal. The first is a national assessment of the geological capacity for carbon storage, focusing on deep saline formations, unmineable coal seams or oil and gas reservoirs capable of accommodating industrial carbon dioxide. 
   The second initiative directs the Interior Department to devise a regulatory framework for conducting geological carbon sequestration activities on Federal lands. This is extremely important considering future actions this Congress may take in this area. In the event a suitable geological formation is identified on Federal lands, there currently exists no clear-cut authority to allow that activity to go forward. 
   The third is the biomass utilization program established by this title. One of the purposes of this program is to develop biomass utilization for energy, including through combustion with other fuels such as coal, to achieve cleaner emissions. This is especially important in our continued efforts to develop a viable coal-to-liquids industry in this country to counter imported oil. Expert studies and tests show that when coal is mixed with biomass in the coal-to-liquid production process it will produce a cleaner fuel at the tailpipe than conventional gasoline. 
   In conclusion, on our title VII of the Natural Resources part of this bill, I would like to highlight provisions which aim to restore the public interest in the management of our Federal oil and gas reserves. 
   A number of GAO and Interior Inspector General investigations made it abundantly clear to our committee that the taxpayers are not receiving a fair return for the disposition of their resources as a result of royalty underpayments, various schemes and outright fraud. 
   The Natural Resources Committee has been very aggressive in pursuing these matters. There is a fiduciary responsibility to the American people involved here, and if the Interior Department will not fully exercise it under this administration, then those of us in Congress on our committee will. 
   Provisions of this title will bolster Federal audits and provide expanded tools for requiring compliance with the payment of Federal oil and gas royalties. This is simply good government. 
   Our portion of this bill provides for transparency, accountability, and a fair return to the true owners of these Federal lands, the American taxpayer. No longer can we allow the American taxpayer to be ripped off, to not receive their fair share for the disposition of their resources. No longer can we allow cronyism, fraud and abuse to exist in the Department of the Interior. 
   I conclude by saying that the Natural Resources portion of this bill is a good bill. The underlying bill is a good bill. I salute our Speaker, a true leader, who has addressed the concerns of many members of our caucus, who has an intimate grasp of the details of this legislation. Under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, we are advancing in this particular legislation energy independence for this country, a freeing of our reliance upon foreign, unstable sources of oil that imperil not only our national security but imperil the lives of our young men and women. 
   This bill helps restore that integrity and that independence. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, the Committee on Natural Resources is continuing our effort to bring justice to Indian country. Last year, the committee brought to the full House legislation to finally provide Federal recognition to the long suffering Lumbee Tribe in the State of North Carolina. 
   We also brought to the floor legislation to grant Federal recognition to six Virginia tribes 400 years after the founding of the Jamestown settlement. These were the very tribes that greeted the English settlers when they landed on our shores. 
   Today, we are considering legislation to end a 153-year odyssey involving two federally recognized tribes in the State of Michigan--the Bay Mills Indian Community and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. 
   This bill seeks to settle legitimate land claims of these two Indian tribes. I would note that the resolution of Indian land claims is something that is vested with the Congress, and Congress has taken this type of action on numerous occasions. No precedent is being set by these bills. 
   The genesis of the pending legislation dates back to 1807 when the Chippewa ceded much of what is now the State of Michigan in a treaty with the Governor of the Michigan Territory. Subsequent treaties ensued in 1817, 1820, 1836, and in 1855. 
   In the case of both the Bay Mills and the Sault Ste. Marie, the 1855 Treaty of Detroit set aside land, in what is now known as Charlotte Beach, for their exclusive use. However, shortly after the treaty was concluded, that very land was sold to non-Indian speculators. 
   This is hardly the first time something like this was done to Native Americans, but it is another indictment in the long and sad chapter of their past treatment by those with wealth and power. 
   At present, some 100 non-Indian landowners reside on the Charlotte Beach land, under a clouded title, due to the legitimate land claims filed by the Bay Mills and the Sault Ste. Marie. This makes it impossible for the residents of Charlotte Beach to receive title insurance--depressing land values and making it difficult to obtain mortgages, among other issues. 
   The Interior Department has testified to the legitimacy of the land claims in question. Their legitimacy has also been recognized by two Governors of the State of Michigan--Republican John Engler and current Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm. 
   Indeed, Jennifer Granholm stated in a letter addressed to me: ``The Federal courts have held that both the Bay Mills Tribe and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe trace their ancestry to the two Chippewa bands named in the deed to the disputed Charlotte Beach lands and that both tribes, accordingly, share in any potential claim based on those lands.'' 
   To be clear then, that is what is at issue with the pending legislation--the settlement of these land claims. There is no administrative process available to accomplish this. It is something that is solely vested with the Congress. 
   The pending measure would implement a settlement agreement entered into by the Governor of Michigan, the Bay Mills and the Sault, and in doing so, it would clear the land title cloud that has hung over the residents of the Charlotte Beach area. 
   Under an agreement reached with the Bay Mills and with the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, initially with Governor Engler and subsequently with Governor Granholm, the tribes would relinquish their land claims at Charlotte Beach, and instead, would be able to take into trust land at, in the case of the Bay Mills, Port Huron, Michigan, and in the case of the Sault Ste. Marie, either Flint, Monroe or Romulus, Michigan. 
   Under this settlement agreement, gaming is authorized on the new reservation lands at Port Huron and at either Flint, Monroe or Romulus. 
   However, in my view, the primary concern of Congress is the settlement of the land claims. What then occurs is a matter that is up to the State of Michigan, its political subdivisions, and the affected tribes. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would note that all Representatives of the House of Representatives whose congressional districts contain either the lands where the existing land claims rest or the areas where the new reservation lands would be created support these two bills--the dean of our House, Chairman John Dingell; Representative Bart Stupak; Representative Dale Kildee, and Representative Candice Miller. I would also note that the municipalities involved support this settlement. 
   I have set out the facts, Mr. Speaker, the historical record regarding these two tribes and their Charlotte Beach land claims. I do believe that the deliverance of justice is on the side of these two tribes and of the legislation we are considering today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, as we conclude this debate, I would like to take this opportunity to implore the other body to act upon the Lumbee and the Virginia Tribe bills that this body had sent over for its consideration last year. The magnitude of injustice that has befallen these Indian people is almost beyond comprehension. 
   To the matter at hand. One hundred fifty-three years ago, ladies and gentlemen, that is when these tribes were robbed of their land. The historic record shows they were swindled out of their promised land. This has been their version, their own version of the Trail of Tears. We must not continue to condone that. 
   We have a higher calling in this body. This is a matter about rising above the petty differences, it's about making restitution and making the tribes involved whole, making the tribes involved whole, and as well clearing title to land where the good people of Charlotte Beach reside. 
   So I would say to those of my colleagues with concerns over this measure, look into your souls. There, it is my hope, that you will find justice to this cause, to this land claim settlement. The pending legislation, I might add, is supported by the United Auto Workers, the International Union of Operating Engineers, and the International Union of Machinists. 
   As I conclude, let me say again that it is time we move on so that we can address other issues of importance to Indian country, such as the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, reported out of the Committee on Natural Resources; self-governance issues; other land and economic development issues, such as with the Catawba in South Carolina. 
   There are many other Indian tribes in Indian country around our country that have many injustices yet to be addressed by the Congress of the United States. We have to look into our souls and decide that it is time to move above these petty differences, to realize that it is incumbent upon us in the Congress to address these issues when others will not. 
   So I implore my colleagues to support the pending legislation as well as ending many other injustices to our first Americans, our native Indians. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Under this settlement agreement, the tribe will transfer 70.5 acres of land located within its expanded 1988 reservation to the county. In exchange, the county will abandon any and all claims to the disputed road. 
   I would like to commend our colleague from New Mexico for his super leadership and determination, Mr. TOM UDALL, for bringing this bill before us today.

   Other areas of this land would be used for a cultural center, agricultural activities, housing, and open-space needs. The legislation prohibits these lands from being used for gaming.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call up this legislation which is comprised of 61 separate measures that were already considered by this body, packaged by the Senate, and sent back to us for further and final consideration. This is a bipartisan package, almost evenly split between bills sponsored by Democrats and Republicans. 
   Further, I would note that 57 of the measures included in this package originated in the Committee on Natural Resources. In this regard, I salute the committee's Chairs who worked so hard on this legislation: 
   RA&#218;L GRIJALVA, chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands; GRACE NAPOLITANO, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, and DONNA CHRISTENSEN, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs. 
   In this body, these three Members did all of the heavy lifting, the hearings, the managing of the individual bills on the floor, the listening from other Members of this body that helped to make the package we are considering today possible. 
   The pending measures include new protections for wilderness, national parks, historic sites and trails, and precious water resources from sea to shining sea. 
   I will not speak to each and every provision of this legislation today but would like to highlight two in particular. 
   This bill will finally designate the long-awaited Wild Sky Wilderness in Washington State, championed by our colleague, RICK LARSEN. As I noted last week when the House considered wilderness legislation for my home State of West Virginia, to be in a wilderness area is truly a humbling experience. To be part of designating the wilderness is even more humbling because wilderness is an effort to retain the landscape as God created it. And as with God's good graces, we are working toward designating new wilderness areas in West Virginia today. 
   Let this be the next-to-last action, other than the President's signature, on establishing the Wild Sky Wilderness in the State of Washington.     
   The other measure I would like to highlight would finally bring badly needed immigration, national security and labor protections for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Further, this legislation would also grant a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives to the Northern Mariana Islands. 
   For too long, abuses took place in the CNMI, and for too long remedial legislation was held hostage in this body. Let this legislation bring forth a new dawn, the start of a new era with a delegate to this body, that the people of the CNMI's voices be heard. 
   Again, I want to thank the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Dr. DONNA CHRISTENSEN, for her great work on this matter. 
   There are other issues of note in this bill. It would expand parks in Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Washington and Idaho. It would improve visitor transportation options at Denali National Park and Acadia National Park. And it would expand and increase the authorization for the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. Three new national heritage areas and nine existing areas will receive Federal assistance under this measure. Seven other areas will be examined as possible new park units. 
   This bill would also authorize Federal participation in new and expanded water recycling projects around the west, projects which will provide an estimated 52,600 acre-feet of water annually in an area experiencing severe drought. 
   It's a good bill, Mr. Speaker. I urge all Members to vote for this package.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this is 60-some pieces of legislation in this bill, and it may not be perfect, but it's the nature of the beast, as the process is. Of the 60-some measures in this legislation, 57 that went through our committee on  Natural Resources were pretty well examined. They weren't just thrown into this bill without any consideration whatsoever. Either in this Congress or the previous Congress, these bills have had hearings on them. I mentioned the subcommittee process that worked its will in our Committee on Natural Resources. So this bill has had pretty careful scrutiny. 
   I'd like to conclude by commending the majority leader of the other body, Mr. Reid. He has called me on this legislation. It passed through the other body after a tortuous process. The final vote over there was 91-4. I also want to commend the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the other side, Mr. Bingaman, for his work and his tenacity. 
   Again, I commend my ranking member, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Bishop, and the staffs on both sides of our committee on Natural Resources for the long hours that they have put in on this legislation. It is indeed, as the process goes, an excellent piece of legislation, and I am very proud and highly commend it to my colleagues for passage and on to the President for his signature.  
   Mr. UDALL of Colorado, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Senate-passed bill, and urge that it be passed and sent to the President for signing into law. 
   It gathers into one omnibus measure some 60 bills--dealing with various public land, national park, water, and territorial issues--that have already been passed by the House but on which the Senate has not taken separate action. To expedite their consideration, Senator Bingaman, the Chairman of the other body's Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, gathered them into one package after most if not all of them had been favorably reported by that committee and been pending on the Senate calendar for some time. Each part of the package is important, but I want to highlight three.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Existing Federal law allows tribal corporations to lease tribal land for a term of 25 years. However, there are instances where the Congress has provided the authority for a tribal corporation to engage in even longer terms. 
   The pending measure would give the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of Connecticut the ability to lease its lands for not more than two additional terms of up to 25 years each, for a total of 75 years, in an effort to assist this tribe, expand its economy and assist its members. 
   Furthermore, it prohibits any entity from conducting gaming activity on any land that is leased with an option to renew under this act. 
   I would note that this measure passed the other body by unanimous consent. And I would commend our colleague from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) for his leadership and championing this measure in the House. 
   I urge its passage and I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my appreciation to the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, for bringing this bill forward, and the ranking member, Mr. Bishop. Also I want to thank Mr. Peter Welch for the tremendous leadership he has provided. 
   Certainly I am in support of the legislation. I recognize that much of the debate that has occurred thus far has not really been on the legislation itself, but rather has surrounded the energy issue. As all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know, we are working toward bringing an energy bill to the floor of the House of Representatives in the very near future. 
   I have heard a lot of finger pointing. We all have been doing that, are guilty of that, for the last several months on this issue. Each side is trying to blame the other for the high price of gas today, ignoring the fact that the price of gas when President Bush took office was $1.47, both houses of Congress were  in Republican hands, and the price of gas is where it is today. 
   But that is the past. We must look forward. Now we are all talking about using all of our domestic sources of energy in order to free ourselves from that dangerous reliance upon foreign oil. And certainly I am one of those in the category, if not 99.9 percent of my colleagues, that want to see all of our domestic sources of energy used. I dare say that in the not-too-distant future, when we do address the energy bill, if not in the next several days on the floor of this body, that we will see the most broad-ranging, most comprehensive energy bill come to this floor that we have had in several years. It will be an all-of-the-above. It will be a start toward progressive, comprehensive energy legislation. 
   In that, it will be a pro-drilling bill as well, although it will not be all-drilling. It will not be all my-way-or-the-highway, as some on the other side continually preach, but rather it will be a bill that will show the sacrifices that will be necessary, the compromises that are always necessary in the legislative process if we are going to address the common good of this country. So that is what we are going to see. 
   One important factor of that bill that we have not seen in previous energy bills is accountability and transparency. After all, these are the American people's resources, our public resources we are talking about on the OCS or with Federal leasing on on-shore Federal lands. That means the American people have the right to receive a fair dispensation for the use of their resources, as well as an accountability of royalties and fees collected thereupon. 
   One of the areas in which we will seek to provide much-needed reform and more oversight is in the area of royalty collection and the royalty-in-kind program specifically.

And I say we will provide that additional oversight, because the Interior Department's own Inspector General, Mr. Devaney, is today coming out with a report of his investigation of the royalty-in-kind program in which he says we have also discovered a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity in the RIK program, both within the program, including the supervisor, who engaged in illegal drug use, had sexual relations with subordinates, and is in consort with industry. Internally, several staff admitted to illegal drug use as well as elicit sexual encounters, and it goes on and on about what has been happening with this oversight program. We will strengthen this program and make the reforms necessary.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND WATERTRAILS NETWORK CONTINUING AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, I would like to commend our colleague, Representative John Sarbanes, for his tireless efforts on behalf of the pending legislation. 
   This bill is a simple, straightforward measure that would permanently authorize the highly successful Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network, which would otherwise expire at the end of this fiscal year. 
   Over 10 million people each year visit one of the 156 gateway sites supported by this program. They come to kayak or canoe, hike or bike, picnic, hunt or fish or to watch wildlife. Others come to visit the Chesapeake's many maritime museums or to renew their acquaintance with turning points in our Nation's history at sites such as Fort McHenry and Yorktown Battlefield. 
   Each of those visitors comes away with a strengthened awareness of the crucial role of the Chesapeake in our national story and as the ecological and economic heart of the mid-Atlantic. And that is the goal of the Gateway Network, to renew our connection with that great bay. 
   The program is so successful that the National Park Service has heaped praise upon it, and the White House, in 2005, declared it to be a ``cooperative conservation success story.'' 
   Congress originally authorized this program for 5 years, and renewed that short-term authorization in 2002. In 2004, a National Park Service special resource study concluded that a permanent commitment to the program would ensure its long-term viability and enhance the Chesapeake's status among America's national treasures. 
   Anyone who saw the Washington Post article on Monday knows that the bay's oyster population is in trouble. That situation is both a symptom and one of the causes of the precarious health of the bay. Keeping people connected with and concerned about the Bay is vital to each step in restoring that great estuary--from its headwaters to its oysterbeds. 
   The Gateways Network does just that. The program is a proven success, and should be permanently authorized. I commend the gentleman from Maryland, a valued member of the Natural Resources Committee, for his advocacy of this measure. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5540.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, in 1774, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.'' Though our nation had yet to be formed, a sense of unity was already ingrained in the hearts and minds of future Americans. Beginning during our Nation's formative years and continuing today, many have looked to us in awe, inspired by the strength of our sense of patriotism, particularly in the face of adversity and animosity. 
   Six years ago, the world watched in horror as tragedy struck in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. From the moment the first airplane struck the first tower, America was changed. We were awakened to a new sense of vulnerability that continues to shape our nation. But what we have learned from this tragic experience extends beyond those early hours of shock and uncertainty. 
   September 11th brought momentarily to the forefront those anonymous heroes who stand among us every day. From the firefighters who died in the line of duty, to the airline passengers who fought back, to the bystanders who put aside their own fears and sprang into action, a new generation saw firsthand the incredible power of the American spirit. 
   Across the country, strangers became neighbors and communities became families. Drawn together in fear and confusion, the American people found solace and comfort in their fellow man. Their selfless acts turned one of our nation's darkest days into one of our Nation's finest hours. And today, we are stronger because of it. 
   As we pause to remember the lives that were lost on September 11th, we must give thanks to the doctors, nurses, first-responders, National Guardsmen, and American troops who spend each day protecting liberty at home and abroad. These brave men and women put their lives on the line in noble service to our country. Their generosity, compassion, and determination embody the values our Founding Fathers fought to safeguard more than 200 years ago. 
   On September 11, 2001, our nation was brought to its knees with grief. But on September 12, we rose again, and stood united. In a few tragic hours, America said goodbye to 2,998 friends and family members, but, with a reawakened American spirit, we welcomed 281 million strangers into our homes and our hearts. 
   I can think of no more fitting tribute to the lives that were lost on that sad September day than to take this time, on this day, to remember the best of America and to renew our commitment to ensuring that no force will ever ``destroy or disjoin'' us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Thank you, Mr. Barton. I appreciate your yielding, and I certainly want to commend you and Jason Altmire, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, for putting together this rather unique 2-hour debate, civilized debate, I might add, on our energy situation. It comes at a very appropriate time. 
   As we all know, President Bush just today by executive order lifted the moratorium that was put into place by his father some 18 years ago, I guess. That moratorium being on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf and in ANWR. And by a stroke of the pen, the President has lifted that moratorium, and I assume now that those lands are open for leasing; and I think that's a very important point to stress that they are not under lease at this time but are open for leasing. 
   And as the gentleman from Texas, I'm sure, is aware, having a lease in hand is not quite the same as starting the process to obtain a lease. The latter being a rather lengthy process that can take quite a few number of years. 
   I would think at this time an appropriate quote would be that quote from the Energy Information Administration. When commenting on the efforts to lift the moratorium on OCS and ANWR, it stated that lifting the current moratorium, ``would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.'' 
   That's the year 2030, 22 years from now. 
   This is the Energy Information Administration, a part of Secretary Bodman's Department of Energy. 
   And I think it's also worthy of note that 79 percent of the oil and 82 percent of the natural gas in Federal waters off America's coasts are already available  for leasing. That is today, now; not 22 years from now. 
   So I think that old saying that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush, well, an oil lease in hand is certainly--a lease, the actual lease in hand is certainly more preferable in terms of gaining production today in the near future; that is today, gaining production today, and bringing meaningful relief at the pump today, not 22 years from now, but today, would leave one to believe that opening these some 68 million acres of Federal onshore and OCS lands that are already under lease that can go--the companies can go out and drill on today--today, not 22 years from now, but today--would, I think, be preferable. And I'm not saying not including what the President has done today, that's fine. He has done what he did. 
   But also I don't see--and I'm asking the gentleman from Texas this question since it is his time--what is wrong with requiring the oil companies to use this acreage, 68 million, that are already under lease to go out and make some, at least a due diligent effort towards developing those leases? 
   Now, I recognize that's like a housing development. You're not going to find something on every acre that's under lease. You already know there's nothing under a few of those acres because when you build a housing development, you don't build a house on every inch of that entire development. So there are some acres where there's obviously not going to be anything there and not worth exploring. 
   But of that 68 million, there's only about 10 million now that is actively under production. And if you extrapolate out the same Energy Administration Department figures I just quoted, if you extrapolate out what is being produced from that 10 million acres, then you come up with roughly about a 14-year supply of natural gas by extrapolating out those figures. 
   So why can we not give some push to the industry to go out and make an effort to find out if there's anything in these 68 million acres or not? They will say, I'm sure there's not. But how do they know that there's not? How do we know what exists in the OCS that is now open by today's action of the President in lifting the moratorium? How do we know--I mean, the word ``potential'' is always used. The potential for this large find or this potential. But I just don't--I'm asking that question

   Mr. RAHALL. Well, this gentleman is certainly no stranger to efforts to reform Federal onshore oil and gas leasing program. I've been involved in that for 20 years, I guess, through first my subcommittee chairman on what was then called the Interior Committee, I guess, and now certainly as chairman of the full Committee on Natural Resources. I'm not even adverse to reforming that process to make it more expeditious. 
   But I still haven't heard, and I'm still unclear, as to the fact that leasing is the more difficult portion of going out and drilling on these lands. Is that not accurate? Obtaining a lease, it seems to me, is a much more difficult--and you know, even before the land is available for leasing, for example, the land manager has to develop a plan to determine whether or not an area is appropriate for oil and gas drilling. Then once the Interior Department has made the land available to leasing, then the oil and gas companies need to secure the permits and do some preliminary exploration.

   Mr. RAHALL. And in our use-it-or-lose-it legislation, we're simply saying current leases are generally 10 years. They vary somewhat depending on depth of water or where they're located. But generally, 10 years is the current leasing term. And if a company is holding that lease for 10 years and not producing on it or not even making an effort, showing some type of good faith, due diligent effort, as I'm sure the gentleman knows our Federal coal is required to do, other minerals on Federal lands that's owned by the taxpayers are required to do, we say in our use-it-or-lose-it, if that due diligent effort is not made, then you lose the lease and it's open again to competitive bidding. Another company can come in and make their bid for it.

I don't have it readily on me, but it's a matter of the public record because, as the gentleman from Texas has already said, when they go through the competitive bidding process to obtain the leases on the 68 million, of course, that's public knowledge, and these are public lands.

   Mr. RAHALL. I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia yielding. 
   You've mentioned ANWR and how much is available from that pristine environmental area. And again, I'm going to quote from that infamous Energy Information Administration of which I've quoted earlier. 
   First, this is a quote from President Bush June 9 of this year, ``I've proposed to Congress that they open up ANWR, open up the Continental Shelf and give this country a chance to help us through this difficult period by finding more supplies of crude oil which will take the pressure off the price of gasoline. That was the President's statement on June 9. And his own Energy Information Administration predicts that the savings from drilling in ANWR would equal 1.8 cents per gallon in the year 2025. And that, coupled with what I said earlier--I think you were here--about the fact that these areas that the President has lifted the moratorium on today would not produce any major savings or even produce any oil until 22 years from now, it is not going to give us the relief we need. 
   And let's not kid ourselves. I think we all know in this body, both sides of this debate--or all sides of this debate I should say--that what we do in this body is not going to bring down the price tomorrow, next month, perhaps not next year. It takes not just increasing the supply side like you want to do, like we want to do in our ``use it or lose it'' legislation--that's a pro-drilling piece of legislation--but it has to be followed with follow-up efforts in developing all, renewable and alternative, fuels, which includes coal to liquid----

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. I first thank the gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) and the Rules Committee for fashioning a rule today which provides for a free and open debate on a historic measure, refining the Mining Law of 1872. 
   I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) who has so ably taken the reins of leadership on the Subcommittee on Mines and Minerals, a subcommittee I once chaired over 20 years ago. We had extensive hearings at that time across the country, including in Alaska. And the gentleman from California has conducted himself in the same fashion and with the same knowledge of this bill. I certainly thank him for his help. 
   This legislation, it should be noted, is sponsored by, or, rather, enjoys the support of a number of Members from both sides of the aisle and from all political persuasions. It should be noted that Members from mining States affected by this legislation support this bill, including the gentlelady from Arizona (Ms. Giffords), who just spoke. 
   The rule does make a number of amendments sponsored by Members from the other side of the aisle in order that touch upon key features of the legislation. Indeed, the Rules Committee was very generous, extremely generous to the other side. 
   We are going to have a vote on the amendment today that will continue the 19th century practice, for example, of giving away mineral-rich public lands, the deed of which lies with all American citizens, for $2.50 an acre. That is an amendment that we will debate at the proper time. I say to my colleagues that this is not a Democrat or a Republican issue. It is a nonpartisan issue. It is bipartisan. Indeed, similar legislation has passed this body, not this Congress, but previous Congresses, by large, overwhelming margins. 
   We are dealing with a law that has been relatively unchanged that was enacted when Ulysses S. Grant resided in the White House. Union troops still occupied the South. The invention of the telephone and Custer's stand at Little Bighorn were still 4 years away. 
   In 1872, Congress passed a law that allowed people to go on to public lands in the West, stake mining claims, and if any gold or silver were found, mine it for free or to purchase those claim mine lands for as little as $2.50 an acre. 
   Let me speak for a moment on the process leading up to our consideration of this matter; a fair process, I might add. The genesis of H.R. 2262 dates back to 1879, 7 years after the enactment of the mining law of 1872. At that time, Congress created the first major public land commission to investigate land policy in the West. One of its major recommendations included a thorough rewrite of the 1872 law, which, even then, was believed by many to undermine efficient mineral development. 
   Several decades later, in 1908, President Roosevelt created the National Conservation Commission to study Federal land policy in the West, and it, too, made a number of recommendations for reforming the mining law. 
   Again, in 1921, a committee appointed by the Director of the Bureau of Mines recommended a series of reforms developed in concert with mining industry representatives interested in improving the mechanics of the law. Following this effort, the next call for reform came at the onset of World War II, when then Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, endorsed a leasing system for hardrock mining. 
   In 1949, the Hoover Commission recommended a series of changes to the mining law. This effort was succeeded by the President's Materials Policy Commission in 1952, which also recommended revisions, including placing hardrock minerals under a leasing system. 
   Once again, the criticism centered on inefficiencies in mineral development caused by the law. Beginning in 1964 and 1977, Congress went through another period of debate on the mining law reform until 1977, when efforts collapsed. 
   In 1985, this gentleman from West Virginia became Chair of the Subcommittee on Mining and Natural Resources, and delved into the matter. I conducted a large number of hearings, including in four western States. It was not until 1992 that I brought a bill to the House floor for consideration. 
   Following that effort, on November 18, 1993, the House passed my bill by a vote of 316-108. Unfortunately, during that 103rd Congress, a House-Senate conference committee on mining law reform was unable to reach a final agreement. 
   We were then shut out, locked down on the consideration of any meaningful mining law reform during the 12 years of a Republican majority in this body. This Congress, the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) became the chairman of the subcommittee that I once chaired and took up the reform banner. He held a number of hearings, took testimony from 33 witnesses, and subsequently, the Committee on Natural Resources marked up H.R. 2262.     
   Subsequently the Committee on Natural Resources marked up H.R. 2262 over one 2-day period and considered countless Republican amendments. Nobody was denied their ability to offer amendments. I repeat: nobody was denied their ability to offer amendments. 
   The legislation considered at the time was offered to Members and their staffs well ahead of time for ample dissection. I will stack this record up to anyone's with respect to the consideration of the bill by this body. Again, I defend our process as fair, as accountable and as transparent as a process can be in the House of Representatives, just as this legislation is worked and drafted in the same manner. 
   I urge adoption of this rule and the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, over 135 years after President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Mining Law of 1872 into law, I bring before this body legislation to drag it into the 21st century. This legislation at long last provides badly needed fiscal and environmental reforms of mining for valuable minerals in the 11 western States and Alaska. 
   In bringing this measure before the House, I am pleased to have the strong support of our colleague from California (Mr. Costa), who chairs the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources of the Natural Resources Committee. JIM chairs the subcommittee that I chaired 20 years ago when I first began this effort to reform the Mining Law of 1872. I am honored that he has taken up the mantle as well. 
   The Mining Law of 1872 is the last of the frontier-era legislation to remain on the books, with the Homestead Act having long been repealed, not to mention laws regarding carrying your six-gun into a saloon or allowing a posse to hang horse thieves. The basic goal of this law, almost free land and free minerals to help settle the West, has long been achieved. While the minerals produced under this law remain in demand, mining under an archaic 19th century regime is not compatible with modern land use philosophies or social values. This threatens mining, and mining jobs, and is one reason this law must be brought into the 21st century. 
   Today, as in the 1800s, the Mining Law allows claims to be staked on Federal lands in the West for valuable hardrock minerals such as gold, silver, and copper. No royalty is paid to the true owners of these lands, the American people, from the production of their minerals. Except by dint of an annual appropriations rider, the claims can be sold to multinational mining conglomerates for $2.50 or $5 an acre. 
   Now, some listening to what I just said may think I am making this up. Free gold and land for $2.50 an acre? That sounds like a fairy tale. My friends, ladies and gentlemen, I am not making it up. This is no fairy tale. This is a pirate story, with the public lands profiteers robbing the American public blind. 
   Mr. Chairman, billions of dollars' worth of gold, silver, and copper have been produced from American soil without a royalty paid to the true owners of the land, the American people. Those that will recall history will know that the largest bank heists in the world have been the $900 million stolen from the Central Bank of Iraq in 2003; the $72 million stolen from Knightsbridge Security Deposit in England in 1987; and the $65 million stolen from the Banco Central in Brazil in 2005. But, my colleagues, those figures are chump change, chump change compared to the estimated $300 billion in valuable minerals given away for free from America's public lands under the Mining Law of 1872. Incredible. Simply incredible. But, it gets worse. 
   Being a 19th-century law, it contains no mining and reclamation standards. The result is a legacy of toxic streams, scarred landscapes, and health and safety threats to our citizens from abandoned mined lands. The mayor of Boise, Idaho, and let me restate that State, Idaho, wrote a letter to me recently to state that the city is powerless to protect the integrity of its source of drinking water, which is threatened by a cyanide heap-leach gold mining facility proposed by a Canadian, and I repeat that, a Canadian-based company. 
   This last September, a 13-year-old girl tragically plunged to her death in an Arizona mine shaft. In reference to an area pocketed with abandoned mine sites, an Arizona mine inspector was quoted as saying: ``It's just a death trap out there.'' 
   The Mining Law of 1872 is the Jurassic Park of all Federal laws. It requires an extreme makeover. Environmental safeguards must be supersized. Federal lands must stop being given away for fast-food hamburger prices. The robbery of America's gold and silver must stop. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bill I am bringing before the House today would make commonsense reforms by imposing a royalty on the production of these hardrock minerals. Bear in mine that coal, oil, and gas produced from Federal lands have long paid these royalties. The legislation would also put a permanent end to what is known as patenting, the sale of mining claims for the price of a snack at Taco Bell. 
   Further, it would provide for statutory mining and reclamation standards that are performance-based rather than prescriptive. As well, this would establish a special fund to reclaim abandoned hardrock mines, address the health and human safety they propose, and provide for community impact assistance. 
   This is a historic debate, a debate that is long overdue. Those who support this legislation, the countless locally elected public officials across the West, concerned citizens across the West, sportsmen and -women across the West, taxpayer advocates across America, bring with them the new-century conviction that corporate interests can no longer have an unfettered ability to reap America's mineral wealth with no payment in return. There must be parameters set and rules to which industry must comply. 
   I am here to suggest that if we continue under the current regime, that if we do not make corrections, the ability of the mining industry to continue to operate on public domain lands in the future is questionable. The other side will bring up jobs, they will bring up the health of the industry that might be decimated by this legislation. I say we are here to protect mining jobs and to protect the health of the industry and to provide some certainty in the making of financial decisions by the mining industry. 
   While the Mining Law of 1872 over the years has helped develop the West and cause needed minerals to be extracted from the Earth, we have long passed the time when this 19th-century law can be depended upon to serve the country's 21st-century mineral needs, and do so in a manner accepted by society. Reform of the Mining Law of 1872, I tell my colleagues, is a matter of the public interest, the interest of the American taxpayer, the interest of all Americans who are true owners of these public lands. The name of every American is on the deed of these lands. I urge approval of this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   I say to my colleague from across the river from me in Kentucky that, as he knows, jobs in both our hardrock mining industry and our coal industry are on the decline already. Those jobs have been declining; and as the gentleman so well knows, as well as my colleagues on the minority side, these jobs are declining today because of the technologies that are coming in place. 
   Look at our coal industry. We're mining more coal as we're producing more hardrock minerals, but with less man and woman power because of the technologies that are replacing man and woman power. It's that simple. 
   So while the jobs may be on the decline, the production is on the upswing. 
   I would say as well to my colleagues who raise the specter of here the Democrats go raising taxes again, note this week in the Wall Street Journal, this week the administration, the administration, not the Congress, announced that it's raising the royalty rates for oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico to 18.75 percent from 16.67 percent for offshore leases to be offered next year. Even with this increase, the gulf will remain one of the lowest tax oil basins in the world. 
   So let's put this proposed 8 percent royalty on hardrock mining in perspective, please. It's less than half. Let's also keep in mind that hardrock mining is the only industry that pays no royalty on public lands, and all other countries and all States, for that matter, charge a royalty. Companies impose royalties and private agreements on hardrock mines. Let's keep in perspective what we're doing here; and, remember, it was the administration this week that raised royalties on Gulf of Mexico leases. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr).

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, on January 28, 1872, Representative Sergeant brought to the House floor from the Committee on Mines and Mining H.R. 1016, the bill that was to be enacted as the Mining Law of 1872. He noted that debate had taken place whether it was worthwhile for the government to sell the mineral lands of the United States, some thought, on some idea of a royalty belonging to the government. 
   Instead, the Members debating that measure decided to allow for the patenting of mining claims for $2.50 or $5 an acre, depending on whether it was allowed to place their claim because, in the words of Representative Sergeant, ``We are inducing miners to purchase their claims so that large amounts of money are thereby brought into the Treasury of the United States.'' 
   Well, now, perhaps back then $2.50 an acre represented a large amount of money. But I submit it does not today. And the royalty debated back when this law was passed is what, ironically, we are debating today. 
   Now, the gentleman from New Mexico has said that in order to pay that $2.50 an acre you have to mine the land. I would say that that is an inaccurate description of current law. You do not necessarily have to mine the land. You have to show that there's a valuable mineral that exists therein, which is not a very hard proposition to show these days. 
   With that noted, let me state that I've engaged in the effort to reform the Mining Law of 1872 these past many years, not just for the apparent reasons, valuable minerals mined for free, the threats to health and human safety from abandoned mine lands, but also because I am pro-mining, I come from a coal mining State, because I no longer believe that we can expect a viable hardrock mining industry to exist on public domain lands in the future if we do not make corrections to the law today. 
   I do so because there are provisions of the existing law which impede efficient and serious mineral exploration and development. And I do so because of the unsettled political climate governing this activity. With reform, if not coming in a comprehensive fashion, certainly it will continue to come on a piecemeal basis. 
   As my colleagues come to the floor to vote on this issue, I hope they will ask their staffs just how many letters from how many mining groups have they received in opposition to the pending bill. I hope they'll bring those letters to the floor with them, because I submit there will not be many. And I submit the reason may be, using my intuition, could the responsible segments of the hardrock mining industry, which is the majority, could the responsible segment of that hardrock mining industry want to end the uncertainty that exists over this industry? Could it be that they want a finality to the arguments surrounding their industry? Could it be that they want a basis upon which to make business and future investment decisions? 
   And hardly today are they screaming pauper. Look at this week's Wall Street Journal headline: ``Gold Rush of 2007. Mining Mergers.'' 
   The price is pretty well up there these days. I think these companies are doing quite well, and they would like to have some finality on this issue. I believe that, with enough courage, as we've seen from elected officials, hunters, sportsmen, fishermen from across the West, we can continue to address the problems facing mining and dovetail our need for minerals with the necessity of protecting our environment. 
   For at stake here in this debate over the Mining Law of 1872 is the health, welfare, and environmental integrity of our people and on our Federal lands. At stake is the public interest of all Americans. And at stake is the ability of the hardrock mining industry to continue to operate on public domain lands in the future to produce those minerals that are necessary to maintain our standard of living. 
   I urge the adoption of this legislation.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, following 2 days of committee consideration of the bill during which the committee debated 25 amendments, we continued a dialogue with several members of the committee, both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, in order to further perfect the underlying legislation and to keep the fairness of the process open. 
   This manager's amendment is a result of those deliberations. In summary, the manager's amendment would, one, clarify that valid existing rights associated with existing mining claims would be protected under the act. 
   Number two, this amendment clarifies that, in addition to paying a 4 percent royalty, existing operations would still need to come into compliance with the act within 10 years. 
   Number three, this amendment clarifies that the claim maintenance and location fees currently allotted to the administration of the mining claims will continue to be so allotted with the balance going to cleanup of abandoned hardrock mines. 
   In addition, in this amendment, as requested by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), user fees assessed by the BLM to process mining permit applications would be used for administration of the mining law program. 
   The manager's amendment would further limit the purview of section 504 citizen suits to permits issued pursuant to title III of the act as suggested by Mr. Cannon of Utah. 
   The manager's amendment would clarify that nothing under this act will affect the sovereign immunity of any Indian tribe. 
   That concludes the summary explanation of the manager's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge an ``aye'' vote. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I would agree with my friend from New Mexico in only the first three words of the statement he just made, and that being it's a simple amendment. Yes, it's a simple amendment. It helps liberate, it eradicates, it eliminates, it erases, it simply guts the fundamental environmental safeguard of this legislation. 
   We have struggled for many years to find a statutory standard by which hardrock mining on Federal lands must comply with. This bill states that mining must prevent ``undue degradation of public lands and resources.'' That term is defined as ``irreparable harm to significant scientific, cultural, or environmental resources on public lands that cannot be effectively mitigated.'' 
   And let me stress the use of the words ``that cannot be effectively mitigated.'' It is common practice in this country to mitigate developments, whether it be the construction of a highway, a dam, or a mine. But under this bill, if a mining operation could not be configured under any circumstance to effectively mitigate irreparable harm to save the water supply of a major city, then the Interior Department would have the ability to just say no. The gentleman from New Mexico's amendment would strike the definition in the bill of this term. The amendment would continue a 19th century view that was fashioned in an era when there was no major metropolises in the West. The amendment harkens back to an era that no longer exists. This is a defining moment. This is what we are talking about in the overall thrust of the pending legislation. 
   Under this bill, we will continue to have mining on Federal lands. I personally believe it will flourish. But the bad actors in the industry, the minority, and I will be the first to readily admit it is a minority, will no longer be allowed on the stage. The responsible industries should be against this amendment because they are the ones, as I said earlier, that want some certainty to their planning decisions so that they can make the investment decisions necessary to run a responsible mining operation with the jobs attendant thereto. 
   I therefore would urge opposition to the gentleman from New Mexico's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, during debate in committee over this legislation, the gentleman from Nevada conducted himself in a manner which I highly commend. He offered amendments that were aimed at addressing the concerns and interests of his State and his district. And, frankly, I recognize he has the most at stake here, representing Nevada, the largest gold-producing State in the Nation. 
   The gentleman offered two amendments. The one he is offering today was one of those amendments. In committee, I could not accept it because we had no discussions on it prior to its appearing as an amendment. But we did offer to continue to work with the gentleman from Nevada, as we have done. 
   And after having some time to consider the subject matter of his amendment, I am going to accept it, and I would urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   This amendment would allocate 50 percent of the revenues received from the proposed new abandoned hardrock reclamation fund back to the States where those revenues were generated.     
   There is precedent for this arrangement in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund established for coal back in  1977 which so vitally affects my State. The other 50 percent of the revenues would be used by the Federal Government for national priorities. 
   So, in conclusion, I say to the gentleman from Nevada, you are looking out for your State. I appreciate that; I commend you for it. And I appreciate the manner in which you have approached this overall issue of mining law reform, and I accept your amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the gentleman from Utah's concern and his deep involvement in this legislation. What worries me with his pending amendment is the myriad of unintended consequences that may occur. 
   In 1947, and again in 1955, Congress took out from the operation of the Mining Law of 1872 mineral materials such as sand, stone, and gravel on Federal lands and provided that they could be sold under contracts. However, a loophole was inserted into the law. Under this loophole, if the sand, stone, or gravel was an uncommon variety, it would remain under the Mining Law of 1872. 
   Now, determining just what an ``uncommon variety'' is has since cost the American taxpayers countless millions of dollars in litigation. The legislation before us today eliminates the distinction and confusion. And we would make all of these mineral materials available through sales contracts. The gentleman's amendment would strike that provision. 
   In essence, the gentleman's amendment would continue to allow uncommon varieties of mineral materials to be claimed under the Mining Law as revised by this legislation. 
   I'm not sure the sponsor of the amendment realizes what the result would be for these uncommon variety mining claims to be then subject to the bill's royalty regime and the bill's environmental standards. As such, if we adopted the gentleman's amendment, an 8 percent royalty would then be slapped on any future production from these uncommon variety claims. 
   Be that as it may, I oppose this amendment. First, the American people receive a return from the disposition of mineral materials through the sales contract. Moreover, this distinction between uncommon and common varieties of sand, stone, and gravel is nothing but a scam. I well recall, as does the gentleman from Oregon, our colleague, PETER DEFAZIO, the ``great sand scam'' at the Oregon Dunes National Recreational Area. I conducted a subcommittee hearing in Oregon on this issue. One person plastered mining claims over 780 areas of the recreation area where the hearing was held claiming the sand was uncommon. As I recall, his contention was that it had unique silica virtues for making glass. He then demanded $11 million from the Federal Government to buy him out. 
   I well recall the ``stone-washed jeans scam,'' where this guy located mining claims for pumice in a wild scenic river in New Mexico. He claimed that the pumice was an uncommon variety because you could produce stone-washed jeans with it. Give me a break. I think the gentleman gets the idea. 
   And just because some special interests lobbyists got this loophole inserted into Federal law in 1955 does not mean it should be condoned today. I view it as a scam, a rip-off. I urge defeat of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   So I would urge opposition to the amendment.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that the gentleman continues to push. We had it offered in full committee markup, had debate on it at that time. 
   When it was offered in committee, I advised him that it did not belong in this bill and perhaps should be considered as a stand-alone piece of legislation after the subject of a hearing. We have not conducted that hearing yet on this matter. 
   As I said in committee, I do remind my colleagues on the other side that when Newt Gingrich and Company issued their Contract with America, one of its tenets was to reduce the Federal bureaucracy. What the Republican majority ultimately achieved in this regard was the elimination of two Federal entities, the ICC, the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was then recreated as the STB within the Transportation Department. And the other Federal entity that the then-Republican majority eliminated was the Bureau of Mines at the Interior Department. 
   Now, in a stunning reversal, the Bureau of Mines would essentially be recreated under the guise of a Mineral Commodity Information Agency, I guess you would call that, MCIA. It would enlarge the bureaucracy and increase Federal spending. I repeat, it would enlarge the Federal bureaucracy and increase spending. I keep looking around for my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Flake). Where are you when we need you? 
   The gentleman's amendment would authorize $30 million a year for this new bureaucracy that the then-Republican majority eliminated when they ran the Congress. This new bureaucracy would have an associated administrator; it would have four assistant administrators; there would be an external affairs office, a public affairs office, even an international affairs office, and who knows how many other offices here and there.     
   The budget, financial, human resources offices, the human capital management office, the professional development office, the contract management office, yadda, yadda, yadda, I think you get the picture. So this is a whole lot of bureaucracy that would be created based on a proposal that never had a hearing and that was rejected by the Republicans when they were in the majority. 
   I urge the defeat of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, this is the day after Halloween and I recognize fully there are still tricks in the air, and this is another trick by the minority in this body. The amendment says report back to the House promptly. I am pretty sure that every Member of this body recognizes what the word ``promptly'' means. It is an amendment by the minority to substantially delay, if not outright kill, the pending legislation. So Members are well aware of this trick, and I urge defeat of this attempt to thwart passage by the House today of bipartisan legislation that has broad support at the local, State and Federal level. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, the effect of this motion would also be to reduce the amount of royalties owed the American people under this bill, under the guise of advocating nuclear energy for that matter, and I see no relationship here. I urge defeat of this motion which would reduce the amount of royalties that would come in to the American taxpayers under this bill. 
   Now to the segment about loss of jobs.     
   Due to changes in demands today, it's every Member of this body's knowledge that we may see a decline in the hardrock mining industry and the demand for jobs because of the technology, because of the technologies that are coming online. There's not a one of us who is against those technologies. In many cases, they're cleaner. In many cases, they're safer and they're healthier for our workforce. But that technology does displace man and woman power. It's a fact of our economic realities today. 
   So the gentleman's motion to recommit is based on unfounded premises, scare tactics, and tricks that we should not adopt; and I would urge defeat of the gentleman's motion to recommit.

   Mr. RAHALL. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
   I certainly want to commend him as well as our full committee chairman, Mr. Oberstar from Minnesota, for their invaluable work over the years that I have been in this body on the Appalachian Regional Commission. Their full committee chairman, Mr. Oberstar, is strongly in support of the Appalachian Regional Commission. He has been to our State of West Virginia and seen how important it is. And this bill certainly would not only extend the work of the Appalachian Regional Commission, but it would enhance that work. 
   Throughout my career as a Member of this body, I have supported the work of ARC. West Virginia is the only State that has its entire borders within the jurisdiction of the Appalachian Regional Commission. We have seen firsthand how it has enabled struggling communities throughout West Virginia and the Appalachian region to provide economic opportunity and a renewed sense of hope to our citizens. 
   I would like to point out specific provisions in this bill aimed at increasing American-made energy for America. We have spent weeks on this floor hearing about the need to increase domestic energy supplies by becoming even more beholden to Big Oil. But we have at our fingertips the chance to help forge a better solution. 
   We possess the technological know-how to convert coal to environmentally advanced transportation fuels and electric power. This bill recognizes that and provides for an infusion of investment to help make that happen. A provision in this legislation, for example, would enable the ARC to make grants, provide technical assistance, enter into contracts and otherwise provide for projects that would increase the use of renewable energy, particularly biomass, in the Appalachian Region to produce alternative transportation fuels. 
   This is extremely important in helping make a commercial coal-to-liquids industry a reality in this country. The use of biomass with coal in the conversion process can sharply cut carbon emissions of coal-to-liquid fuels. 
   A study provided by Princeton University found that by combining 30 percent biomass with coal in the conversion process and capturing and sequestering the carbon dioxide, CTL fuel can be made cleaner than other conventional liquid fuels in use today. A second provision in the bill would provide support for the development of conventional energy resources, such as coal, to provide electricity using advanced greenhouse gas reduction technologies. More plainly, it would help to advance projects which would capture and store carbon emissions, a necessity to our continued use of coal and other fossil fuels throughout the foreseeable future. 
   In this age of increasing energy need and growing carbon awareness, it makes sense that such an initiative would find a home in Appalachia, a region in which much of the economy is intertwined with coal. The development of CTL and the success of carbon capture and storage is vital to the Nation's quest for greater energy independence. CTL fuels will assure us of a  readily usable, environmentally advanced alternative to current high-cost transportation fuels.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in the words of mourning and celebration of the life of our late colleague, Juanita Millender-McDonald. She was a leader on many issues as we have heard stated already. And foremost among those in my opinion was her leadership and her vision as the first African American female chairman of a major committee here on Capitol Hill. She had a plan for how this City on a Hill would operate in a more smooth and efficient manner. And while she may not be with us to see that vision carried out, it is my hope that we will carry it out in memory of her. So to her husband and to her children and to her grandchildren, I hope that her memories will serve as a source of inner strength, inspiration, courage and love for the rest of their lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, on another subject, if I might, over the last few weeks, a series of anti-coal advertisements sponsored by a group called the Clean Sky Coalition have been running in prominent publications, such as the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and other publications that we in this body come to rely upon each day and view each day. These ads feature photos of people whose faces are smeared with coal dust and the headline reads, ``Face It, Coal Is Filthy.'' Indeed, there have been bumper sticker handouts on the streets of Washington, DC, stating that same phrase. 
   But the real filthy secret here is that the people depicted in these ads are not our Nation's coal miners but they are Hollywood models, and the ads are not being financed by environmental groups as one might be led to believe by the title of Clean Sky Coalition but, rather, these ads are primarily being financed by elements of the natural gas industry, including Chesapeake Energy Corporation headquartered in Oklahoma City. These ads are despicable and so is this so-called Clean Sky Coalition. The sponsors are not being truthful and they would have you to believe that it is merely environmental groups leading this campaign. The filthy secret is that this ad campaign is about market share. It's about profits. It's about one segment of the energy industry trying to bamboozle the general public and policymakers to sell more of its product. 
   And the filthy secret is that these ads completely ignore the tremendous progress being made to burn coal cleanly and ignore the national security interests of this country. The only truth here is that these ads are an insult, an absolute insult to the hardworking men and women who go beneath this Nation's bowels each and every day to produce the energy that provides for this Nation's electricity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6022, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008. 
   At a time when crude oil is over $120 a barrel, it makes absolutely no sense for the Federal Government to continue purchasing massive quantities of oil in order to stick it in a hole in the ground for safe-keeping. 
   Under the current situation, the Federal Government is buying oil at record-high prices to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the rate of 70,000 barrels a day. These daily purchases create additional pressure on demand and further inflate prices at the pump. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is roughly 97 percent full right now. We do not need to pay a premium to the oil companies just to top it off. 
   In addition to the obvious economic reasons to suspend filling the Reserve now, the Federal Government should not use oil taken as a ``Royalty-In-Kind'', RIK, from oil and gas production in the Federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico to fill the Reserve. By way of background, RIK is one of two methods used by the Government to collect the taxpayer's share of production from the Nation's substantial oil and gas mineral assets. The other method is good old-fashioned cash. 
   I have been arguing for years that the Royalty-in-Kind program is a bad idea. Under the pretense of ``enhanced transparency'' and ``reduced litigation,'' the oil industry, with a little help from its Republican friends in Congress and the Administration, snookered folks into believing that taxpayers would get a better deal if Federal oil and gas royalty payments were made ``in-kind'' instead of paying in cash. Despite report after report, investigations and potentially even criminal indictments, the Minerals Management Service, MMS, has forged ahead with this misbegotten program. Today, the RIK Program is selling over 800 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and over 150,000 barrels of crude oil per day on the open market. 
   The MMS reports that revenues from sales of RIK oil and gas in fiscal year 2006 were approximately $4.1 billion. However, we have no way of knowing if it got the best price or even broke even. Even the MMS itself estimates that the Royalty-in-Kind program only increased royalty revenues by a meager 0.3 percent--which according to the Government Accountability Office, GAO, during a recent Natural Resources Committee hearing, could not be confirmed. 
   As further evidence of the problems with RIK, earlier this year, the Inspector General for the Department of Energy found chronic mismanagement in the transfer of oil between the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy. During a brief 4-month period of oil transfers between the two agencies, approximately 32,000 barrels of oil were lost or could not be accounted for--that is almost $4 million worth of oil that is simply gone. The GAO also concluded that the current method for filling the Reserve is not cost-effective. 
   The bottom line--the Royalty-in-Kind program should not be used to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Not now, not ever. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important first step in reducing the pain Americans are feeling at the pump. It cuts off the flow of Royalty-in-Kind oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time when that flow is neither necessary nor prudent. I believe we need to pass this bill and then take a closer look at the Royalty-in-Kind program overall to see if that, too, is costing the American taxpayer more that it is worth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Today, it is my privilege to bring to the floor of the House of Representatives the ``Wild Monongahela Act: A National Legacy for West Virginia's Special Places.'' 
   This legislation is supported by the entire West Virginia delegation: In this body, my colleagues Representatives ALAN MOLLOHAN and SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, and in the other body, our Senators, ROBERT C. BYRD and JAY ROCKEFELLER. 
   The pending measure would designate 37,771 acres of Federal land as wilderness within the Monongahela National Forest. 
   Included in this legislation is the expansion of three existing wilderness areas: Cranberry, Dolly Sods and Otter Creek. Additionally, three new wilderness areas would be established: The Big Draft, the Roaring Plains West, and Spice Run. 
   The issue of wilderness has captivated many Americans since the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. According to this landmark statute, these are places ``where the Earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' 
   To be in a wilderness area is, to me, truly a humbling experience. To be part of designating wilderness is even more humbling because wilderness is an effort to retain the landscape as God has created it. 
   As the Reverend Dennis Sparks, Executive Director of the West Virginia Council of Churches wrote to me, and I quote, ``We believe that carefully protecting this wonderful national forest and its wilderness-quality lands not only has a sound biblical basis, but is also the best and most practical course of action for safeguarding the world which we will pass along to our children.'' 
   A great many people have worked to make this legislation possible: Matt Keller, Dave Saville, Mary Wimmer, Beth Little, Mayor John Manchester of Lewisburg, West Virginia, Bob Bittner, Jr., Mike Price, as well as the Reverend Sparks. And there are many others with whom I've hiked and with who I've worked on this legislation for which time will not allow me to name them all. 
   I would also like to express my appreciation to the Monongahela National Forest Supervisor, Clyde Thompson, as well as to Sammie Lammie, for his excellent map making. 
   And finally, to the Governor of West Virginia, Joe Manchin, and to the Division of our Natural Resources Director, Frank Jezioro. We have and will continue to work to ensure that appropriate wildlife management activities can take place in the areas designated by this bill.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. On May 14th, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel. 
   Over the last 60 years, Israel has built a nation, forged a new and democratic society, and created thriving economic, political, cultural and intellectual life. For six decades now, the United States and Israel have maintained a special relationship and the U.S. continues to regard Israel as a strong and trusted ally and an important strategic partner. 
   On the House floor today, H. Res. 322, reaffirms Congress's support for Israel and reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation which have existed between the United States and Israel and commits to strengthening those bonds. I too support Israel, its continued stability, democratic principles and its important role in the Middle East by extending the warmest congratulations and best wishes to the State of Israel and the Israeli people for a peaceful, prosperous, and successful future.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives starts our celebration of Earth Day with the consideration of two measures to designate wilderness on Federal lands in opposite ends of the country, Oregon, and in my home State of West Virginia. 
   As chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, I think it appropriate to recognize that in many places of this great Nation of ours, there remain areas with special features, unique landscapes teeming with wildlife that deserve and command conservation. 
   The pending measure, introduced by our colleague, Representative Peter DeFazio, would designate portions of the National Forest System land in Oregon as wilderness and potential wilderness, and designate segments of the Elk River as wild and scenic. 
   These areas include some of the last remaining stands of Port Orford Cedars in the Elk River watershed. Furthermore, the fisheries of the Elk River are known as one of the best salmon and steelhead producers in the continental United States. 
   This bill has broad support from the Governor of Oregon, the Curry County Commission, the Mayor of Port Orford, the Port Orford Chamber of Commerce, the Friends of the Elk River, Trout Unlimited, and the American Fisheries Society, the Oregon Chapter.  
   I wish to commend our colleague, a member of our Natural Resources Committee and our Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative DeFazio, for his outstanding work on this bill. 
   I support H.R. 3513.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, I am today in support of H.R. 799, the Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of 2007. This long overdue legislation continues to promote every one of the southern West Virginia counties I represent, and indeed the entire State of West Virginia, as it is the only State which lies entirely within ARC jurisdiction. 
   ``A rising tide,'' President Kennedy told us, ``lifts all boats.'' And so one of President Kennedy's legacies was created in 1965 with a unique mission to serve a unique part of the Nation, the Appalachian region. 
   Historically, the counties of Appalachia have ``faced high levels of poverty and economic distress resulting from geographic isolation and inadequate infrastructure.'' 
   It was with these concerns in mind that ARC was created and it is these concerns ARC has been addressing vigorously for the past 40 years. 
   Take for example the area of transportation, a major focus for ARC. ARC was developed, in part, because of the severe isolation experienced in Appalachia and that in order to develop Appalachia and give its people an opportunity to compete, a system of highways was needed. Enter the Appalachian Development Highway System, which was created to serve the transportation needs of Appalachian residents by assisting in the construction of highways so critically needed by Appalachian communities for economic growth and development. 
   The ADHS now encompasses over 3,000 miles of Appalachian highways and nearly 85 percent of those roads are complete or under construction. The ADHS is truly a success story for ARC and all of Appalachia. Despite the President's recent budget, which requests eliminating funding for the Appalachian Development Highway System, it is my strong conviction that this program be continued at the agreed upon level set forth in SAFETEA-LU. 
   Before I leave this subject of transportation and the critical value of rural America's transportation network to our urban brothers and sisters, it is my sincere hope that rural America's voice will be loud and clear when it comes to funding 
   schemes that would punish rural commuters and citizens who are forced by geography to drive long distances each day to and from their employment. It is an issue critical to the completion and maintenance of ARC development highways network. 
   And while a major focus of ARC remains on highways and Appalachian transportation infrastructure, as the times have changed so has ARC. 
   As much of the United States has been able to take advantage of the technological boom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Appalachia once again is in danger of being left behind and unable to compete in the global marketplace. 
   In the most recent FCC data on high-speed connections for Internet access, released on January 31, 2007, you can track the Appalachian mountain range by just how spotty the provider coverage is on the FCC's provider map. In fact, in West Virginia it is significantly below the average in broadband use nationwide. 
   Again, ARC is there to offer significant support, bringing broadband access to our communities, which is essential to leveling the playing field and giving our communities an opportunity to compete. Schools, businesses, local governments and individual homes all have benefited from ARC involvement in the expansion of broadband access in Appalachia, and continue to do so. 
   I have been working with ARC, private telecommunications companies and local economic development leaders to bring broadband technology into southern West Virginia. For example, through the E-commerce training initiatives being offered by ARC and others we are working to connect local small businesses to broadband, opening doors to Internet sales and services that just weren't there a couple of years ago. 
   It is ARC's ability to serve its mission by adapting its actions to fit the times that makes ARC such an invaluable resource to Appalachia and the Nation. From the Appalachian Development Highway System to the E-commerce and broadband initiatives, ARC continues to serve its mission by advocating for and partnering with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life. 
   I am also glad to see the integrity of ARC programs kept in tact by disallowing the use of earmarks in this legislation. I believe adoption of this provision is critical and will benefit all ARC member-states and the long-term viability of ARC itself. Additionally, I am pleased to see the bi-partisan support for this program which was displayed by the rejection of attempts to cut funding for it in the recent House passed FY08 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation. 
   I applaud the efforts of Federal Co-Chair Anne Pope who, as a native daughter of Appalachia, executes so well the mission of ARC in each of Appalachia's communities. I have said this before and am happy to do so again on the record, Anne is one of the finest Federal Co-Chairs to ever serve the people of Appalachia and I look forward to our continued strong relationship serving the needs of southern West Virginians, together. 
   I strongly support ARC, its mission and the incredibly successful initiatives it has undertaken to better the lives of the people of Appalachia and West Virginia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt, for yielding me the time. 
   While the Republicans continue to argue that opening more land is essential to lowering gasoline prices, the facts prove otherwise. We simply cannot drill our way to lower prices at the pump, and let's look at those facts. 
   Since 2000, the amount of drilling on Federal lands has steadily increased. Between 1999 and 2007, drilling permits on public lands has increased more than 361 percent; yet gas prices, as we all know too acutely, have risen dramatically. There is simply no correlation between the two. 
   Despite the Federal Government's willingness to make public lands available to energy production, of the 42 million acres of onshore Federal lands currently being leased by oil and gas companies, that's the red column here, only about 12 million are actually in production or producing oil and gas. The industry has this much available to them, and this is all they're using right here. They are obviously stockpiling these leases, and it's been evident for at least the past decade. 
   In 2007, for example, the government issued 7,561 permits to drill. Yet only 4,704 wells were started. Over the past 4 years, there have been 9,800 more permits issued than the wells drilled. 
   Today, the oil and gas industry holds in excess of 3,000 permits for onshore oil and gas development that they are not using to increase domestic production. 
   Now, here's the most important point for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Some would argue that the entire Outer Continental Shelf should be opened to oil and gas development. This is a specious argument as drilling off the coasts of California, Florida or Virginia has been consistently and repeatedly opposed by both parties. 
   And for those on the minority side who may want to vote for this motion to recommit, just remember: This will be viewed as a vote to allow oil and gas drilling off your shores. 
   According to the Department of the Interior, the parts of the OCS, primarily the Gulf of Mexico, that are currently open to drilling contain 79 percent of the oil and 82 percent of the natural gas that exists on the entire OCS.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. And as is the case with onshore, out of the 40 million acres currently being held by oil and gas companies, under lease, in the Outer Continental Shelf, the oil and gas industry has put less than 7 million of those acres into production. It's already there. It's available to them. Yet they're not using it, and they want to go elsewhere to drill. 
   In a nutshell, the industry has access to most of the estimated technologically recoverable natural gas that's occurring in the Federal OCS, in fact four times as much as is estimated by the Minerals Management Service to occur in the moratoria areas, but the industry is not developing it. 
   You cannot drill your way to lower gas prices at the pump. The industry has plenty available to them. Let them use what they already have before going into other pristine areas like ANWR.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD END COMMERCIAL WHALING -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 350, a resolution I introduced with the gentlelady from Guam, Ms. BORDALLO, and the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. DELAHUNT, urging the U.S. delegation attending the International Whaling Commission meeting in Santiago, Chile, to take a leadership role in ensuring the protection of the world's great whales. I wish to thank Chairman BERMAN and Subcommittee Chairman DELAHUNT for their support of my resolution and for ensuring its timely consideration today. 
   The American people care deeply about protecting whales, and the U.S. played a leading role in the adoption of the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the IWC. 
   Before the moratorium, whalers from many countries routinely exceeded quotas established by the IWC, and whale populations plummeted. Adoption of the moratorium and the end of the slaughter represented an historic milestone in the history of whale conservation, and many stocks have recovered.  
   Despite this, whales still face many threats--from pollution, climate change, and even continued hunting. Norway officially objected to the moratorium when it was adopted and resumed commercial whaling in 1993. Japan and Iceland exploit loopholes in the Convention and continue to hunt whales under the guise of ``scientific whaling,'' despite the fact that the scientific committee of the IWC has decried the need for and condemned the quality of this science. 
   At the same time, Japan is calling for the IWC to once again sanction commercial whaling in the form of ``coastal'' whaling, ``community'' whaling, or some other iteration of small-scale commercial whaling that will effectively eviscerate the moratorium, threatening to leave the IWC and resume larger-scale whaling operations unless their request is met. 
   The issues of commercial whaling under the guise of scientific or community whaling will likely be debated at this year's IWC meeting, and many will claim that the future of the organization is in jeopardy. We must be very careful, however, that our efforts to fix what some people perceive as a broken institution, do not come at the expense of the very species that institution is intended to protect. 
   H. Con. Res. 350 calls on the U.S. delegation to remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling in all its forms at the upcoming meeting of the IWC. The resolution urges the U.S. not only to oppose the unnecessary lethal taking of whales for scientific purposes, but also to reject proposals that would weaken or lift the moratorium by creating the new category of coastal or community whaling that is nothing more than commercial whaling in disguise. 
   Now, it is more critical than ever that the U.S. maintain its leadership role in shaping global whale conservation policies through the IWC. The American people strongly oppose commercial whaling of any kind, and the Administration must not undo more than 20 years of whale conservation by yielding to a few nations who threaten to leave the IWC. 
   In supporting this resolution, Congress recognizes the intrinsic value of these majestic animals, as well as the vital role whales play in the world's marine ecosystems. Conserving them for future generations requires us to uphold strong international agreements and maintain an unwavering commitment to protect these magnificent species from killing for commercial gain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, this year the week of November 18-24th has been designated ``National Bible Week,'' a week to renew our interest in the Bible and to recognize the influence that the Bible has had in our lives and on our nation throughout its history. 
   As a child growing up in West Virginia, I was encouraged by my father to read the Bible daily, because he found such solace and comfort in the Word. As Paul wrote in Philippians 4:13, ``I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want, I can do everything through Christ who gives me strength.'' 
   Knowing this soothes and comforts my soul in times of distress. It is my guiding light that keeps me centered and focused and I derive great joy from reading the scriptures during my time of mediation and reflection. 
   Today, God's Word written in the Holy Scriptures of the Bible is important to me both as an individual and as a leader. It is the Bible that guides me through the day, as I seek to make decisions that will affect people in my state and in our nation--decisions that require a wisdom that is found throughout the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. 
   It is the Word of God written in the Bible that gives me the fortitude I need to carry out my responsibilities as a friend, a father, a husband, and a Congressman. The Bible provides the wisdom to know how to respond to my family and constituents during times of dire crisis. 
   For these reasons, and many more, I thank God that we have a manual for our daily living in the Bible. 
   As we face the unforeseen challenges that lie ahead, both at home and abroad, I encourage all Americans to read the Bible and read it often, to study its teachings, and to make it an important part of their lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. RAHALL. (FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, it has been over a decade since Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Clause Termination Act. 
   While I have the deepest respect for my colleague from New Jersey who sponsored this amendment, I feel his amendment is overly broad and violates the letter and spirit of the ICCTA. 
   According to the Gentleman from New Jersey's amendment, any State and local agency can regulate railroad-owned, solid waste rail transfer facilities. 
   Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. 
   Adoption of this amendment would mean that if a railroad were to try and establish a solid waste transload facility, local government authorities would have very few checks on their ability to regulate this industry. 
   There are no jurisdictional requirements in this amendment, no limit to the number of authorities which could mount challenges. It would begin to dismantle, piece by piece, the federal preemption that is integral to our national rail system. 
   Many of the individuals supporting this amendment today will tell you how states are unable to protect their citizens under the current guidelines set forth by the Surface Transportation Board. 
   What you may not hear, is that a State can protect the health and safety of their citizens. 
   Should companies violate the laws and regulations governing health and safety problems, a state can use its police power, take the offending railroad to court, or petition the Surface Transportation Board to halt the railroads operations. 
   New Jersey was able to shut down three waste transload facilities earlier this year, because the facility violated the fire safety laws. 
   These transportation facilities were not created through judicial fiat, they are defined in the very legislation we crafted a decade ago. They were addressed wholesale because we knew that to grant certain commodities preemption, and deny it to others, would create a daunting patchwork of regulation. 
   This amendment, as well intentioned as it may be, begins the path down that slippery slope. What's next? Will a state's department of environmental protection decide that it doesn't like the transportation of coal, or liquid natural gas, because of the pollution it may cause? 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge the defeat of this poorly crafted amendment,

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, which reported the pending legislation sponsored by the gentleman from Massachusetts, Chairman Barney Frank, in support of this measure. 
   The 106th Congress authorized a study of the river to determine whether it is eligible for such designation. The National Park Service released a report in June of last year, finding that the river is eligible and identifying designation of the entire 40-mile segment as the environmentally preferred alternative.  
   H.R. 415 implements the study's findings by amending the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to add the Taunton River. 
   Some apparently feel that, in their opinion, the lower portion of the Taunton River is not deserving of designation. I would first point out that the bill designates this portion of the river as a recreational river--not as a wild or scenic river. This is a designation intended for river segments just like the lower Taunton. 
   More important, the experts at the National Park Service, the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation, and the 10 local communities along the banks, all think the river does qualify for designation and, with all due respect, their opinions are more informed. Opponents of this river designation have attempted to Iink this legislation to the apparent demise of a liquefied natural gas facility that had once been proposed along the banks of the Taunton. 
   Approval for the LNG facility was denied--twice--by the United States Coast Guard for reasons having nothing to do with the wild and scenic designation. In fact, the designation was proposed long before the LNG facility was announced. 
   This is a good piece of legislation, the river is worthy of designation, and I urge the adoption of this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise this today in strong support of the passage of H.R. 1595--the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. I also commend the gentlelady from Guam for her leadership on this issue. This legislation has bipartisan support and is being considered today because of her determination to seek justice. 
   We are here this afternoon, taking a significant step forward to close a very painful chapter in Guam's history. From the time that Guam had been granted a delegate to Congress in the 1970's, throughout the service of our former colleagues--Mr. Won Pat, Mr. Blaz, and Mr. Underwood--this House has been made aware and constantly reminded that Guam and her people suffered unimaginable atrocities during its occupation by Japan during World War II. For nearly three years, the idyllic paradise became a land of panic, horror, suffering, and death. 
   The personal testimonies of survivors of Guam's occupation has a strong history with the Committee on Natural Resources. They are emotional, sad, and graphic. Many of those survivors who appeared before the Committee to re-tell and, in essence, re-live the pain of occupation have since passed on. There are very few of the estimated 22,000 Guamanians alive today who survived this era, and it is my hope that we can give them closure before none remain. 
   There now have been two federally appointed Commissions that have reviewed the implementation and the parity treatment of Guam's experience--the Hopkins Commission in 1947, and the Review Commission in 2004. Both concluded that the people of Guam were either misinformed or mistreated. Either way, their recommendations to Congress--be it in 1947 or in 2004--are that something needs to be done to make this right. 
   The weight of history now falls on the shoulders of this House, nearly sixty-three years  after Guam's liberation. We have the opportunity by passing H.R. 1595 to correct a great injustice for those patriotic Americans who withstood brutal occupation. 
   The issue has been studied to exhaustion and the recommendations have remained the same. We should never forget their sacrifice for our country, nor should we allow for this inequity to continue. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 1595--the Guam World War II Loyalty Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3058, the Public Land Communities Transition Assistance Act. As the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, I do want to express my deep appreciation to the gentleman from Oregon, PETER DEFAZIO, for his strongly tenacious efforts and determined determination on behalf of this legislation. He has more than adequately explained the bill. My purpose is to stress the urgency of this body acting on the legislation. 
   This legislation, commonly referred to as the ``county payments bill,'' was enacted in 2000 to provide stability in revenue sharing payments made to the States and counties containing Federal forest lands. This funding has been extremely important, critically so in many cases, in assisting schools and communities in rural counties across the country, including my home State of West Virginia. Yet the Congress has failed to reauthorize the program. 
   This Congress, with a Democratic majority, is attempting to pick up the pieces of a program that was looking at being eliminated square in the eye. Last year we managed to pass a 1-year extension of county payments, but that is due to expire at the end of this month. So I cannot stress enough the urgency of today's vote. 
   Critical funding for schools and county services across the country will evaporate if we do not act today. Indeed, the National Forest Counties and Schools Coalition estimates that about 7,000 teachers and other educational staff will be laid off as of June 30th when their contracts expire if this body does not act. That is something worth thinking about. Students in rural forest counties across this Nation will be deprived of almost 7,000 teachers and the other educational staff. 
   Now, some have taken issue with the pay-for, the offset being used for this bill, which is a conservation of resources fee on a class of Federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico that  are unduly enjoying royalty relief by virtue of not having price thresholds. 
   This is not a new proposal. This body has considered it before, and rightly so. My colleagues, to date the American people have been deprived of over $1 billion in Federal royalties as a result of this situation. That is over 1 billion with a ``B'' dollars, something worth thinking about. 
   We now learn that in the future if this situation is not corrected, the American people will be fleeced to the tune of $4 billion and to a high of $14 billion.

   Mr. RAHALL. That figure could go as high as $14 billion, depending on the price of oil and natural gas and the amount produced from these leases. 
   So it is very important that we recognize this bill does have funding sources and that is what we are trying to do here, at the same time generating funds to pay for teachers and the education of our school children.

   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, I insist on my point of order and raise a point of order that the motion to recommit contains nongermane instructions in violation of clause 7 of rule XVI. The instructions in the motion to recommit address an unrelated matter within the jurisdiction of a committee not represented in the underlying bill. 
   The second reason, the motion to recommit uses the word ``promptly,'' as we all know, which kills a bill. 
   And third, the motion to recommit is the exact language already in the bill. That language states ``nothing in the amendment made by section 2 of this act shall prohibit or hinder the development, production, conveyance, or transmission of energy,'' the exact repeat language of the motion to recommit.     
   Therefore, I insist on my point of order.

   Mr. RAHALL. Madam Speaker, the form of the amendment, which calls on the House to promptly recommit the bill, as I know all Members realize, is a parliamentary tactic that kills the bill. That wording makes it perfectly clear that the motion is not about its subject. It is purely and simply another one of those ``gotcha'' votes. 
   A vote to recommit is a vote to kill this bill, which has the support of a long and bipartisan list of Members, a large and vocal constituency across eight districts and the District of Columbia, and the support of the Bush administration. Again, the current legislation as written has the support of the Bush administration. It has the support of the National Rifle Association. 
   To briefly address the substance of this issue, the bill before the House already reaffirms the right of gun owners and hunters by ensuring that current State management of fish and resident wildlife will remain unaffected by the bill. It should not be necessary to include this language because nothing in the bill would affect those State laws or regulations. Nevertheless, we have included this language already in the bill, which renders the motion before us wholly unnecessary. 
   The Trails Act has been around since 1968, and we have thousands of miles of trails all over the country, and all over the country hunting, fishing, trapping have flourished nonetheless. The bill already contains sufficient protections for gun owners. I repeat. The bill already contains sufficient protections for gun owners. 
   A vote to recommit is a vote to kill the bill. It's that simple, and I would urge all Members to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, we are considering H.R. 1286, legislation introduced by our colleague, Representative Maurice Hinchey of New York. I might also add that it was some 9 years ago that the initial study on this legislation was initiated by our colleague from Connecticut, Mr. John Larson, and I wish to commend his leadership, as well as Mr. Hinchey's leadership on the pending bill. 
   The pending legislation will designate a National Historic Trail, tracing the routes taken in 1781 by the armies of General George Washington and French Count Rochambeau on their march from New England to face the British Army at Yorktown, Virginia. 
   The story of this trail is a fascinating piece of our history. The French Army, after wintering in Newport, Rhode Island, marched southwest in early July to join General Washington and his troops at Phillipsburg, New York. On August 18, the soldiers, and their provisions and armaments, started to slip away from Philipsburg. 
   The troops and their supplies traveled 600 miles over a network of strategic roads and waterways through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, the future District of Columbia, and Virginia. They reached Williamsburg in late September, 1781. 
   With a French fleet in the Chesapeake, blocking British reinforcements from New York or a sea escape for Cornwallis' troops, Washington and Rochambeau laid siege to Cornwallis' army at Yorktown. Three weeks later, on October 19, 1781, the British troops laid down their arms. 
   I would note that when we bring forth legislation of this nature, concerns have been raised in some corridors regarding any potential impacts on private property rights. I can assure this Committee that most of this trail follows public roads or crosses public lands. While the historic route does cross some private lands, the National Park Service does not propose or anticipate any acquisition of private lands.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   For some time now, the Democrats on this side have been watching our colleagues on the other side of the aisle time after time on bill after bill come to the floor and defend multinational oil conglomerates, and now they claim to be the friends of coal as well. 
   My colleague from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) gave us a great presentation on coal-to-liquids, as has been done a number of times, and there is not much I can disagree with in his presentation about the coal-to-liquids. But it is, and the fact of the matter is, that it is pure and simple that it is the oil industry and their defenders here in the Congress that have time and time again undermined the viability of a true alternative fuels industry in this country. And let me back that up by example. 
   In the 1940s, the Synthetic Liquids Fuels Act passed the Congress and appropriated over $80 million for research and production. By the 1950s, America was producing thousands of gallons of synthetic gasoline a day at a test plant in Missouri. But the discovery of cheap oil combined with a lobbying effort by the oil industry caused the government to abandon its synthetic fuel research. 
   Let's hark back to the 1970s and that oil crisis that we all faced and the long gasoline lines. The Federal Government briefly pursued synthetic fuel production. But once again, when the price of oil receded, interest in coal-derived fuels faded. And here we are again, with oil prices and talk of synthetic fuels both on the rise. 
   The Congress has a duty, a responsibility to the American people to do much more than simply coddle the oil industry and let history repeat itself. We also need to do more to discourage foreign oil cartels from temporarily manipulating oil prices for the sole purpose of destroying a competitive domestic fuel source. 
   And if my friends on the other side of the aisle were serious about coal, they would be pressuring this White House to back away, the two oil men in charge, to back away from its cozy relationship with those cartels. Instead, they want to roll over and give Big Oil everything it wants, no strings attached.  
   Furthermore, the Republican-led Congress had 6 years under the Bush administration to go about making meaningful contributions to clean coal and coal-to-liquids fuels. If Republicans in Congress were truly serious about producing the next generation of these technologies, then we would already be seeing these technologies coming to light today and the capabilities thereof. 
   I would remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that in 2000, President Bush while running for office pledged to spend $2 billion over 10 years for a clean coal technology program, a program that the Democrats initiated in the 1980s. He never made good on that promise and allowed in only about half of the promised money while claiming credit for the full pledge. 
   During its tenure in leadership of the Congress, the Republican Party did nothing to buck the President's low balling for clean coal programs. Again and again, the President's party voted for his budgets to cut funds for clean coal research. 
   Now, if the other side were truly serious about supporting coal, they would have added funding to clean coal budgets and they would have done more to put coal on a more even footing with oil and gas. They did not, and now we are seeing the consequences of high energy prices that Americans are experiencing. 
   So the fact of the matter is that the energy challenges that our Nation faces demand more than rhetorical battles on the floor of this body. Certainly our constituents would agree, and they are feeling the energy pinch and deserve much better. 
   We need to put our energies into finding common ground to achieve real workable solutions to our energy problems. And towards that end, we need to be working on our energy challenge from two ends at the same time: The environmental end and the supply end. If we take that approach, then we can build a viable coal-to-liquids industry. 
   Unfortunately, too much of the talk in this body in recent weeks has been focused only on supply, and not enough of it has considered the environmental hurdles that we face. 
   As worldwide pressure mounts to address carbon emissions, the coal-to-liquids industry recognizes that to be economically successful, it must also be environmentally successful. But this administration has done nothing to help the coal industry address the environmental side of this energy challenge. So we need to invest more in environmental research and development, something that Democrats have been arguing for, but that our Republican colleagues during their 12 years in control of Congress have continually relegated to the back burners. 
   By failing to lay the environmental foundations for coal's future, this administration has opened the opportunity for foreign nations, most notably China, to bolster their coal fuels industry, putting our own Nation's future fuel production and economy at a disadvantage. This administration has failed to invest in new emissions technologies, technologies that we can use here and we can sell overseas; and, as a result, we risk watching worldwide emissions grow unchecked as we become more and more beholden to yet another set of foreign producers for our fuel, with China at the very lead. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I say to my colleagues on the other side who keep coming to the floor on bill after bill and speaking about the energy crunch, which is indeed on the uppermost of every American's mind today and the high price of gas, that we do need to address this in a bipartisan way and in a way that uses all of our domestic sources of energy and in a way that does not coddle one domestic energy fuel over all others, especially when that energy fuel is trying for its own competitive advantages to put other domestic sources of energy at a disadvantage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment addresses a concern that is truly far beyond the likely impact of this bill. The bill expressly limits Federal condemnation of land for the trail which is all that should concern us here and the National Park Service. This amendment seems to be based on the assumption that the Federal Government in some smoke-filled back  room conspiracy-type of mind-set is going to conspire with State or local governments to have them condemn land and then turn it over to the Federal government. 
   First of all, I don't believe this happens often, if ever. We have really reached an extreme level of detail here where we have to legislate out to the far corners of what anybody might imagine might some day happen. But for the sake of argument, let's say that a State does decide to condemn land and pay the owner for his property. Such a decision will be up to the State or local government acting in what that unit of government believes to be the best interest of its citizens. Whether the State or local government subsequently conveys the land to the Federal Government is irrelevant. 
   And I might add, just for the record, this is not a trail like the Appalachian Trail which cuts across country and private property, it is more a series of signs like those gray historic markers you see along roads all over the country. Most of the route travels along public highways and roads. No private landowner will be forced to let tourists on their land, and the NPS anticipates no Federal acquisition at all. 
   But nevertheless, in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation and all that I have just said, we are willing to accept this amendment. We think that it is unnecessary, but we are willing to accept it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Chairman, in evaluating this amendment, I would ask that Members first read section 3 of the underlying bill which states, ``Nothing in this Act shall prohibit or hinder the development, production, conveyance, or transmission of energy.'' So by its own terms, H.R. 1286 will have no impact whatsoever on energy production. 
   The Pearce amendment would require the Secretary to assess the impact this trail designation will have on energy production. In other words, the Pearce amendment would require the Secretary to study impacts that would never exist. That's similar to a requirement that the secretary study the Tooth Fairy or the Easter Bunny. The bill says there will be no impacts, so studying them is impossible. Such a report would read in its entirety, ``We find no impacts on energy production because the bill prohibits them.'' Period. The end. 
   It is my hope that this amendment is simply a platform, and I think the sponsor of it has already used it for that to restate some of their talking points on energy production. It's my hope that no one could ever seriously suggest assessing the energy resources that might lie under George Washington's front lawn. 
   The first part of this amendment is completely unnecessary because the underlying language in the bill makes impacts on energy production a non-issue. The second part of this amendment contemplates oil rigs and wind farms in places that we would never allow them to be built. 
   So once again, as with the previous amendment, this amendment is not necessary. Therefore, I will not object to it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 186, introduced by our colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, Representative Henry Brown, honors the 75th anniversary of Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina. 
   When Brookgreen Gardens opened to the public in 1932, they were the first public sculpture gardens in the country. The gardens reflect the distinguished career of Anna Hyatt Huntington, a sculptor whose work spanned a period of 70 years. 
   On October 5, 1992, the Secretary of the Interior recognized the significance of the site by designating Brookgreen Gardens as a National Historic Landmark based on the more than 550 works of American artists displayed in the sculpture portion of the gardens.
