<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I just would like to say to my friend across the aisle that I, as a member of the Democratic majority, consider the repeated, deliberate use of the phrase ``Democrat majority'' to be a pejorative use. That is not certainly what we call ourselves. And we could call you the Republic minority, but we don't. So, in the interest of bipartisanship and comity, I would suggest ``Democratic majority'' is the normal term to use. 
   I congratulate you on accepting and adopting most of the parts of your plan from our plan. The renewable energy and conservation components, which, by the way, the Vice President sneered at in 2002, I think it was, when he said that conservation may be a personal virtue, but it is no way to build a national energy policy. 
   We have been working, in this Congress, in the last year and a half to pass the first increase in fuel mileage standards in 32 years, to provide record, billions of dollars to alternative fuels research and development, record billions of dollars for carbon sequestration so that we can use coal that we have in this country without releasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
   We have been trying, and I might say that perhaps your friend or the colleague in the Republican Party in the other body, Senator Domenici, could use a little talking to, perhaps from you, to get him to drop his resistance to the renewable energy standard and to the extension of the renewable tax credits which we have been fighting for on this side and have been stymied in the Senate by a small number of Republicans who are holding that up. 
   But allow me to go to what I was going to say, which is that in New York this morning, gas prices are over $4.25 and in some cases $4.50 and have been this high for weeks. These sky high prices are squeezing families in my district right now. Today we are trying to give them relief using SPR oil to increase supply and bring down prices. 
   A release of oil from the SPR is a proven method of calming markets and lowering prices. The last three Presidents have used it successfully. And I urge all my colleagues to support it to do the same thing today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (PASS ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, times are rough right now. Signs of economic turmoil are multiplying, and we seem to be headed for, or already are in, a recession. Last week stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, and only an emergency rate change by the Federal Reserve prevented them from falling even farther. 
   The people I represent in the Hudson Valley have been particularly hard hit. Oil has passed the $100-a-barrel mark, making it more expensive than ever for people to heat their homes and drive their cars. In suburban communities in the Northeast, like the area I represent, home heating bills are up by more than 30 percent over last year. 
   Expenses are rising; wages are stagnating. As a result, families struggle to pay their everyday costs. Our debts increase and investment in our future plummets. 
   Congress must act quickly. I am proud that this Congress will pass legislation today to stimulate the economy to help people and businesses, but especially the working families who need it most.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the price of oil broke another record yet again, closing at over $120. Families feel the impact of these costs every time they shell out close to $4 a gallon at the pump. In districts like mine, where commuting is a way of life, it's forcing some painful sacrifices. 
   Our oil dependence has become the energy albatross around America's economic neck, and I'm proud that the majority in Congress has advanced ideas for short-term relief and long-term solutions. We've pushed for higher tax incentives for hybrid cars, expanded the use of renewables and efficiency, consumer protection to keep the oil companies honest, and a timeout from taking 70 million barrels a day of oil off the market and putting it into the strategic petroleum reserve, the SPR. 
   What is the response from the President and his allies here in Congress? Let's go drill for some more oil that won't hit the markets for another 10 years, and let's keep sending more taxpayer dollars to the oil companies that are already making record profits. 
   Most Americans would agree that we cannot wait a decade for relief and we shouldn't send anymore of their money to Big Oil. Let's stop filling the SPR to provide immediate relief and ask the President to move with us into a green, domestic, job-producing energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise today in support of this rule because last November the American people sent a new majority to Congress with a clear mission, to reduce our energy dependence on foreign oil, fight skyrocketing energy prices, and to protect our environment. The landmark legislation before the House today makes good on that goal. 
   You know, in my district, we're able to buy wind power on the back of our electric bill. My wife and I burn 20 percent soy biodiesel in our home heating oil in our furnace. We're driving an American-made hybrid car which today gets 33 miles per gallon, although one can get 35 if one drives a little slower with a gentle foot on the accelerator. These things are attainable now. The technologies, many of them are available now. 
   We had a woman call our office and say, I'm all excited; I just got a flex fuel vehicle. Where can I get some flex fuel? And my staff had to tell her that there were two pumps in New York State for E-85. 
   There's plenty of supply. We've heard in front of the select committee that there's a surplus right now of both biodiesel and ethanol, but not the infrastructure to get them to market. And so we need to put the supply and the demand together, and that will produce more incentive for people to develop these biofuels. I believe that they can be produced, and they are being produced, in fact, by several producers in my district. 
   This sweeping array of provisions on this bill includes two historic measures. First of all, the first CAFE standard fuel economy increase in three decades, which will save drivers $1,000 at the pump and cut Persian Gulf oil imports in half. And for the first time we will adopt a renewable energy standard so we can replace the polluting electric generation plants we rely on today with domestically produced power that helps us fight climate change. 
   With energy prices burdening our working families, dependence on foreign oil continuing to undermine our sovereignty, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I assure you that this Member is serious and sincere, and I strongly support the DRILL bill. 
   Gas in my district in the Hudson Valley is over $4.30, and families are paying and really being hurt by this. They need serious solutions that deliver real results, and that's why I support the Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands Act to take action right now to extract more American oil in the right places. 
   Oil company advocates have been preying on the anxiety of Americans to push the failed ANWR drilling plan that would only lower prices by a nickel in 20 years, 20 years in the future. Our drivers need more help than that, and they need it faster. The DRILL Act answers the call, telling oil companies to drill for oil that can give more relief than ANWR ever could. 
   The ``use it or lose it'' measure requires oil companies to drill on land they have already leased or make way for someone who will. If they did that, they could double production and cut imports by one-third. It also makes it easier to lease the 20 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, already approved for drilling, and calls on the President to build pipelines to bring that 10.6 billion barrels of oil to market. The bill will pave the way to get at the most oil in the shortest time with the greatest responsibility. 
   I hope all of my colleagues will support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I stand here to support the Employee Free Choice Act because it is necessary. 
   This bill would not be necessary were the administration and the NLRB neutral in labor relations. However, they are not and have not been. Therefore, I am hearing from my constituents, such as citizens of my district who work for a school bus company which won an election many months ago which has not yet been certified by the NLRB.  
   While the NLRB is dawdling, there have been 16 consecutive labor charges filed against the union by the management. This company, by the way, is owned by another company in England which is 96 percent unionized in England. So apparently it is good enough for them to have union representation there, but not here. 
   I speak and vote in favor of my constituent who distributes dialysis equipment and supplies around the New York and Hudson Valley area who was called in for repeated meetings with his supervisors when they learned that he was helping to organize a union drive. Even after the election was won, management filed an appeal and lost.     
   If it were not for such, I could go on for a long time with stories I have heard in my districts from my constituents, and what I am hearing is about harassment, intimidation, about anti-union propaganda on the lunch table, in the lockers, on the bus seats. Look at the evidence. Look at the disparity in income. Look at the increase in poverty rate and the explosion of wealth at the top of our income scale. 
   What we are seeing here is the result of a systematic tilting of the playing field. This bill tends to tilt it back towards working families.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, today the House of Representatives will consider an important package of reforms that, when adopted by this chamber, will take the first necessary steps toward restoring fiscal responsibility in our government. I am proud to be a cosponsor of these measures, which will allow us to undertake the critical tasks of balancing our budget and controlling our national debt. 
   For too long, our government has operated under a ``buy now, pay later'' philosophy that, if left unchanged, will force our children and grandchildren to foot the bill with increasingly dire consequences. The fiscal responsibility provisions put forward today will help us avoid this generational buck passing by imposing some much-needed discipline on the budgeting process. The package of reforms put forward today accomplishes that by preventing the House from considering budget measures that would increase the federal deficit. 
   One of the most important reforms we are advancing today is the reinstitution of ``PAYGO'' rules to govern the Congressional budgeting process. Although the overall budget process can be technical and complex, ``PAYGO'' simply means what it sounds like: you pay as you go. The ``PAYGO'' provision creates a barrier to passing legislation that would further inflate our huge national deficit and mortgage our country's future. 
   Congress operated under ``PAYGO'' rules from 1990 until 2002 with clear results. Under the ``PAYGO'' constraints on spending, our government was able to balance the budget, create budget surpluses, and reduce the national debt by $453 billion. Since the mistaken move away from the ``PAYGO'' rules, deficit spending is back and our national debt has spiraled out of control. As of today, the total national debt is almost an astonishing $8.7 trillion or almost $29,000 for every person in the United States. Disturbingly, much of this debt is held by America's economic competitors, including China. Instead of demonstrating the leadership needed to turn this dangerous fiscal tide, our government has not taken steps to curtail earmarks, our President has never vetoed a spending bill, and we have yet to demonstrate the will to do what is necessary. 
   I am proud to say that with today's reform package we can begin to change that. It is in our vital interest to get spending under control to eliminate deficits and return to paying down our debt. It will require difficult choices and the will to change business as usual in Washington, but it is our responsibility to meet that challenge by passing these reforms.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the Hinchey-Wolf amendment to force the DOE to take a time-out from its rush to subject giant stretches of this country to eminent domain for energy interests. 
   In my State, in my district, the New York Regional Interconnect, for instance, NIRE, is an internationally financed private entity which will receive eminent domain rights to seize private land for private profit. It would remove the State environmental review process and all property rights and States rights from the equation and give that all to FERC. I think this is something that needs much closer examination. 
   New York City, I would reassure my colleagues from downstate, does not need NIRE to have power, especially not this route. In fact, there are alternate routes that the State could and would look at if it had the time that it would normally have under CCRA. 
   I urge support for the Hinchey-Wolf amendment in the interest of property rights and States rights.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just want to point out, in response to a couple of remarks that were made, this project that Mr. Arcuri, Mr. Hinchey, and I are concerned with, which could happen anywhere in the country to any of you, is not an interstate project. It occurs entirely within New York State, mysteriously starting in Utica and mysteriously ending in the little town of Campbell Hall. The other shoes have not dropped yet. But in New York State's Environmental Quality Review Act, nothing gets approved in under a year. 
   The proposal in section 1221 that after a year it kicks up authority to FERC is patently meant to usurp State authority. You can't get a subdivision, a power plant, a landfill, hardly any public project approved that fast. It usually takes a draft environmental impact statement; public comment; a final environmental impact statement; and at long last, approval. But two years is the shortest that I have ever seen. So to have this be one year means to me that the law was written to usurp State authority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my admiration and support for the brave men and women of our military who are nobly serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. In Afghanistan, they continue to perform an important mission by taking action against our enemies in the country that served as host to the Al Qaeda organization that attacked the United States of America on September 11th, 2001, and they do so with complete skill, courage, and professionalism. I am fully supportive of them and their mission. I have voted to provide funding solely for our military activities in Afghanistan, and would do so again if such a bill were to come before the House. 
   However, the funding measure in Amendment Number 1 brought before the House today included funding for the ongoing war in Iraq without accompanying conditions on those funds or a timeline for withdrawal of American forces. I remain opposed to the President's mistaken war in Iraq, which has now claimed over 4,000 American lives, undermined our military and ability to respond to other threats abroad, and cost hundreds of billions of dollars that could have been used to meet pressing needs at home. I believe that we must change course in Iraq, and cannot support the appropriation of additional funds without measures to impose conditions on that funding and start bringing our troops home. Accordingly, I could not vote for Amendment Number 1.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, we are in a housing crisis in the United States, yet the Bush administration seems determined to ignore it. 
   Losing your home has a deep economic and emotional impact that can last for years. When the mortgage crisis broadens as wide as it has, entire communities, not just individuals, face dire consequences for the future. 
   In the Hudson Valley of New York, we have been especially hard hit. Over the last 3 months, foreclosures in Westchester County were up almost 40 percent from last year, and they've more than tripled since 2005. Putnam County, also in my district, has the single highest foreclosure rate of any county in New York State. 
   This crisis demands bold action. This Congress has already expanded the Federal loan limits to make Federal protections available to more home buyers, now we need to extend these Federal guarantees to more homeowners in need. This Congress will not only protect institutions like Bear Stearns, but will also protect American families who remain at great risk.

   ``Of all the enemies of true liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded because it compromises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes. And armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. 
   ``In war, too, the discretionary power of the executive is extended. Its influence in dealing out offices, honors and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people. This same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manner and of morals engendered in both. No nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual war. War is, in fact, the true nurse of executive aggrandizement.''

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, tonight, as part of consideration of the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act of 2007, the minority offered a motion to recommit forthwith with the proclaimed intent of clarifying the circumstances under which motorized vehicles can enter wilderness areas. However, I am concerned that the language of the motion may actually work at cross purposes with that goal. 
   The MTR stated that: ``The designation of lands as wilderness or a wilderness study area by an amendment made by this section does not prohibit the use of motor vehicles, motorized equipment, or motorboats or the landing of aircraft or other forms of mechanical transport, on the designated lands when required in connection with an emergency involving the health and safety of persons, including search and rescue efforts or the response to an Amber Alert.'' 
   I don't know anyone who believes that we shouldn't be able to use motorized equipment in a wilderness to react to an emergency. It's common sense, and that's why it's already included in the underlying statute. In fact, the underlying law makes the allowance for motorized equipment in a health or safety emergency without enumerating specific types of equipment or circumstances, giving the widest possible scope of interpretation. I am concerned that by listing specific pieces of equipment and circumstances, the motion offered tonight could have caused more confusion and possibly limited the ability to respond to emergencies, despite any good intentions. For this reason, I voted against it.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today with my esteemed colleague from Oregon to offer an amendment that will help communities across the country pay for wastewater projects, protect their environment and preserve their open spaces by combating sprawl. 
   Today's action on the underlying bill comes not a moment too soon. Nationwide, there is over a $300 billion shortfall in funding for wastewater projects. In my district, we have $500 million in projects that can't get funding just because the dollars aren't there. 
   Communities in the Hudson Valley and elsewhere are also trapped in a battle to balance the booming population with the preservation of water resources and open spaces. 
   By requiring States to prioritize spending of revolving loan funds of moneys on existing projects, this amendment will help address both of these challenges by helping to bolster existing communities, instead of haphazardly subsidizing the building of new developments. 
   There is an old adage that says, ``Work smarter, not harder.'' For many of our rural and suburban and rural communities, the only way to accommodate growth without sacrificing precious open space is to build smarter, not wider. Targeting moneys to projects that will help existing communities provide expanded and improved water treatment will meet that test. Without a smart growth strategy, the loss of open spaces, runoff created by the change from soil to pavement and other impacts will wreak havoc on our environment. 
   If we don't take aggressive action to make smart growth the guiding principle of development, we will end up squandering our resources, jeopardizing our health, and damaging our economy. 
   The amendment will also do one thing that I think, quite frankly, the Federal Government should be doing more of, giving property taxpayers and municipalities much needed relief. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much Congressman Hinchey and thank Congresswoman Kaptur for her remarks. 
   Today marks the start of the 5th year of the war in Iraq; and as I begin my statement, I want to recognize the honorable service of the men and women who have served our country in Iraq. I want to honor the memories of the 3,188 servicemembers who have given their lives in Iraq, including five men from my district and over 50 officers of the United States Army who graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, which I am proud is in my district. While I believe the war in Iraq has been a mistake, I deeply respect the honor and integrity of those who have given their lives following the orders of their Commander in Chief. 
   In light of the sacrifices of so many of our men and women in uniform, it saddens me that I have to come to the floor of the House of Representatives and say I believe this war has been a strategic blunder in our efforts to fight terrorism. 
   On September 11, our Nation was attacked and many people from my district, including police and firefighters, died at the World Trade Center. The United States correctly responded by pursuing those responsible for 9/11 in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, this administration decided to change its focus and start a war of choice with Iraq, a country which had not attacked us and was not an imminent threat to the United States. 
   Now our military is trapped in the middle of a civil war instead of pursuing Osama bin Laden, Mullah Mohammed Omar, and other al Qaeda affiliates throughout the world responsible for 9/11 and other similar attacks and groups planning to attack the United States again. 
   Because we are focused in Iraq, the progress made in Afghanistan is slipping. The Karzai government does not control the territory outside its own capital. We see an increase in the drug trade that funds regional warlords. The Taliban emerges at night to terrorize the local population, and our military expects increasing attacks throughout this spring. However, because of our continuing overcommitment in Iraq, the United States has little ability to increase its troop numbers in Afghanistan and respond to that deteriorating situation. 
   While the administration and its allies say we are battling the terrorists in Iraq, the United States intelligence agencies say otherwise. The National Intelligence Estimate released in April 2006 stated: ``The Iraq conflict has become a `cause celebre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.'' Iraq is not the central front in the war on terror as the President likes to say. Instead, it is a rallying point, a recruiting poster that Osama bin Laden uses to recruit more terrorists. 
   The war in Iraq has seriously weakened our military. A recent report found that 90 percent of our National Guard youths are rated ``not ready'' to respond to a national disaster or terrorist attack in the United States. Further, in order to meet their recruitment goals, the military has lowered the minimum standards for being accepted into the service, and our military faces a crippling loss of mid-level officers as larger and larger numbers decide not to reenlist and face multiple deployments. 
   It is time for a new direction. Our intelligence agencies know it, our military commanders know it, and the American people demanded it last November. General Petraeus, commanding general in Iraq, stated on March 8: ``There is no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq, to the insurgency of Iraq.'' And just last week, Pentagon analysts admitted that the war in Iraq is a civil war. 
   Unfortunately, our President refuses to face reality and the will of the American people. He wants to put more troops in the middle of a civil war. He wants an open-ended commitment to keep combat troops in Iraq indefinitely. He wants to leave the problem of Iraq to the next President. And, once again, he has returned to Congress and asked for another blank check to continue this misguided war. Unlike the President, this Congress will face reality and realize that we must change direction in Iraq. 
   Some of our colleagues speaking earlier from the other side of the floor criticized us for trying to, as they say, micromanage the war. There cannot be 435 or 535 Commanders in Chief. We would not need to take this kind of action to manage or, if you will, micromanage the war if the President and Commander in Chief were doing his job, if the leadership were coming from the top, as our structure of government ordinarily calls for it to come. 
   But because there is a vacuum in the top, because the President has continued to disregard or turn a blind eye to the reality of what is happening, not only around the world, as our Congresswoman just mentioned, in terms of the reputation of the United States, which ultimately in the long term is what will determine our security, our reputation, the approval of the United States and its policies by other peoples and other countries around the world will ultimately determine in the long run how secure we are, we do not have enough money to spend our way into security if we continue to make more enemies and lose our friends. 
   General Petraeus is correct. We need a political solution to the war in Iraq instead of a military escalation. It is time for a diplomatic surge. The United States must push the Iraqi Government to meet its commitments that it made to its partners in Iraq. It is time the United States reached out to our allies in the region and throughout the world. 
   By requiring the Iraqi Government to achieve a list of objectives and establishing a timetable for U.S. involvement in Iraq, we can end the culture of dependency developing in Iraq. We can make the Iraqi Government stand up and take control of its own fate. If they do that, we will stick by them. We will help them train police and military forces and rebuild their country. If they are unwilling or unable to take that responsibility, we will know that the United States does not have a serious partner in Iraq. 
   If we are to defeat the people who did attack our country on September 11, those who continue to seek to destroy us, we must pivot away from Iraq and back to Afghanistan and al Qaeda, the people who actually attacked us. We must draw down in Iraq and let our military redeploy, rebuild, and refocus. 
   The United States faces a gravely serious threat, and we must be prepared to defeat it. Our 4-year involvement in Iraq has seriously endangered our ability to do that. At home, our National Guard has been undermined. It is unprepared to respond to a terrorist attack or a natural disaster. Abroad, our military forces are stretched thin and unable to shift quickly. 
   If we really want to defeat Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda and the other terrorist groups that seek to kill us, we must return our attention to that war and leave the civil war we currently face in Iraq to the Iraqis. If we rebuild our forces and refocus on the threats in Afghanistan, Pakistan and throughout southeast Asia, we will be able to truly defeat our enemies and truly protect the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week the Senate took historic action by approving the first meaningful increase in CAFE standards in over 30 years. 
   The Senate bill would raise the average efficiency of all cars on the road to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The result would be dramatic relief for working families at the gas pump, significant cuts in demand for foreign oil, and the reduction of tailpipe emissions that lead to climate change and air pollution. 
   If we are serious about ending our dependence on foreign oil and combating climate change, we have to take real action on car efficiency. At a time when many cars on the road are already capable of meeting this standard, the consumers are voting with their dollars by buying record numbers of hybrids. We simply cannot wait. 
   By acting to raise CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon, this House can take courageous action to meet some of the greatest challenges of our time, keep our domestic auto industry competitive, keep those jobs in these countries, and do not concede the efficiency market to foreign manufacturers. 
   I hope the House will take this visionary action.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that I find it amusing to be lectured about energy independence and working hard to get things done from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who for the last 6 years could have solved these problems, but instead watched us sink further into dependence on foreign and polluting sources of energy. 
   In April 2005, President Bush was quoted as saying, ``With oil at more than $50 a barrel, energy companies do not need taxpayer incentives to explore for oil and gas.'' Then, even as prices went higher, he and the Republican Congress went ahead and gave them a goodie bag of taxpayer subsidies. Gas prices topped $3 per gallon, Big Oil made record profits of $97 billion, and record dependence on foreign oil still leaves us vulnerable to the whims of unfriendly regimes. 
   Today, we are going to take back the tax giveaways to Big Oil so we can give the American people a break at the pump, a breath of fresh air, and a more secure nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (HEATING OIL -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, sky-high prices for gas and heating oil have taken a big bite out of family budgets. Just as we enter the home stretch of the summer driving season, these same families are bracing for increased prices in home heating oil. 
   Families in my district use heating oil to stave off winter cold, and too many of them are already shivering. We're not even into the heating season yet, and already prices in the Hudson Valley are over $4.60, 70 percent more than last year. 
   We need to throw these families a lifeline and fix the energy crisis threatening them. 
   To help with the costs, I have cosponsored the HEATR Act to give qualifying families a $500 tax credit for their heating costs over $1,500. 
   To fix the markets, the majority has tried repeatedly to provide support for new technologies, increased domestic drilling, and oil releases from the SPR. Each time, the President and his allies have opposed these measures and are holding our energy solutions hostage to their insistence on old, ineffective drilling proposals. 
   They need to get out of D.C. and see how these prices are affecting working families, figure out how to join us, or soon we will all be out in the cold.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I am a strong supporter of the rights of landowners. H.R. 2016, the National Landscape Conservation System Act, would not affect any private property. The bill deals only with land that is already owned by the Federal Government. No new lands are taken away from any person or added to Federal lands and there is no impact on how landowners can use their property. 
   Under the guise of protecting landowners, the minority attempted to use the vote on ordering the previous question, roll call number 164, to kill a good, bipartisan bill. I voted to order the previous question because I believe that the House of Representatives should consider and approve H.R. 2016.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Indeed, as my colleague from across the aisle says, there are many of us, citizens and Members of this House, who do not believe our Commander in Chief, and we have good reason not to believe him. I wish it were not so. 
   After President Bush announced his escalation of the war, I said that he owed the American people an honest explanation as to why he thinks this surge will succeed when previous efforts have failed. Unfortunately, the President decided to stay the course and to begin the escalation before either House of Congress had a chance to consider it. Instead of providing a new comprehensive strategy to turn the tide in Iraq, President Bush offered the same tired rhetoric. Rather than engage in an important discussion with the American people, his loyalists prevented the Senate from debating this crucial matter. 
   Fortunately for us, such obstruction will not occur in this Chamber and the House will begin to take up this important debate this week. As a new Member of the House, I feel it is my responsibility to ask serious questions of our President who refuses to take this institution seriously. I ask my colleagues to join with me, to not try to score cheap political points but to push this administration and its supporters in Congress for real change in the direction of our Iraq policy. Our men and women in uniform, who have done everything that has been asked of them, deserve no less. 
   So I ask the President why this Congress should support his proposal to send 20,000 more troops into harm's way when his own former Iraq commander, General Abizaid, said it is not needed? Why should we support it when the Prime Minister of Iraq has himself expressed no support? And why should we support it when the American people have shown that they actively oppose the President's policy towards Iraq? 
   From the very outset, this administration has been wrong at every step of this war. 
   The administration led us into an unnecessary war with flawed or manipulated intelligence. Wrong. 
   This administration went to war without enough troops to win the peace. Wrong. 
   This administration gave no-bid contracts to its friends and political allies, locking out other countries who might have helped us and indeed locking out the Iraqis. Wrong. 
   President Bush stood on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003 and said, ``Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.'' Wrong. 
   This administration literally took piles of cash, flying pallets of millions of dollars from the U.S. mint to Baghdad, into a war zone, and lost billions of dollars of taxpayer money. Wrong. 
   Now this administration wants us to blindly place our faith and the lives of 20,000 more of our troops in an Iraqi government that has failed to meet every security obligation it has pledged. Sadly, once again, this President is wrong. And no amount of presidential wrongs is going to make the situation in Iraq right. 
   Last fall's National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the President's policy in Iraq is creating more terrorists than it is eliminating. Nothing in this policy will change that. Three thousand one hundred twenty-four American service men's and women's lives have been lost in Iraq as of yesterday. Three thousand one hundred twenty-five will not make it right. 
   It is time for a new strategy in Iraq. It is time to start to bring our brave men and women who have fought so courageously back home. By turning Iraq over to the Iraqis, we will force their government to fight for their own security. Al Qaeda in Iraq will lose their mission and be less likely to inflame the Sunni-Shiite conflict. And Iran and Syria will have to work for calm rather than sit in the shadows and stir the insurgency. 
   Mr. President, it is time for a new path for the United States and Iraq. This nonbinding resolution reflects the will of the American people. It is an important first step but only a first step. I look forward to working with my colleagues as we seek to untangle this disaster the administration has brought upon us all. Together, we can begin to repeal this tragic blunder and undo the damage done to our military, to our country, and to our standing in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2830, COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to agree with and concur with the comments of my colleague, the gentlelady from Michigan, regarding the merits of the bill. I'm pleased to serve on Transportation and Infrastructure, and I'm happy to say that Chairman Oberstar always goes the extra mile to incorporate everybody's opinions from both sides. And I believe this is a good bill that deserves all of our support. 
   Regarding the allegations or the comments that are being made about this Congress not being interested in or producing bills that will produce energy, I beg to differ.  
   H.R. 2264, holding OPEC accountable for oil price fixing, we call it the NOPEC Act, which was passed on May 27 of last year, with 220 Democrats voting for it, and 125 Republicans voting against it. 
   Cracking down on gas price gouging, H.R. 1252, passed May 23 of last year, opposed by 140 Republicans, including all of the Republican leadership, 228 Democrats voting in favor of it. 
   Repealing those subsidies that were given to profit-rich big oil companies. We're talking about ExxonMobil and the other big oil companies that have made the biggest profits of the history of any industry in the world. And, by the way, the five CEOs of the five biggest oil companies testified a couple of weeks ago before the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. I sat there while all five of them talked about how they couldn't help it they were making so much money. One of my colleagues from the Republican side during his 5 minutes of questioning, Representative Walden, said, ``I'm a small businessman''--and if I can paraphrase because I don't know if this is an exact quote--``I'm a capitalist,'' said Representative Walden. ``And when I had a very good year where my profit is so high that it's better than I even could have imagined, I start to ask whether I can lower the prices to my consumers.''

   Mr. HALL of New York. ``I start to think,'' said Representative Walden to the oil company executives, ``about whether I might be able to lower the price at the pump and lower the price to my consumers. Have you ever thought about doing that, now that you're making such a big profit?'' 
   And one by one, all five of them said, ``Oh, we don't control the price at the pump.'' 
   I think that's as good a case as one needs to hear for government regulation and possible legislation to make sure that there are not excess profits or gouging going on in this current state of the economy, and especially the oil economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (VETERANS' COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Congressman, for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 1284 earlier this month with the Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Congressman Filner. 
   Chairman Filner has been instrumental in moving this bill forward. I thank him for that. I also want to thank the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Steve Buyer, and our ranking member of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Doug Lamborn, who were both helpful in getting this bill moved expeditiously. The fact that we got this bill to the floor within the month shows the House leadership's commitment to our Nation's veterans. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, I believe that America must uphold its promise to care for our veterans and their families, and I strongly support efforts to alleviate unjust financial burdens imposed upon our Nation's veterans and their survivors. This is why I am so pleased that H.R. 1284 is on the floor today. 
   H.R. 1284 would provide a cost-of-living adjustment to the rates of disability compensation provided to our Nation's disabled veterans and to the compensation provided to the survivors of veterans and servicemembers who died or who will die as a result of military service. 
   Every year since 1976, Congress has enacted an annual COLA adjustment for veterans with disabilities and their survivors. The regularity of Congress' action on COLA legislation underscores its importance. Without it, inflation would diminish and erode the purchasing power of millions of beneficiaries. According to VA, as set forth in its fiscal year 2008 budget, the Department estimates that it will provide disability compensation to 3,220,031 veterans with service-related disabilities in fiscal year 2008. 
   In summary, this legislation is critical to the lives of over 3 million beneficiaries who have served our country well and faithfully. I ask for your continued support for our Nation's veterans, and I ask for your support of the bipartisan Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living-Adjustment Act of 2007. 
   I would just like to say a few words also about another bill that is on the floor today and falls under the jurisdiction of my subcommittee, H.R. 797, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. As with H.R. 1284, I am proud of the speed and fashion in which this bill has come to the floor. 
   H.R. 797, which has the backing of the Blind Veterans Association, would put the Veterans Administration on a par with the Social Security Administration, the World Health Organization, and all 50 States in defining a visual impairment. 
   Furthermore, this bill allows certain veterans to receive a ``V'' on their gravestone and reauthorizes the VA's popular work/study program. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Congress faces a substantial task in dealing with the difficulties our veterans face. Currently there are more than 570,000 veterans claims pending before the VA, literally hundreds of thousands of veterans waiting on decisions that can substantially affect their financial situation. 
   On top of this, we have a new generation of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The subcommittee I chair, the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, recently held a hearing where we heard from experts and Iraq war veterans. They all agree that the VA is critically unprepared to deal with these new commitments and will be overwhelmed. 
   One witness privately compared the VA's current position to that of a person standing on a beach while a tsunami comes rushing towards the shore. These men and women deserve our support, and it is incumbent upon this Congress to act. 
   In the coming month, I plan to hold hearings on several pieces of legislation that will address this backlog. I have introduced one bill which would provide interim benefits to veterans who have waited over 6 months for a decision on their appeal. 
   While this will not fix the entire problem, it will help veterans pay their bills and buy their medicine while they wait for a decision from the VA. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on these important issues, and I trust they share my sense of urgency on these matters. 
   It is my hope that H.R. 797 and H.R. 1284 are the first of many steps this Congress takes to ensure that those who have sacrificed so much for this country receive the benefits they have earned.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, later today, we will begin  work on important legislation to finally help America end its dependence on foreign oil and pursue newer, cleaner forms of energy. 
   I'm excited that the Energy and Water appropriations bill that we will pass this week will take the long overdue step of setting a new course for our energy future by making significant investments in renewables and efficiency. 
   For too many years, working families have felt the sting of high gas prices at the gas pump and rising home energy costs. Our economy has been made vulnerable to the whims of OPEC, and our reliance on fossil fuels has polluted our air and exacerbated climate change. 
   All the while, State and local governments have been forced to try to fill the leadership vacuum left by the Congress and this President. 
   No more. The new Congress is prepared to meet our Nation's energy challenges head-on, and to do so, this bill provides almost $2 billion for renewables and efficiency, significantly more than the President requested. 
   I am concerned that it continues to provide unwarranted taxpayer subsidies for nuclear power that hide the true consumer costs of this power source, but I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to ratify it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, when the Democrats won control of Congress in November, we committed to raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years and to provide tax relief to our small businesses. 
   Today's increase in the Federal minimum wage marks a concrete step that this new Congress is taking to provide greater opportunity and prosperity for all working Americans. The considerable small business tax relief that was passed along with the minimum wage increase reflects a broader American agenda to expand our economy and give small businesses more room to grow and succeed. This relief includes allowing small businesses larger tax reductions, making it easier to expand and provide better services, and specific relief from the AMT. 
   I am proud that the State of New York has already been a leader in providing workers with a living wage, and the raise that goes into effect today will put our businesses in New York on a level playing field with the rest of the country.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1424, The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Since this House rejected an earlier plan to intervene, the bad economic news has kept rolling in and the dangers to Main Street businesses have increased. Only today it was announced that 159,000 American jobs were lost in September alone. This kind of news combined with the tremendous declines we've seen in the markets only underscores our need to take action. 
   I continue to share the anger of most Americans about the need to take these unprecedented steps, but I remain more convinced today that we must act decisively to contain this economic contagion before it spreads into the far reaches of our economy and leaves lasting damage. 
   Although this bill added an important provision to increase the insurance guarantees on personal deposits by the FDIC and a number of tax provisions, it remains similar to the package that I reluctantly supported earlier this week. While this bill is far from perfect, I believe it addresses the economic crisis in a responsible way that helps Wall Street while still looking out for Main Street and protecting our tax dollars. 
   This bill would still institute limits on executive compensation and golden parachutes for the executives of companies that take part in the plan. It puts in place real oversight, from the courts, from Congress and from a new Inspector General's office and finally installs significant Government supervision and regulation of the companies that helped to put us in the situation we're in now. 
   It also puts in place mechanisms to make sure that taxpayer dollars will be protected to the maximum extent possible. To the extent that our investment is not recouped, the President will have to come up with a plan to make sure that the companies taking out this Government loan will have to pay back the American taxpayer. 
   The financial industry is of great importance to New York State, which relies on our financial institutions for a significant percentage of tax revenue and jobs. The Hudson Valley is particularly vulnerable to difficulties on Wall Street, and I fear that the workers, small business owners, and families in my district will face severe economic ramifications if we do not stem the tide of this financial crisis. That is the primary reason that I feel I must vote yes today. 
   In fact, the ripples of the credit crisis are already impacting some of the small businesses in my district. Jeff Conston, owner of Dutchess Recreational Vehicles in Poughkeepsie, contacted me to tell me that his customers are finding it very hard to get financing to purchase the equipment he sells. He has 34 employees who handle sales, parts and service for his dealership. He urged us to get this financial rescue plan passed so the financing for his customers and his business can start flowing again. 
   Another local businessman, William L. Spearman, Chief Executive Officer of the Mid-Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union in my district, told me that while his credit union's balance sheet remains strong, his members are so concerned about our financial system that they are withdrawing money just to put it in their mattresses. In his view, the financial system is frozen and we need to pass this bill to provide confidence to his members and to get the system moving again. 
   Overall, I am pleased that the legislation sent back from the Senate includes some important tax relief provisions that I believe Congress should pass this year. Chief among this is a one year ``patch'' that will protect thousands of middle class families from being hit by the AMT this year. Last year over 30,000 families in my district paid AMT, and this bill will ensure that an additional 70,000 families in my district will not also be obliged to pay it. I wish we had the support to permanently fix the AMT, and help the middle class families that are still subject to it, however once again the ``patch'' legislation that we consider today is the best legislation that we can pass at this time and I will support it. 
   I am also grateful that this legislation contains a number of tax breaks to help individuals and small businesses. Given the economic troubles we are in the midst of, tax breaks for research and development and for teachers who use their own money to purchase supplies for the students are desperately needed and could not come at a better time. 
   This bill also includes some important provisions to help shore up our economy in the long term by moving us away from imported fossil fuels and toward energy independence. The critical tax incentives in this bill for wind, solar, hydropower, marine energy, and the purchase of advanced plug-in hybrid vehicles will create thousands of green jobs here in America that can't be outsourced, help cut consumer energy costs, and give individual families and businesses the power to help fight climate change and end our dependence on foreign oil. Although I am deeply disappointed by the inclusion of incentives for coal to liquids technology and tar sands and oil shale exploration, which will not meet these goals, this package is still critical to our future and worthy of support. 
   Passage of this plan is only a first step. What created this crisis was the Bush administration's and previous Congress's failure to stem reckless behavior on Wall Street, and we cannot allow that lapse in oversight to be repeated. I am pleased that the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will begin hearings soon on the causes of this crisis and that there is acknowledgement that we must work to make more fundamental investments in the true engine of our economy, American workers, innovation, and small businesses, in order to more permanently strengthen our prosperity. Congress must remain vigilant, aware of how this tremendous authority is being exercised by the administration and in the markets, and ready to intervene at the first hint of abuse or ineffectiveness.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, in the last few months, the economy has been battered. Wages have stagnated, and expenses continue to rise. Personal debt is skyrocketing, and investment for the future has become nonexistent. American families are once again paying the price for this difficulty. More and more employers are moving overseas to take advantage of cheap labor and complacent regulations in places like India. 
   Last month, this pernicious trend made its mark on my district when Watson Pharmaceuticals, the second largest employer in Putnam County, New York, announced that they were closing their facility and moving all their jobs to India. 
   The company has praised its workers. The CEO said there was nothing the workers could have done differently or better to save their jobs. But that does them no good. The pull of profits from outsourcing was just too much to ignore for another American manufacturer. 
   There is something very wrong when U.S. companies are only too happy to pick up and move overseas, abandoning their employees and the county and the country that has supported them for years. I hope this Congress acts swiftly to remove incentives for this kind of behavior and that CEOs of these corporations will show some patriotism and loyalty to our communities.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, this week the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming held two events that starkly presented the consequences of climate change and showed us the way forward to prevent them. Wildlife officials from Alaska showed pictures of polar bears and other species struggling to survive as the ice literally melts under their feet. 
   The committee heard the gripping testimony of Mayor Stanley Tocktoo, whose village of Shmirsha, Alaska, is literally being wiped away by climate change. He showed footage of severe storms that polar ice once used to defend his village from, hundreds of feet of shore line lost during a single storm, and homes collapsing into the sea. 
   We need to act to keep Shmirsha, Alaska, from being a harbinger for our communities around the continental United States. The next day, U.N. Special Envoys on Climate Change discussed how. 
   Secretary Ban gathered over 150 countries in the largest discussion ever of climate change, and they testified of the need to change energy policy and bring emissions under control. 
   We must act by passing the energy bill and taking real action on carbon control. The stakes are too high for soft, nonenforceable goals.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Lampson, and Mr. Speaker, it's an honor again to be here on the floor of the House of Representatives, but it's kind of another sad moment to think that the price of oil went to an unthinkable level again today, cresting over $129 per barrel. 
   Gas prices have more than doubled since 2001, and today, the average gas price in my State of New York is over $4. Oil dependence has become an untenable burden on our economy and a threat to our national security. 
   Skyrocketing gas prices we see climbing each day threaten to break family budgets that are already being devoured by the price of food, health care, higher education and consumer goods. 
   Breaking the grip of OPEC and Big Oil is something that our country must do to thrive and to survive in the 21st century. It's a big job that will take some time, and I'm proud to be here tonight to discuss one of the innovative solutions that the majority and this Congress is working on, the Invest in Energy Independence Act, which I'm proud to be a cosponsor of, and I thank my friend for cosponsoring and offering that bill. 
   I was talking to another Member at the back of the body when we were taking votes I think a few days ago and talking about this very thing. And you came up and said I happen to have a bill that addresses this problem of the Strategic Reserve absorbing 70,000 barrels a day over 
   and over, day after day, taking them off the market, and creating that much more demand which is helping to drive up the price of oil. 
   This bill creates a win-win scenario for the American taxpayer. By redirecting through the release of oil from the SPR and restructuring its stockpile, the bill would help to put oil supply on the market to quell prices at the pump in the short-term, and this would also result in revenue to the Federal Government that does not come from increased taxes, which could be used to capitalize a fiscally responsible result and make sure that we take a more permanent action to end our oil addiction. We can't, as many of us have said, drill our way out of our problems. 
   The bill would invest that revenue in innovative research to develop clean, domestic sources of energy to power our economy. Ending our dependence on foreign oil has to be a top national priority, and to do so, we have to use every tool at our disposal. 
   Until recently, this administration has been violating the fundamental principle of buy low and sell high by taking oil off the market to fill the SPR at a time when prices were breaking new records and supplies were tight. Smart management of the SPR along the lines called for in Mr. Lampson's bill can make the reserve a powerful weapon in our battle against foreign oil dependence, and I strongly support you in this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you for asking that question. 
   If you read the comments by T. Boone Pickens on the front page of the  New York Times and other newspapers and magazines recently, he, one of the original oil tycoons and more successful ones, has said that he's more excited now about wind power than he is about any oil field he ever discovered. 
   Now, all people might not share his excitement. I talked to Ted Turner, who's been a media mogul and then head of record companies, broadcasting companies, Time Warner/AOL, I believe. I remember him back when he was sailing America's Cup yachts. He's certainly been around the world for a while. But today he said the thing he's most excited about as an investor and as a businessman is solar power. 
   And I see these men and women who have experience and have been observing commodities and observing economies and observing the way the world works and the direction it's going looking not just at drilling. I mean, obviously we're not going to get out of our dependence or our use of oil or liquid fuels anytime soon, especially for aviation. 
   As a member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I'm keenly aware of the fact that we might be able to move to electric vehicles, to hybrid, gas-electric or ethanol-electric or biodiesel hybrid, plug-in hybrid vehicles, et cetera, and combine these other technologies on the ground. But when we're talking about aircraft, especially I would say our Air Force, our military aircraft, we need to be able to develop and conserve liquid fuels and liquid petroleum fuels for those purposes and not burn them unnecessarily on the ground that we could use other technologies for. 
   So I would say that I agree to a point and I disagree to another point. The other problem with petroleum-based, carbon-based, fossil fuel technologies is that they're also emitting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and accentuating the kind of climate change that we've seen. 
   I would say climate change resonates more with people than global warming, especially on a day like today in Washington where it's cool for late May. But we've seen the cyclone in Myanmar. We've seen the almost biblical flooding in Arkansas and Missouri and parts of our Midwest. My district in upstate New York has seen three 50-year floods in the last 5 years. We've seen Hurricane Katrina. We have seen droughts in the South and wildfires in Florida right now. We've seen the last couple of summers devastating fire seasons in the Western States and the Rocky States. 
   So, it's not just that the climate will be getting warmer and the glaciers or sea ice in the Arctic are disappearing but that the extremes of all kinds of weather, be they rain events or drought events, be they hot spells or cold spells, be they low pressure systems that turn into bigger tornados or bigger hurricanes or cyclones, that's what the computer models project. And the more we burn oil, the more we push ourselves down that road. 
   So, it helps us in a number of ways to look at these alternatives. First of all, for domestic, they are not sending our money overseas by the billions, especially borrowed money that we are getting from countries like China or Japan or other countries we're already hugely in debt to. They don't cause asthma and emphysema and acid rain and oil spills. They don't cause us to possibly be drawn into wars in unstable countries in unstable parts of the world that just happen to have oil. 
   So it's a win-win-win-win situation. Whether or not you believe that the climate is changing, the fact of the matter is if you can create jobs and create new technologies and new industries here in the United States, get us out of our balance of trade deficit and make the atmosphere cleaner at the same time, I'm happy.     
   And I think a lot of Americans would be happy, too. I think it solves so many problems that it's clearly the direction our policy should be moving in. And I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In New York, in my district, as you suggest, there are a number of very exciting developments going on. We have a private business in Orange County, New York, which is currently taking all the solid waste on a pilot program, municipal solid waste--garbage, trash--not burning it, as the old incineration model would have us do, but separating it, pulling out the recyclables, pulling out the batteries and the cans of insecticide and the toxic substances that might be considered to be household hazardous waste, which, if you were to burn them, they would cause dioxin and heavy metals to go up the stack, and basically pollutants that can harm us and our children. Those things get pulled out and recycled. And what's left after the magnetic field pulls up the ferrous metals and magnetic metals and the shaker grate drops out the dirt and the stones, and so on, you're left with a combination of paper waste, wood waste, food waste, agriculture waste, all of which is gasified with hot sand as a catalyst under a patented process. And then that gas is used to spin a turbine and send, I believe, a couple of megawatts it is that they're generating out into the grid. 
   But the interesting thing about it is that the global warming gas emissions, the greenhouse gas emissions from this process are 75 percent less than if they put the same material in a landfill, which is what the town of Montgomery was doing before and what cities like New York City are doing. They're trucking municipal solid wastes, since the Fresh Kills landfill closed on Staten Island, to other States and buying space in landfills that are willing to accept it. And it's not cheap, especially with diesel and the price that it costs now, it's not cheap to send a roll-off truck with trash in it--or thousands of them a day--from a city like New York out to Ohio or Pennsylvania or wherever the latest landfill is, and then coming back empty, burning diesel fuel the whole way and sending those emissions into the air, too. 
   And when that material in the landfill decomposes, when the plant and vegetable matter decomposes, it creates methane, which is released through those J-shaped vents. If you drive past a landfill in your travels and you see those vents like upside-down  Js, what they're releasing into the atmosphere is methane. Methane is 20 times worse than carbon dioxide in terms of its greenhouse gas global warming impact. 
   So here's one idea, one project that can produce electricity, that can produce ethanol by the thousands of gallons, that can strip hydrogen, which is 48 percent of the gas that they produce out to charge hydrogen fuel cells, and it gets rid of municipal solid waste at 75 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas emission. So, very inventive project. 
   And I would say, at the other end of the spectrum, in terms of not just the size of the operation, but the funding that came to play, Newburgh High School in Newburgh, New York, Orange County, on the west bank of the Hudson, has a solar racing team which built a solar-powered car. They came to one of our workshops we did in the district on solar energy, it was packed--as all of our alternative energy forums are packed by people wanting to know what they can do. But the kids on the solar racing team included kids from the BOCES program, who are on the vocational track. And they knew how to weld and how to put together a car that would not fall apart on the road. And they included the advanced placement math students, who knew how to calculate how many square inches of photovoltaic cells they needed in order to generate the watts necessary so that they could 
   power this vehicle, and the battery capacity. 
   And it looked about the size of this table here. It's actually an oval shape, maybe a little bit bigger than this, like a soapbox derby racer. And the student who drove it crouched down inside and had a little windshield in front of him to keep the bugs out of his face. And they won, or actually tied for first place, in a race from Houston, Texas to Newburgh, New York. Two thousand miles of this country they traveled with a top speed of 55 miles per hour. And when they showed up at our forum wearing ``Solar Racing Team'' hats and ``Solar Racing Team'' t-shirts and showing a video and the slide show of their car rolling across the highways from Texas to New York, the adults in the audience were so excited I think it woke up the little kid in them. They could hear about all the well-funded, high-science, high-technology things, but to see that these kids, with virtually no resources--the teacher adviser from the school was not allowed to touch the vehicle, it was entirely built by the kids. And the fact that they were high school students and were able to do this, even on a test, a display pilot project kind of scale, to build a vehicle that would do 2,000 miles, that would reach speeds of 55 miles per hour powered entirely on solar power and storing that power in batteries, the adults, as they were leaving, were asking me, why can't Detroit do this? And I answered, well, I think they can, but they're not. 
   And what we're trying to do through this bill, among other things, is to provide the incentives--and tomorrow, by the way, the House will pass sweeping tax incentives to provide not just corporations, but consumers, as well as businesses, with extended incentives for hybrid plug-ins for wind, solar, biofuels and marine energy. 
   And I know that there has been great concern around the country, and I've heard it from people in my district, about these renewable energy tax credits being extended. And what we're trying to do by doing that is to make it possible, not just for students in a high school, but for those who run our automobile manufacturing companies to be able to build cars that use these new technologies. 
   And with that, I yield back to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank you for your comments. And I would add to what you say, as I look at $100 million for ARPA-E, including $50 million for university research, $15 million for wind--and congratulations to you and the State of Texas on passing California in becoming the number one wind energy State in the country with more installed wind capacity than any of the other 49 States. By the way, I have to thank our President, George W. Bush, who signed a renewable energy standard when he was Governor of Texas, and that's partly why the wind is being exploited in Texas to the extent it is. I only wish that he would change his mind and sign the same renewable energy standard for the entire country now that he is President of the entire country. 
   But I look at this and the $30 million for solar and the $100 million for weatherization, et cetera, et cetera, and you know what I think of? Jobs. I think of jobs because when you put $100 million into weatherization of low-income housing, and I'm speaking as one who used to live in New York City, although I now live in Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley, there are so many old buildings in every city in this country that are poorly insulated, that have no storm windows or storm doors, that are leaky, that are leaking cool air in the summer when they're being air conditioned and leaking heat during the winter when there's actually a heating unit running, and what are you hiring? You're hiring trade people. You're hiring sheet metal workers. You're hiring carpenters. You're hiring installers. And in the process, you're saving barrels of oil or kilowatts, and a barrel of oil saved or a kilowatt saved has less environmental impact than any way you can generate a new barrel or a new kilowatt. So it's the cheapest way of getting a barrel or a kilowatt, and it also has the least environmental impact. So I'm very happy about the weatherization component of this. 
   Marine/hydrokinetic, we in New York are aware of the work that's been done recently by Verdant, Inc., a company that has been doing a test on six hydroturbines that are running below water in the East River, east of Roosevelt Island. As Long Island Sound, the western half, drains out through East River, under the Throgs Neck and the Whitestone and the Triborough Bridge, alongside the UN down the East River past Manhattan Island and through New York and out under the Verrazano-Narrows, half of Long Island Sound, millions of tons of water every day twice going out into the ocean and then back in through the harbor again. And that's what's being done by the action of the moon's gravitational effect on the ocean. And the fact that we are not harnessing that is just absurd. And their biggest problem, Verdant, Inc., in terms of putting in a hydrokinetic-generating station that use these turbines, there's so much force at work in the East River that it kept breaking the blades off the turbines, and they had to use titanium instead of steel and lessen the pitch so that there wasn't quite so much force on them to keep the turbines intact. Now, they're going back in, I believe, this year with a second round of more highly refined generators to test it again, but it's obvious that the power is there, whether it be wave action or whether it be tidal action or any of the other renewables that we are talking about. And if we can transition ourselves to these with whatever liquid fuels like, for instance, ethanol, I know that there are some problems with ethanol, but there's a surplus right now of ethanol in this country. I checked on the Internet last week. I just did a little Internet search and found that it's selling, as of the middle of last week, for $1.97 a gallon. That's half the cost of gasoline. 
   We had somebody call our office in Upstate New York, in Carmel, Putnam County, a woman constituent, who said, ``I'm so excited. I just bought a flex-fuel vehicle. Where can I get some flex-fuel?'' And my staff had to tell her there are two pumps in all of New York where you can buy flex-fuel. Well, West Point which is in my district, the United States Military Academy at West Point, where, I'm proud to say, my nephew is a cadet, just announced at our Board of Visitors meeting last week that they are planning to put in a 5,000 gallon underground tank for ethanol so that they can carry flex-fuel E-85 in the motor pool and at the commissary and start with a big quantity that's going to be used by that community of faculty and graduates and West Pointers who still live around the academy.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I don't know how much time we have left, my friend, but I just wanted to say once again  that I support the Invest in Energy Independence Act and am doing my best to convince more Members of this body on both sides of the aisle to support it. I believe that it will help to ease market tensions. It will help to keep the price of gasoline from rising too much higher and hopefully eventually to bring it back to more affordable levels by providing competition with other kinds of fuels and other kinds of energy. 
   And when that day arrives, Mr. Lampson, when that day arrives that we can tell the Saudis or the Russians or whichever country it is that's shipping imported oil into this country ``No thank you, you can turn your tanker around and send it somewhere else,'' that day a big weight will lift off the shoulders of America, off the American public. And I believe it will be a moment similar to the day when we first landed on moon. 
   Because I was a kid when Sputnik was launched, and I remember the feeling of this thing. It was beeping overhead, that the Russians had gotten to it first. And it didn't really do anything other than beep. But the fact it was there above us was symbolic of, we thought and we probably were right, a technological breakthrough that another country had made that put them for the time being ahead of us in that field. And I believe that we can't afford to let Japan or China or any other country get more of a lead in energy than the one that exists now. And the day that we are once again able to throw 
   our shoulders back, hold our heads high, and say that we can fuel our own economy and our own industry and our own recreation and our own family's trips to and from work and from school and so on without depending on some other country that might have policies and human rights or other things that we don't like but we have to sort of bow to them and ignore that aspect of foreign policy because we need something that they have, that will be not just energy independence, it will be independence. 
   We're talking about sovereignty here, and I think that will be a day that Americans together, regardless of party or no party at all, if they're paying attention, all Americans on that day will be proud to be Americans. Not that we aren't proud now, but we will be proud of an accomplishment that will be uniquely American and something that I believe we will accomplish and that we have to look forward to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. While the terrorists were able to destroy the World Trade Towers in New York City, and damage the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, they did not take into account the indomitable American spirit. 
   My most lasting image of that day is not planes flying into buildings or towers collapsing. I remember the people--firefighters, police officers, EMTs, ordinary men and women--doing everything in their power to help. I think of all the people who rushed downtown, without regard to their own safety, determined to do what they could do for others. They clearly demonstrated to our enemies that our spirit cannot be broken and that we are determined to confront any threat to our national security. 
   The United States will never give in to terrorism and we will never shirk from our duty to defend our country and the principles for which it stands. 
   I urge all Americans to honor those who lost their lives on September 11, and to commit ourselves to whatever sacrifices it may take to prevent such an attack from taking place again. 
   Also, I'd like to especially recognize a constituent and friend, named Jay Winuk, the founder of MyGoodDeed.org, an organization he created to further honor the victims, families, and survivors of September 11, by encouraging the government to recognize that day as a national day of community service, and to encourage people to perform good deeds to mark the date. 
   Jay's brother, Glenn Winuk, was a volunteer firefighter and attorney working at a Manhattan law firm on 9/11. He lost his life at the World Trade Center after helping to evacuate everyone from his office, and then rushing back into the South Tower, looking for others to save. When he was last seen alive, Glenn was helping people escape the tower and reach safety. 
   Many rescue and recovery workers volunteered their time and efforts in the hours and days following the attack. Jay has found a unique and touching way of honoring all their efforts and ensuring that the heroes of that day are not forgotten. Through the work of citizens like Glenn and Jay Winuk, this country remains as great  and as powerful as it is, and we should all recognize and remember them, and all those who lost their lives, or whose lives were forever changed on that day.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes a small change to funding at the Department of Veterans Affairs. It would prohibit any funding to be spent for performance bonuses to senior level staff at the Department for fiscal year 2008.  
   This amendment would effectively mean no person in a Presidential-appointed position or Secretary-level position would receive a performance bonus during the coming fiscal year. 
   As I begin, let me state that the Department of Veterans Affairs has done a very good job in many areas for our Nation's veterans. In fact, its health care system is rated amongst the very best in the country, and the demand of veterans to get into the system speaks to the high level of care that it provides. 
   However, there remains a significant need for improvement in many areas. In the last 3 years, the VA has underestimated its health care budget by nearly $1 billion. It has roughly 600,000 veterans claims backlogged and veterans currently waiting an average of 177 days before receiving a decision on their claim. 
   Furthermore, according to a draft Inspector General's report, the VA is significantly overstating its success in getting patients timely appointments with VA doctors. The number of claims pending before the Department has steadily increased over the last 5 years. The current wait time is nearly 2 months longer than what Secretary Nicholson suggested in front of our Veterans Affairs Subcommittee would be acceptable to him, which was 125 days rather than the 177 currently being suffered by our veterans. That is nearly a 2-month difference. 
   The Secretary himself called this ``unacceptable.'' However, the awards for bonuses last year ranged up to and included a number of members of high management at the VA of $33,000 in annual bonus. Their award bonuses were because of evaluations of outstanding and excellent. In fact, 87 percent of the senior staff were called ``outstanding'' or ``excellent'' in performance. One of those who got the $33,000 bonus had only served in his position from February 2006 until September 2006. So an outstanding performance for 6 months earned that individual a $33,000 bonus; this at a time when our veterans are waiting 177 days average to have their claims for disability heard. And if they go to an appeal, it is an average of 2 years to wait for that appeal to be heard. This simply makes no sense. It is either unacceptable or it is outstanding, but it can't be both. 
   I am sure that most of the staff at the Department is dedicated and hardworking and the service they provided in often excellent, but in other areas it is unsatisfactory. Our veterans deserve accountability from the VA. Yet Secretary Nicholson himself has signed off on all of these bonuses, making only one change since 2004. 
   Veterans in my district and across the country were outraged when The Washington Post and the Army Times broke this story a couple of months ago. The VA Committee and the Subcommittee on Oversight invited Secretary Nicholson to testify this week and explain the bonuses. However, he decline and decided instead to send a substitute who admitted to knowing very little about the issue. 
   I understand that the chairman wants to study and best address this issue; and I would prefer that rather than eliminating bonuses altogether that we have them tied to performance, as bonuses should be. So if the chairman agrees, I would like to work with him and other Members on a separate piece of legislation to add accountability to the bonus process to the Department. 
   As in private industry, bonuses at the VA should be tied to performance, and I believe all of us want to see that happen, want to see the backlog reduced, and want to see our veterans get their claims processed promptly. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the chairman.

   For the record, I would like to say that Under Secretary Mansfield, under oath this week at the Subcommittee on Oversight hearing, at least six times answered that he did not know the information and would have to go back and respond in writing. And one of those times specifically had do with an individual who was identified by the Congressional Research Service as being a presidential appointee who is among those receiving bonuses. 
   So at least in one case that may need to be clarified.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I often say that the opportunity to serve on Veterans' Affairs Committee is one of the greatest privileges I have been given in my short time in Congress. The action on the floor of the House today is another reminder of how it is truly an honor to serve on this Committee. Earlier this afternoon the House passed several pieces of legislation to improve outreach and care to our nation's veterans.  
   Memorial Day is the day for Americans to officially honor the heroes who have fallen in service to our country, and a day to pray for and remember the brave souls who have given the ultimate sacrifice. We are the beneficiaries of those who serve and who have served to preserve the peace and freedom we enjoy. 
   As a nation, we honor the bravery of those who have fought and died for our country and recognize the tremendous sacrifices they and their families have made. But to truly honor these heroes it is our duty as a grateful nation to not just spend the day remembering their service, but to provide the promised support and benefits to the soldiers and veterans who served with and followed them. These bills help provide that support. 
   H.R. 67, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act, creates a grant program to allow the VA to partner with State and county veteran organizations to reach out to veterans and their families to ensure they are aware of their eligibility for benefits. 
   This bipartisan bill also increases acountability in spending taxpayer dollars by requiring reports on how the grants in this program have been used to improve outreach. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and am pleased it has passed the House. 
   H.R. 612 is an extremely important piece of legislation. This bill will extend access to VA Healthcare for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans from two years to five years. This is vital to the health of our veterans returning from Iraq because of the nature of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 
   In some cases, TBI and PTSD symptoms do not emerge until several years after the injury occurred. With the current freeze on Category 8 veteran enrollment in VA healthcare, this means that some OIF/OEF will realize they suffered a brain injury while deployed but be locked out of the system. 
   They might not have health insurance to cover their treatment, and will not have crucial medical documents that will help them receive disability benefits. 
   By expanding their eligibility for 3 additional years, Congress is acting to limit the damage done by the President's Category 8 veterans enrollment freeze. I was proud to also cosponsor this legislation. 
   Another extremely important bill to our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is H.R. 2199, the Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long Term Support Act. 
   TBI is the signature injury of the war in Iraq and this bill vastly improves the VA's ability to provide care for brain injury. 
   This bill requires the VA to establish a program to screen veterans for TBI and establish a program of long term care for acute TBI victims. 
   Currently, of the nearly 1,300 VA health care facilities in the United States, only 4 have specialized TBI programs. This bill allows the VA to partner with private facilities to provide treatment the VA cannot immediately provide. 
   It also establishes centers of research and a national database so we can better understand the causes and symptoms of TBI. Hopefully, this will allow us to better treat victims in the future. This bill contains provisions of H.R. 1944, a bill I originally cosponsored. 
   H.R. 1470 expands chiropractic care to all VA facilities throughout the country by 2011. During a subcommittee hearing on returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, several OIF veterans suggested that back injuries will be a long term problem for this generation of veterans. This bill will help the VA better prepare for this new wave of patients. 
   I am proud that these bills passed the House today and that I could support their passage. 
   Congress has a responsibility to live up to our promises to our veterans. Today was another down payment on fulfilling these promises. 
   Through my role on the Veterans Affairs Committee, I pledge to continue to push for legislation that will improve services for our veterans and treat them with the respect they have worked so hard to earn.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, before I address the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, I just wanted to comment that it is interesting, some might say entertaining, to be given a lesson in fiscal responsibility by those Members who helped to run up the biggest deficit and the biggest balance of trade deficit that this country has ever seen. But we will let that go. 
   For now I would just like to talk about, first of all, the fact that there are no earmarks in this bill. To talk about earmarks on a bill, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which has no earmarks is inappropriate and just a distraction. 
   In terms of first responders, the part that I would like to address, it is particularly important to my district, New York's 19th, which served and continues to serve New York City. Orange County in my district is the farthest north that first responders from New York are allowed to live. The firemen and policemen of New York may live only that far north from New York City because of needing to be there when they are called in a hurry. And as a result, we have had many fire and police who lost their lives on 9/11 and many are subsequently suffering from respiratory ailments from working on the Ground Zero pile. So we know, not only from that but from planning for other incidents, accidents, attacks that we need to be ready for, that first responders need our help and they need it from this bill, and this bill gives it to them. 
   This bill gives it to them through Homeland Security grants, which meet the needs of first responders including hiring, training, and equipping first responders. The President proposed slashing the grants by 52 percent. Instead, our bill restores this cut, providing $550 million, which is $25 million above fiscal year 2007 and $300 million above the President's request for Homeland Security grants. 
   Local law enforcement terrorism prevention programs, this $375 million program plays a key role in assisting local law enforcement agents in information sharing, target hardening, and counter-terrorism planning. The President's budget eliminates this program. Our bill provides $400 million, which is $25 million above fiscal year 2007. 
   Firefighter assistance grants, the President proposed to slash these grants by 55 percent. Instead, this bill restores the cut, providing $570 million, $23 million above fiscal year 2007 and $270 million above the President's request. And SAFER grants, the President proposed eliminating these Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, SAFER, $115 million SAFER grants. The program was eliminated by the President in his proposal. We, instead, provide $230 million, which is $115 million above fiscal year 2007. 
   So in every instance in which first responders need our help, need the Federal Government's assistance, to be able to respond to fire, police, and other security and public safety issues and events, we are trying to provide them with the resources that they need over the President's objections and over his cuts. 
   I am proud to support this bill, and I submit that I personally don't have any earmarks in it, and I don't know of anybody else who does. So let's please not discuss it in those terms but in terms of what makes the American people safer.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (DEMOCRATS HONOR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor in defense of fiscal responsibility. After 6 years of disastrous management and record deficits, the new Democratic House has restored fiscal sanity to the Federal Government. We have reinstated PAYGO, or pay as you go, and passed a budget that will balance Federal spending. 
   As the Speaker knows, PAYGO requires the House to live by the same rules that American families live by. Like them, if we want to spend more money on something, we know we have  to spend less money on something else. Just as families sit down and make tough choices every day, Congress now has to decide what the government's priorities should be. 
   And the new Democratic majority has made America's priorities the priorities of this Congress. We have twice passed the SCHIP legislation to provide working families with health care for their children. 
   We passed the College Cost Reduction Act, the largest investment in college financial aid since the GI bill. This bill increased Pell Grants, provided tuition assistance for future teachers, and enabled loan forgiveness for first responders, law enforcement officers, and fire fighters. 
   The new Democratic Congress also honored America's promise to our veterans by passing the largest budget increase in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   We have passed appropriations bills that fund the most pressing needs of our country. As the bridge collapse in Minnesota showed, there are serious infrastructure needs throughout the country. In fact, there are 13 deficient bridges alone, according to a study that we were shown today in a Transportation and Infrastructure hearing, in my district, the 19th Congressional District of New York. 
   The House has increased funding for highway repair by $631 million over the President's request to make these important repairs. 
   We have provided $400 million extra to improve the quality of teachers in America's schools. 
   House Democrats provided $1.8 billion above the President's request to invest in renewable energies to save our environment and end our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Because we have funded these vital needs for America, the President has threatened to veto these bills. After borrowing more money than every other President in history combined, President Bush has decided to pretend to be fiscally responsible. Unfortunately for the President, his Halloween costume just doesn't fit. For as he protests over $22 billion for American needs, he has watched $35 billion in taxpayer money get lost or stolen in Iraq. With the money the President has lost in Iraq, we could pay for all of these important needs with billions left over. The President has spent over $2 billion in Iraq to improve oil production; yet still, production of oil in Iraq remains at below prewar levels. 
   Now the President threatens to veto the Homeland Security bill because House Democrats have added that same amount to train first responders and protect our ports. It seems that the President believes it is more important to waste money in Iraq than to provide critical equipment and protective gear for 250 fire departments in New York. 
   The President has stood by while contractors have gone $144 million over budget building the embassy in Iraq. With this $144 million, I believe we should instead provide health care for over 20,000 New York veterans. 
   The President has paid $2 billion to provide drinking water to the Iraqi people, although fewer Iraqis now have access to drinkable water than before the war. Yet the President threatens to veto $1.2 billion, as compared to $2 billion, for clean drinking water here in America. 
   Finally, the President stood quietly by as the American government shipped $8.8 billion in cash to Iraq and simply lost it. You heard me correctly, lost it. There are absolutely no records to explain where this money went. It just disappeared into the Iraqi desert. 
   The new Democratic majority has spent the last year restoring fiscal sanity to the government's budget. We have passed legislation to help middle-class families insure their children and pay for college. We have funded important needs across this country. I am proud of our work and I urge the President to stop playing politics and sign these important bills.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, the events of the last few weeks have been unprecedented. Following a summer of economic disarray and confusion the rapid failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and AIG have rocked our economy, roiled our financial markets, and left many Americans fearing that we may be on the verge of the greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression. This would imperil the economy of the Hudson Valley and New York State, costing us jobs and revenue that the State and local governments rely on. 
   In the wake of massive federal intervention to keep these former pillars of the financial industry afloat, it has quickly become clear that a cascade of financial collapse on Wall Street threatens to spill over into the credit markets, wreaking havoc on the broader business community and our entire economy unless swift, responsible, and effective steps are taken to stabilize the situation. 
   In response to these events, the Bush Administration asked Congress for a $700 billion blank check to bail out failing companies as it saw fit without limits, restrictions, or oversight. 
   It's hardly surprising that following this proposal, the outcry from my constituents came through loud and clear that it was unacceptable to throw a life line with no strings attached to the same reckless, irresponsible CEOs who have driven our economy to the brink through dangerous, greedy speculation on mortgage values. I share their view that the original Paulsen plan had too little oversight, too little protection for taxpayers and too little accountability for Wall Street. It was unacceptable. 
   I share the anger we're hearing from Americans about the fact that Congress may be poised to bail out greedy, freewheeling CEOs while average families are struggling with flat wages and higher costs. However, one of my most important responsibilities, and one of the most sacred obligations of Congress, is to ensure the security of the people of the United States, including their economic security. As satisfying as it would be to let these irresponsible companies flounder and fail as a result of their actions, the bottom line is that their instability has created an economic contagion that must be contained, or it will spread into the rest of our economy and present a clear and present danger to our prosperity and the quality of life of every American. 
   It is that need for action that has driven Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to work feverishly over the last several days to come up with a plan. While far from perfect, it attempts to address the economic crisis in a responsible way that helps Wall Street while still looking out for Main Street and protecting our tax dollars. 
   It is outrageous to think that the CEOs who ran their companies into the ground and have brought us to the precipice of disaster could  receive fat corporate bonuses, and the bill before us today would put a stop to that by instituting limits on executive compensation and golden parachutes for the executives of companies that take part in the plan. There is real oversight, from the courts, from Congress and from a new Inspector General's office. There will finally be significant government supervision and regulation of the companies that helped to put us in the situation we're in now. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the bill puts in place mechanisms to make sure that taxpayer dollars will be protected to the maximum extent possible. When the market improves, and I believe it will, our investment will allow the taxpayers to share in the profits. To the extent that our investment is not recouped, the President will have to come up with a plan to make sure that the companies taking out this government loan will have to pay back the American taxpayer. 
   The proposal we have before us today is a substantial improvement over what was originally presented to us just a week ago. It has safeguards to protect the taxpayers' investment and it has comprehensive oversight so we will always know where our money is going. While I would take great personal satisfaction in seeing Wall Street deal with this crisis on its own, I have a responsibility to the people who elected me to do everything in my power to keep the economy in good order. 
   New York State depends on the continued success of our financial institutions for tax revenue and jobs. The Hudson Valley is especially vulnerable to difficulties on Wall Street. If we could contain the damage to Wall Street I would be tempted to vote no, but I have become convinced that the situation has already begun to have ripple effects through our economy that could do permanent damage to retirement accounts, individual investments, and small businesses. This would be unacceptable, and that is why for the sake of our economic security I believe that I must reluctantly support this measure. 
   We must also be clear that passage of this plan is only a first step. One of the conditions that created this crisis is the tendency by the Bush Administration to turn a blind eye to the recklessness on Wall Street, and we cannot allow that to happen again. Congress must remain vigilant, aware of how this tremendous authority is being exercised by the Administration and in the markets, and ready to intervene at the first hint of abuse or ineffectiveness.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, today it was with great reluctance that I cast my vote against the Woolsey substitute budget amendment. I say it was with great reluctance because the progressive budget put forth by the amendment contained a great many individual provisions that I strongly support. 
   I strongly applaud the inclusion of full funding for No Child Left Behind in the amendment, and believe that we as a Congress must continue to work toward that goal. For too long, the Republican majority and President Bush have forced local communities to bear the brunt of No Child Left Behind's mandates without sufficient Federal support. For the sake of our children, our schools, and our communities we need to rectify this. 
   Likewise, I admire, respect, and support the amendment's commitment to full, guaranteed funding for veterans' healthcare. As the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan create a new generation of veterans with critical new healthcare needs, we must make sure that the VA healthcare system will be able to accommodate them while caring for veterans from previous generations. As a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I remain committed to making sure that the VA can honor the sacred pact we make with our soldiers; that if they fight to defend our Nation, our Nation will make sure they have the care they need. 
   There are other highly commendable provisions in the amendment, including the repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, tax cuts which I believe have helped to put us on the path to fiscal ruin without providing one bit of support for working families. The proposal also includes much-needed provisions to crack down on corporate welfare and a commitment to expand health coverage to all Americans. 
   I support these provisions, and it is my deep and abiding hope that they will be brought to the floor of this Chamber individually to be considered and adopted by the House. However, the option to consider them as such was not available today. 
   The previous majority left this House, and this Nation, with an astounding fiscal train wreck, and in order to restore budgetary balance we must make difficult decisions. I am also concerned that although there are many laudable goals included in the substitute amendment, it failed to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax, which unintentionally and unnecessarily burdens a tremendous number of the residents of the Hudson Valley.  
   The underlying budget resolution, for which I cast my vote, contains strong funding increases for many of the programs I have discussed, balances the budget, and provides vital AMT relief. In light of the fiscal challenges created by previous Congresses, I believe that the underlying budget represents a strong, responsible step forward and is deserving of support.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, when Democrats took control of Congress in January, we vowed to make some changes around here. The American people were rightfully disgusted by several examples of unethical behavior that made this entire institution look bad. The Senate and House have now reconciled differences between two different lobbying reform bills passed earlier this year. Today, the House will give final approval to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. 
   The bill requires greater transparency of lobbyists so they are more accountable to the American people. Specifically, the bill requires lobbyists to file their lobbying activities in an electronic database that is accessible to the public. It also ends the K Street Project by prohibiting Members of Congress and their staff from attempting to influence employment decisions in exchange for political access. 
   Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats said we were going to change the way business is done here, and today we will deliver on that promise by passing the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you so much, Congressman, for yielding. 
   I am proud to join my fellow new Members of the class of 2006. Freshmen, new Members, whatever you want to call us, I am really honored to be here with all of you and to tell you, speaking of oversight, about my trip this last weekend to Iraq. I think it's one of the most important functions the Constitution gives to Congress, the power, the sole power, to make war and to fund that war should it decide that it needs to happen.     
   I flew out on a congressional delegation that was led by our fellow classmate, Dave Loebsack, Congressman of Iowa. And after a few hours of sleep in Kuwait, we were flown in by a C-130 to Balad Airbase in Iraq. On the way in, the plane's crew deployed flares against a perceived threat from the ground. I never found out exactly what they saw, but they fired flares for protection. 
   We got a tour of the base and the Air Force Theater Hospital there. We spent a night in the Green Zone. I slept in a guest room in one of the pool houses by one of Saddam's palaces, with a big Olympic swimming pool and gold fixtures and a marble bathroom that the guesthouse had. And I understand this is a subject of some friction with the Iraqis who feel that after 4 years we should have handed over the national palaces to the Iraqi people rather than inhabiting them ourselves, but that's another subject. 
   I have good news and I have not so good news. The good news that I first perceived on my trip is that, first of all, I cannot state strongly enough my admiration and respect for our Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine personnel. Officers, medical teams, enlisted men and women, all are displaying creativity, commitment and a work ethic that should make all of us proud, even when they're carrying out duties other than they were trained for, such as an artillery officer doing civil affairs or training Iraqi police. They are more than up to the mission. 
   The other good news is the money that we and our fellows here in Congress voted for MRAPs was definitely money well spent. We saw a picture of a Cougar MRAP that was hit by such a powerful explosive that it blew it up 25 feet or so into the air, hooked the utility lines, and brought them down with it as it landed upside down. Four soldiers inside that MRAP, two of them  walked away; the other two spent a night in the hospital with relatively minor injuries and returned to their units. Their commander told us that in any other vehicle all four would have been fatalities. 
   Now for the bad news. We have a lot of other vehicles. We were shown a huge parking lot. Imagine the biggest used car lot that you ever saw full of Humvees, Bradley vehicles, tanks, trucks, all kinds of vehicles that had been hit by IEDs. Some, including Abrams tanks, looked like they had been opened up by a can opener and had metal inside that had melted and resolidified. Tires, treads, electronics and other useable parts were being salvaged, and the twisted steel that was left sold for scrap to Kuwait. 
   Some vehicles were deemed fit for repair, but most of what we saw was clearly far beyond repair. The lot we looked at represented thousands of American casualties and billions of taxpayer dollars. We were not, by the way, allowed to take photographs of it. 
   In the Green Zone, the most heavily guarded part of Baghdad, one of the safest, supposedly, parts of Baghdad, we were shown the concrete shelters every couple of hundred feet and warned to duck inside one of these shelters if an alarm sounded, because just the week before, two American troops were killed by mortar fire in the Green Zone. Even sleeping in a guest room in Saddam's pool house, with the Olympic swimming pool and gold fixtures, we had to be ready to duck and cover. 
   We had meetings with Ambassador Ryan Crocker, General Petraeus, briefings by the intelligence staff. And my synopsis of the conversations goes like this: Ambassador Crocker said, ``the Maliki government is somewhere between challenged and dysfunctional.'' 
   I asked repeatedly about what progress is being made toward restoration of clean drinking water, sewer service, and uninterrupted electrical supply. The answers from all of our briefers were vague. And current estimates are that electricity is only on 2 to 3 hours in Baghdad, maybe 12 hours a day in Ramadi or the Shia-controlled south. 
   The next day we got to go to what they called the safest part of the country, which is Ramadi in Anbar province. Surprise; the last couple of months there has been a decrease in violence there as what they call the Anbar awakening happens with the sheiks deciding they're going to side with us rather than siding with the terrorists. 
   Nonetheless, as we rode in the helicopter to the safe part of the country, we flew low and fast, close to the deck, with two .50 caliber machine guns out each of the front doors, and a couple of times they fired bursts of automatic weapons fire. And afterwards I asked what it was for, and the gunners said they were clearing intersections. I presume that means firing in front of the lines of vehicles to make them stop and not drive directly underneath us. 
   When we entered the marketplace to see the new, safe Ramadi market and the new business center, the small business center that had opened, we were driven there in a Cougar MRAP and told to wear our body armor and our helmets while we were inside the MRAP. And when we took them off and walked around the marketplace, we were surrounded at all times by a ring of dozens of soldiers carrying automatic weapons, and they were wearing their helmets and their body armor. So, if that's the safe part of Iraq, I wonder what the dangerous part is. 
   On the way home we stopped in Ramstein, Germany, launched to a medical center, visited some of our troops. I saw one of my constituents there and had my picture taken with him, and interrupted his lunch to shake his hand and thank him for his service. 
   There were several Romanians there who were injured, a number of Americans, all of whom from Iraq were hurt in Baghdad, attacked in Baghdad, and then there was one attacked or wounded in Afghanistan. 
   Their spirits, in general, were great, and the medical staff was terrific. I can't say enough about our medical core either. And they really appreciate the visits. They really appreciate the donations from home that are coming from individuals, from school kids, from veterans groups and from corporations of everything from fleece and coats and underwear and toothbrushes, anything you might need, duffel bags, because these are soldiers evacuated from the point where they were wounded in the field by helicopter to Balad and then stabilized and sent off to Germany. 
   So, there are good things, but there are also enough negative things going on there so that I returned with the same conclusion that I went there suspecting, which is that the $200 billion more that we're being asked for by President Bush for Iraq, based on the presumption that the Maliki government, which our own ambassador describes is dysfunctional, will be up to the task of resolving and reconciling the differences between the different sects is wishful thinking; and that after a year and another $200 billion, where will we be? What kind of guarantee, what kind of even probability do we have of a stable country to leave behind? If the sheiks in Anbar can get together, if the mullahs in the south, the Shia south can get together, if the Kurds in the north can get together and stop attacking Turkey long enough to have the country that they've always wanted, then perhaps we can bring our troops home and get to business spending that money here on things that Americans, at least in my district, are telling me they need built, infrastructure they need repaired, schools that they need to be improved, and other things that constitute Nation building here at home. 
   That is the short version of my report. I thank you so much for letting me share that with you.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is true that all of our areas and our districts around the country are different in many ways, but it is also true that they are the same, and our people have the same needs in many ways. 
   The gentleman from Florida talked about Hurricane Katrina. The gentleman from Minnesota mentioned the trailers that FEMA didn't know were contaminated with formaldehyde. Two weeks ago, in my district, the town of Deer Park discovered they had lead contamination in their highway department building and their town hall  that was measured at 5,000-plus parts per million of indoor air contamination of lead. 
   My office called and we got FEMA to send a trailer over 2 days later so they could set up some computers and telephones and at least have a rudimentary office in the parking lot next to their closed-down office being remediated for lead contamination. 
   Three days later, the following Monday, I found that FEMA had come and towed the trailer away because it was contaminated with formaldehyde. Two-plus years after Hurricane Katrina, they still don't know which of their trailers have formaldehyde in them and which ones don't. 
   That is why oversight is needed. Whether it is the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which has performed significant oversight, whether it is the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee looking at Coast Guard sweetheart deals with military contractors that resulted in eight vessels being lengthened by 13 feet and rendered unseaworthy, the 123s, as they call them, so they are now being scrapped in Baltimore Harbor, or whether it is oversight of the conduct of the war in Iraq, this body needs to perform oversight, and I am glad after the last 6 years, it is finally doing so.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I agree that we need energy independence. All Americans agree that we need energy independence. There used to be bipartisanship on this issue. In fact, it was the first President Bush who proposed an executive order banning drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   We've had eight budgets sent here by President George W. Bush, who's his son. Every one of them, including this February when we got the budget for fiscal 2009, included language banning drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Somebody got a poll this last spring, and the prices went up because they're being manipulated by oil companies and OPEC, and we wind up with a situation where it becomes a campaign issue that was made into a partisan issue by, I believe, the party that had originally supported these things, whose President sent us eight budgets with banning the Outer Continental Shelf language. 
   So I would just say calm down. We are working on a genuine, all-of-the-above, bipartisan--we hope it will be a bipartisan bill. It's up to my colleagues and my friends on the other side of the aisle, but the solutions are there. They're available today. The renewables are in front of us, and they hire more people than fossil fuels.

   Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of this economic stimulus package, which will have an immediate effect on our economy by creating investments in infrastructure projects that can start fast, meet existing needs and create jobs. These projects provide short-term benefits by putting people to work, buying goods, and leave behind long-term infrastructure assets that will benefit Americans for years to come. 
   Outside of the crumbling schools that will be repaired, the water projects, the transit, the advanced battery technologies, et cetera, I want to just mention the one that I am thinking right now about the most, highway infrastructure, $12.8 billion for our Nation's crumbling, aging, highways and bridges, to improve our safety and reduce traffic congestion. In my district, there are 13 bridges on the deficient list that was released after the I-35 bridge collapse in Minnesota. 
   If we can spend $12 billion a month in Iraq, certainly we can come up with this $12.8 billion to repair the bridges that our school buses, our trucks carrying commerce, and our family vehicles are going across every day. This will be a job-creation program whose jobs cannot be outsourced. We would be rebuilding the value of our own country, nation building here at home, and creating jobs for our people that cannot be sent abroad.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration's recent decision to reject New York's plan to provide health insurance for uninsured children is just another example of how out of touch the President is with the needs of the American people. 
   Last year, the number of uninsured children in the Nation increased to over 8.6 million, an increase of over 600,000 children. The State of New York has committed to decrease this number, starting with our lowest income families. However, the onerous conditions placed by this administration are threatening to thwart New York's efforts. 
   That any Americans have no health insurance is a travesty; that so many do is a tragedy of the highest proportion. 
   Providing our children with health care is protecting America's future. It is difficult to imagine why the President wants to stop New York from protecting the health of its children. But this decision suggests just that. We must not allow this to stand. I am committed to working with my colleagues to do what must be done to overturn this misguided decision.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq has cost, as of last week, every man, woman and child in my district, New York's 19th district, $3,077. Now, for that $3,077, the men, women and children of my district have paid for a war that was a strategic mistake and has been horribly mismanaged. 
   In the latest example, USA Today revealed that the Pentagon has been even slower than we thought in providing safer vehicles for our troops. According to e-mails within the Pentagon, a Marine general in Iraq requested MRAPs, mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, as far back as December 2003. These vehicles offer the best protection from IEDs for our troops. The number one killer of troops in Iraq are IEDs.  
   However, while Pentagon leadership delayed in providing these vehicles to U.S. troops, they decided to equip the Iraqi Army with these vehicles, while leaving our soldiers with Humvees. This resulted in the unnecessary deaths of at least 600 Americans. 
   For $3,000, the taxpayers of my district paid for the best equipment we could buy for the Iraqi Army, but left our soldiers and marines with substandard Humvees. It is time we reorient our priorities, protect our own soldiers, and end this war.

   The war in Iraq has cost every man, woman and child in my district $3,077. For over $3,000 a person, the people in my district have gotten a war that was a strategic mistake and has made them less safe. It is time we end this war.

Mr. Speaker, this evening, the House of Representatives considered H.R. 2900, The Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007, which, among other things reauthorized the FDA through 2012. I voted for this bill because I believe it's vital for our national interests that the FDA be authorized, and I am aware that the current authorization is due to expire very shortly. That said, I cast this vote with great reservations. The current funding of the FDA is too dependent on the companies that the Agency is supposed to be regulating. There is an inherent and unacceptable conflict of interest in this arrangement. To be a truly effective regulator, the FDA must be a completely independent entity, with no outside relationships. Only then can the American people be absolutely certain that the agency is always acting with their best interests in mind. 
   It is my hope that during conference with the Senate some greater protections can be added to this legislation to ensure that it is an independent entity in which we can place our full and complete trust.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am excited to be here at this time, at this point in history when our country will finally, beginning in this House of Representatives, begin to act on renewable energy and conservation in a meaningful way. And I also want to say that I hope Northeast farmers will also be able to contribute to the biofuels that will be developing. 
   I have a friend in New York State who is driving around in a stock diesel Jeep Liberty 4-by-4 that he is running on biodiesel made from wood waste at a renewable tree farm that makes furniture in New York, just north of my district in Representative Gillibrand's district, but it is minutes from where I live in Dover Plains, New York. There is no modification needed to the vehicle. The company that is making this fuel runs all their farm vehicles on it, they run their road vehicles on it. Every scrap of leaves and sawdust and little twigs and things that are parts of the tree that are too small to go into the furniture they make goes into making biodiesel fuel, and it is very successful. 
   The only thing that is lacking is the knowledge on the public's part that they can ask for it, and the law of supply and demand will work for renewables the same way it does for any other form of energy or any other commodity. 
   I called up my own local oil company in my hometown of Dover and asked if they had biodiesel to sell for me to burn in my home heating oil system, my furnace that heats our home, and they said yes. And I said, ``What is it?'' And they said, ``20 percent soybean derivative.'' And I said, ``Sign me up.'' And I asked the gentleman on the phone, ``How is it?'' And he said, ``I am the owner of the company and I burn it in our house, and it burns cleaner than regular home heating oil.'' 
   So it is similar to the situation I ran into when I served in county government and we were dealing with markets constantly fluctuating in recyclables, for instance, where one month you might make money on recycling paper and the next month you might lose it. It depends on how many plants are built to recycle it and how many new communities start to do so in earnest. 
   If our country and our citizens know to ask for wind power, which we get in my home the first 1,500 kilowatt hours per month from a wind farm in Atlantic City. And that is only one of many wind installations that are being put up around the northeast. There is a big wind farm in the Tug Hill Plateau in the Adirondacks that is going to figure majorly in New York's energy supply, and in the Finger Lakes region also. Farmers are finding out that they can lease space on their property for wind turbines, make royalties on it or lease payments from the utilities on it that will pay their property taxes and enable them to stay in farming. The cows don't care. They graze under the wind turbines, and meanwhile they are turning overhead and cranking out the energy. 
   The Jersey Atlantic Wind Farm in Atlantic City that my wife and I are buying power from will be amortized in 5 years. It consists of five 380-foot-tall wind turbines. Each turbine is a greater surface area than a football field and taller than the Statue of Liberty and generates 7 1/2 million watts of power when it is running at peak operation. 
   So if it is free in 5 years, the investment is paid off. After that, you have free energy, you have no pollution, zero emissions, and as you were saying it helps our balance of trade deficit, it cuts back on the money that we are sending to the Middle East oil potentates that are funding the madrasas that are training people that we then have to send our military to go fight. It cuts back on oil spills. It cuts back on asthma and emphysema in the inner cities, the particulate emissions. So it is a win-win-win situation with jobs being created here, with the dollars that we are spending on energy being kept here. 
   And I would just like to say once again that I am proud to be a part of this action of repealing and closing loopholes. It is not a raise of taxes as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were saying before, but it is actually closing tax loopholes, subsidies, and giveaways that they created in the last Congress and transferring those funds to these renewable energies.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I am just looking at the uses 
   of the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, and I will get that out in one sentence, to accelerate the use of clean domestic renewable energy resources and alternative fuels, to promote the utilization of energy efficient products and practices and conservation, and to increase research development and deployment of clean, renewable energy and energy efficiencies and technologies. 
   The word ``conservation'' is in there, and it is one that has been sadly neglected. In fact, it was unfortunate a few years ago when our Vice President said conservation may be a personal virtue, but it is no way to build a national energy policy. I completely disagree. I think it is one of the most important ways to start building a national energy policy, and I was happy Mr. Bartlett earlier was talking about energy efficiency. It is time all of us on both sides of the aisle did that and put our money where those words are. 
   I see these pet peeves of mine as I go through every day life. For instance, walking down the aisle of the supermarket, in the Northeast, I can walk through Hanford's A&P or Stop & Shop, and there are aisle after aisle of cold cases with yogurt or beer or cheese that is being kept cold by a refrigerator and a compressor running all of the time, and an open top so it is convenient. I can just reach in. But there is no door or plastic sheet to keep the cold air in and the warm air out. Meanwhile, because we live in the northern part of the country, half of the year there is a furnace going to keep the shoppers warm and the furnace and the compressor are working at cross purposes. That is the kind of blindness we have gotten used to, that energy is something we can throw away.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I wanted to mention something that should be another part of our energy mix and that is low head hydroelectric power. There are dams and waterfalls throughout this country where in some instances they used to generate power and no  longer do. But our own Idaho National Laboratory from the Department of Energy did a study a couple of years ago that showed, and it is on their Website, it shows how much State By State latent hydroelectric power is waiting to be harvested. 
   In New York State, there are some 4,000 dams and waterfalls that could, just by having turbines placed where the water is already falling, yield greater than 1,200 megawatts of power, which is about 60 percent of the peak output of the Indian Point Nuclear Plant in my district. 
   It is that kind of using everything. We have to leave no stone unturned and to try every opportunity for clean, renewable domestic sources of power for national security purposes, as Mr. Klein mentioned, for environmental purposes, as we all know, and for global warming. Anybody in my part of the country knows that the weather is not normal this year. And, indeed, the records for last year showed that it is the warmest year on record and there has been a string of years getting warmer. 
   We had a seminar at one of our freshman orientation sessions on global warming that shows as the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are rising, the temperature average is rising with it. It has risen out of what they call the background noise, where it is no longer something that can be written off to the normal ups and downs of climate. We are experiencing a change, a man-made change in our climate here on earth, and it is our duty to our children and grandchildren not to leave them that problem or to leave them mountains of debt because we refused to deal with this problem and keep borrowing money from one country so we can import oil from another country and lose our own sovereignty in the process.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Inslee. I am pretty confident there will be votes from both sides of the aisle tomorrow. And it is interesting thinking about the history of ExxonMobil in terms of their corporate advertising, going back to the days of Herbert Schmertz and the op-ed in The New York Times, and how they have spent probably more money, and other oil companies as well have spent more money. Or I should say they have spent good money on advertising to try to stop people from changing the approach that they could have spent instead on research and development on these new forms of energy. 
   I wanted to mention one you had not mentioned yet, and that is tidal power. Wave power, of course, is obvious. My dad taught me to sail when I was a kid, and many is the time I have sailed by a buoy that had one of those wave-driven generators in it and keeping the light powered, and/or a solar panel on it keeping the light powered and a battery storing the energy. 
   But tidal power in my neck of the woods, in the Hudson River, which splits my district in half, is tidal all the way to Troy, all the way past Albany, and navigable all the way that far north. The current runs a couple knots and a half south on the ebb and about two knots north on the flood in New York Harbor. And in the East River and in Hellgate, what they call the juncture of the East River and the Harlem River, where it opens into Long Island Sound to the east, the tidal current there runs five to six knots, depending on the phase of the moon. 
   We have inlets, rivers, harbors, coastline all throughout this country where tide comes and goes, millions of tons, millions of tons of pressure of water moving in and out of these bodies of water twice a day every day. And that is, well, it is solar and lunar, because it is driven by, I guess primarily by the  moon, but nonetheless it is natural, free energy that can be harvested and should be explored. And, indeed, there have been experiments going on in the East River with tidal generators within the last year that I am looking forward to seeing the results of. But that is one more available source.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Yes, if the gentleman would yield for another minute. I wanted to mention a couple of other ways we can help, that the government can help jump start these industries. One of them is indemnification of risk. We have unbeknownst to most Americans been the underwriters for the nuclear industry since its beginning via the Price-Anderson Act. In fact, there would never have been a nuclear plant, electrical generating plant built in this country if the taxpayer didn't underwrite the possible cost of a catastrophic accident. 
   Now, if we took that same approach where we were willing to subsidize or underwrite alternative fuels or low head hydro plants, many of which are being held up, by the way, because of liability issues, that would be one way that we could help. 
   Another way would be preferential purchasing, because the government, at all levels, buys a lot of vehicles. And if we put out a request for proposals saying that we want American companies to build vehicles that will either be plug-in hybrids or plug-in biodiesel hybrids, or just high efficiency vehicles that can be used in our fleets that the different departments of our government used, that would start the economy of scale working. The same way the wrist watches, digital wrist watches that used to cost $200 when they first came out came down to the point where they are $2 now, and computer chips that were bought in quantity by the Defense Department, or by the aerospace industry and NASA, drove down the cost to the point where now anybody can afford a laptop. It is that economy of scale that we can help get started. 
   And as you said, it is not going to be something that we will have to underwrite or subsidize forever. But when you look at the number of years that we have been subsidizing the old technologies that may be 19th or 20th century technology, we certainly now, in the 21st century can look at these renewables, domestic clean safe renewables and think about the same helping hand to get them off the ground.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I wanted to say that you prompted this thought. I am not against big corporations. I am not against corporations making a profit. In fact, a couple of the companies that are making the most innovation and putting the most investment into wind energy in our country right now are GE and Siemens. General Electric built the wind turbines that are in the Atlantic City wind farm that I mentioned earlier. Whether it is small start up companies working on alternative energy or whether it is existing oil companies or other utilities or big energy companies, the important thing to say, and this is the important thing, I think, to say to individuals also, and it is what I believe leadership should be doing, whether it is our President, whether it is Senators or whether it is us here on the floor of the House of Representatives, we need to tell our corporations and our citizens that it is patriotic to save energy, that it is patriotic, when you have a choice, to use the most domestic, clean, renewable form of energy that you can. It is patriotic to try to support, if you have a choice on the back of your utility bill, as I do in New York State, to check off that I want wind power, or to check off that I want hydro electric. You could choose the source of where your power comes from if you can afford to do it. And not everybody can, but those of us who are able to spend a couple of cents more per gallon for home heating fuel can get biodiesel. Well, right now it is no difference where I live. It is the same price for bio as it is for oil. But we need to think of this in terms of patriotism and national security and our national interest, and that you can't separate it from our foreign policy. You can't separate it from our economic well-being. You certainly can't separate it from our health. And I don't think you can separate it from our job future either. We need to have these industries start up and be developed here so we can compete. We can't afford to be in a situation we are in right now with hybrids, where I, who want to support, I got elected with union support, I am proud to say. Now I want to buy an American hybrid car that gets top mileage, and right now, the best mileage cars being sold in the United States are made in Japan. I don't believe, for a minute, that we can't compete and make a car that will get as good mileage or better as any other country in the world as their companies can. I think it is the choices that have been made, and the incentives that have been offered or the direction that has been given by government has been lacking. And I am proud to be a part of this 110th Congress, when we, tomorrow, will start down that road where we transfer the emphasis from the old to the new in terms of energy.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I think you have said it all, Congressman. I am happy to be here and proud to be here as part of this 110th. This is part of our taking our own future back, we as a country, I am talking about all the citizens of this country. 
   I think the same way Congressman Klein mentioned the moon shot, I do remember that, I am a couple years older than you are, and there was a huge lift in the psyche of this country, because even though President Kennedy didn't live to see the day that we landed a man on the moon, it was done in 9 years when he said we could do it in 10. 
   So our ingenuity and our industry and our creativity took hold, and we accomplished the goal. You could just sense this palpable lifting of the weight off the shoulders of Americans on the street. I mean, people you knew, that we had done this. 
   The day that we harness all these alternatives, and harness the power of conservation and efficiency so that we can say no thanks, turn that tanker around, send it back to the Middle East, we don't need that oil, that day, when that day arrives, you will see the same feeling of weight lifting off the shoulders of the American people and a feeling of self-sufficiency and of pride and of being in control of our own destiny again. That is really something to look forward to.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, there are millions of Americans across this country who have lost a house, lost a job or lost their investments through no fault of their own, and they don't have a rich corporate bonus. They don't have a golden parachute or a bailout plan. 
   The idea that the well-paid executives who contributed so much to put  us in this mess could walk away, while making millions of dollars, getting bailed out by the same taxpayers who are struggling thanks to their negligence, is totally absurd and cannot be allowed. Whatever we do this week, as we help out Wall Street, we should throw a lifeline to Main Street where people are really hurting. 
   We need to help them keep their homes, hold on to their jobs and make ends meet. We must act to ensure that these problems never happen again by including rigorous new government control and oversight into all of the securities and institutions that have been operating outside regulatory authority. 
   If we act in the right way, I have no doubt we can pass a bill that will rescue the economy and at the same time prevent this same mess from happening again. We must pass the right bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (THE BUDGET AND NATIONAL DEBT -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Congressman. It's my pleasure to join you tonight. 
   I wish I had as much pleasure looking at the budget the President submitted as I do discussing it with you, and all of us, of course, earlier this week received a copy of the President's budget. Like all of us, I was disappointed by the questionable accounting and fiscal irresponsibilities contained within this budget. I wish I could say I was surprised, but unfortunately it represents the same missed opportunities and misplaced priorities that have highlighted this administration. 
   First of all, I would have to say for a President and an administration that claimed to be fiscally responsible and who constantly accuse Democrats of being fiscally irresponsible, it's really shocking and deserving of mention that this President, George W. Bush, has been responsible, his administration, responsible for the five biggest deficits in American history. Here they are. We all remember, of course, at the end of the 1990s when President Bush took over from President Clinton that we had a surplus, and we were, in fact, paying down some of the national debt for a change. 
   But due to his tax policies and his overspending and his penchant for borrowing, our President and his administration have run up, in 2003, a deficit of $378 billion; in 2004, a deficit of $413 billion; in 2005, $318 billion; 2008 actually is the next figure here, $410 billion; and for 2009 is a projected $407 billion budget. 
   We can't keep this up. Any family knows that they can't keep spending. In fact, too many families are finding this out, that the chickens eventually come home to roost. I, as a former school board president and school board trustee who had to balance the budget every year know that you can't go on spending more money than you take in without some kind of disaster befalling you. 
   Unfortunately, what's happening in terms of the value of the dollar, in terms of our exporting jobs, in terms of foreign interests buying up pieces of the United States or corporations or infrastructure in the United States, in terms of our weakened markets, and volatile and declining markets, all these things have to do with the basic foundation, the underpinning of our country being massive debt. 
   The other thing about the President's budget that I was surprised to see and disappointed to see, it does nothing to fix the alternative minimum tax, or the AMT, a tax which was originally designed, when it first took effect in 1970, to affect only 155 households, the most wealthy, the most affluent households in America who were using tax loopholes to avoid paying any tax at all. Congress wrote, in the late 1960s, this bill which the AMT took effect in 1970, to hit the very top of the most wealthy people in the country. 
   Now because it was never indexed to inflation, it was never given a cost-of-living increase, it was never allowed to float as the cost of living and the average salaries and income in the country changed, that AMT has dipped every year deeper and deeper and deeper into the American tax-paying public and dramatically increasing the tax rate paid by millions of middle-class families who were never intended to be hit by the AMT, over 20 million of whom will be forced to pay it next year. 
   Without a permanent fix, half of all taxpayers in this country will pay this AMT that was originally designed to hit 155 of the wealthiest households in the country. 
   But the President does nothing to stop this. Instead, he calls for more than $1 trillion in tax cuts for the top 1 percent of all Americans. 
   Once again, we have 5 years in a row of record increases in the poverty rate, we have record increases in personal debt, we have record increases in national debt, we have record increases in our balance of trade deficit. Strangely enough, at the same time, I read in the paper that ExxonMobil has declared 40 point some billion dollars in profit, the largest single yearly corporate profit in the history of the world, breaking the previous record which was held by ExxonMobil themselves. 
   Some people in this economy and in this current fiscal and business financial scheme are doing very, very, very well and will continue to do very well. There are others, mainly the middle class and lower income Americans, who are being squeezed from all sides. Believe me, they are not being squeezed up, they are being squeezed down. 
   The middle class is having their options and their opportunities cut, whether it's the cost of sending their children to college, whether it's being the cost of purchasing health care for their families, the cost of property or property tax, the cost of fuel for their cars or for their homes. I mean, even the fact that the President in this budget slashed the low-income heating assistance program, LIHEAP, is scandalous. 
   At a time when we have families and seniors who are struggling to heat their homes in the northern parts of this country, I wouldn't have expected the President, a so-called compassionate conservative, to be so discompassionate as to cut heating assistance for low-income people in this current climate of economic uncertainty and astronomical fuel costs. 
   I would just say that I am happy to be here to discuss this, and, more importantly, to talk about how we are going to move to a real budget, not a fake budget that's based on some platitudes and some kind of ideological belief, some faith-based budgeting that has nothing to do with reality and nothing to do with the well-being of the American people.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Yarmuth. I appreciate your leading this discussion. I also want to acknowledge my colleague from New York (Mr. Arcuri). Thank you for serving as Speaker pro tem during this period of time. 
   I'd just like to respond to Mr. Walz's comment about what kind of sense does it make for this cut in the water program in your district. Well, I can say it makes about as much sense as the President's completely eliminating the Byrne Grant program and the COPS program, both of which are vital to my district to provide cops, additional policemen on the streets in the 19th District of New York. It makes about as much sense as cutting the important programs that provide local and State law enforcement agencies with funds to fight terrorism and crime, including almost $140 million that were cut from bioterrorism preparedness. They make as much sense as the President cutting Medicare and Medicaid at a time when health insurance costs are skyrocketing, when more and more Americans are forced to live without health insurance. This budget cuts $200 billion out of health insurance from Medicare and Medicaid. At a time when we're facing one of the most damaging housing crises in our history with foreclosures and evictions due to the subprime mortgage crisis, it makes as much sense as this President cutting the Nation's largest rental assistance program. It makes as much sense, as I mentioned before, as cutting the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program by almost 25 percent, preventing people in the lower income segment of our economy from being able to heat their homes during the winter. 
   We were talking about your district. I'll talk about something specific to mine. We have, many of us think due to climate change, suffered from three 50-year floods in the last 3 years in the 19th District, the Delaware River, the Wallkill River, the Ten Mile River, all flooding farms, homes, businesses, golf courses, which might not sound too important, except they do employ people and they're a source of economic input into the local economy. And, but as importantly, lives were lost. In Congressman Hinchey's district in Sullivan County, there was a drastic, catastrophic flood shortly after the April 29 nor'easter, which was the third in 2007, the third in a row of our 50-year floods that came within 3 years. 
   So last year, when I was new, I was a freshman, wet behind the ears, just been sworn in for my first turn, we got into the appropriations process. And you know what it's like. People come into your office from different departments of the government asking to  have funding restored to these different important programs that have been cut by the administration. One of those who came to my office was the general who is the Army Corps of Engineers director of the Philadelphia district, which includes the Delaware watershed. Now, the Delaware Corps of Engineers offices go by watersheds, not by State lines or any kind of political jurisdictions. Her district, the general's, ran from Philadelphia up to Delaware and into New York from Pennsylvania and all the way up to the reservoirs that feed New York City's drinking water system. This is one of the rivers that has had, at that point in time, three 50-year floods in a short span. She came in to ask if I could help restore funding. And I said, well, what was it cut to? And she showed me in the President's budget it was cut to zero. It was a goose egg. 
   Now, flood control, in the days after Hurricane Katrina, we all know is a serious matter. This obviously is not a serious document any more than last year's budget was a serious document. This document is a fictitious document that is aimed at pretending to balance the budget in 2012. And we all know that can't be done. And, in fact, the general and others who have come from different departments to my office and others have said, off the record, that it's done with the knowledge that the Democratic majority will restore some of these funds at least to be able to keep the programs going and to protect people, and then we'll get blamed for being big spenders. 
   Well, in terms of being big spenders, I just want to bring out this chart which I happen to have here which shows the surplus that was the United States budget surplus when, in 2001, the Bush administration began its term. There was a $5.6 trillion surplus. In the time since then, there's red ink of $8.8 trillion, so that at this point in time we're at a $3.2 trillion deficit, including omitted items. 
   Now, we all know there are items that are not included in this. For instance, the war is off budget. We fought wars in the past, World War II or the Korean War or the Vietnam War, World War I, during which time people were asked to sacrifice. People were asked to pay for the war as they went. 
   This is a war that we're borrowing money to pay for, and Congressman Klein's chart that he showed before, of the increasing foreign ownership of our debt, I think, is really important and really interesting for several reasons. Obviously it's not healthy for us to have this much debt and to accumulate an ever-growing interest payment that eclipses anything we can do for education or for housing or for veterans or for homeland security and that we're going to pass on to our children and our grandchildren.     
   That's really unconscionable. 
   But the other thing that that does to have that kind of huge debt to the Chinese or to the Saudis or to the Mexican or Japanese Governments or investors from other countries is it loses our sovereignty when we can't talk to China about Darfur or when we can't talk to China honestly about human rights violations in their country or about the obliteration of the history of Tibet or about whether they're being as tough with North Korea about their nuclear problem as we want them to be or about lead in toys that are being imported for our children to play with or about contaminated food or animal feed or contaminated medicine. When we can't talk to the Saudis honestly about human rights violations in their country or about their funding of the madrasas, we have suffered what I call a loss of sovereignty. When you no longer can make honest, diplomatic, economic, military, international decisions or really state what is in your best interest because you are afraid that your hands are tied for want of getting a commodity from one place or the money to pay the debt off from another place, then you have lost some of your sovereignty. 
   And I'm telling you, in this country, the American people are not aware of the extent of it yet, but they better get aware of it because this is already a major factor in our foreign policy, but it will be more and more of a problem and restrict our options more and more in the future if we do not get back to a surplus in terms of our budget, if we don't get back to a surplus in the balance of trade, if we don't start producing things here. I, personally, am especially fond of the options of renewable energy technologies and high tech and computer and medical advances and so on that we have traditionally led the world in. 
   But we need to invest in education, we need to invest in these innovation approaches to technologies and especially to invest in new forms of energy to get us away from the billions of dollars a day that go to import oil. 
   But all of these things are our freedom, and they equate our future sovereignty. And I hope we make the right decisions, as opposed to the wrong decisions, that are embodied in this budget that the President just released so that our children and grandchildren will enjoy being a truly sovereign country and a leader in the world in these things rather than being subservient to whatever foreign interests happen to own our debt.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I would like to close by saying as college costs rise, this President eliminates programs to help pay low-income students for higher education. As health care costs rise, this budget proposes a significant cut in both Medicare and Medicaid. It actually cuts funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, which would endanger the health and welfare of all Americans. 
   So to quote from this President Bush's father, the first President, Herbert Walker Bush, when he was responding to the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, This will not stand. I will say, as far as this budget being brought to this Congress, this will not stand. It will be changed, and I hope the next time around on the floor of the House we will be talking about the positive changes that we've made to reflect the priorities of the American people which we were elected to espouse.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, before being sworn in, I was home in my district for a couple of weeks doing a listening tour traveling around the five counties that I represent, and I had dozens of my constituents come up to me and say, Please bring them home, bring our troops home. 
   I didn't have one person in my district in New York come up to me and say, Please send more over there. 
   I am proud and honored and humbled, and I must say saddened at the same time, at the prospect that as a member of the Veterans' Affairs committee of this House that I will be able and be responsible to help returning veterans from this war deal with their physical, psychological, economic, housing and other problems. 
   It is an honor. It is an important service to provide. But what is a shame is that we are creating so many more veterans that have so much more grievous problems, that this war is producing injuries that in previous wars might not have been survivable. 
   The good news is that the soldiers, our servicemen and -women, are surviving in greater numbers. The bad news is that when they come home, they have to deal with much longer periods of rehabilitation or much more serious injuries and limitations on their mobility and on their other physical capabilities. 
   I am reminded, standing here, of the State of the Union address 3 years ago when Ahmed Chalabi was sitting in the Presidential box next to the First Lady. At the time he was the fair-haired boy that we had picked out of Iraq to stake our hopes for creating a government in our image and likeness and our country on. So no longer is it Chalabi; it is Maliki.     
   The President is telling us we can to take his word and trust that he can produce 18 brigades to spread out across the country and to work side by side with our troops. 
   I am not so sure that 18 brigades that are reliable and independently-functioning of Iraqi Army and police actually exist. I am also not so sure that in another couple of years it won't be somebody else besides Maliki; that  there will be a new Prime Minister that we will be told we should stake our hopes on. 
   There was a front-page story in the Baltimore Sun yesterday that said that 20,000-some new troops heading to Iraq will have to go with the old, lesser armored vehicles, the flat-bottomed HMMWVs, because the new V-hulled transports that deflect the power of a roadside bomb or a land mine are not available in sufficient numbers because the money has not been available to bring the production lines up to where they need to be to have them ready. 
   It just bespeaks of the same incompetent planning, the same lack of thorough thinking of the problem through that leaves us with six fluent Arabic-speaking translators in the embassy according to the Baker-Hamilton Report. 
   If you believe our national intelligence estimate from this past fall that says all 16 of our intelligence agencies in this country report that so far the Iraq war has created more terrorists than it has disposed of, where is the logic in continuing that war? Where is the logic in escalating that war? 
   I would like to see a surge of interpreters and a surge of religious and historical experts in the region and a surge of trained negotiators, and I would like to see a surge of diplomacy, of us treating other countries as sovereigns and talking to them. There are a couple of examples of that working. 
   One might remember, for instance, a President from the other side of the aisle from me, President Reagan going to South Africa which at the time was a rogue state that had nuclear weapons, and I was on the side that was saying, Let's sanction them. Let's not talk to them. And let's cut off all interaction. And what he called constructive engagement was sending ballet troupes and sending artists and having as much commercial and cultural exchange as possible to bring them to our way of thinking. It worked in that case, a nuclear power disarmed. And I would like to see that kind of emphasis and diplomacy returned to our country's foreign policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentlewoman. Today, I rise in support of H.R. 3, the Chamber's effort to improve the lives of millions of Americans by once again advancing the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act.  
   For many Americans, including relatives and friends of mine who suffer from the effects of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, paralysis, and other devastating illnesses, embryonic stem cell research provides the hope of a better life or even perhaps a cure. 
   Last year, Johns Hopkins University released the results of stem cell therapy tests on frogs in the laboratory using frog embryonic stem cells which showed paralyzed frogs recovering the use of their hind quarters. Now, one can't necessarily extrapolate from laboratory experiments to humans; but until we try, we will not know. 
   There has been a lot of debate about this bill, what it is and what it is not. I would just suggest that by allowing the Federal Government to support research on embryonic stem cells, regardless of when they were derived, this bill will allow science to move forward unimpeded in the quest to cure some of our most crippling diseases.  
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in support this chamber's effort to improve the lives of millions of Americans by once again advancing the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   For many Americans suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, paralysis, and other devastating illnesses embryonic stem cell research provides the hope of a better life, or even perhaps a cure. 
   There has been a lot of debate about what this bill is, and what it isn't. 
   What this bill is an opportunity to expand the resources the federal government can bring to bear in supporting breakthroughs in medical technology. 
   Under current policy, only stem cell lines derived before August 2001 can be used for research. But according to the National Institutes of Health, of the 78 stem cell lines that were declared eligible for federal funding by the President, less than one third are still available. 
   To make matters worse, many of the available lines are contaminated with ``mouse feeder'' cells, making their therapeutic use for humans uncertain. 
   By allowing the federal government to support research on embryonic stem cells regardless of when they were derived, this bill would allow science to move forward unimpeded in the quest to cure some of our most crippling diseases. 
   What this bill isn't is an attempt to devalue human life. 
   Under this bill, stem cells could only be used for research if they would never be used by fertility clinics and be discarded, and only if the donor of the embryo gave full consent. 
   Instead of being discarded, these embryos could help researchers unlock the cures to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, MS, cancer, and other conditions. Certainly, advancing these goals is consistent with a reverence for human life. 
   Last year, Congress overwhelmingly passed this bill on a bipartisan basis, and it's clear that the majority of the American people want this research to go forward. 
   It is my sincere hope that we will again pass this bill by an overwhelming and bipartisan margin, and send it to the President for his signature. 
   I would urge the President not to repeat his previous mistake of allowing ideology to trump science by vetoing this bill. Instead of placating his narrow political base, the President should heed the will of the great majority of the American people by signing this bill into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (RELATING TO THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, today the House recognizes the 40th anniversary of the Six Day War and congratulates Israel on administering a unified Jerusalem as a city open to people of all faiths. 
   I want to join in congratulating the people of Jerusalem on the 40th anniversary of the unification of this ancient city. Further, I wish to commend the State of Israel for opening this holy city to followers of all faiths. Jerusalem is the holiest city of the Jewish faith, the third holiest Islamic city, and is the site of many significant Christian sites. Because of its important status to all these religions, Jerusalem must remain an undivided city that protects the rights of all ethnic and religious groups. Israel has recognized this important reality and allows members of all faiths to visit and worship at their holy sites. 
   It is my hope that all parties in the Middle East will use Jerusalem's example of religious coexistence to work towards a final negotiated peace in the region. A lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors is in the interests of all countries in the region and overall international stability. 
   Finally, it is my belief that the United States should help to reaffirm its commitment to a strong relationship with Israel by placing its embassy and staff in its capital city of Jerusalem. Accordingly, I hope that the President will consider the relevant language in the legislation before the House today and abide by the provisions of the Jerusalem Embassy Act passed by Congress in 1995. This would be an important step in cementing the bond between the United States and Israel at this critical time in history.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I thank my friend from across the aisle for his comments on conservation and the sharing of the same root between conservatism and conservation. Perhaps he would be willing to tell our Vice President who said a few years ago that conservation may be a personal virtue, but it is no way to build a national energy policy, that he is wrong. I am pleased to hear Members of this body on both sides of the aisle voicing that opinion, that conservation efficiency in effect has to be part of our national energy policy. 
   I also was happy to hear his comments on electric cars. In Israel, which I visited last August, and which I would like to wish a happy 60th birthday to, Israel is leading the way on not just solar energy in which they are collaborating with a California company on a huge solar photovoltaic project which will provide today, this is not some distant time in the future, today will provide enough electricity for 400,000 homes. Solel, Inc., is the Israeli company and Pacific Gas and Electric is the partner here in the United States. Not only are they a leader in photovoltaic solar electric power, but they are pioneering in Israel, as we could be in this country, electric cars that travel from one station to another and instead of charging the battery, they just switch it. They are working on a battery that will be interchangeable between all cars. So one can drive up to the gas station which will now be an electric station or whatever fuel one moves toward, remove the old battery that is run down, immediately get a new one installed and drive away in a matter of minutes rather than waiting for it to be charged up.     
   All these options are available, and I'm here to say they're available today. 
   I would also dispute, however, the assertion that nuclear power is non-emitting, that nuclear power is clean. First of all, nuclear power does give off greenhouse gas emissions because, in the process of mining and milling and transporting nuclear fuel, there are fossil fuels burned. 
   There are, in my very district, in fact, strontium, nydium, tritium, among other cancer-causing radioactive particles being released into the groundwater and even under normal operations, into the air. 
   And lastly, of course, the spent fuel has to be transported, again using fossil fuels, to a repository, which may be Yucca Mountain whenever that happens to be opened. 
   In the meanwhile, every nuclear plant and every nuclear shipment is a potential terrorist target. We know that Mohammad Atta wrote, for instance, in the papers that were found after 9/11, about canvassing New York City, flying on commercial airliners, and that he took notes about a nuclear plant that he flew over as a potential target that we believe to be Indian Point.  
   So I would remind those on both sides of the aisle that our diplomatic stance around the world has been one of trying to stop other countries from taking a ``peaceful nuclear program and turning it into a military nuclear program.'' It's a very gray area and a blurry line once one learns how to enrich fuel. It's only a matter of how far one enriches that fuel. 
   So there are some things that we agree about. I totally agree that we need a moon shot technology revolution. We need to put all the resources of this country that we can behind this, and that American ingenuity can solve these problems. 
   But speaking as one who's burning 20 percent biodiesel in my home heating oil, who's getting 1,500 kilowatt hours a month from wind power, who's driving an American-made hybrid today that gets 33 miles per gallon, and an SUV with 4-wheel drive, not a little tin can, but actually a pretty sizeable vehicle, I think these technologies are available if they're given the proper incentives, tax breaks and subsidies today, and if we lead the way in government with preferential purchasing and the decision-making that we make as the powerful government that we are. 
   So I'm happy to be a part of this exciting time in our energy history.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (H.R. 3196, NAMING THE PORT JERVIS POST OFFICE THE E. ARTHUR GRAY POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - March 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, just moments ago, this body voted to pay an appropriate tribute to a dedicated public servant in New York's 19th Congressional District. 
   On April 10, 2007, the Hudson Valley lost one of its most involved leaders when E. Arthur Gray, a former five-term mayor of Port Jervis and New York State Senator, passed away at the age of 82 years old. He left behind a legacy of friendship, involvement and service that earned him a permanent place in the heart of Port Jervis and serves as an example of what it means to work for the betterment of your community. 
   By voting to pass legislation that would redesignate the post office in Port Jervis, New York, as the E. Arthur Gray Post Office Building, the House has acknowledged the contributions of an individual who loved his hometown and who, as a businessman, government official and family man, dedicated a significant portion of his time and energy to its civic life. 
   Simply put, Arthur Gray was a Port Jervis resident to the core: born February 28, 1925, in Port Jervis, a graduate of Port Jervis High School before leaving briefly for college, only to return as president and co-owner of the Gray-Parker Funeral Home in his native Port Jervis. 
   Art Gray's participation in public life extended to government service. He was mayor of Port Jervis from 1978 to 1988. A lifetime resident of Port Jervis, Gray gave his undivided attention to issues, both large and small, and was widely known for his open-door policy. 
   Art Gray remains the longest-serving mayor in the history of Port Jervis. During his tenure he was able to reinvigorate the downtown area and greatly improve the city's economic development plan. Citizens of the local area remember Art as a man who was generous in nature and willing to help those in need. After finishing his service as mayor, Art Gray maintained his commitment to public service by successfully running for a seat in the New York State senate in 1988. 
   He represented the 39th Senatorial District in that capacity until 1990. But E. Arthur Gray's contributions to his city and his country were not limited to business and politics. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II. He was also deeply involved in community life, and the list of organizations that count him as a member is astounding. 
   At one time or another, Art Gray was a member of the Port Jervis Community Development Agency, the Orange County Economic Development Agency, the National League of Small Cities Advisory Council, St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Bon Secours Community Hospital Advisory Board, Knights of Columbus Council No. 471, Ancient Order of Hibernians in America, Elks Lodge No. 645, BPOE, Port Jervis Lions Club, Tri-States Chamber of Commerce, Port Jervis Country Club, Metaque Falls Hunting Club, Tri-States Rod and Gun Club, the Port Jervis Board of Education, and Port Jervis Planning Board. 
   When you look at that list, you gain a true appreciation for how much time, energy, and dedication Art Gray devoted to betterment of his hometown. However, he devoted just as much, if not more, to his family and friends. He was extremely devoted to his wife, Helen; son, Gerald; daughter, Brigid; and numerous other family members and close friends. He is remembered by those closest to him as enthusiastic, optimistic, supporting, loving, and inspirational. 
   Through it all, E. Arthur Gray's life was deeply interwoven with the fabric of Port Jervis, his home, and it is fitting that the adoption of this bill will help memorialize his service.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MIKE M<em>c</em>NULTY -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Congressman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my distinguished colleague from New York, Congressman Mike McNulty. 
   After nearly 40 years of public service, Congressman McNulty is retiring, and he will be sorely missed. I will resist the suggestion of one of our fellow New York delegation members to sing that he's still the one, but I will say that, at the age of 22, he was elected to serve as supervisor of Green Island, making him at the time the youngest supervisor in New York. Since, he has served as mayor, as assemblyman and, for the last 20 years, as a Member of Congress. While his role may have changed, his dedication to fighting for the interests of New York's capital region have remained constant. 
   Mike is known as a worker. I've observed that in the short time that I've been here. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security, he has worked to make sure that our seniors receive the benefits that they need in economic times where that effort is even more important than ever and when we can see how important it was that he was there to help protect against privatizing that Social Security. 
   I have only been honored to serve one term in this body with Mike, but have already been impressed by the spirit of cooperation and of teamwork that he brings to the New York delegation. In addition to ``gentleman,'' I would add the word ``statesman.'' 
   Some of us get more excited about issues. That doesn't mean that you care more or less about them, but MIKE's temperament has impressed me in its evenness and in its equanimity. I think that we could use a good dose of that from time to time here because we on both sides of the aisle and even in our own caucus have strong feelings about the issues, about the critical, important and immediate issues that we face. 
   So I will be sad that at the end of this session and that at the end of this term we'll be saying goodbye to Congressman McNulty, but I'm glad that he is here now, this week especially and as we go forward through the rest of this term, to help us deal with the serious issues we have on our plate and that the country is facing in these difficult times with the thoughtfulness, with the work ethic and with the equanimity and level-headedness that he brings to the Congress. 
   I wish you, Congressman McNulty, the best of luck and good times as you retire from the House to return home to your family and to your district. It has been an honor to serve with you. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I must comment on the gentlelady's remarks that just preceded me and describe them as fiction. I'm sorry to have to say this because many things have happened in this body on a bipartisan basis, especially on the Veterans' Committee that I serve on, where we are in almost unanimous agreement on all issues. But on the issue of energy, our colleagues across the aisle keep going on dishonest tirades about our national energy crisis in order to distract from their record of oil company capitulation and failure to protect consumers. 
   I guess they're operating under their party philosophy that if you repeat something often enough, you can make people forget that it's not true. I actually have more faith in the American people than that. 
   They know that for most of this decade energy policy has been written in the White House by Big Oil and led to record dependence on imports and skyrocketing prices. They know that Republicans in this Congress have been pursuing a none-of-the-above strategy, blocking every attempt to move forward at real energy solutions. At every step, they have said no. 
   They said no to responsible drilling in Alaska and making oil companies drill on the 68 million acres that are already open. They said no to increasing oil supply through the SPR, releasing oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is the only way to immediately bring down prices. They, our Republican colleagues, said no to reigning in market speculation to keep prices from skyrocketing. They said no to protecting the American driver from price gouging and oil company exploitation. And while they stood in the way, the American economy suffered and family budgets braced for high home heating costs. 
   I think it's time to share the views of most of Americans when I say enough is enough. We need more energy and we need to enter a new era of energy technology instead of staying stuck in this ``drill first, ask questions later'' mindset that will not lower prices. According to our own Energy Information Agency, at the most, it's 1.8 cents lower after 8 to 10 years, or possibly longer. It will not make us more energy secure, and it will not allow America to prosper, which is why I have joined with the rest of the majority to support drilling responsibly for more American oil. And that means, by the way, making sure that the American taxpayer and the Treasury get the money from our oil. Oil under Federal lands and offshore leases belongs to the American public, to our children and our grandchildren, and those royalties were given away by the previous Congress, which for 6 years had control of all branches of government, the White House, both Houses of Congress, and the court system. For 6 years they did nothing but give away our resources, our children's and our grandchildren's resources without asking for fair royalty payments by the oil companies. 
   We have provided key tax incentives for renewables, like wind and solar and high efficiency. And I beg to differ with the gentlelady that spoke before me. These things are available today. 
   West Point, in my district, is putting in wind energy on their hundreds of acres of campus. They are putting in a 5,000-gallon E85 tank, which is actually a breakthrough, considering the fact that thousands of flex fuel vehicles have been sold in my State of New York, and there is hardly any place you can even buy flex fuel or E85. 
   We are seeing students at high schools like Arlington High School in Dutchess County, New York, come to me and to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and ask for money for solar panels so that their high schools can be powered today by solar power. 
   We have voted to break the chains of our dependence on Middle Eastern oil by using American innovation to create hundreds of thousands of green jobs that cannot be outsourced. 
   When I was in Denver a couple of weeks ago, I learned that one of the biggest new solar photovoltaic installations in Colorado was being built, fortunately, with American jobs doing the installation but, unfortunately, with solar panels that are being built in China. 
   We should not go from buying oil overseas to buying solar panels from overseas or buying wind turbines from overseas or buying geothermal systems from overseas. The country that put man on the Moon should lead the way in this technological innovation and develop this energy at home that's a broad, real energy policy. And it's time to pass that kind of complete really all-of-the-above plan now. It's time for action now.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I won't need that much time. 
   Thank you to my colleague from Rhode Island and from the other side of the floor, who just spoke in favor of this amendment. I would like to take a moment to commend all who support this issue. 
   There are 27 Head Start facilities in my district, and they provide critical services to families that want their children to have every opportunity to grow and succeed. I'm glad that the bill we are considering today will expand access to Head Start and help make sure that America's less well-off children can have a great chance of long-term success when they arrive in our schools. 
   The amendment will help to meet these goals by providing more support for inclusive education. This is the practice of teaching children with disabilities in the same classrooms as those without disabilities, and it has largely been shown to have a positive effect on the development of those children with disabilities. 
   The Head Start Act already requires that 10 percent of enrollment slots go to students with disabilities, and the actual number of enrollees is even higher, at about 13 or 14 percent. 
   Although these classrooms can provide increased educational benefits, they also present teachers and staff with increased demands. Teachers and staff have often been forced to try to handle greater responsibilities without the necessary resources. This amendment would help to bridge that gap by allowing training and technical assistance funds to be spent to enhance the ability of classroom staff to meet the needs of eligible children in inclusive classrooms. 
   Providing more resources for teacher training and support, this amendment would make great strides in improving the quality of the educational experience for all children in a class. 
   Another fundamental goal of the Head Start program is to make sure that all children have the best chance of success in school and in life. The second provision of this amendment will help to further serve those goals by working to make sure that the inclusive classroom environment benefits every student, including typically developing children. It would do so by allowing research and evaluation funding to be used in further studying the impact of inclusive classrooms on the educational experience of children with or without disabilities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment with President Bush's veto of the Iraq Accountability Act. Sadly, this is just the latest example of the President's unwillingness to change his mistaken policy towards Iraq. After more than 4 years of the President's stay-the-course strategy in Iraq, we must provide a responsible plan to redeploy our troops and require the Iraqi government to meet basic benchmarks for stability. This bill presented that plan and the President should have signed it into law. 
   Last month, 4 years after the President declared ``Mission Accomplished,'' was the deadliest month for American troops in Iraq this year. For too long, the Republican-led Congress failed to exercise its Constitutional responsibility to hold the Bush Administration accountable--with disastrous results for the American people. No longer. 
   I have opposed the war in Iraq since its start, and today with my vote to override the veto I was proud to vote once again to take our policy in Iraq in a new direction. More than 4 years after the President declared the end of major combat in Iraq, we suffered over 100 U.S. military casualties in April alone. We must provide a responsible plan to redeploy our troops and require the Iraqi government to meet basic benchmarks for stability. 
   Our country faces serious threats. There are dangerous people in this world that seek nothing more than to kill as many Americans as possible. The number of people who died from my district on September 11th make me acutely aware of this dire threat. I was proud to vote for a bill that allows us to refocus our military on that threat. That would allow us to seek out, capture, or kill those who were responsible for September 11th or who currently plot to kill Americans rather than police a civil war in Iraq. 
   I'm disappointed that the President chose to ignore the American people and veto the Iraq Accountability Act. He should have signed this bill, in order to get these needed resources to our troops and our veterans, hold the Iraqi government accountable, change course in Iraq and refocus on destroying Al Qaeda. 
   As we move forward, the President must realize that this Congress is not going to give the President a blank check with which to ignore the will of the American people on Iraq. Four years of a flawed strategy are 4 years too long.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, the last few days have clearly demonstrated that the troubled state that our economy is in is more serious than we thought. The Bush administration's mismanagement of the American economy has officially caused a housing crisis to snowball and jeopardize the entire economy. 
   Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, established companies that survived the Great Depression, have declared bankruptcy or have been sold off to survive. Both companies employ thousands of people from my district, the 19th District of New York, and no one seems to know what will happen to these workers or to their families. 
   But it's not just Wall Street suffering. Wages have stagnated; expenses continue to rise. American families can no longer afford to buy necessities, much less to invest in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, when President Bush took office 8 years ago, he inherited a flourishing economy and a record budget surplus. Now, as he leaves office 8 years later with 8 years of misrule and a lack of oversight, those days are clearly gone. 
   I hope we make the right choice for our next President and elect Barack Obama, who will understand how to deal with the complexities of our economic situation.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to decry our unprecedented use of unaccountable private security contractors in Iraq. 
   By some estimates, there are over 50,000 private security personnel working in Iraq. These contractors operate outside U.S. and Iraqi law, raising animosity toward Americans in the field and losing us hearts and minds in Iraq. 
   The activities of one of the most prominent contractors, Blackwater, highlight why they are a counterproductive influence in Iraq, and their activities must be curtailed. 
   Two weeks ago, Blackwater personnel guarding a State Department group were involved in a shootout that resulted in the deaths of as many as 17 Iraqis. Yesterday, the Government Reform Committee disclosed that Blackwater has been involved in 195 escalation of force incidents since 2005; and in 80 percent of those, Blackwater fired the first shots. These incidents, combined with others, clearly indicate that we need to stop putting contractors in Iraq and bring those there under control, which is why I have introduced legislation to freeze the number of contractors operating in Iraq at September 1 levels. And I am a proud cosponsor of the bill we will vote on today, the MEJA Expansion Act, to bring these contracts under control.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I am proud to rise today in support of the Schakowsky amendment, and I thank my colleague for her leadership on this most important issue. 
   One of the most destabilizing aspects of our military involvement in Iraq is our unprecedented use of unaccountable private security contractors. By some estimates, there are 50,000 or more private security personnel working in Iraq. These contractors operate largely outside U.S. and Iraqi law, raising animosity toward Americans in the field and losing the hearts and minds of the people in Iraq. 
   The activities of one of the most prominent contractors, Blackwater, highlight why this amendment and the underlying bill come not a moment too soon. Two weeks ago, Blackwater personnel guarding a State Department group were involved in a shootout that involved the deaths of 11 Iraqis. Blackwater has been involved in 195 escalation of force incidents since 2005. In 80 percent of those, Blackwater fired the first shots, even though they are only supposed to use defensive force. 
   It turns out that Blackwater has terminated 122 of their security employees, 53 of which were for weapons-related incidents or drug and alcohol violations. An incident report from another contracting firm described a Blackwater contractor's killing of a vice presidential security aide as ``murder,'' and Blackwater itself determined that he should be fired and his clearance should be revoked. 
   I could go on, but I think you get the picture. How many more incidents are there? How many more allegations and actions to be brought? Congress and the American need to know. 
   The MEJA Expansion Act will go a long way toward stopping the most egregious behavior of misconduct by these contractors and make their activities subject to U.S. law. 
   The Schakowsky amendment will strengthen this bill by making sure that any charges or legal actions are brought to light by DOJ. This amendment is vital to helping us in Congress conduct effective oversight to rein in contractors in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (THE TIME IS NOW TO SUPPORT HEROES OF 9/11 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and my colleagues from New York for carrying this important legislation forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, Tuesday marks the sixth-year anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. September 11 is truly a dark day in America's history and a personal tragedy for those who lost family and friends in the attacks.     
   But out of that dark day, however, we saw the spirit of the American people. Immediately following the attack, people around the country lined up to donate blood and raised money for the victims' families. Every congressional district and every State saw people, first responders and just ordinary citizens, get on planes and get in cars to rush to Ground Zero to help work on the remains of the World Trade Center. 
   In New York, first responders, many of whom lived in my district, rushed into the burning World Trade Center towers to save whomever they could. Immediately after the attacks, we saw firefighters, police and volunteers line up and work 24-hour shifts sorting through the rubble looking for survivors. 
   And when it was clear that no one would come out of that rubble alive, those responders remained at the scene determined that no one would be left behind in the rubble. 
   Whenever a body was removed, the stirring sight of everyone coming to a stop and honoring and showing their respect to the flag-covered body as it was removed is an image that will stay with all of us as we move forward through our history. 
   Slowly we came to realize that those magnificent people who worked at Ground Zero were being exposed to harmful toxins, with significant risks to their health. Despite the heroic acts of our first responders, National Guard reservists and even volunteers, the Federal Government has failed 6 years later to provide comprehensive medical screening and medical care to those who were injured in service to our country at Ground Zero. We have failed to provide a comprehensive plan to monitor and treat those who lived and work in the immediate areas around Ground Zero even after we realized that the air they were breathing might be toxic. 
   Earlier this year I had graduates of Stuyvesant High School in New York City come and ask for my support in providing health care for themselves and their classmates because of the medical problems they had encountered after 9/11. 
   Despite assurances that their school was safe and the air was clean, when they returned less than a month after the attacks, multiple students from Stuyvesant have faced serious health care issues, including Amit Friedlander, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease and has been battling the cancer. 
   The Federal Government made a serious mistake and exposed these children and young adults to dangerous toxins. It is well past time that we correct this mistake and provide the care these children and volunteers need. 
   That is why I am proud to say I will be an original cosponsor of the Maloney-Nadler-Fossella 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. This bill will take a vital step towards providing the care those affected at 9/11 deserve. It is my hope and belief that the New York delegation will unite around this bill and the House of Representatives will unite to act on its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, National Purple Heart Recognition Day is August 7, 2007. This year, we celebrate the 225th anniversary of the Badge of Military Merit. This medal, the forerunner of the modern Purple Heart, was designed by GEN George Washington in his headquarters in Newburgh, New York, in the Hudson River Valley. 
   The badge, given for ``any singularly meritorious Action,'' was the ``figure of a Heart in Purple Cloth or Silk edged with narrow Lace or Binding to be worn on the uniform coat above the left breast.'' 
   After falling into disuse after the Revolutionary War, GEN Douglas MacArthur had a new medal designed based on the Badge of Military Merit. This medal, the modern Purple Heart, was awarded for meritorious action or for receiving a wound in combat with the enemy. 
   Since that time, more than 1.5 million people have received the Purple Heart. These men and women sacrificed for our country. Many never came home. The Purple Heart recognizes their sacrifice and their service protecting the rights and liberties we enjoy at home. 
   National Purple Heart Recognition Day serves to remind the country of those who have suffered injury or death in the defense of our country. It is always right to remember and honor those who have sacrificed, and this resolution encourages Americans to learn more about the history of the Purple Heart and its recipients. 
   This year, on National Purple Heart Recognition Day, recipients and their families will come together at the Purple Heart Hall of Honor in the town of New Windsor at the New Windsor Cantonment site in the Hudson River Valley of New York, in New York's 19th Congressional District, which I am proud to represent, and Orange County, a county which the aforementioned Congressman Gilman represented so ably. There, they will recognize the anniversary of the Badge of Military Merit, the 75th anniversary of the Purple Heart, and, most importantly, the price that the recipients and their families have paid protecting our country. 
   I ask that the House pass this resolution to recognize those who will gather in New Windsor on August 7 to honor the sacrifices and suffering of Purple Heart recipients and their families and to remember those who paid the ultimate price and are no longer with us

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, the situation at Walter Reed Medical Center is an embarrassment to our country. The deplorable conditions for outpatient care at Walter Reed are not fit for men and women who have sacrificed to serve our country. The delayed and mishandled care of these individuals has harmed their recovery and placed significant strain on their families. 
   This is not the way our combat veterans deserve to be treated. These conditions demonstrate a catastrophic failure of planning on the part of the administration. 
   Although the Army has stated its intention to remedy the situation quickly, we must act for those who are currently held at Walter Reed, for it is clear that the Army is not currently equipped to do so. It is unacceptable for those who served us abroad to languish in a no man's land at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the coming days I will introduce a bill to allow Walter Reed outpatients the option of moving to a VA facility closer to their homes and families while still getting their military pay and benefits. We must show that our country supports our troops not only in word but also in action.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I voted in favor of the motion to instruct conferees, which included Senate language stating that ``the Senate should not pass legislation that will undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq'', because I believe the men and women of the United States military are admirably and ably performing their duties. They are already doing everything the can to prevent Iraq from becoming a failed state, and I continue to support them and the professionalism and skill they have displayed. However, it is not the role of the United States military to control the long term viability of the Iraqi government. To avoid becoming a failed state, Iraqi political leaders must come to a consensus regarding the future of Iraq and the Iraqi government. There is no role for the United States military in that task. I continue to call for strong diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation in Iraq, and believe that a firm time-line for the withdrawal of U.S. troops will force Iraq's political leaders to take responsibility for the future of their country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the latest demonstration of this administration's misplaced priorities. 
   President Bush wants to slash $2 billion in funding that will help our police and other first responders protect Americans here at home from terrorists and other threats so that he can send $3 billion over to Iraq to train police there. That money means a lot to our police and firefighters here at home. By cutting this funding, President Bush will endanger security at our ports, subways and rail lines. Further, his proposal will not allow law enforcement agencies to use grants for counterterrorism or intelligence personnel, funding which has helped the NYPD uncover and stop nearly 20 terrorist attacks. 
   By proposing these cuts, the President rejects the advice of the Department of Homeland Security and the 9/11 Commission and again shows his priorities are not those of the American people. 
   I urge the President to reconsider this request and will work with my colleagues to reverse these deeply misguided cuts to homeland security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, my colleagues. This is an important step we took today. Simply put, our success in ending our addiction to foreign oil and fossil fuels is going to determine whether or not America will continue to grow and prosper in the 21st century. There is perhaps no other issue that could have as much of a profound effect on our economy as our ability to meet this goal of producing our own energy and new breakthroughs in ways of developing that energy. 
   We have seen the terrible toll that the economic downturn has taken on working families over the past few months. Skyrocketing energy costs have made the burden harder to bear, and, at the same time, wages have stagnated, growth is far from certain, oil is over $100 a barrel, translating into homes in my district that are 
   literally burning up their savings every time they burn oil to heat their home. 
   I would remind those of you who don't know that you can call up your local distributor of heating oil if you, as my wife and I do, burn heating oil to heat your homes, and ask for biodiesel. Ask for a biodiesel blend. You will be surprised at how many distributors have it. We are currently burning in New York State, in my home in Dover Plains, a 20 percent soy-biodiesel blend, and that is that many barrels of oil less that have to come into the country from unstable parts of the world. 
   Failure to take swift aggressive action would simply result in more of the same. I think that the House has taken leadership, which I am proud of, and all of the government can join us in this leadership, toward clean energy technology. 
   The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act which we passed today will provide the kind of market incentives and financial support needed to usher in a new era of clean energy technology and innovation that will create jobs here, enhance our security, retrieve our balance of payments deficit, protect our environment and create thousands of green jobs. 
   I just want to point out too that some people might see this, might read this, especially with the connotations that have been attached to the word ``tax ,'' and think that this is something that it is not. 
   Actually what this bill did was to take back a tax giveaway that was given by a previous Congress to the oil companies who are reporting, even week-to-week now we seem to hear about new record profits being set by companies which are breaking their own record from only a couple of years ago. And it is hard to juxtapose that and to balance that in my mind with the increased poverty rate, with the increased amount of personal indebtedness and national indebtedness and the balance of trade deficit that is being fed and exaggerated by our addiction to oil. 
   I would prefer that we go in the direction of the bill we passed today, which will support new technologies to power our homes, business economies and vehicles, and the vital tax incentives to spur renewable energy generation, the production of biofuels of all kinds, innovative technologies like plug-in hybrid cars. 
   I am driving an American made, union-made, Detroit hybrid four-by-four, which I hope soon I will be able to convert into a plug-in hybrid. In fact, there is a company in Massachusetts that is already making a plug-in conversion kit to double the gas mileage of a car like mine, or a Prius or any hybrid. So we can help push these things forward. 
   In my district, the 19th District of New York, we have had meetings all around the five counties I represent about renewable energy. We have a solar forum and wind forum and a geothermal forum. And one of the most popular things, the thing that got adults on their feet, was the students' presentation from Newburgh Free Academy, Newburgh, New York, of the solar racing team. 
   They had a beta vehicle that ran on solar energy. It was a little bit larger than this oval table sitting here. It looked sort of like a flying saucer. It had a seat that a student could crouch in and just barely get behind the steering wheel. It is covered entirely with solar panels and has batteries to store the energy in it. And it won, or tied for first place, in a race from Houston, Texas, to Newburgh, New York, 2,000 miles on the highway in a car powered by solar power and electricity generated therefrom, and built by the BOCES vocational track high school students who know how to put together machinery and weld and so on, and working with the advanced placement math and science kids, who know how to calculate how many square inches of solar panels you need to produce the sufficient amount of electricity. It was the kids who got the adults excited.     
   I ran into constituents of mine who were leaving there saying, why don't the big auto companies do this with the resources they have? Why can't government incentivize this sort of thing with the resources that government has? I am happy to say that we are taking a big step in that direction today, and I encourage our colleagues in the Senate to follow suit and to join us. 
   Just this weekend on the front page of the New York Times, a major story about a wind boom in Texas, which is now the leading State for installed wind technology. None other than T. Boone Pickens, the oil tycoon, was quoted, if I could paraphrase him saying he is as excited now about wind power as he ever was about any oil field he ever discovered. 
   That warms my heart to hear a guy like Mr. Pickens recognizing the financial value, which also translates into the jobs value and the boost to our economy that can come from wind and solar and geothermal and low-head hydroelectric power and all the other biofuels and all the other things that we are trying to incentivize and give tax credits for in this legislation. 
   I am just thrilled to be here to talk with my colleagues about it and to be here today to vote on it, because I see it as moving from the lose-lose-lose energy policy of the past or, unfortunately, still the present, where we send billions of dollars a day to the oil potentates in the Middle East which, either by weaponry, some of that money goes to fund radical schools which result in young, mostly men but some women in those parts of the world being taught, among other things, to attack U.S. interests or Israeli interests or to be seen as, you know, as fighting against America. 
   Then for the privilege of doing that, and also funding, as Tom Friedman likes to write in his columns, we pay for our troops to try to go and defend our interest, and at the same time we get to borrow the money from the Chinese for the whole endeavor, because we don't have it. So for all of this trouble and all of this expense of this lose-lose-lose policy, we also have asthma and emphysema epidemics in our inner cities, acid rain, oil spills, et cetera. 
   The win-win-win policy would put us back in control of our own foreign policy, put us back in control of our own economic policy, would make us, once again, leaders in the technologies that we should have been leading in all along, like hybrid technology or wind and thin film flexible solar technology and so on. 
   I am glad to see us moving toward the win-win-win.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I am always ready to talk, my friend. I was thinking, as you were speaking, about how institutions starting with the United States Government and State and county and local governments can all do their part, and we have done our part by voting today for this legislation, by voting, actually, earlier in this session, last year, in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we voted out legislation to put solar panels on the south-facing wall on the Department of Energy building, which would be a symbolic step forward, as well as a practical one, because the south-facing wall was designed in the 1970s when the Department of Energy was first created to be at the proper angle for photovoltaic cells to generate the best and most power from the sun.     
   It is that kind of investment that government can make. It is that kind of investment that States can make. 
   I met today for probably the third time with representatives of New York State's Energy Research and Development Authority about ideas like putting infrastructure on the New York State thruway service stations, the whole route that goes from Buffalo across to Albany and down to New York City of interstate highways, which would include biofuels and which would include at least a blend of biodiesel, and hopefully some E85. We have hundreds of thousands of vehicles, at least, of vehicles that have been sold as flex-fuel vehicles to American citizens by TV commercials saying you are doing something green when you buy them. 
   But in New York State, the 19th Congressional District of New York State that I represent, we got a call in our district office from a lady saying, ``I just bought a flex-fuel vehicle. Where can I get some fuel?'' And our staffer had to say there is one pump in Albany and another one in Westchester somewhere. 
   Congressman Markey told me that in Massachusetts, he said there is one pump for the whole State for E85 and 140,000 flex-fuel vehicles on the roads. So we have to start pulling the string through the tube, the string of demand through the tube, and make sure there is more supply created by creating the demand. 
   I would hope that the Arlington High School Action Club which I just met with last week, which is in the middle of a project right now of putting solar panels on the roof of their school, a new wing of their school, and I suggested to them that their next project, after they do their solar panels, they should switch their school bus fleet for that school district to biodiesel or to a biodiesel blend. It is made to order for school bus fleets, for post office trucks, for town and county highway trucks, any entity of government or private enterprise like FedEx or UPS, or trucking companies that use a lot of diesel fuel, can just as well burn. If I can burn 20 percent biodiesel at home, they can burn it in their diesel trucks. 
   Some of my musician friends, Willie Nelson and Bonnie Raitt, have been driving for years tour buses and trucks all over this country on biodiesel. It definitely can be done, and I think each of us as Americans should look at this as an opportunity to lead and to do our part to push this revolution forward and to push this new policy into being. 
   Government can't do everything. It certainly can't do everything all at the same time. But together, businesses, government, and individuals can make the decisions on a day-to-day basis to vote with our dollars for those new forms of energy, where available, whether it is by flipping our electric bill over and voting for wind. In New York State, we are allowed to do that. We are allowed to choose whether it is wind or hydro or whatever form of electrical generation we choose, whether it is by asking for biofuels whenever we can get them, by driving the most fuel-efficient car, in the most fuel-efficient way, I might add. 
   At any rate, there is nowhere to go but up. And in the process, we will regain our sovereignty and somewhere down the road we will not have to worry about speaking honestly to Saudis or other nondemocratic governments about human rights, just as we won't have to worry about speaking honestly to the Chinese about lead-tainted toys because we are afraid we won't get the oil from one or get the debt floated by the other. 
   So it is getting ourselves back on our feet economically and diplomatically and energywise.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, gas prices in New York are still at the outrageous price of $4.19, well above what working families in the Hudson Valley can bear. They are looking to us in the government for answers, and Congress needs to respond. 
   The fact is that the Democratic majority has advanced a wide variety of proposals to provide relief. We have pushed tax credits for fuel-efficient vehicles and renewables, we've called for Big Oil to drill on its land that it has already leased and gotten permits for, and advocated a release from the SPR. Each time President Bush and his allies have opposed these measures and are holding real energy solutions hostage to their insistence on old, ineffective drilling proposals. 
   The Republican minority treats our energy crisis like a multiple choice question. The problem is that they keep answering ``none of the above.'' On this side of the aisle, we will keep pushing solutions to responsibly enhance American energy supplies and usher in an innovative and independent energy future. 
   I hope that after the break our friends on the other side of the aisle will come back to Congress ready to cooperate instead of standing in the way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentleman from New York. 
   In the Hudson Valley, in my district, gas prices have reached crisis levels where commuting is a daily part of life and small businesses need to move their products. The record-setting spikes in gas prices have been a drain on family budgets and our entire economy. 
   There is, unfortunately, no silver bullet solution to our gas and oil challenge, but I am proud that Congress has taken aggressive action to provide desperately needed relief. We have passed a once in a generation increase in fuel economy standards, pushed for more development of cellulosic biofuels, and continue to advance legislation that would provide tax incentives for people to purchase fuel incentive vehicles and help us break the grip of OPEC on our economy. 
   The need for relief is real and urgent, and we have also taken steps to provide near-term assistance. The House has passed a bill to beef up the Department of Justice's ability to pursue antitrust action in the oil sector, and we have also passed legislation that requires the President to stop taking oil off the market to put in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, so that more supply is available on the market to lower prices. That was 70,000 barrels of oil a day that was being taken off the market that we passed in a bipartisan way. I am sure my friends across the aisle remember voting with us on that bill. 
   When market relief does arrive, however, we need to make sure that the individual American driver benefits, not just the oil companies. There is the old proverbial question about whether a tree falling in the woods with no one to hear it actually makes a sound. I don't know about that, but I do know a drop in oil prices that doesn't cut prices at the pump is the same as no price drop at all. 
   Unfortunately, that is what we have been seeing. Over the past week, the price of crude oil has actually dropped by several dollars per barrel, offering the hope that the edge would be taken off the record high gas prices we have been facing. One look at the local price figures at your gas station is enough to know it has not happened. 
   On April 1, the price of crude oil was just over $100 per barrel and kept soaring, reaching $135 per barrel during trading on May 22. Over the same period of time, the national average price of gasoline rose from just under $3.29 to just over $3.83 a gallon. In New York, prices increased by over 60 cents from just over $3.40 to almost $4.02 a gallon. 
   Despite the fact that as of 2 days ago crude prices had dropped below $123 a barrel, retail gasoline prices are still at record levels. Nationwide, the average price of regular gasoline stayed at $3.98, and in New York the average price remained at the astronomical level of $4.17 per gallon. These represent increases of about 15 cents per gallon at the pump during the same period in which crude oil prices were declining.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Apparently, the old adage that what goes up must come down does not apply for the oil companies. That is a cause of great concern, and I have asked the Federal Trade Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate this disconnection between the price of oil on the world market and the price of refined product at the pump. 
   Drivers are expected to share, in fact are forced to share, in the pain of oil and gas increases immediately, and they should have the expectation that they will also share in the relief just as quickly when the world oil price comes down. In a market this complex, it is imperative for the government to be an active protector of consumer rights and take swift measures to ensure that conditions are not exploited to the detriment of working families. By doing so, I believe we can make sure that any drop in crude prices will also mean real relief at the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, tonight this body did something that it failed to do last year under the previous majority by passing legislation to direct the spending of our Federal Government. 
   I am disappointed that the choice of the President and the minority to engage in confrontation and obstruction instead of cooperation and progress prevented us from more fully meeting America's needs in this bill. Despite their intransigence, we were able to pass a bill that began to reinvest in critical national priorities that had been neglected for too long. Priorities like life saving medical research, law enforcement, border and homeland security, K-12 education, college aid, needed infrastructure improvements, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. In addition to those steps, this bill lived up to the commitment of this Congress to keep our promises to America's veterans by providing $3.7 billion over the President's request for veterans' medical care, claims processing, and facility improvements. 
   As I indicated this is not a perfect bill. I am deeply troubled by the decision to include language that provides authority for the Department of Energy to issue over $8 billion in loan guarantees to coal-based energy projects, and over $20 billion for nuclear energy projects, while authorizing only $10 billion for renewables and energy efficiency. Nuclear power has shown itself to be an environmentally and economically unsustainable form of energy, and has repeatedly failed the test of whether it can survive without taxpayer support. Given the nuclear industry's record of risk and nonperformance, expanding taxpayer support for nuclear power would be throwing good money after bad. In order to truly make the most progress possible toward a clean, profitable, independent energy future for our Nation, it will be more effective to devote maximum federal support to renewable energy technologies like wind, solar, geothermal as well as new technologies and improvements in efficiency. 
   While I remain concerned about the loan guarantee language, I believe that in its totality the spending bill we approved tonight does a tremendous amount of good by funding key programs that will make America more secure and more prosperous. It makes necessary investments in America's future, and that is why I voted for it.

   In the meanwhile, there is no better day than today, April 15, to talk about the commitment this Congress has made to the American people to ensure that the Tax Code becomes fairer and simpler for middle class families. 
   We must be consistent and make the Tax Code more helpful to families by prioritizing middle class tax relief, including the child tax credit, relief from the marriage penalty, and preserving our lowest tax brackets. 
   We must also commit to making sure our tax dollars are spent wisely. The average family pays over $13,000 in Federal taxes; they deserve to get their money's worth. 
   For that to happen, we must preserve fiscal discipline, as this Congress has done by reinstating the pay-as-you-go rules, PAYGO, meaning we only spend as much money as we have and we do not increase the deficit for our children and grandchildren. And we must prioritize important spending such as health care, education, and our national infrastructure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, today, this body once again considered legislation to provide funding for the ongoing military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the final analysis, this was one funding bill for two very distinct conflicts. In Afghanistan, the men and women of our military continue to perform an important mission by taking action against our enemies in the country that served as host to the Al Qaeda organization that attacked the United States of America on September 11th, 2001. The importance of the work they are doing with complete skill, courage, and professionalism has only been underscored by the recent resurgence of Taliban activity, which must be quelled. I am fully supportive of them and their mission. I have voted to provide funding solely for our military activities in Afghanistan, and would do so again if such a bill were to come before the House. 
   However the funding measure before us today also included funding for the war in Iraq without accompanying conditions on those funds or a timeline for withdrawal of American forces. I remain opposed to the President's mistaken war in Iraq, which has now claimed over 4,000 American lives, undermined our military and ability to respond to other threats abroad, and cost hundreds of billions of dollars that could have been used to meet pressing needs at home. The men and women in uniform serving in Iraq have performed brilliantly and heroically. It is time for the Iraqi government to take responsibility for Iraq and for America to start bringing our troops home. I cannot support the appropriation of additional funds without timelines that would begin to wind down our military involvement in Iraq, and therefore could not vote for that portion of the funding legislation considered by the House tonight. 
   However, I am pleased that I was able to vote for a separate piece of legislation tonight that addresses several important priorities here at home. Specifically, I am pleased that we were able to consider legislation to expand veterans educational benefits in order to honor the service of our men and women in uniform and give them every opportunity to succeed in life after they have served. Also included in this bill was a desperately needed extension of unemployment benefits that will help struggling middle class families weather the current economic storm. In addition, the piece of legislation that I was able to vote for this evening included a moratorium on six of the seven Medicaid regulations the Bush administration has unwisely decided to implement recently, I would have greatly preferred if the legislation prevented all seven regulations from coming into effect. Outpatient Graduate Medical Education is a vital component of medical education, and by disallowing Medicaid funding for it, this regulation will cost New York State as much as $300 million per year. On multiple occasions, both the House and Senate have passed a moratorium on all seven of these regulations overwhelmingly. I don't understand why we have decided to allow these unwise cuts to graduate medical education to continue now, when the votes exist to prevent it. However, I will continue to push for this final moratorium to be implemented and for this unwise rule to be overturned.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I am very pleased that today the House passed S. 2106, the Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act. This bill is the Senate companion to an important piece of legislation I sponsored along with my good friend Representative TIM BISHOP of Long Island. 
   To start off I'd like to thank Mr. BISHOP for introducing this important bill in the House, and Mr. BIDEN for introducing it in the Senate. This is a simple bill, but a vital one to the people who it will affect, and I applaud both gentlemen for calling it to my attention, and that of the Congress as a whole. 
   Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed legislation to the effect that those victims and families of victims seeking legal redress as a result of the events of 9/11 may do so only in the federal court in the Southern District of New York. However, under the Federal /Rules of Civil Procedure, parties can only issue subpoenas for testimony and documents located within 100 miles of the District. This means that a significant percentage of evidence that might be relevant to the case is unobtainable to the participants only because it is not located within the New York City metropolitan area. 
   When Congress mandated that only one specific court could hear lawsuits from those people who opted out of the 9/11 Compensation Fund, no one foresaw that the decision would prove to be a barrier for those people who seek evidence from outside the jurisdiction of this court. But there is no alternative as to where they can bring suit. 
   I am proud to support this bill because it fixes this unintended flaw by providing nation-wide subpoena power to all the parties involved in litigating 9/11 claims. The 9/11 attacks were an attack on the whole country. It was a tragedy that greatly affected us all. There's no reason why victims should be prevented from obtaining possibly vital evidence, just because it happens to be outside the jurisdiction's direct subpoena power.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Well I think that is a subject for some discussion. And perhaps somewhere between 30 and 50 million barrels would be a good starting point. 
   But the most interesting thing about it is that it's one of the few investments the American taxpayers made that has more than doubled in value. In other words, it was bought at less than $50. Most of the oil there was bought at less than $50 a barrel and then would be sold for whatever it's going for, $130 or $140, the current value. So there's a big mark-up. And there is an opportunity not only to provide supply, to loosen up the supply-and-demand equation, but also to use the proceeds from that for some important things such as compensating those who are hurt the most. In the northeast with home heating oil this coming winter, there are many people very afraid about paying $6 for home heating oil, truckers who are paying exorbitant amounts for diesel, or people on low incomes who can't deal with this, or for that matter investing in some alternatives to provide some competition for oil, which, by the way, I think we should get to. Because what we're really faced with here is we're talking about drilling and drilling and where we're going to drill and what kind of oil and how much sulfur, and is the diesel going here or is the diesel going there? 
   But we're still talking about being at the mercy of oil. And I think ultimately this conversation has to come around to breaking the monopoly, the energy monopoly, that oil has in this country.

   Mr. HALL of New York. If the gentleman would yield back. 
   I would just comment that it's likely should the countries that don't like us and would theoretically cut us off in a crisis would look elsewhere to sell their oil, and the oil would probably go on the world market to other countries, to China, to Asia and so on and would provide slack in the system overall worldwide which would enable us to buy similar quantities of oil from other sources. This is all speculation on our part. 
   But I would just say that it's not by any means certain that a cut-off of oil from a certain country to us would mean that we would not be able to get the same amount of oil elsewhere. 
   Let me also say, because there was a comment made before, just continuing on a couple of quick points, there was a comment made before, many comments about how the American people are hurting, and one comment about how the oil companies are being squeezed. I just wanted to show the profits of the oil companies since 2001 climbing from $30 billion profit to $123.3 billion profit in 2007. And this is just from 2007 to 2008. 
   Here is an increase for another record year of oil company profits in the first quarter of 2008, $36.9 billion. So the curve continues to go up even as the gentleman from Pennsylvania said I believe it was, or the gentleman from Connecticut, we've had in the last 6 years I think a 361 percent increase in the number of leases granted and 668 million acres, which is either in some part of the permitting process or has not yet been drilled on, but is available for drilling in the lower 48 and adjacent offshore leases. No matter what we do, the oil companies continue to make record profit among record profit. 
   So against that backdrop, I think it's really important to consider such things as the geothermal system. I was personally in the trench next to a house that was being built, fastening these loops of hose, of plastic piping, that is going to carry a glycol water mixture 6 feet underground and enable a 3,500 square foot house in Cold Spring, New York, to be heated and cooled for the cost of one 75-watt light bulb. There are four buyers so far that have come to this development and have been offered a house. I think the base price of the house is $350,000. In that part of New York, it's expensive. And that is what they're offering these homes at. Or they can pay the extra $15,000 up front for geothermal heating and cooling. And all four of the buyers have come in with today's price of energy and said, we will take the geothermal. 
   And the estimates of the company doing the work is that it will pay off in 3 years. If it's a full-time resident, it will pay off in 3 years. If it's a part-time weekend or summer home, it may take 7 years. But these are the kinds of things that are here today. And it's not rocket science. It's plumbing. And it's common sense. 
   And we need to do this because we're at the moment an oil-based economy, especially for aircraft. There is no getting around liquid fuels. You cannot fly a hybrid plane any time soon. But there are many other places that we can find other fuels and other sources of power, not only for transportation but for heating and cooling our homes and our businesses and free up the oil for the purposes that we really need it for. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I just know they have made the biggest profits in the history of any corporation in the history of the world, and that the CEO got a pension of $400 million. There are certain things that to the American people look excessive. I can't tell you whether they are. All I can say is what it looks like, and I can say that my sympathy for the oil companies is not at a very high level. Hence, my likelihood to pursue use it or lose it. If you are sitting on 68 million acres, some of which may be in the process of being developed, but my understanding is that all or most of it has passed the permitting stage and is ready for the drill bit to go in the ground, and the drill bit is not going in the ground because they are waiting for the drill rigs, they don't have enough offshore exploration ships. They have enough money to buy the company that makes the drill rigs. Most of these oil companies have more money than most countries have. When you are floating that kind of money, I think there may be another incentive at work which is where is the oil worth more? Is the oil worth more left in the ground or pumped and sold into dollars because the dollar is going down. You can't invest it in real estate right now because  that is going down. If you put it in the stock market, you are taking your chances. A financial analyst inside one of these oil companies may look at the choices and say, let's leave it in the ground. Let's acquire more and more leases and pump it in 5 years when it is worth more. I want to be sure that is not the incentive that is driving this.

   Mr. HALL of New York. But I would just point out, going back a little bit, this map that I was holding up for Chairman Rahall, the more interesting thing about this map, and I hope it shows up on the cameras, is that the purple sections here are all Federal land that may be leased and has not been offered to lease. Now, I suggest that the Department of Interior ought to take that--that's most of these areas. The red is the part that is actually producing. The yellow or orange is the part that has been leased but is not yet producing. But the purple, most of this lower 48 or western half of the lower 48 on this map, land available currently for leasing that has not been leased; so I would just urge that it be leased. No Democrats that I know are opposed to leasing, counter to whatever may have been implied out there. 
   I just want to mention that the one thing we can do that will have an immediate impact, and we're talking 5, 10, 15 years, maybe 20 years out before ANWR or OCS has an impact, depending on whom you listen to, but the one tool we have, that the President has, which was used by the first President Bush in 1991 and again by President Clinton in 2000, is the SPR, releasing oil from the SPR to increase supply. In 1991 it resulted in a price drop of $8 per barrel, and in the year 2000, it brought down the price of oil by nearly 20 percent in a week. So I'm not saying it's the answer. I'm saying that it's a temporary thing and it's a tool that was given to the President by the Congress to deal with crises, which I believe were in one now, as our people are telling us. 
   All of us at home are hearing the same thing, I think, be it from parents driving their kids to school, commuters going to work, school systems that are barely able to afford to keep their school buses running, whatever it is, we need to provide immediate interim and long-term solutions. And one immediate thing that I think we should consider is releasing some amount of oil from the SPR.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, tonight the House took a critical step in the effort to ensure that America remains at the leading edge of the global economy by passing H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act. The provisions in the bill, including expanded grants through the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy for early career researchers, support for research in fields of national importance, and government recruitment of young scientists build on the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences and will help to rebuild our knowledge infrastructure. By doing so, the legislation will help America maintain its leadership in scientific research and allow American innovators to strengthen our economy by finding solutions to achieve energy independence, greater environmental protection, the development of new medical treatments, and a host of other goals. It is for these reasons that I voted to support H.R. 363. 
   However, I am deeply opposed to language, added to the bill through a motion to recommit, that prioritizes support for research into advanced nuclear reprocessing. Although supporters of nuclear power have renewed their efforts to increase America's reliance on nuclear power, the reality is that there are significant safety and environmental concerns associated with nuclear energy. The storage of spent nuclear fuel is a growing problem facing individual power plants and communities throughout the nation. At the Indian Point Energy Center, there is an ongoing leak of radioactive material from spent fuel pools into the Hudson River, and throughout the country communities that host nuclear facilities are being forced to contemplate the cleanup and security costs associated with the storage of nuclear waste. 
   We must also clearly understand that, at a time when nuclear terrorism is one of the greatest threats facing our nation, the process used to recycle spent fuel would create a significant proliferation risk by resulting in the production of plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. The language prioritizing support for a technology that threatens to damage our environment and undermine our national security is misguided, and tarnishes an otherwise laudable piece of legislation. I am hopeful that this language will not be included in the conference report.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from New York for offering this important amendment. I am honored to speak in support of it. 
   America's railways and power lines are key critical infrastructure. So when proposals would locate them together, it only makes sense for DHS and DOT to give them serious scrutiny. 
   In the State of New York, the homeland security stakes are particularly high. Yet a private company continues to pursue eminent domain authority to install the massive New York Regional Interconnect along rail routes, through environmentally sensitive areas, and over the objections of local residents. 
   In their hurry to get NYRI up and running, the company has pushed forward a plan that would put a 1,200 megawatt line on 135-foot towers near numerous rail lines. In western New York, there have been 19 derailments since 2005. The potential recipe for disaster is clear here. 
   There is also a matter of precedent that this amendment would help to clarify. By passing this amendment, this body can say that in projects in New York and around the country that we will not endorse putting special for-profit eminent domain provisions above the security of our citizens, the sanctity of our environment or the rights of our landowners. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, today, during the consideration of H.R. 3915, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007 I voted against the Motion to Recommit forthwith. If passed, that motion would have required anyone seeking to get a residential mortgage loan to produce one of four forms of identification prior to approval; a Social Security card and picture ID, a Real ID drivers license, a U.S. or foreign passport or an ID card issued by the Department of Homeland Security. 
   I am opposed to giving illegal immigrants access to mortgages. However, the language contained in the Motion to Recommit forthwith would not only have failed to meet the goal of denying mortgages to illegal immigrants, but it could have actually made it more difficult for legal citizens of New York and other states to obtain these same housing funds. The motion could have made it more difficult for people from states that have not yet adopted Real ID standards or do not have ready access to other documentation to qualify. However; any illegal immigrant with a passport from their native country would have no difficulty in using that passport to get a mortgage. That is not the kind of requirement we want or need. 
   I believe it is important that Americans have the opportunity to qualify for mortgages. Owning one's home is a vital part of the American dream. I cannot and will not support legislation that will make it more difficult for citizens and legal immigrants to get mortgages, and easier for illegal immigrants to do so. This motion would have done just that, and as a result I could not support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, if nothing is done soon, 27 million families across the country will be obligated to pay the alternative minimum tax, the AMT. Over 100,000 of these middle-class families live in New York's 19th District. They will have to go through the tedious process of computing their tax returns twice, and they will end up having to pay thousands more than they otherwise would. 
   The AMT is an unfair tax which in 1970, when it first took effect, only affected 155 households in the entire country. The people who pay it lose the opportunity to take many of the deductions and exemptions that make the tax code friendlier to families. Under the AMT, it doesn't matter what money is spent on health care, on property tax or on education; everyone pays the same amount of tax regardless. 
   Tomorrow, we will consider legislation to allow almost 73,000 of my constituents to escape the AMT. Today, millions of middle-class families are in danger of being ensnared by a tax that was never intended to affect them.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, the nineteenth district of New York is one of the districts in this country most affected by the AMT. Last year over 30,000 families in my district paid AMT. I wish we had the support in both the majority, and the minority, that we need to advance the major tax reform necessary to prevent the AMT from unfairly penalizing thousands of families in the Hudson Valley. The ``patch'' legislation that we considered today is the best legislation that we can pass at this time to prevent more families from being impacted by the AMT, and will ensure that an additional 70,000 families in my district alone will not be hit next year by the AMT. 
   I am proud that the Democratic Majority in the House of Representatives has twice passed a responsible AMT patch; offsetting the $50 billion in lost revenue from the AMT by eliminating tax loopholes for some of the richest people in the country, who choose to use offshore tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. However, neither the President nor his allies in Congress are fiscally responsible. They will not accept any legislation that acts responsibly by ensuring that the cost of protecting working families from the AMT will not be borne by their grandchildren. I believe I was elected to Congress last year to help restore fiscal integrity to the Federal Government, and I stand by the numerous votes I have cast in support of a responsible Pay-Go system. 
   Although I am deeply disappointed that we will not be able to pass a version of AMT reform with a revenue offset this year. I am unwilling to let working families in my district suffer as a result of the President and the minority in Congress. That is why, despite its obvious inadequacies, I feel that I must support this bill. I am disappointed that we were forced to pass this bill by borrowing the resources to do so. As Congress continues its work in the future, I am committed to working to make sure our government operates within its means and respects the principle of fiscal responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, today this body did something that it failed to do last year under the previous majority by passing legislation to direct the spending of our Federal Government. 
   I am disappointed that the choice of the President and the minority to engage in confrontation and obstruction instead of cooperation and progress prevented us from more fully meeting America's needs in this bill. Despite their intransigence, we were able to pass a bill that began to reinvest in critical national priorities that had been neglected for too long. Priorities like life saving medical research, law enforcement, border and homeland security, K-12 education, college aid, needed infrastructure improvements, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. In addition to those steps, this bill lived up to the commitment of this Congress to keep our promises to America's veterans by providing $3.7 billion over the President's request for veterans' medical care, claims processing, and facility improvements. 
   I indicated when the House considered this legislation earlier this week that I believed this is not a perfect bill. However, I believe that the spending bill we approved on December 17, 2007, does a tremendous amount of good by funding key programs that will make America more secure and more prosperous. It makes necessary investments in America's future, and that is why I voted for it. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate has added funding for the war in Iraq without placing a time line for withdrawal. For that reason, I could not support the Senate version of the bill and voted against it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, today, the House took an important step to restore accountability to our involvement in Iraq by passing H.R. 2740, the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act of 2007. This bill serves an important purpose by bringing previously unaccountable private security contractors under the rule of U.S. law. 
   By some estimates there are nearly 50,000 private security personnel working in Iraq. These contractors operate largely outside U.S. and Iraqi law, and episodes of significant contractor misconduct raise animosity toward Americans in the field and lose us hearts and minds in Iraq. 
   The activities of one of the most prominent contractors, Blackwater, highlight why they are a counterproductive influence in Iraq and their activities must be curtailed. Two weeks ago, Blackwater personnel guarding a State Department group were involved in a shootout that resulted in the deaths of as many as 17 Iraqis. Yesterday, the Government Reform Committee disclosed that Blackwater has been involved in 195 escalation of force incidents since 2005 and in 80 percent of those Blackwater fired the first shots. 
   These incidents combined with a host of other abuses clearly indicate that we need to stop putting contractors in Iraq and bring those there under control. That's why I was proud to cosponsor and vote for the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act to bring these contractors under U.S. jurisdiction if they commit criminal acts. Only by holding these contractors accountable can we actually begin to restore our standing in the world and win hearts and minds in Iraq. 
   During consideration of this bill, the House of Representatives considered a motion to recommit forthwith that stated, ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect intelligence activities that are otherwise permissible prior to the enactment of this Act.'' 
   I am an ardent supporter of our efforts to combat terrorism, prevent terrorist attacks, and bring terrorists to justice. I want our intelligence community to have all of the tools it needs to accomplish these tasks, and believe it can be successful in doing so within the rule of law. Some of my proudest votes on this floor have been to give our government new tools to fight terrorism and keep Americans safe. However, for the following reasons I could not in good conscience vote for this motion to recommit forthwith. 
   It is often said that, ``the devil is in the details.'' In this case, I fear the level is in the lack of details. The drafting of this legislative language is extremely vague, and I have serious reservations about the scope of its impact. It seems that this language could be interpreted to provide legal cover to abuses committed by contractors, like those at Abu Ghraib, that undermine our national security and are contrary to the founding principles of our nation. On a day when the New York Times has reported at length on the concerted efforts of the Administration to twist the law to make practices like freezing and water-boarding legal, I could not support language that could be manipulated to provide cover for such illegal and counterproductive acts. 
   I am doubly skeptical of this language because if it was not meant to provide cover for questionable acts, it would not be necessary. The MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act does not make any previously legal acts illegal, it simply extends the jurisdiction of U.S. law. Previously uncovered contractors would not be impeded in their work if they were acting and continue to act in accordance with the law. 
   For these reasons, I voted to support the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act and voted against the motion to recommit forthwith.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise, today in support of S. 2617, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act. With today's military and veteran community facing increasing deployments, a struggling economy, rising gas prices, and other hardships that together create tough financial situations, this legislation could not have come at a better time. 
   For many of our Nation's veterans and their families, these payments are a necessity in order to make ends meet. They provide for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the survivors of certain disabled veterans. Specifically, this COLA increase will boost wartime disability compensation, additional compensation for benefits, and even things such as clothing allowances. 
   Again, in these increasingly tough times, we cannot allow rising costs to strip our brave veterans of this crucial resource. For those who have done so much by sacrificing mind, body, and family in service of this Nation, this COLA is the least we can do to honor their sacrifices. 
   I commend Senator Akaka for his hard work passing this crucially needed legislation through the Senate, and urge my colleagues to pass this in the House with equal success.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1527, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act, and I would first like to take this opportunity to commend Congressman Moran for all of his work on this legislation. I used to live in Manhattan, New York, and I am glad that veterans from Manhattan, Kansas, and Manhattan, New York, will be served better by this Congress and by the VA. 
   We can illustrate the fact that issues relating to veterans can, and should be, and I believe in this Congress and in this committee, are a truly bipartisan effort. I can't recall a single critical remark of this bill as it passed through the committee process, because it is truly a needed piece of legislation. 
   Veterans have consistently been calling on the VA to develop a plan to address the needs of those veterans who live in rural areas at great distances away from the nearest VA hospital. When these brave men and women served our country honorably, they expected the same service in return once they retired. When they signed up, nowhere, at no time, did it say that they would get the health care they need only if they wanted to drive for hours and hours to get it. 
   Moreover, with the recent increases in the cost of gasoline, travel for rural veterans is placing an even greater financial burden on them and their families. Hours of driving and a hefty gas bill is not the kind of treatment our veterans deserve for their selfless sacrifice to our Nation. 
   I am confident that the pilot programs erected in H.R. 1527 will begin to bring relief to our veterans who live at great distances from the nearest VA hospital. It is our duty to reward the veterans of our Nation with this treatment befitting their sacrifice. I believe this bill takes the necessary steps to do just that, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, over the weekend, gas reached the $4 national average for the first time in our Nation's history. The majority in Congress has worked to combat these prices by advancing new energy solutions and efforts to protect consumers. The standard refrain from the oil companies and their allies is, ``We need to drill for more oil here at home.'' I would ask them, ``Who is stopping you?'' 
   The oil company myth is that we need to open up the Arctic refuge and give the oil company a free hand to go wherever and whenever they want to chase oil. The reality, however, is that about 75 percent of the oil in the United States is on land that is already open for production, but less than one-third of that land is actually being used by the oil companies. 
   They are literally sitting on 10,000 permits and millions of acres of leased land that would let them start pulling more oil out of the ground here at home. So I say to the oil company advocates, start drilling for more domestic supply. Start drilling on the lands that are already open, and stop posturing while American drivers are in pain at the pump.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the chairman for his prior support of a muck soils conservation program. Unfortunately, this House language did not survive in conference. 
   Existing programs like CREP do not address the needs of muck farmers, like the black dirt farmers in Orange County, New York. In the Hudson Valley, this has led to full retirement of soil and rent inflation. 
   The needs that would have been addressed in the House bill remain. Proposed administrative changes in future CREP contracts will not address impacts of contracts that are in place today and will be for several years. These are ongoing challenges for farmers in my district and throughout the northeast, growers of specialty crops and producers of muck crops who have been thrice underserved by previous farm bills. 
   Again, I thank the chairman and ask if he would be willing to continue working with USDA on solutions that will meet conservation goals and address unintended economic consequences of existing programs.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and congratulate him on successfully bringing this conference report to the floor after many months of hard work and committed effort. I also thank him for his prior support for inclusion of a muck soils conservation program to address serious challenges being faced by the farmers in my district and throughout the country. Although such language was included in the version of this bill passed by the House, it was unfortunately not able to survive the conference negotiations. 
   Currently available conservation programs have shown that they do not specifically address the needs of farmers who produce crops  on muck soil. The existing Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, CREP, seeks to prevent erosion and protect water quality through a voluntary retirement program. In areas like the Hudson Valley, this has created unintended consequences including the full retirement of productive soil and inflationary pressures on rental rates. 
   The program included in section 2303 of the House version of the bill, which would have sought to meet conservation goals with practices that would also keep these lands active and address local rent pressures, will not become law as part of this bill, but the needs it was meant to address remain. Similarly, efforts to make changes in future CREP contracts at the administrative level will not address the rent inflation that has been created in places like Orange County, NY, by contracts that are in place today and will have standing for several years. 
   The issues of unintended land retirement and rent inflation are ongoing challenges for farmers in my district, who as farmers in the Northeast, growers of specialty crops, and producers of muck land crops have been thrice underserved by previous farm bills. 
   The chairman has been extraordinarily understanding and supportive of efforts to address these challenges. Again, I thank him for his efforts and ask if he would be willing to continue our work on this issue and to work with USDA on solutions that will meet the conservation goals of farmers on muck soils and address the unintended economic consequences of existing programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, it is good to be here with Mr. Klein and Congressman Braley. 
   Before I talk about Iraq, I have to respond to a couple of things that were said a few minutes ago by our friends from the other side of the aisle who used the word ``truth'' frequently and talked about their children and grandchildren. And I am sure they are sincere, but to those of you Americans out there listening, I am sure you can remember that when President Bush took over with Republicans controlling both Houses of Congress in the year 2001, he had a surplus delivered to him by the Clinton administration. 
   In the years since then, these folks you just heard talking, who profess to know what is best for our economy, have delivered to the United States, from a surplus when we were paying down the national debt, now the biggest deficit in the history of our country, the biggest balance of trade deficit, the biggest individual debt by Americans that is held, whether it is credit card debt or home second mortgage debt, and now we have the housing crisis, the subprime crisis, and various big box stores I was reading today are getting ready to file for or have already filed for bankruptcy, including some that we have seen proliferating around the country and have assumed that they were on solid ground. 
   So I would take all the proclamations you just heard and the fancy charts that you just saw from the Republican hour before us with a grain of salt. 
   The tax increase that they claim we are voting for is actually something that they, when they installed their tax cuts early in the Bush years, they installed it by putting in a sunset provision that is their creation, not ours. So I stand here and say that we have not in fact voted for anything like this biggest tax increase in history. It is a theatrical and dramatic presentation,  well acted, and possibly even believed by them, but it is not the truth. 
   As far as Iraq goes, we are spending $12 billion a week in Iraq, and I have started to look at the needs of our country and my district in particular in terms of how that money could be used here because we are basically running on fumes financially. I just visited 13 bridges that are on the dangerous faulty bridge list that came out after the I-35 bridge collapse in Minnesota, and the estimate of the New York State Department of Transportation is that it will cost about $60 billion to fix all of the deficient bridges in the State of New York. That is 5 months in Iraq. 
   I just came back 2 weeks ago from visiting a Nogales, Arizona, checkpoint on the Mexican border. Congressman Braley was on that trip, along with Congressman Arcuri. And we asked at every step of the way the Customs and Border protection officials what they need from Congress and what would their wish list be. 
   They said basically if it was Christmas and they could have everything that they wanted in terms of infrastructure, primarily what they need is more loading docks to unload the bales of marijuana that are stacked in front of an 18-wheeler behind a load of watermelons, or more bandwidth for more computers so they can get 10 fingerprints processed faster to establish somebody's identity. All of it, northern border, southern border, all ports on both coasts, $500 million a year for 10 years. That is $5 billion.     
   That's a little bit less than 2 weeks in Iraq to secure both of our borders and all of our ports. That sounds to me like it would actually make our country more secure; not that we want to shut the borders down, but we'd like to know who's coming and who's going, what's coming in and what's going out in terms of drugs, in terms of agricultural products that might be infested, in terms of currency smuggling. So anyway, there's a real cost to all these things. 
   And I would just say, after hearing General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker for the second time, it's clear that the goals in Iraq that we're spending this $12 billion a month on have been changing, that the goal posts have been moving, that 5 years after the initiation of this war and the death of 4,017 of our mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, I have a figure of 29,676 wounded, the estimate before the VA, Veterans Affairs Committee, last summer was that if the war stopped at that point we'd be looking at $1 trillion for the lifetime care of grievously wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. That's four injuries primarily, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, spinal cord injuries that cause paralysis, and amputations. 
   And these are, fortunately, men and women who we're able to save today in the battlefield because our battlefield medicine is so much better than it was in Vietnam, for instance. The ratio is about 16:1 wounded to killed where in Vietnam it was about 2 1/2 :1. That's the good news is that we're saving more of these mostly young lives of brave Americans who've gone over there and fought and carried out their mission. 
   But the bad news is that the American public has not been told yet that, on top of the figures you mentioned, there's at least $1 trillion lifetime care for the wounded from this war that we're already looking at being responsible for. And we have to take care of these wounded warriors. You can't pay for the war and forget about the warriors. 
   So I would just say that we need to look at this in terms of a broad view of national security and a realistic, clear-eyed view of where we are financially and whether we can afford it. 
   And with that, I yield back to Mr. Klein.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Well, in fact I do. And I thank the gentleman. You know, I saw 60 Minutes, I think this last Sunday, and they had an interview about the topic you just mentioned, the Iraqi windfall due to the price of oil, and how those tens of billions dollars are sitting in accounts. And the Iraqi officials interviewed on the TV show said they can't get at them to pay for their own reconstruction; and the American taxpayer has to keep paying the way we are because they don't yet have the systems in place or the infrastructure or the banking technology to be able to transfer the money. 
   Now, either that's a really lame excuse, or we've been missing the boat by not helping them set that up. Or both. 
   But you know, I have to just, not to be, not to carp on an old topic, but to hearken back to the previous hour and the other side of the aisle, our friends' presentation about budgetary truth. I would point out that the President's budget that he sent down to us this year shows no money for Iraq after the first of the year. So that's obviously not an honest document. 
   It also assumes the AMT, the Alternative Minimum Tax which was supposed to be a tax on the richest of the rich and has become instead a tax that's been digging deeper and deeper into the middle class, and we've been working to change that. Our budget does change that and pushes it back up to the wealthiest 4 percent or so of Americans. 
   But the President's budget assumes all the money that will be scooped out of the middle class, if nothing is done, will be available. So I just had to say those couple of things about that.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Not only do they know, but the President, as we speak, is negotiating, or his representatives are negotiating a status of forces agreement to keep our troops in Iraq for some unknown time. So they obviously are planning on it. They're just not putting it in the budget. 
   And I agree with you that the first year you could call it an emergency, but after that, this should be on budget. We're building up enough debt that we're passing on to our children and  grandchildren with interest anyway, and in order for the public to know what is really being done in their name, this should not be a supplemental; this should be in the budget. 
   I would also like to comment about my trip to Iraq last October. When I slept in the Green Zone in one of Saddam's pool houses next to one of his mansions, which, by the way, I think we should give back to the Iraqi people at this point. He was a tyrant, but he was their tyrant, and he built the mansion with their money and it might help us lose that image that some of them have of us as occupiers if we gave them back their property. 
   But at any rate, when I slept in the Green Zone, we were told, use the bottled water, don't drink the water out of the tap; if you hear a siren, there's a concrete bunker over there; go jump in it because we've had a few mortar rounds coming in. But that was basically all the warning we got. 
   Last week when the fighting was going at a higher level of intensity when the battle of Basra was on and the Green Zone took so many mortar and rocket rounds that we lost two soldiers dead and 17 wounded in the Green Zone, they were telling people then and since then to sleep in your body armor and your helmet. So October, we were not told that. Last week and the week before, they were telling our diplomats and our traveling Members of Congress that. That's not progress; that's back-sliding. 
   And Albert Einstein, I think, was the guy who once defined insanity as trying the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. That's where we're at now. 
   There's a friend of mine who's a sheriff in one of the Upstate counties of New York who is a West Point graduate and a classmate of my brother-in-law, 1969 West Point grad, who told me a couple years back that one of the first things they learned at West Point in officer training class is never send a military force to do a job that is not militarily achievable. 
   And this is to say nothing critical or to overshadow the accomplishments of our forces. Our men and women in uniform have done an extraordinary job and we should all be extremely proud of them. They have been creative. They have been extremely loyal not just to our country but loyal to each other. They have been energetic and committed. They will do anything we ask of them and anything their commanders ask of them. 
   But our responsibility as a civilian government, the kind of government that our Constitution sets up where the civilian government and the President, ultimately, is Commander in Chief, but Congress as well has the right to not only declare war but also to fund Armies. And we need to be careful that we use them responsibly. These are not chattel. Our men and women in uniform are human beings that are stressed out with record rates right now of suicide, divorce, and bankruptcy among veterans that have returned from this war, as well as among veterans of previous conflicts. 
   And I think that it's time for us to reevaluate whether this is really making our Nation more secure and whether it is worth the $12 billion for nation building that we might better use for rebuilding the Nation of the United States.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Well, yes. I would just tell you that we are way behind on our infrastructure in this country in terms of keeping it maintained to a level of safety or efficiency just to keep traffic moving. 
   I had a construction worker tell me yesterday that he was working with some of his compatriots on the Tappan Zee Bridge which, as you know, crosses the Hudson River just north of New York and carries the New York State thruway and millions of cars a day commuting to and from the New York metro area. 
   Twelve years ago they were replacing and welding plates to repair potholes and damage that has been done by the salt and acid rain, and pigeon droppings, if you can believe it, are a major cause of corrosion on bridges. And at that time 12 years ago, he and his men that were working on the bridge said if they did not have to drive across it to go to work to feed their families, they would not drive across it because they felt it wasn't safe then. And they told their kids if they could help it, please don't drive across that bridge. 12 years ago. 
   Now we're finally getting down to the point where the thruway authority and the State of New York are looking at building a new Tappan Zee Bridge because the support pilings of the bridge are either being undercut by the tide or eaten by aquatic worms, if you can believe that, or both. There are so many kinds of damage that has happened in a bridge that only had a 30-year life span, and it was built more than 30 years ago, and nothing's been done to get ready to build its successor. 
   As I'm sure you both do, I'm approached in the district every week by town supervisors or mayors or what have you asking for help with a sewage treatment plant, for instance, in the town of New Windsor, New York, that's 60 years old. It's well beyond its design life, and when it breaks down, if there's a heavy storm rain event and it becomes overtaxed with capacity from the storm run-off, you get raw sewage running into the Hudson River, which we've been trying and pretty much succeeding in trying to clean up in terms of sewage. The river is much better. It's actually swimmable, and to some extent, some people eat fish out of it, but I think that disregards the PCBs, which is another issue. 
   But every one of these water treatments for drinking water, sewage treatment for disposing of wastewater, bridges, tunnels, roads, rail, which we are so far behind the rest of the world in, Japan, the European Nations in the EU have a so much more advanced rail system that it actually substitutes for a short hop air travel in this country, what we would consider to be flying from New York to Washington or New York to Boston. They do that by train on a high-speed train that takes virtually the same time or less because it delivers them from inner city to inner city. It eliminates the taxi ride out to the airport and back in from the airport at the other end.     
   It eliminates the taxi ride out to the airport and back in from the airport at the other end. These are all things that cost money. 
   And you know what else? They hire people. They hire construction workers, they hire sheet metal workers, they hire engineers, they hire electrical workers, they hire plumbers. And just as FDR did back when we had the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, and the incredible unemployment and deprivation when schools were closed across the country for lack of money to pay teachers, we saw really desperate times in this country which I hope we don't see again. And I hope we move fast enough to try to take the steps, not just to build assets here at home, but at the same time, to put money back into the economy by hiring people to build this infrastructure. That's the first place that I would start. 
   And I think that there's a lot of agreement, when I talk to Members on both sides of the aisle, and certainly when I talk to my constituents, that that's a good use of the money that we're--whether we're borrowing the money or not, and hopefully we will be able to pay as we go, as in this Congress, this House of Representatives, under PAYGO, we've been trying to do it, but wherever we come up with the money, putting it into our own infrastructure here at home is a really good place to jump-start the economy.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank the gentleman from Florida. 
   And I am happy to tell you that there is a solution to the problem of what to do with that power while the battery is being developed, it's called ``net metering.'' And most States, New York being one of them, I believe have net metering which enables you to, if you're a homeowner or a business and you put solar panels on your property or on your roof and you don't use all that power, it winds the meter backwards and puts the power back into the grid and uses the grid as a battery. So that's what most people are doing today who have solar panels. 
   In fact, I helped the Action Club at the Arlington High School in Dutchess County, New York recently acquire a grant from the Dyson Foundation of New York, who were very generous and came up with funding for them to put solar panels on the roof of the high school. This is leadership by high school students who went first. And NYSERDA, the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority, I got part of the funding from them, developed a design to produce a certain number of kilowatts from, I think it's 123 kilowatts or so, anyway, it's a substantial amount of power toward what their school uses. 
   And then they came to us. And knowing how the appropriation process here in Congress can take so long and it's not a sure thing--last year our appropriations were finally signed into law by the President in December--I didn't want them to have to wait that long, so I was able to find a private source of funding for them. 
   But the point is that, it not only works, but the school kids know about it and they want their school to be solar. And I told them after they get that installed, they should go get the school bus fleet to use 20 percent biodiesel. 
   I'm burning heating oil in my home in the northeast, where heating oil is a major expense, especially this last winter, the cost rising the way it has has been very harmful to many people, especially those on fixed incomes. And I just called up the local dealer for heating oil and said, do you have a biodiesel blend? And the guy on the other end of the phone said, sure, it's a 20 percent soy/biodiesel blend, and I own the company, I burn it at home myself. It burns cleaner than regular oil. And so I said, send it on over. And for the last two winters now my wife and I have been heating our home with a biodiesel blend. And that's 20 percent less that has to come from Saudi Arabia or some other unstable part of the world where we're funding governments that don't like us, that use that money to buy weapons or to fund madrassas that teach young people who don't have much opportunity in their country, by the way, to advance economically or educationally, they teach them to hate Americans or hate Israelis and to do harm to us. And then, as Tom Friedman likes to write in the New York Times, we have to pay for the other side of the war on terror by sending our troops over there to stabilize these unstable parts of the world. 
   So that's a lose-lose policy, the old policy that we've been stuck on of oil dependency. The win-win-win policy is the one that we're talking about, where we use wind, we use biofuels. I mean, Brazil did this 20 years ago. They decided that they were going to use sugar cane ethanol. And they converted their vehicle fleet in the entire country over so that now when they drill offshore for oil in Brazil, they sell it on the world market and make money off of it, but they don't use it in their own vehicles. I think they're a few steps ahead of us. But we can get there. We're the nation that put a man on the moon. We're the nation that has been able to lead the way in many areas of medicine and technology, and certainly computer and software and Internet technology. This is something we can do. And we, in government, can incentivize it and try to encourage private industry and encourage individuals to do it. And make it patriotic, make people know that it's patriotic to drive the most efficient vehicle you can in the most efficient way that you can. It's patriotic to carpool, it's patriotic to use mass transit when you can, and it's certainly patriotic to let your elected officials know at every level of government, whether it's snowplows in the winter, school buses or UPS fleets or the thruway trucks that drive up and down all the time from Albany to New York, governmental fleets of vehicles, if we can buy hybrids, as West Chester County has done with their bus fleet, they're running not just hybrids, but biodiesel hybrids, they're already pyramiding in West Chester County on the B line, as they call it, the county bus route, they're pyramiding one new technology on top of another. And the next step would be plug-in biodiesel hybrids. 
   But we can do this. The technologies are here and available. And the sooner  we start getting on the program and using them, the sooner we will be able to tell some of the countries that we've, unfortunately, been beholden to, whether it's the Saudis to get the oil or whether it's the Chinese to borrow the money to pay for the oil, we will soon be able to tell them, we don't need you quite so badly, and by the way, we'd like to talk to you about human rights and some other things that right now we can't be honest about because, in effect, we've lost our sovereignty because of this dependency. 
   But at any rate, it's a lose-lose-lose policy on one hand and a win-win-win policy on the other, and I want to see us go for the win-win.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Quickly I would just add about Iraq two quotes, one from Ambassador Ryan Crocker. When I was over there with our Republican colleagues Tom Cole, Ric Keller, Dave Loebsack of Iowa, the four Members of Congress sat with the Ambassador, and he was asked by one of us, ``What's the state of reconciliation and peace and resolving the conflicts between the tribes and the different religious sects?'' 
   And I was sitting right next to him; so I wrote down his response to be sure I had it right. His response was, ``The Maliki Government is somewhere between challenged and dysfunctional.'' Now, that was October. 
   In March General Petraeus stated on March 13, ``No one feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation.'' 
   So it's my contention that not only do the Iraqis need to start paying for their own reconstruction, I think they need to take responsibility for their own security as well because as long as we are putting our men and women in a police role to try to police their civil war and their ethnic and tribal and religious differences, it's just going to let them continue to be dysfunctional. And when we phase out or pull out or whatever you want to call it and get back to the real business that this country faces, the real dangers that we face, which, as you said before, I believe, are Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly more in terms of terrorism, that they will be forced to come to terms with whether they want to be a country or whether they want to be three separate groups of Kurds and Sunnis and Shia or whatever it is. But that's one thing. 
   And the other thing is I am a firm believer that after 5 years and a least $600 billion spent and over $1 trillion in veterans' benefits that we have incurred that we will have to pay out of responsibility and the debt that we owe to the men and women who fought in this conflict that it's time for us to start looking at what those dollars could do at home for the things that we really need to take care of, not just for national security but for economic security, education security, health security, and all the other meanings of the word. 
   So I thank my friends both, and I thank the gentleman from Florida for chairing this session.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (SBA TRADE PROGRAMS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for doing such a wonderful job ushering this bill through her committee and onto the House floor today. America's small business community could not ask for a better ally and friend  in this body than the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee. 
   I am pleased today that H.R. 2992, the SBA Trade Programs Act of 2007, is being considered on the House Floor. As in many parts of the country, the small businesses in New York's Hudson Valley are the engine that drives our economy, and their success is vital to the prosperity of our communities. In our increasingly shrinking world, being successful throughout the global economy has taken on a vitally important role. As a result, it is crucial that all businesses, including small businesses, have a level playing field in international trade. 
   Unfortunately, by their very nature small businesses do not have the same opportunities to take part in international trade that their larger competitors do. They are smaller and less able to take advantage of the economy of scale. Many simply do not have the capital or the logistical capability to devote to the cause. Most of the small businesses in my district are located only a few miles from New York City, the world's greatest international hub, and yet they often do not have the capacity to take advantage of that location. Today, with this bill, we hope to change that. 
   The SBA Trade Programs Act we have considered directs the Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade to take a number of steps specifically designed to help small businesses have a greater opportunity to take part in international trade. It instructs the OIT to capitalize on its relationship with the US Trade Representative and international organizations to develop and implement trade policies to support small businesses. This will enable small businesses to take advantage of the system we have created for bigger companies and has proven so helpful to American businesses. 
   It orders the OIT to establish an annual trade strategy for small businesses, which includes specific ideas on ways to increase competitiveness, better protect small businesses from unfair trade practices, increase small business' exports, and expand the representation of small businesses in creating and defining trade policy. 
   It provides small businesses with technical assistance in trade remedy investigations and dispute cases, two places where small businesses have long been at a disadvantage as they often do not have the financial capacity or manpower to deal with multiple jurisdictional issues. 
   The bill calls on the OIT to design comprehensive services to assist small businesses adjust to global climate conditions and increase loans and loan guarantees to small business exporters. By increasing loan availability small businesses will have greater access to the capital required for successful international business opportunities. And the assistive services will better enable small businesses to adapt to the differing tastes and desires of foreign markets. 
   This bill will provide assistance for businesses that require legal resources to help secure intellectual property protection. It will also expand eligibility requirements for international trade loans to include intellectual property violations as well as other trade practices with negative financial repercussions. These provisions are especially relevant because intellectual property remains one of our country's most important exports. Yet the extent and scope of their protection varies significantly from country to country. Any company looking to protect their intellectual property must be aware of the protections offered, and not offered; in each jurisdiction in which they have a presence. This bill will provide the appropriate resources so that America's small businesses can protect, and if need be, defend their intellectual property rights. 
   Mr. Speaker. This is an important bill. It is a bill that will provide a significant benefit to America's small businesses and open doors to them have been shut for far too long. I urge every member of the House to support it. Once again, I thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and the rest of the small business committee for such great work in bringing this bill to the floor.  
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Hodes. Good evening. It is a pleasure to be here again. I want to just agree with one thing that our previous speaker from the other side of the aisle, Mr. King, had to say regarding biofuels. I think that there are ways in which various biofuels, including corn, but especially cellulosic biofuels and nonfood crops can and should be used to extend the liquid fuels capacity of this country. But the main reason that I'm here tonight is because I've heard in the last several days a nonstop drum beat, a chorus singing from the same choir book and the same hymn book at every committee meeting I have been at, at every press conference I have heard, at every chance I see a Republican representative on television blaming the Democrats for the high price of gasoline and claiming, erroneously, that Democrats have been stopping drilling, that Democrats are opposed to drilling, and therefore we're responsible for the price of gas. This is not only false but ridiculous on the face of it. And I challenge it as a falsehood. 
   Specifically, I would say that over the last 8 years, the number of drilling permits issued by the government has gone up by 361 percent. So the lands are open. The oil companies own 9,700 plus leases that they have bid on and received the leases for. And as you say, Mr. Hodes, they have got done the environmental permitting on, the permits have been issued, and the way is clear for drills to go into the ground or into the offshore adjacent waters of the lower 48. But for some reason, no drilling is occurring. 
   Now I'm curious as to why exactly that is, if really the oil companies want to drill. And I would remind you, by the way, that our President George W. Bush said, when oil was going for $50 a barrel, that that was all the incentive the oil companies need. They don't need any more tax breaks or incentives. Fifty dollars a barrel is enough incentive to make them drill anywhere. 
   As this chart will show you, the total Federal acres leased and in production in 2007 were 91.5 million acres leased but producing only 23.7 million acres. There is a huge discrepancy between land that has been leased by the oil companies and that which they are using to actually drill and produce oil. Why is this? Could it be perhaps that they expect that speculators and market forces may drive the prices up further, not to mention their restricting supply might drive them up further, and that if they hold off for a couple more years, that same land and that same oil might be more valuable? And actually when you're making profits such as the gentleman from New Hampshire just talked about, I mean, how much money can you deal with? How many profits can you possibly figure out what to do with and where to invest in? And maybe it's better leaving them in the ground. 
   If I'm an oil company, I'm not necessarily thinking in the national interest. I'm thinking in the interests of my shareholders for the next quarter, for the next year, for the next shareholders' meeting, and for my next bonus if I'm the CEO. We had the CEOs of the top five oil companies testifying in this House before the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. And when they were asked, ``Now that you have made the record profits of any corporation in the history of the world, would you commit to investing in one biofuels pump at every station that you own?'' And they said ``no.'' And when they were asked, ``If you would commit to advertising now that you have made the biggest profits in the history of the world for 3 years in a row, would you invest in advertising to tell people to conserve more and that it's patriotic to conserve and to drive a more fuel-efficient car and so on?'' And they said, ``Oh, we're already doing that.'' Which I frankly haven't seen. I watch enough television. I think I would have noticed if they were doing that. 
   And my friend, Mr. Walden, a minority member, a Republican member of the Select Committee from Oregon said, ``I'm a capitalist.'' I'm paraphrasing him now. I don't remember the exact quote. ``I'm a capitalist. I'm a small businessman myself. And if I made record profits for several years in a row, profits that I hadn't even dreamed of, I would start to think about whether I could lower my price to my customer. Have you at the oil companies thought about lowering the prices to the consumers?'' And one by one all five of them said, ``Well, we don't set the prices.'' And there was a chuckle through the room. 
   But I think there are various factors setting the prices. And one of them is collusion between the oil companies, which is why I have called for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on exactly that fact, the fact that when crude oil goes up on the world market, the gas and diesel price spikes immediately with it. They go up simultaneously. But when crude prices go down, gasoline prices still go up. And if they come down at all, they come done slowly. It's kind of like rockets and feathers. The price goes up like a rocket, and it comes down like a feather very slowly. 
   So I'm suspicious about a couple of things, one, the disconnect between crude and refined gasoline when they're coming down. They're connected when going up. They are not connected when coming down. Secondly, why so much leased acreage that is not being drilled on? And thirdly, why at this time when the prices are at a record, when America's families are being squeezed and hurt, and their budgets are being hurt, they're being forced to choose between food, medicine or gasoline, some people have given up their jobs because they can't afford to commute to those jobs, why at these times are these oil companies and our friends on the other side of the aisle choosing to put the pressure on and say drill in ANWR and drill in these environmentally sensitive areas? 
   By the way, two of the individuals who have been stopping offshore drilling, I haven't personally stopped any myself, but two of the people who have  are the President's brother, Jeb Bush, who is the Republican Governor of Florida who is opposed to drilling off the coast of Florida, and Governor Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican Governor who has been opposed to further drilling off the coast of California. So you can't just say this is a Democratic opposition even if we were opposing it. 
   But the fact is that we have seen an increase, a radical increase in leases that are made available, in leases that the oil companies bid for apparently believing there is something of value underground, 9,700 separate leases and 68 million acres of land currently available and not being used. And I suggest that our friends in the minority might think of another reason, or perhaps another policy, that would help us get out of the box we're in. 
   We have worked very hard in this Congress to try to develop new sources, to provide incentives and tax breaks and subsidies for renewable energies like solar, wind and geothermal and various kinds of biofuels. For the first time, we made a major investment of, I believe it was $6 billion or so in carbon sequestration so we can use the record amounts of coal that we have and still precipitate out the carbon so we don't release that 
   carbon dioxide that causes the global warming. 
   And, by the way, I would say in sympathy to the folks from Mr. King's State and to the parents of the five Boy Scouts who were killed by a tornado there, and in sympathy to the folks in Cedar Rapids who are just now starting to pump out their basements and put their city back together, it used to be called the city ``that would never flood,'' by the way, that was under 12 feet of water from its most recent flood, in sympathy to the poor citizens of Myanmar who were struck by the cyclone a couple of weeks ago that was as strong as Hurricane Katrina but came to shore with no warning and no FEMA, and not even Brownie to save them, and in sympathy to the people in Georgia and in Florida with record droughts, and in sympathy to people of the Rocky Mountain States and the Western States with record fire seasons, and in sympathy to folks in the 19th District of New York, which I represent which has had three 50-year floods in the last 5 years, I would say in sympathy to all those folks and to protect them, that global warming is here, it is starting to change the climate. These extreme weather patterns fit the computer models of global warming. And if we want to pump and drill more oil and burn more fossil fuels, fine. But that had better not be our only solution, or we will see more tornadoes, more floods, more extreme weather catastrophic events and more global warming. And I think that is not what the American people want. What we want are fair gas prices, fair energy prices and a green, renewable, sustainable energy future. 
   I yield back to my friend from New Hampshire.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (THE FRESHMEN CLASS OF THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Hodes. 
   As you were speaking, I was thinking about some of the things that we can do. 
   Westchester County, one of the counties that I have the honor to represent, has a loop of county bus service which has switched from diesel buses to biodiesel buses to hybrid biodiesel buses. 
   We have John Jay High School, at which I just spoke a couple of days ago, where the environmental club has a grease mobile, a diesel car they've converted to run on biodiesel that they made from cooking oil from restaurants in the area. 
   The Newburgh Free Academy, a public school in Orange County, New York, one of the counties I'm honored to represent, has a solar racing club that built a solar car which tied for first place in a race between Houston, Texas and Newburgh, New York. They were built without the faculty advisors' even touching the vehicle. The adults were not allowed to touch the vehicle. The kids had to build it by themselves. These students knew how to weld and fasten the car together and how to build it sturdily enough and how to make sure that the wheels rotated so that they didn't wobble and so on. The advanced placement math and science students knew how to calculate how many square inches of photovoltaic cells it took to power a certain number of batteries to drive the wheels. 
   They drove that car from Houston for 2,000 miles to Newburgh, New York, and tied for first place in a race that was sponsored by a corporation that put the money up for the entire educational and research experiment. 
   When we did a presentation in our district on this, the students came in, wearing their solar racing club hats and their solar racing club T-shirts, and they showed the video of their car rolling down the highway with nothing but solar power powering it. By the way, this was a standing-room-only crowd who came to see this at the Bedford Town Hall in New York. 
   Afterwards, the adults came up to me as we were leaving, and they were saying, if these kids can do this on a shoestring, with no budget to speak of, where is Detroit? Why can't GM and Ford and Chrysler, our automakers, do this? 
   I would say that they can and that they should have been, but they're only now starting to. In fact, as to the Chevy Volt, as advertised on their Web site--it will be out, I believe, next year--they're planning this car to be a plug-in hybrid which will have a small internal combustion engine, but it will not be connected to the drive chain. The gas engine will only be used to drive a generator to keep the Lithium-ion batteries fully powered. When you drive this car, they say, on a 100-mile commute or less, it will run as an electric vehicle and will not use any gasoline. When you run it on an intercity trip of hundreds of miles, it will average 150 miles per gallon. That's supposed to be available next year. 
   I was at an event last week, and I talked to somebody from Toyota. They said, oh, that's nothing. In a couple of years, we're bringing out a car that's going to get 500 miles to the gallon. 
   Now, my feeling is that, when I was growing up and when we were in the middle of the space race and when President John Kennedy had challenged us that we would get to the Moon in 10 years, in our country, we were used to the position of leadership, and we thought, certainly, the United States has the ingenuity and the creativity and the expertise and the intelligence to be able to devise solutions for all of these problems. I still think we can, and I think we need to, and I think that the solution here is not to drill, drill, drill, and to open up more environmentally sensitive areas to be destroyed. 
   By the way, it was interesting to me that the polar bear was just put on the threatened list by the Secretary of the Interior. Then just this week, with a rulemaking process that doesn't have to go before us here in Congress, Secretary Kempthorne issued a rule indemnifying the top seven oil companies against any legal action should they kill polar bears in their exploration for oil. 
   So it's kind of a curious environmental consciousness that this administration seems to have where they give lip service to it on one hand, but on the other hand, they want to protect their friends in the oil companies from any risk at all at the same time that they open them up to all profit imaginable. 
   Just turning to this chart, natural gas is, of course, another one of the things we hear about, the oil and gas for which we bad Democrats are not allowing them to drill. Currently, how much natural gas is open to leasing? 82 percent. Closed to leasing is this small piece of the pie chart. This came from the Minerals Management Service in 2006. Technically, of the recoverable reserves of natural gas, 82 percent of them are open to leasing. This corresponds with the figures that we've been talking about in terms of oil that is open to leasing and that, in fact, has been leased and that is not currently being used. 
   I would contrast that with the inventiveness of Listening Rock Farm in my district, which is in the town of Amenia, New York. It's, actually, just barely north of my district. It's a renewable tree farm that's making biodiesel from wood waste and is running all their farm vehicles--their tractors and other vehicles and their road vehicles--on biodiesel made from wood waste, which is wood chips, sawdust, leaves, anything that doesn't go into the furniture that they make. 
   I would contrast it with Taylor Biomass, which is a company in Orange  County that is a private corporation but that takes municipal solid waste currently from the Town of Montgomery on a pilot project. They separate out the batteries and the solvents and the Raid and the insecticides and other bad things that you don't want to go into the groundwater or up into the air, and those things get taken away and are dealt with in a responsible way. What is left is gasified and burned to spin a turbine and to put kilowatts out into the grid and, at the same time, to produce ethanol. These are creative solutions to our energy problems that, I think, must be explored. 
   One thing I would share with our friend Mr. King is that we need to look at a wide variety of different kinds of energy around different parts of the country but, in particular, in the northeast where we have a hilly topography. There are many opportunities for small, low-head, hydroelectric power. In New York alone, the Department of Energy's Web site--the Idaho National Laboratory page--lists 4,000-some, low-head hydro sites, meaning small dams and small waterfalls, where, according to them, no lefty, environmental, tree-hugging organization--this is our DOE that we're talking about now--says that if we just put turbines where the water is already falling at these 4,000-some sites of low-head hydro potential that we could generate greater than 1,200 megawatts of power. That's about 60 percent of the output, the full output of the two Indian Point nuclear plants in my district. That's just for contrast. 
   Lastly, I would say that I'm interested that Texas recently passed the State of California as the State with the largest installed wind-power capacity. They have now become the leading wind generation State in the country. The reason, in part, is that Governor George W. Bush, when he was Governor of Texas, signed a renewable energy standard requiring that 10 percent of all electricity in Texas be generated by renewable sources of power.     
   Of course, once the industry knew that that was there, that was a requirement they had to meet, they more than met it, they exceeded it. They had passed California and became the top wind-power electric producer that T. Boone Pickens, one of the original oil tycoons in this country, was quoted recently as saying that he is more excited today about wind power than he ever was about any oil field he ever discovered. 
   The odd part of this picture is that now that George W. Bush is President of the United States, he threatened to veto our energy bill last year if it included a renewable energy standard in it. What was good for Texas, for some reason when he was President, wasn't good for the whole country. 
   Now, I wish that he would revisit that or explain it to us, but I believe that the same thing that was good for Texas would be good for the whole country. It doesn't have to be wind everywhere. It just has to be renewable. Some places will be wind, some places might be low-head hydro, some places might be biofuels, some places might be tidal power or wave power, but all of these things are available. 
   There are test programs and pilot programs that show they are effective. The sooner we start using them, the sooner we can get off this dependence on foreign oil and start to put our economy back to work and create new jobs and the new businesses, new technologies, here at home. 
   I yield back to my friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Well, I have a couple of comments. One is there is a bill that will be, I believe it's already been introduced, but we are going to be talking about more tomorrow called the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act of 2008 introduced by Representatives RAHALL, MARKEY, HINCHEY, EMANUEL and YARMUTH, among others, I am cosponsor as well, as are you, I believe.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (THE FRESHMEN CLASS OF THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. What this will do, it's called, the slang version is the ``Use It or Lose It Act,'' which would compel oil and gas companies to either produce on those 9,700 leases that they have and those 68 million acres of land that they have already leased, either produce or give up those leases that they are stockpiling, and it would do this by barring the companies from obtaining any more leases unless they can demonstrate that they are producing oil and gas or diligently developing the leases they already hold during the initial term of those leases. The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to define what constitutes diligent development. 
   By the way, the backdrop for this, the sort of origin for it, is that back a while in history, coal went through the same kind of speculation, where Federal coal resources were being abused, potential coal exploration areas were being leased by the coal companies, and speculation was driving the price up before that coal was actually developed. 
   Some people think that, and this is people in the financial markets as well as the energy markets believe that a significant portion, maybe as much as 25 percent in the increase in the cost of gasoline is actually speculation, people saying, well, that's a good place to put my money. I guess the stock market is kind of uncertain, and real estate has taken a hit lately. 
   Of course, I am not sure which commodities to invest in, but, oil, that looks like it's always going up. No matter what happens, I think I will put my money into oil. Of course, the more people that do buy oil futures, the more the price of oil goes up on the world market, and the more we wind up paying at the pump. 
   Companies which lease Federal coal resources are, already by law, required to diligently develop those leases. That's the result of this speculation in the past. The requirement has discouraged the rampant speculation that once did exist in the Federal coal leasing program. This same type of speculation now appears to be plaguing the oil and gas leasing program. 
   So under the Use It or Lose It bill, the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act of 2008, oil and gas companies would have to either produce on those leases or give them up. I think that this is in the national interest, I think it's fair, because certainly the application for lease of a particular plot, whether it be onshore or offshore for production of oil or natural gas, implies that that company was intending to develop that resource.     
   And the Department of the Interior has I believe the right and the duty to make sure that our country's natural resources are used for the best and higher good of the people of this country. Not the CEOs or the stockholders of those corporation, but every American citizen, every person in the United States whose future depends on this economy and on the energy choices we make. 
   That's all I wanted to say, but I wanted to ask my friend from New Hampshire, since you have that lovely chart next to you, I wonder if you can comment on the Republican leadership's voting record on legislation that pertains to gas prices.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (BIG OIL DOES NOT NEED MORE LAND TO LEASE TO DRILL DOMESTICALLY--THEY SHOULD USE IT OR LOSE IT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, American families and businesses are indeed reeling from record gas prices, the results of 7 years of missed opportunities and a 19th century energy policy this White House has allowed oil companies to write. President Bush's policy is only working for one group, the oil companies themselves. 
   Rather than looking for new solutions, Washington Republicans say that Big Oil needs access to more land and more water so they can drill for more oil. What my friends across the aisle refuse to acknowledge is that 68 million acres of oil reserves on 10,000 separate leases are already acquired by the oil companies for development and are ready for the drill bit to go into the ground. Permitting has been finished, and the oil companies are holding off. 
   Why are they holding off drilling on these 68 million acres of reserves? If they are really interested in drilling more at home, let's have them do that first before we give them access to the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge or our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. All they need to do is drill is on these 68 million acres they have already acquired. If they don't, I believe they should use it or lose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, in my district, my constituents are complaining and wondering why one day a gas tanker pulls up to a service station and fills a tank underground at the price of that day, and 2 days later the world price of crude oil goes up and the guy at the local gas station goes up on a ladder and changes the numbers, raising the numbers from $4.17 to $4.29, or whatever it is currently in the 19th Congressional District. We are well above $4 for regular. Why is it that gas that is already in the ground goes up on the world price of crude, but when the world price of crude comes down, the price at the pump detaches from it and keeps going up or staying up? 
   They ask me this question, and I ask people down here who supposedly know what they are talking about, and they tell me: Oh, it's a commodity. It fluctuates on the commodity market. 
   Well, I call it the rockets-and-feathers syndrome. The price of gas goes up like a rocket, and it comes down like a feather. And it never seems to deviate from that. While American families are scrimping, oil company profits are soaring. The Big Five's profits jumped a whooping $37 billion this quarter. 
   After the Bush administration's drill first and ask questions later policy has padded oil profits on the backs of working families, it is time for us here to look out for American drivers. 
   The Federal Energy Price Gouging Prevention Act, which I strongly support, will give the government the authority to investigate and punish anyone who takes advantage of consumers by running up energy costs with a steep fine and jail time. 
   After Hurricane Katrina, the FTC found 23 percent of refineries, 9 percent of wholesalers, and 23 percent of retailers had price spikes that could not be explained by increased costs or market trends. 
   We need to be aggressively vigilant to ensure that none of that behavior is going on and consumers are protected. President Bush threatened to veto this bill the last time Congress tried to take this action. I hope that this time he and his allies will for once choose to stand with the American driver and against Big Oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (VETERANS DISABILITY BENEFITS CLAIMS MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Chairman Filner. 
   While we celebrated Independence Day this month, many Americans were unaware that immediately after the Continental Congress signed the Declaration of Independence, it ratified the Military Pension Law of 1776 thereby creating the first Federal disability compensation program. 
   There should be no doubt that the United States has a proud tradition of providing benefits and services to our current population of 24 million veterans, more than 2.7 million of whom receive compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs, a department full of committed, well-intended, and skilled people who nonetheless are struggling with our current situation. The VA is in dire need of change, and it is time to modernize the disability claims system. 
   I would like to thank Representatives Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Phil Hare of Illinois, Zack Space of Ohio, and Jerry McNerney of California and subcommittee Ranking Member Doug Lamborn of Colorado for contributing to this bill. They, too, have recognized the problems in a system that had a backlog of more than 838,000 claims in 2007, and that unbelievable backlog is projected to surpass 1 million claims in 2009. 
   This escalating backlog means that far too many veterans and survivors wait for months, years, or decades for their claims to be adjudicated. This is a national disgrace and violates our contract with every person who serves in our Armed Forces. 
   In my own district, I see time and again the tragic human toll of these egregious delays. A World War II Navy veteran from Westchester County, Ken MacDonald, tried since 1947 to receive compensation for injuries he suffered not once, but twice on ships that were sunk out from under him. Only last year, 60 years later, with the help of our office, was his claim approved. He received over $100,000 in back pay and a pension for the rest of his life--but think of the decades he suffered, the opportunities he lost. 
   We have thousands of veterans coming home injured from Iraq and Afghanistan. We have Vietnam veterans whose claims have never been fully resolved. It is a disgrace for our Nation to allow them to suffer and face financial hardship and health care problems when the VA should process and accept their legitimate claims promptly. 
   Families suffer also. In June, a news story broke of Wayne Kirtley, a 54-year-old veteran who was misdiagnosed twice by the VA, resulting in his premature death. When he filed a claim against the VA, it was denied. Eight months later, the veteran died while his appeal was pending. Under current law, the claim dies with the veteran. Kirtley was worried about his wife, Helen, and wanted to ensure that she would be taken care of with VA benefits. But that has not yet happened. H.R. 5892 would allow Helen to continue her husband's claim with the VA and submit additional evidence which she currently cannot do. 
   Recent commissions and task forces, the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, the Commission on the Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, and the Government Accountability Office have documented problems at the VBA. Over the last 18 months, my subcommittee has held extensive hearings in Washington and in Goshen, New York, to hear the testimony of veterans themselves and of the Veterans Service Organizations.     
   I have incorporated many of their suggestions into H.R. 5892. The bill proposes to overhaul the VA disability benefit system so that veterans and survivors can receive the benefits they have earned easily and quickly. Here is what the bill will change: 
   In today's VA, a veteran's claim is often held up until every medical condition is evaluated, the average wait being over 6 months. Under this bill, a severe, undisputed injury, such as a lost leg or arm, will be compensated  immediately. Lesser injuries that take more time to evaluate will be handled separately. Today's VA claims processing system is labor-intensive and paper-based with the loss of paper files being a major cause of delays. This bill brings the VA into the 21st century by requiring the use of modern information technology. 
   The VA also relies on outdated medical concepts and on an archaic rating schedule. This bill updates the definitions of diseases and disorders to bring them in line with current medical knowledge, and it takes a comprehensive approach to disability ratings, including factors such as the loss of quality of life and of future earnings capacity. 
   It is hard to believe, but today, when a veteran dies while his or her claim is being considered, the surviving wife or child has to start all over again at square one even if that claim has been stuck in the backlog for years. This bill allows the spouse or child to step into the shoes of the veteran while the claim continues, saving them months or years of frustration and of waiting. 
   This bill recognizes the rights and needs of family members by establishing a new unit called the Survivors Office. The VA has always proclaimed as part of its mission caring for the widows and for the orphans of veterans, but it has never had an office specifically focused on them. 
   Finally, another title of the bill deals with the United States Court of Appeals for veterans' claims. My hope is that we can eliminate the hamster wheel effect that bounces veterans back and forth between different levels of the appeals process, reducing today's unacceptable backlog of cases. 
   A nimble, quick, responsive VA claims system could go a long way to helping our Nation live up to its commitment to care for wounded veterans and their families. It could help prevent suicides, bankruptcies, poverty, family disruptions, and homelessness among our Nation's disabled veterans. 
   We can and must change the way Washington handles the claims of our injured veterans. We must give them easier access to the benefits they have earned and end forever the adversarial, inefficient and frustrating claims process they are now forced to endure. I believe H.R. 5892 puts the VA on a new course for the 21st century, giving them the resources and new approaches to make better, faster decisions, to achieve more accurate ratings and to treat all veterans and their families fairly and with respect. I urge all of your support.

   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, today this House is again going to consider legislation that would heed the  will of the American people by changing course in Iraq and paving the way for responsible redeployment of our troops. 
   Although the President claims that he is interested in cooperation with Congress, his most recent veto threat shows that to him cooperation still means, ``I'm the decider, you will do what I say.'' Well, the American people feel differently. The President is going to have to acknowledge that his course in Iraq is the wrong course, and that it is time to abandon this approach and work with Congress. 
   The bill we are considering today funds our troops, enhances our ability to go after al Qaeda and ensures benchmarks for the Iraqi Government that will ensure we are not on a road to nowhere in Iraq. 
   This bill sets the stage for responsible winding down of our military involvement in Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the President to sign it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment that the House has once again been forced to consider legislation to rescue some of America's most important and renowned companies. I regret the need to cast this vote, but I believe voting for this legislation is the better choice. 
   Congress cannot allow the Big Three automakers to go out of business. They are too important to our economy and our national security. In my district alone there are more than 3,000 jobs directly dependent on the auto industry, accounting for salaries of more than $150 million annually. The industry is a significant contributor to the tax base of New York State, which is already facing severe financial turmoil. 
   Beyond its economic importance, maintaining a successful domestic automobile industry is vital for the long term interests of the United States. There are certain industries which we must maintain domestically for national security reasons. During World War II, the automobile industry led the way in the conversion to a war economy by altering their manufacturing plants to make armored vehicles and tanks instead of cars and trucks. Few companies still maintain that capacity, and so for that reason alone we cannot let the industry fail. 
   We need to help the auto industry, but I do not believe we should be giving a blank check to anyone. That is why I appreciate the work this Congress has done to make the legislation tolerable. This is not a give away. We are voting on a loan which I expect to be paid back, and paid back with interest. It has protections for the taxpayers. As long as the loan remains outstanding, no dividends can be paid, no executive bonuses or golden parachutes can be issued and the government will receive warrants for equity value equivalent to part of the value of the loan. In addition, this loan takes legal priority over every other debt and obligation the companies face. 
   I am disappointed about provisions that this bill does not contain. I recognize that the presidentially appointed overseer will have a great deal of power to force specific changes in the way our Nation's auto industry does business, but I would have preferred to see many of these changes specifically tied to the loans by this legislation. For example, in their presentations last week, the CEOs of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler claimed that with these loans they will be able to meet and even exceed the increased CAFE standards Congress finally mandated last year. I believe that they should be required to do so by the legislation. It is critical that, over the coming months, Congress exercises the necessary oversight to make sure that the Big Three keep their word. 
   I would have liked to see clear goals that required a set percentage of products produced by the auto companies to be high-efficiency vehicles. I would have liked to see a commitment from the automakers to make hybrid technology options more prevalent and available more often. I would like to see more substantial investment made into research and development for new, greener, energy-efficient technology. Perhaps most importantly, I would have liked to see a guarantee of true reform, starting from the top, in how these companies do business and the kinds of cars they produce and sell. Taxpayer-supported companies cannot be allowed to continue the sort of ill-advised business decisions the industry has been making the last few years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that today will be the first step towards the beginning of a new era for U.S. automakers. Congress is doing what we must, stepping in and saving the manufacturers, but we are not doing so without a commitment for genuine and long lasting reform on their part.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I have consistently supported modernizing the existing FISA law to give our Government the tools it needs to identify and defeat terrorists in today's high-tech world, while at the same time preserving the freedoms and rights that define America. I have voted three times to pass legislation that would strengthen and modernize FISA and reaffirm the rule of law. Despite some improvements over previous attempts to update FISA, the bill considered by the House today regrettably falls short of achieving that critical balance. The rule of law lies at the core of America's founding principles, and the language in this bill was too weak to ensue that any breach of our laws that may have occurred under the warrantless wiretapping program will be fully addressed. It is not appropriate to deny Americans the right to pursue these matters in court, or to short-circuit the judicial review that lies at the heart of our system of checks and balances, which is the bedrock of our Constitution. Accordingly, I voted against this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. I thank my colleague. 
   Madam Speaker, the last few months has certainly seen severe damage done to our economy and have left many Americans battered. As a parent, I wonder how many other people have had the experience that I have had of watching my daughter when she was in high school getting credit card offers from banks, or when she was in college, with me and my wife paying for her expenses, getting credit card offers from banks, and wondering how many college students or young adults are taking those offers and not realizing the interest rates that come with them? 
   Signs of economic turmoil are multiplying, and I don't think anyone doubts that we are either in or headed for a recession. Some academic economists may quibble over the technical terms, but the bottom line is that our economy is headed in the wrong direction, and for many Americans, tough times are either here or lie ahead. 
   Stock markets around the world have behaved as if they are a roller coaster, alternating huge increases and dramatic declines. Wall Street traders don't seem to know what to make of each contradictory economic indicator. As a musician and songwriter, and now a Member of Congress, I have had hedge fund traders and stock market advisers and financial experts come to me and say, what do you think is going to happen, and that is a sign I think of the confusion and the general uncertainty that we see in the market. 
   While the cost of everyday expenses like food and fuel continue to rise, most people have seen their wages stagnate. People in my district make little more than they did a decade ago, yet their costs continue to rise dramatically. 
   People I represent in the Hudson Valley have been particularly hard hit. Oil has long passed the $100 a barrel mark, making it more expensive than ever for people to heat their homes and drive their cars. In suburban communities in the Northeast, like the area I represent, home heating bills increased more than 30 percent just between last winter and this winter. 
   While personal debt has skyrocketed to a record level, investment for the future has become all but nonexistent. As a result, families struggle to pay their everyday costs, more people have made incalculable personal sacrifices, lost their homes, and went hungry. As necessities become outrageously expensive and more and more employers are moving overseas to take advantage of the cheap labor and complacent regulations in places like India and China, as always, it is the American families who pay the price. 
   Ultimately I believe these troubles are a direct result of President Bush's disastrous economic policies. After years of the President and his enablers in the previous Republican Congress mismanaging the economy, more Americans are looking for work than ever before, the 
   housing crisis has caused millions of Americans to risk losing their homes, and the price of gas has hit an all-time high. Clearly it is up to this Congress to act soon and act decisively. If we do not, it may well take years for the country to recover from the last 7 years. 
   I am proud that this Congress has already begun to take steps to do what we need to do. First we enacted the 2008 Economic Stimulus Package, which provided tax rebates for most Americans to go out and spend, and raised the loan limits for mortgages backed by FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to make it easier to get a mortgage with better terms. Both of these measures have already begun to help. 
   But I hope none of us are naive enough to think that that alone will be enough. We still have a lot more work to be done, specifically targeting working and middle-class families, the true lifeblood of our Nation's success. Relief for these people will only come from a clear commitment to increasing assistance for unemployment insurance, food stamps, Federal Medical Assistance Percentage payments and Federal housing programs. 
   I am proud of the steps we have taken here in the House, but I know we have much farther to go. As you say, my friend, Congressman Hodes, we need to not only pass these progressive and family oriented middle-class steps in the House, we need to persuade our friends in the Senate to approve them as well and then persuade the President to sign them. I hope together we can do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, in a move that defies logic, President Bush made the mistake of vetoing the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, contradicting an explicit pledge he made during the 2004 campaign to ``lead an aggressive effort to make sure uninsured children receive health coverage, guaranteeing them a healthy start in life.'' Instead of living up to that promise, he is denying millions of children access to high quality, affordable health care. 
   CHIP is a vital program for both the Nation and the State of New York. Since 1997, it has proven to be a popular, successful program, covering 6.6 million children nationwide, and helping to reduce the number of uninsured children in my State of New York by 40 percent. The bill he vetoed would help 268,000 more of New York's kids. 
   The President has said that children don't need health care; all they need to do when they get sick is go to an emergency room. I am not sure if that comment was uninformed and irresponsible or simply callous, but I think that parents of New York would like to see the veto overridden.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Rising drug prices have created an escalating crisis for seniors in my home in the 19th District of New York in the Hudson Valley and the rest of the country. This passage of H.R. 4 will represent another promise kept in our 100 hours with which we begin the 110th Congress. 
   When the House passed the bill creating the Medicare drug benefit in the dead of night, it took the audacious step of prohibiting Medicare from negotiating for the best price. It is unconscionable that a government agency serving 43 million seniors was not given the same consumer rights as other agencies and private companies. The drug companies have reaped record profits, the taxpayers have been shortchanged, and seniors have been forced to break the bank to pay for drugs. 
   Today we are moving to change that. Most importantly, we will make sure that our seniors, not the drug companies, get the best deal.

It's unconscionable that a government agency serving 43 million seniors wasn't given the same consumer rights as other agencies and private companies. 
   In 2005, a Families USA study found that the median drug price under Part D was 48 percent higher than the price negotiated by the VA. More recently, the same group found the price spread had grown to 58 percent. 
   When there was a crisis created by the anthrax attacks in 2001, HHS negotiated for lower prices for Cipro. There's an ongoing crisis now for seniors trying to cope with skyrocketing drug prices, and HHS should use its negotiating skill to come to their aid. 
   The drug companies have reaped record profits, the taxpayers have been short-changed, and seniors have been forced to break the bank to pay for drugs. Today, we're moving to change that. 
   Directing HHS to negotiate for lower prices will make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to afford the life-saving and life-improving drugs they need. It will save billions of taxpayer dollars. And most importantly, it will make sure that seniors, not the drug companies, get the best deal. 
   The Medicare drug benefit was supposed to offer seniors the promise of affordable drugs that would help them enter their golden years with fewer worries. For too many seniors it turned into a dire financial predicament. I'm proud to be a supporter of legislation that will help us finally keep our original promise.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (TIME TO END THE MISTAKEN WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, a recent CRS report shows that the United States is now spending $10 billion a month fighting the war in Iraq. That is over $2.5 billion a week. And what does the American taxpayer get for this $10 billion a month? An army, nearly broken by repeated deployments; a National Guard that is unwilling and unable to respond to natural disasters or terrorist attacks at home because many of our men and women are in Iraq and most of their equipment is; an escalation in Iraq that has resulted in more death and little reduction in violence; an Iraqi government that is unable to govern; Iraqi Security Forces that refuse to fully stand up. 
   The war in Iraq costs every man, woman and child in New York's Nineteenth District $3,077. For over $3,000 a person, the people of my district have gotten a war that was a strategic mistake and has made them less safe. 
   Today, the House of Representatives considered another bill for a responsible withdrawal from the war in Iraq. The Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act requires U.S. troops to redeploy from Iraq by April 1, 2008. After 4 years of repeated failure and little accountability, the new Congress is working to repair the damage done to our military and change the direction of this country. 
   When the President came to Congress to ask for additional funding for the war in Iraq, I established a guiding principle for determining my vote. Any legislation I voted for would have to contain a responsible specific timeline to redeploy U.S. troops out of Iraq. Furthermore, the bill would have to contain benchmarks that would hold the Iraqi government accountable. 
   Following this principle, I voted four times in 5 months to provide nearly $100 billion for extra military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, including extra money to improve our fight against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. These bills also required the Iraqi parliament to meet specific benchmarks to reduce violence and limit sectarian violence. Further, they required the President to follow troop readiness standards established by our own Pentagon. Unfortunately, the President ignored the will of the American people and vetoed the first bill that Congress sent him. 
   The President blindly insists that America continue down the same path in Iraq. The President's path has left our troops in the middle of Iraq's civil war, weakened U.S. national security, and is devastating our military's ability to fight. 
   The President refuses to listen to his own State Department's report showing that the Taliban is reemerging as a dominant force in Afghanistan, dramatized by the most recent disheartening sight of young girls being machine-gunned as they left their school, a tactic that is used to try to intimidate parents into not sending their girls to school. 
   Our men and women in uniform in both Iraq and Afghanistan have performed bravely and worked to achieve every mission their leadership has given them. Our troops have performed heroically in Iraq. But the administration concedes that violence remains high; that the Iraqi government has failed to meet the benchmarks endorsed by the President in January; that political reconciliation is nonexistent. 
   Finally, after years of silence, even President Bush's allies have realized that the current path in Iraq cannot be sustained. Senator Domenici says, ``There is no reason to wait. I am trying to tell the President that he must change his ways because there is nothing positive happening.'' And Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER said, ``The President needs a new strategy.'' 
   It is time our troops had leadership worthy of their service, leadership that will give them achievable missions that improve the security of the American people. 
   That is why I supported the Responsible Redeployment From Iraq Act that requires that the President publicly justify the number of troops he needs to carry out post-redeployment missions such as protecting embassy staff, force protection, and fighting international terrorist organizations in Iraq. It is time the American people saw a change in our course.  
   In the time it has taken me to give this speech, we have spent another roughly $1 million in Iraq. $1 million for every 5 minutes we spend in Iraq, for a war that has made us less safe and has weakened our military. 
   It is time to change our course in Iraq and refocus on the threats in Afghanistan, where the 9/11 attacks were planned and the al Qaeda and the Taliban continue to plot. It is time we end our mistaken war in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chairman and rise to offer an amendment to help farmers in regions across the country simultaneously meet the goals of continued production and environmental protection. 
   My amendment would establish a Conservation on Muck Soils program that would provide conservation assistance tailored to the specific needs of farmers who grow crops on what is known as muck soil. 
   In politics I know we hear a lot about wallowing in the partisan muck or muckraking, but I'm sure that some of my colleagues are scratching their heads and asking, ``What exactly is muck soil?'' Well, muck is a special type of dirt that develops a thick organic layer of topsoil that is highly vulnerable to erosion when the lands are exposed to air. It's extremely fertile, loose soil in which farmers grow crops like onions, potatoes, lettuce, celery, and other specialty crops. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very supportive of the conservation programs administered by the USDA. They make an important contribution by making it economically feasible for farmers to manage their land while being environmentally responsible. In States like my home of New York, they are critical to making sure that farmers aren't penalized for doing the right thing. I'm extremely pleased by the increases in conservation program levels under this bill, and I'm sure that they'll make these programs more accessible and effective. 
   However, they are broad programs built to accommodate a wide array of conditions. Because of muck's special characteristics, existing conservation programs don't necessarily provide support to growers on these lands in the most efficient, effective way possible. My amendment would attempt to acknowledge the nature of this soil with a tailored approach that improves on the current application of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. 
   The CREP program is a good program. It attempts to further the important goals of preventing soil erosion and protecting water quality through a voluntary retirement program. In order to obtain conservation payments, the CREP program requires farmers to enter into 10-15 year agreements to remove qualifying land from agricultural production.  
   As I said, this is a good program but it does not always present an adequate conservation solution, particularly for farmers who want to prevent soil erosion or runoff pollution without foregoing production. 
   At times, this aspect of the program has created unintended consequences, including the retirement of specialized, productive soil from farming and a lack of land maintenance leading to weed and pest threats on neighboring lands. 
   My amendment would address these concerns and help muck soil farmers remain viable by providing support for conservation activities on working lands. 
   In addition to being actively involved in farming on muck soil, in order to qualify farmers would have to have a spring cover crop planted with the primary crop to prevent soil erosion, maintain a winter cover crop to prevent off season soil loss, have surrounding ditch banks seeded with grass on a year round basis to stave off runoff and erosion. 
   These are practices specifically designed to prevent erosion, runoff, and water pollution. By doing so, it would not force farmers to make the choice between conservation and cultivation. 
   Mr. Chairman, the COMS program would provide a unique opportunity to support active farmers and protect the environment. That's why it has been endorsed by the New York Farm Bureau and the National Farmers Union. I urge support for the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the other members of my freshman class to support this important resolution. My election and those of my fellow freshman colleagues were an unmistakable signal from the American people. They believe the President's path in Iraq is wrong and they want new voices to produce change. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am one of those voices, and today I rise to speak with the American people to oppose the President's escalation. 
   The United States requires a new path in Iraq, a path that will deploy our troops out of Iraq; a path that will force the Iraqi Government to plan for its own defense; a path that will engage countries throughout the region and around the world to help stabilize and protect Iraq; and a path that will allow the United States military to rebuild and refocus on the important mission of destroying al Qaeda and defending America from the threat of international terrorism. 
   Sadly, the escalation proposed by the President does none of these things. The President's plan continues down the same path we have traveled for the last 4 years. These years have taught us that U.S. military power alone is not sufficient to stabilize Iraq, yet it is the only tool this President employs. 
   From the outset, this administration has been wrong. The administration led us into a war with flawed intelligence. That is one wrong. The administration  went to war without a plan to win the peace. Two wrongs. This administration chose to protect Iraqi oil fields before securing the ammunition dumps throughout the country. Three wrongs. This administration sent our troops into harm's way without enough body armor or armored vehicles. Four wrongs. This administration gave no-bid contracts to its friends and political allies. That is five wrongs.     
   Years ago now, President Bush stood on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln before a banner declaring mission accomplished and said, ``Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.'' That is six wrongs. 
   Now, this administration wants us to blindly place our faith and the lives of 20,000 more of our troops in an Iraqi Government that has failed to meet every security obligation it has pledged. Sadly, once again, this President is wrong, and no amount of wrongs is going to make the President's policy towards Iraq right. 
   It is time for a new kind of escalation on the diplomatic front. A stable Iraq is in the United States' interests and in the interests of Iraq's neighbors. However, the President has done next to nothing to gain the assistance of regional partners. 
   Inside Iraq, the government must meet its promises to reach out beyond its base of support and unite the Iraqi people. Sending more troops into Iraq does nothing to push the Iraqi Government towards greater self-reliance. At a time when it is incumbent upon the Iraqi Government to step up and do more, why should we give them the opportunity to do less? 
   This resolution is an important first step that voices loud and clear the message America sent last November, and it puts the President on notice that the Congress will no longer stand by and allow him to recklessly endanger American lives and security. If the President refuses to change course, this Congress will be forced to act. 
   We will no longer allow him to send underequipped and underprepared units into combat. We will demand appropriate accounting standards and no longer allow billions of taxpayer dollars to disappear unaccounted for into the rabbit hole of Iraq. And we must not let our National Guard continue to be decimated by repeated and extended activation. 
   I recently met a young man from my district who has been accepted at West Point and who will soon serve as a future leader in the United States Army. I want to ensure that when he graduates from West Point and accepts his commission, the Army he joins will not be decimated by the mistakes in Iraq. 
   I also want to talk about the veterans of this war and the unique challenges they will face. I am proud and honored to be on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I am proud that one of my first votes in Congress was to provide an increase in VA health care funding. 
   Currently, there is a backlog of nearly 600,000 pending veterans claims at the VA. We must reduce this number so that all veterans can be better served. We must provide funding to better diagnose and treat post-traumatic stress disorder. I am appalled that during this time of war the administration would cut funding for research on prosthetic technologies that will let our wounded veterans lead more normal lives. 
   My district is the home of West Point Military Academy and, as such, has a unique perspective on the war. The leaders that emerge from the halls of that institution are an invaluable resource for our Nation. Sadly, we have lost over 50 West Point graduates in Iraq and others in the services and throughout my district. 
   My brother-in-law is a lieutenant colonel who works at West Point. My nephew is a cadet. The courage, devotion and conscientiousness of the men and women of the United States Military Academy embody the best of America. 
   In the words of the sheriff of Putnam County, a retired brigadier general, one should never send our Armed Forces to do a job which is not militarily achievable. 
   I support this resolution

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I rise today in strong support of this bill, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act. I am so pleased that the needs of our returning soldiers are finally being recognized and that Congress is finally taking action. 
   While this is no panacea and much still needs to be done to fully care for our soldiers, namely to make wartime service in the theater of combat a presumption for post traumatic stress disorder which I have submitted that concept in independent legislation, I am glad to see that mental health is beginning to gain the recognition and the treatment it deserves. 
   There is no greater time for this recognition than right now. The Rand Corporation did studies showing that approximately 20 to 30 percent of our military servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are showing symptoms of PTSD or depression. Longer and more frequent deployments are placing increased stresses on our military families and are taking a very real toll. Substance abuse and suicides are up, and coupled with our current financial hardships, our returning brave men and women and their families are facing incredibly difficult times. 
   I am very grateful for all the work of the members of the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees and for the leadership of Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for pushing through this legislation. 
   Just to name a few of the provisions of the bill, it will utilize the Internet to provide education, outreach and treatment for substance abuse, PTSD or other ailments soldiers are facing; a review and update of all the VA's mental health facilities by the Inspector General; an additional pilot program providing peer outreach, peer support, readjustment and mental health services to veterans through contracts with community mental health centers; it increases funds for mental health research; and it provides marriage and family counseling within authorized mental health services and also bolsters family outreach programs. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill and provide the returning men and women of our Armed Forces who have sacrificed so much for our Nation with the treatment and the respect that they deserve.

   Mr. HALL of New York. I did fine, and they did great. You can imagine in a kayak where it is arms and upper body, they can go where they want to go very fast; faster than I can. It is incredibly therapeutic. It wasn't not Olympic competition, but it is a perfect example of what you were talking about in terms of the therapeutic value of that program. 
   I am honored to be here with my distinguished colleagues in the House supporting Senate bill S. 3023, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. And I am especially grateful that it contains all of the provisions from our Veterans' Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act which I and other members of the subcommittee, including the ranking member, Congressman Lamborn, worked incredibly hard on in the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs. 
   The bill really grew from the testimony of VSOs, individual veterans, employees of the VA, various stakeholders on these issues who came for a year to hearings and round tables and brought us their ideas. I would like to thank all of them for their contribution. 
   At the end of July I was told that the backlog of claims had reached 838,000 which is a shameful situation for our country which has so much technological and medical capability and capacity, to not be able to keep up with the combination of returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at the same time there is the maturing of our Vietnam veterans. And we still have vets from other conflicts who are coming in for care at the same time. 
   The backlog was predicted to reach a million cases by next year if we didn't do this, and so I am happy we are moving forward and not letting that happen. This Congress has done, in a week in which we had the financial disaster dropped in our lap, and I was afraid that this might all get put on the back burner, I am pleased that the staff worked as hard as they did, both House and Senate staff, full committee and subcommittee staff, and I think it is the right thing to do, not to make our  veterans wait for another 6 months because we are going to a new Congress and we have to resubmit the whole thing. 
   Today's VA claims processing system is labor-intensive and paper based. It relies on an archaic rating schedule and outdated medical concepts, practices that have been allowed to continue for too long unchecked and unaddressed. Too many opportunities for change have been missed, too many reports after reports have been shelved to collect dust. 
   This bill will comprehensively repair the VA disability benefits' system so that veterans and their survivors can receive accurate and timely assistance. The VA schedule by which veterans are rated for their disabilities needs to adhere to more modern medical practices and disability concepts, and should consider such factors as quality of life and earnings capacity. 
   VA management issues need to be addressed and inefficiencies corrected to enhance quality and performance. S. 3023 outlines procedures so veterans can expedite their claims when they have included all of the available evidence. It also codifies the VA's ability to render temporary ratings for undisputed, disabling severe injuries or illnesses. 
   Furthermore, the information technology enhancements in the bill require the VA to institute electronic systems and computer softwares that are commonplace in other aspects of our society. And I compliment Ranking Member Lamborn for his consistent advocacy of that portion in particular of this bill. 
   Veterans should benefit from the modern technological age that we live in, and an environmentally friendly, paperless process that can award claims in real-time, allow two offices that specialize in different aspects of the medical claims to be looking at the information at the same time. 
   Applying for VA benefits should be as easy as online banking, and that is what we are aiming to make it. 
   This bill also calls upon the VA to create a survivors' office. Although the VA's motto is ``to care for widows and orphans,'' it has never lived up to that visionary idealism of President Lincoln. That omission is rectified in this bill, especially important while so many military members are giving their lives in service to this country and leaving behind their beloved families. 
   In another measure to support survivors, the bill allows for the survivor to become the claimant when the veteran dies so that the pending claim can be adjudicated. It is a travesty that so many veterans die worried that they will be unable to provide for their families. Widows and dependent children are left aggrieved and abandoned by the country their spouses faithfully served just at the time when they are concerned about so many other adjustments being made in their lives and that their grief is still being processed at the same time. 
   A properly operating benefits system could prevent the ills that might befall a veteran. We must fight against suicide, divorce, bankruptcy, stigma, poverty and homelessness among our Nation's disabled veterans by providing to them the quality of life needs, providing them with parity among their peers, and elimination of stress they encounter in an adversarial and confusing claims processing system. 
   I envision S. 3023 as putting the VA on a 21st century track to lead the way to decisions that are made quickly and correctly. We must treat our Nation's veterans and their families with the dignity and respect that they deserve while restoring their faith in us. We must end the turmoil, alienation and injustice that they feel when they file a claim for their earned VA benefits by acting now. 
   I urge all Members to support this bill. I thank both Ranking Member Buyer and Chairman Filner.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of New York. (HUDSON-FULTON-CHAMPLAIN QUADRICENTENNIAL COMMEMORATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Act of 2007, which will simultaneously pay homage to the history of New York's Hudson Valley while helping to build a vibrant future for the region. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Hinchey, for his leadership in drafting and introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Hudson Valley has been a cradle of prosperity and a driver of growth and exploration in America since long before there was a United States of America. The character of the region, and the history of the nation, was strongly shaped by two separate voyages that occurred almost 400 years ago. 
   In July of 1609, the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, having already founded the settlement of Quebec, arrived with a group of Native Americans at what would eventually be known as Lake Champlain. This expedition would lay the groundwork for the settlement of the Champlain valley by French colonists in the ``New World''. 
   The next month, Henry Hudson would begin the voyage aboard that Half Moon that would bring him into New York under the Dutch flag. His efforts to find a sea route to Asia on behalf of the Dutch East India Company travels would eventually take him up what is now the Hudson River almost to Albany. Hudson was to be the first European explorer to navigate and note the full length of the Hudson River, and along the way he noted the region's inherent beauty and engaged in trade with Native Americans. 
   By laying the groundwork for settlement and commerce in the region, these voyages would help establish a corridor for trade that helped to drive the prosperity of the ``New World'' and continues to be an economic engine of America. 
   Two centuries after those fateful journeys, the region was once again home to a breakthrough that would transform commerce and transportation throughout the continent. On August 17, 1807 Robert Fulton successfully sailed his steamboat from New York City to Albany in the first long-distance trip of such a vessel. This 32-hour long trip opened the gateway to a new means of trade and transportation. 
   The Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Act of 2007 will make sure that these events, and their contribution to the greatness of our nation, will be appropriately honored. By establishing the Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission the Hudson-Fulton 400th Commemoration Commission to plan and execute commemorative activities in the region, the bill honors the storied past of the Hudson Valley, will bring increased prosperity to the region, and perhaps open the door to the Corridor's next great adventure.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.
