<DOCNO>Mr. SALAZAR. (TRIBUTE TO THE LATE USMC SERGEANT CLINTON W. AHLQUIST -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor United States Marine Corps Sergeant Clinton W. Ahlquist of Creede, Colorado, who was killed in the line of duty while serving his country honorably in Iraq. 
   Sergeant Ahlquist wore his Nation's uniform proudly, and we should all pay tribute to this brave and courageous young man. 
   Every day our men and women in uniform willingly face unknown dangers as part of the effort to promote peace and democracy throughout the world. Their individual stories of honor and courage must not be forgotten. 
   Clinton Ahlquist moved to Creede, Colorado, during his freshman year of high school. Clinton touched countless lives during his 3 years at Creede High School. 
   Ahlquist was killed in Ar Ramadi, Iraq on Tuesday, February 20, 2007, by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a Medivac helicopter. He was 20 years old. 
   My heart goes out to Clinton's family and friends and those whose lives he touched throughout his service to our country. I am humbled by their strength and perseverance in the face of such hardship. 
   Sergeant Ahlquist died performing noble deeds, serving and protecting his fellow countrymen. Clinton and his family and friends have exhibited a rare form of selflessness and courage. 
   Madam Speaker, I submit this recognition to the United States House of Representatives in honor of their sacrifice so that Clinton W. Ahlquist may live on in memory.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALAZAR. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, the administration has turned a projected 10-year, $5.6 billion surplus into a nearly $3 trillion deficit. Over the past 6 years, America's debt has climbed 50 percent to more than $28,000 per person. It is so bad that this administration has borrowed more money from foreign nations than all previous 42 U.S. Presidents combined. That is the fiscal mess that we inherit from the 109th Congress. 
   We believe it is time that we finally get our fiscal house in order. Today, we will restore the pay-as-you-go rules that were instrumental to the budget surpluses we experienced in the early 1990s. Pay-as-you-go budgeting with no new deficit spending is a key first step. This will reverse the budget deficits that are currently passing billions of dollars in debt to our children and our grandchildren. 
   It was wrong to eliminate pay-as-you-go in 2002. We need to begin to treat our Federal budget in the way that working families treat their budgets, and pay-as-you-go is a good first step. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that this House can act in a bipartisan fashion to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALAZAR. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding, and I would like to recognize him as a real leader in our rail transportation system. Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Mica and our Ranking Member Shuster, I want to thank you for your exceptional work and leadership on this important bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 and urge swift passage on this measure. 
   H.R. 6003 is long overdue, and it has been nearly 11 years since Congress has authorized funding for Amtrak. And without sufficient funds, Amtrak has  been forced to operate with its hands tied. Maintenance and legacy projects have been delayed, and salaries have been frozen, and infrastructure has been deteriorating. 
   Improving our passenger rail system is critical. It will mean better service reliability, reduced trip times, added capacity, and less congested highways. 
   I am also pleased that this bill addresses high-speed rail. A number of us had the opportunity to travel with Chairman DeFazio and Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Mica to Europe several months ago, where we saw the advancements that have been made in various modes of transportation, notably high-speed rail. I think it is unacceptable that this country is so far behind other countries in this area. 
   We also saw how public and private partnerships work to be successful. Given the current budget constraints, we need to keep all funding options on the table, including these partnerships. 
   H.R. 6003 is a good bill that will allow for necessary improvements to be made to our Nation's transportation network. Hopefully, some day, we can have a high-speed rail system that will connect Denver to Grand Junction and all the ski areas in between. It will connect Fort Collins, the Pueblo, along the front range of Colorado. 
   I carefully support this beautiful piece of bipartisan legislation, and Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for your strong leadership. I am proud to be a member of this bipartisan committee that works to improve America's transportation problems.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALAZAR. (TULE RIVER TRIBE WATER DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman, and I want to thank Chairwoman Napolitano for all of her hard work on many of the water bills that are before us today. I also want to thank Congressman Nunes and Congressman Costa from California. Being rural water Members, they understand the importance of water to rural America. 
   Today I would like to speak on H.R. 3437, the Jackson Gulch Rehabilitation Act of 2008. I introduced this bill after hearing from my constituents in Mancos, Colorado, including Gary Kennedy, who is the superintendent of the Mancos Water Conservancy District. Gary told me about how every spring as the snow melts he is terrified that they are going to have a catastrophic failure in the system. And it is only a matter of time. 
   The Jackson Gulch project is critical to southwest Colorado and has stored and delivered water for domestic, agriculture and recreational uses for over 50 years. 
   The Jackson Gulch Reservoir supplies water to the town of Mancos and the Mancos Rural Water Company. Many of my constituents in the area depend on the agricultural land to make a living. They cannot afford to lose their water supply. 
   Also of critical importance, Jackson Gulch is the sole supplier of municipal water for the Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde National Park was founded in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt and is one of our Nation's most treasured archeological sites. Almost 600,000 Americans each year enjoy Mesa Verde National Park and rely on the water of the park that they receive from Jackson Gulch. 
   This bill is critical to extend the life of Jackson Gulch Project. The project was authorized in 1939, and construction of the project was completed in 1949. Over the past 60 years, the canals and facilities have exceeded their life expectancy and are in dire need of repair. 
   Congress is faced with a simple decision: Tackle the problem of rehabilitation for $8 million today or wait for a catastrophic failure and face a $30 million price tag for replacement tomorrow. Without action, it's only a matter of time before we have a major failure  and cut off water to Mesa Verde National Park and Coloradans in the southwest. 
   The most dangerous period is during the spring snow melt when Jackson Gulch Reservoir is being filled. If anything happens during that time, my farmers, the town of Mancos, and the Mesa Verde National Park will be out of business. The estimated cost to rehabilitate the canal system is less than one-third of the cost of replacement. 
   I urge my colleagues to help us address this important issue for southwest Colorado. There are approximately 300, 350 families living in the town of Mancos and 100 more living in Mancos Valley. The median income in Mancos is only $25,000. Yet in their desperate need for water, they have agreed to pay for 35 percent of the cost. They know this will stretch their budgets, but they are also willing to do their part. Now Congress should do its part and pass this critical bill. 
   I want to thank the chairwoman; I want to thank the Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, yesterday we resumed reading the names of our servicemembers on this House floor that have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this war. To date, 3,188 American servicemembers have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I am greatly saddened today to add the name of Specialist Blake Harris to that list of the fallen soldiers. 
   Specialist Harris was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. 
   Specialist Harris died on Monday, March 5, in Baqubah, Iraq, of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his patrol. 
   Blake Harris was born and raised in Pueblo, Colorado. He was a 2002 graduate of Pueblo South High School. 
   In Pueblo, Blake leaves behind a loving wife, Joanna; a 2-year-old son, Jonah; and his mother, Deborah Harris. He is also survived by his father, John Harris of Denver. 
   Madam Speaker, I extend my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to his family and friends who have suffered this loss, and I pray for their comfort and strength in their time of greatest need. 
   Specialist Harris was a proud and courageous soldier whose story must never be forgotten. Blake Harris was 22 years old. 
   Madam Speaker, I submit this recognition to the United States House of Representatives in honor of his sacrifice so that the memory of Blake Harris may live on forever.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Chair, I would like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding me this time. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. I urge swift passage of this matter. 
   Chairman Oberstar, thank you, thank you, thank you for addressing the issues of western America. Over the past 2 years, I have visited with folks from across the Third Congressional District of Colorado. Water is one of the issues that greatly affects every constituent in the arid southwest. My constituents are concerned about their water quality and supply, the aging infrastructure, and are concerned that their health is at risk. 
   Fast-growing rural areas are experiencing trouble with infrastructure demands, especially waste water treatment facilities. With revolving loan money on the decline, small rural communities have been struggling to address major infrastructure needs. This issue crosses lines of environment, health and human safety, growth and economic development. 
   Many of us view H.R. 720 as a long overdue measure to ensure that the Federal Government invests in waste water infrastructure. This legislation will not only ensure that we have undated waste water infrastructures; it will also reduce the burden of construction and maintenance costs on local towns and communities. 
   Now is the time for us to start investing in the infrastructure that will safeguard our water quality for future generations. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you. And thank you for understanding the struggles that rural America has. I don't understand our opposition on the other side and their opposition to prevailing wage and to a livable wage. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support investment in clean water infrastructure and passage of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding, Mr. Gonzalez, and I want to thank your leadership for bringing this very important issue to the forefront. 
   Tonight, I would like to tell the story of Christopher Herrera. Lance Corporal Evenor Christopher Herrera was just 9 years old when his family came to the United States from Honduras in search of opportunity. He found that opportunity for himself in the United States serving in the Marine Corps, which he joined a year after graduating from Gypsum's Eagle Valley High School in Colorado. 
   He figured that enlisting he could pave the way to a better future, or, as he told his family, the 22 year-old would be considered a hero if he should die while serving his adopted country. Fate chose him the latter. On August 10, 2005 while manning a machine gun during a clash near Ar Ramadi in Iraq, an improvised explosive device detonated. Herrera was killed in combat with a month and a half left before he was to return home. 
   From the time his family immigrated from Honduras, he began talking about joining the Army. Christopher, as he was known to his family and friends, was not naive about the dangers he faced in Iraq. His brother, who was also a Marine, said that Christopher was happy to fight for the country that he loved. He would rather die over there as a hero and be remembered as doing something good, as opposed to being here and not remembered at all. 
   His mother, Blanca, said that he joined because he wanted to have more opportunity in this country. He wanted a career in the Marines. The stories about Christopher come easily. His sister recalled about how shy he was, but yet he was fearless, and once drove a 4-wheel-drive vehicle down a muddy hill, nearly flipping it over. Christopher enjoyed typical mountain activities like most young men in Colorado, like fishing and snowboarding. 
   The brothers often went camping. The brothers were close, but because they were both deployed Balmore Herrera hadn't seen his brother in 7 months. When Christopher was killed, Balmore was called to act as official military transport as his brother's body was transported from Maryland to Colorado. 
   There have been 3,396 servicemembers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and over 25,000 Americans wounded. This evening, members of the Hispanic Caucus rise to recognize immigrant servicemembers because these brave men and women didn't have the privilege of being born in this country. They chose to live here, and also made the choice to serve the country they loved in the Armed Forces. 
   Many immigrants, like Christopher, have paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Each of them has a story. Each story is filled with struggle and a hope for opportunity. Like Christopher, each story is also filled with sacrifice.  
   There is an Internet blog set up as a memorial for Lance Corporal Herrera. Whiskey 3, Red 2, left these words for him: 
   ``To my fellow brother Evenor, I had the great privilege of serving with you in the good and the bad times. 
   ``I'll keep fighting the good fight, and one day I'll see you again ..... and together we can guard the gates of heaven as we once guarded each other in Iraq. 
   ``You will never be forgotten.''

   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 5, the designation of Hire a Veteran Week. I encourage the President to issue a proclamation supporting this designation. 
   I would once again like to thank Mr. Holt for offering this resolution and thank the committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Boozman, who has been a strong leader on veterans affairs issues. I am proud to be a member of that committee. 
   As a Member and as a veteran of the United States Army, I understand the important and sometimes difficult adjustments that face our soldiers when they return home from their tour of duty. Securing employment should not be one of those difficult tasks. 
   Many are not aware that the men and women of the United States military have amazing skills that translate perfectly into civilian occupations. Veterans also have the ability to learn new skills and concepts and can enter the workforce with those skills proven in real-world situations. Veterans know what it means to do ``an honest day's work.'' Employers know that they are gaining someone with a track record of integrity. 
   Madam Speaker, we must take care of veterans when they return home. We value the commitment that veterans have shown to this great country. We value what veterans have learned from their military experience. Together, we can use that experience to continue our country's prosperity and the individual prosperity of our service men and women. There is no better way to send this message than by hiring a veteran. 
   I would like to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Chairman, l would like to recognize Chairman Oberstar and Chairman DeFazio for their exceptional leadership on this critical transportation issue. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 6052, the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008, and urge swift passage of the measure. 
   This bipartisan bill goes a long way in improving public transportation. 
   By creating incentives for transit agencies to reduce fares and expand services, H.R. 6052 makes public transportation a more attractive option for commuters. 
   But this bill also provides relief to many of our transit agencies who are struggling with operational costs. 
   I've heard from agencies in my district, like Roaring Fork Transportation Authority, who have seen an increase in ridership, yet face the problem of record fuel prices. 
   They are begging for more resources just to stay afloat. 
   So I support the additional $200 million that this bill authorizes for formula grants to rural areas. 
   Additionally, I applaud Chairman Oberstar for including a fuel provision in the Manager's Amendment, which will help our transit agencies deal with their fuel costs. 
   With their increased ridership, they need help now more than ever. 
   I believe H.R. 6052 will reduce our dependence on foreign oil by encouraging more people to use public transportation. 
   Public transit is a critical piece of cutting greenhouse gases. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   This brings up an important point. It brings up an important point because we are now seeing some underfunding of the VA committee and of VA health care initiatives. We have heard today statistics of how now, today, Vietnam veterans are still being affected by post-traumatic stress disorder. We haven't even been able to touch the beginning of the iceberg. 
   So today, Mr. Speaker, it is important to make it clear what the leadership of this House, the people's House, has said. The leadership of this House today has said that the most important issue for the veterans to be addressed are the issues of health care, both shortfall and VA funding, and it is also an important issue that today we push forward for full funding of VA health care.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And I would also like to thank the chairman of the committee for expressing his support for this amendment. 
   At the end of the 109th Congress, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 was signed into law. This legislation created the Office of Rural Health within the VA and tasked the office with conducting research into issues affecting rural veterans, as well as developing and refining policies and programs to improve care and services for rural veterans. 
   Unfortunately, as the chairman has clearly stated, since this legislation has been signed into law establishing the Office of Rural Health, no action has been taken. Just yesterday in the Veterans' Affairs Health Subcommittee, I asked the VA Under Secretary to give me an update, and he confirmed that as of this date a director has not even been hired yet. 
   This amendment would simply allocate $5 million from the same account within Medical Services to establish this office. 
   The care our Nation provides rural veterans in return for protecting our country should not suffer because some have chosen to live in rural America. We owe them no less for their sacrifice. 
   For the 25 percent of all veterans who live in rural areas, and the nearly 45 percent of all recruits coming from rural America, I urge you to strongly support this amendment, and I commend the chairman for supporting this amendment.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady from Colorado. 
   Mr. Chairman, today I rise as a proud veteran, as a son of a veteran and the father of a veteran. I am honored to be the only veteran of the Colorado delegation. 
   As an Army man, today I am saddened to rise in opposition to the Army's plan to condemn nearly half a million acres of privately owned ranches and farms in my district. 
   Pinon Canyon currently has a 235,000-acre training facility which Fort Carson utilizes in southeastern Colorado. Now the Army is seeking to expand the Pinon Canyon site by an additional 418,000 acres, utilizing condemnation as a power to do so. The Army's plans include taking this land by condemnation. If the Army succeeds, Fort Carson and Pinon Canyon combined will be larger than the State of Rhode Island. 
   Opposition to the expansion is unified, as the gentlewoman from Colorado stated. But when the Army acquired the original Pinon Canyon land in 1982, they promised local landowners that it would never be expanded. Now they are planning to take even more. The loss of 400,000 acres of ranch land, Mr. Chairman, would devastate the economy of southeast Colorado. 
   The BRAC decision of 2005 stated that the Army did not need additional space. In 1970, the Army first looked at condemning land in El Paso County, which is now in Mr. Lamborn's district for the original Pinon Canyon. Many residents from El Paso County fought against the possible land grab in their own backyard, and the site was eventually moved to southeast Colorado. 
   I would ask my fellow Members, if you can't support this in your backyard, please don't support it in my district.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for his strong support of veterans, not only now, but during his tenure in the U.S. Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to bring forward this legislation directing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery for veterans and their families in the Southern Colorado region. I would like to thank Mr. Lamborn from Colorado who, together, we have worked in a bipartisan effort and the bipartisan spirit of the Veterans' Affairs Committee trying to make sure that the issue is resolved. 
   As you know, Fort Logan is the only cemetery that we have in Colorado that will accept veterans, and it is due to be filled. It is strange to say, but it has got a life expectancy of 10 years. I think it is important that we begin working on this issue right now. I would like to especially thank Chairman Filner for allowing us to bring this forward. 
   The National Cemeteries of the United States offer testimony to the desire of a grateful Nation to commemorate the Americans who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces. 
   Since 1862, more than 3 million burials have been made in VA national cemeteries. Of the 120 cemeteries, 58 of them are no longer accepting burials, and many are out of reach and geographically inconvenient for our veterans and their families. Southern Colorado, including El Paso County and the city of Colorado Springs, has one of the highest concentrations of veterans living in the United States. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, Congressman Lamborn and myself worked together in this bipartisan spirit to try to make sure that for the veterans coming back from this war, for the veterans that have served in Colorado, and for veterans that want to be buried in Colorado in 10 years, that there will be adequate space for them to be buried in Colorado. Currently, those veterans, their aging widows, and their families must sometimes travel hours into the highly congested area of Denver to Fort Logan National Cemetery, which is quickly running out of room. 
   The Colorado congressional delegation has worked in a bipartisan manner to create legislation that will benefit all veterans of this great State, and I would like to thank my good friends, Mr. Udall and Mr. Perlmutter of Colorado, for taking time to speak on this important bill. I think a national cemetery in Southern Colorado will serve as a fitting tribute and a final resting place to those who have served our Nation with honor. 
   I certainly urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 1660. But before I yield back, I want to remind the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee that on his question on Jerry Murphy, Jerry Murphy died on Good Friday. Jerry Murphy was born in Pueblo, Colorado. He attended college at Adams State College in Durango and Western State College, and it was a week after we came back that we gave a fitting tribute to Jerry Murphy on this House floor. 
   So he is remembered, Mr. Ranking Member, and I believe that the process takes a little bit of time before we can get things moving on the floor, but certainly he is not forgotten.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALAZAR. (WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Chairman, just for the record, I want everyone to know that I am wearing one of my favorite ties, which is a horse tie. I have been a lifelong farmer and rancher, and I can assure you that no one in this Chamber loves horses more than I do. 
   But the good citizens of western Colorado and all Americans love our beautiful country and the public plans administered by the National Park Service, the Forest Service and the BLM. For more than 100 years, the Forest Service, the BLM lands, have been managed for multiple use and sustainable yield of their products. This means historic uses such as grazing remain a bedrock use of the land, and conservation remains a bedrock principle for which these lands are managed. 
   It is one thing to agree on these core principles. It is another one to do the hard work needed to effectively express the principles and actions and policies. Great needs for land management are going unanswered because Congress lacks the will to provide adequate funding to these core management functions. And at the same time, Mr. Chairman, the courage to adjust these laws reflects the reality of land management today. 
   So, for example, conservation of wildlife under the Endangered Species Act and other laws is regarded by many, including myself, as among the highest conservation priorities in our country. Nevertheless, Congress consistently fails to provide adequate funding for species conservation on the ground, or funding agencies to adequately implement the law. 
   We are at a similar place with respect to wild horses and wild burros. Legal recognition of the place of wild horses and burros on public lands was introduced in the passage of the Wild Horse and Burro Act in 1971. This law reflected America's love for horses and the concern that they be managed properly on public lands. These are values that, undoubtedly, we all share. The key provisions of the law required the BLM to manage the horses to an appropriate management level, called the AML. As a practical matter, this means that horse population numbers had to be managed within the multiple-use framework controlling management of BLM land. 
   For years, BLM has not been able to bring horse populations down within the AML ceiling. This means public lands have been degraded from overgrazing by horses. The habitat and food is taken from the wildlife, and the areas overpopulated by horses cannot  sustain other multiple uses of the land. Congress has consistently declined to provide the funding needed to gather more horses off BLM land and support them to live a healthy life in long-term holding facilities.     
   Still, the law calls for maintenance of wild horse populations at the AML, but the political will has been lacking to allow the agency to succeed. 
   So Congress enacted a legislative solution in the fiscal year 2005 appropriations bill to help relieve the overpopulation of wild horses on public lands by authorizing the sale of unadoptable horses. These are horses that no one wanted. Not ranchers, not public officials, not even members of the animal rights groups or horse protection leagues, and, I am most certainly sure, no one voting ``yes'' on H.R. 249. 
   That first year, in 2005, more than 1,500 horses were sold. BLM credits the law with allowing them to operate their program within budget for the first time in a number of years. A small sales program continues today that is significant to the BLM budget. This year already, in 2007, 346 horses have been sold. BLM estimates that it could run a small sales program of about 600 horses per year. The sale of this number of horses is worth several million dollars to BLM over the life of the horses, for a program that is funded only at approximately $30 million annually. 
   H.R. 249, sponsored by the great chairman, whom I have the greatest of respect for and I know his intentions are good, would eliminate this sales program. Why do it? BLM efforts to prevent the slaughter of horses have been successful to date. Congress is not making sufficient funding available to take necessary care of the horses in long-term care facilities. 
   While the public is adopting some horses under the BLM program, horses are not being adopted at a rate sufficient to ease the overpopulation on public lands. Perhaps worst of all, the administration's budget for fiscal year 2008 called for a complete cutting of the funding for the horse and burro program. The slow progress that has been made towards achieving the AML in recent years will be reversed if BLM lacks the funds to gather the horses. Expenses will increase in the near future, as there will be more horses to manage because the population will not be controlled next year. 
   The existing sale authority is a small but necessary tool in an overall program to manage wild horses and burros on public lands. 
   If you care about the proper management of public lands, responsible government, horse welfare, and political courage, you will vote ``no'' on H.R. 249.

I know that in some of my farming country and my own farm in Costilla County, every now and then, almost every year, we have a beautiful potato field that is run over by a herd of wild horses just because BLM does not have the proper funding and the authority to be able to manage these horses properly. I firmly believe that this bill will take those tools away that BLM currently has to manage wildlife. 
   Divisional Wildlife manages elk and deer herds so that they can thrive within the habitat that they currently have. One of the biggest problems that I see is that BLM uses the tools that they have and the funding that they have to be able to manage wildlife and horses on public land; but the biggest problem that I see is that if this bill passes, they will not be able to weed out the bad apples in the wild herds. 
   For example, they round up these horses. They put back into the wildlife the horses that are good, many of them that are good, but the ones that are lame or the ones that we saw like the one here in this picture, the ones that have broken legs, they can weed out of the population so that they can have better wild horse populations out there. 
   There is nothing more beautiful than to see a herd of wild horses out on the public lands running forever. I can assure you that if this bill passes, it will hurt BLM's ability to manage the great wild horse populations. 
   So I would also urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, frankly, today I'm totally surprised that the other side is politicizing the heartbreak of America. The other side has actually raised fuel prices. We have an oilman in the White House. What we need now is common energy policy, expanding our renewable energy policy, and making sure that we address clean coal burning technology. 
   Who was it that withdrew the FutureGen project off the table? It was President Bush that did this. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, let's make sure that America listens to what Americans are talking about: high energy prices; they're losing their jobs. 
   Today, this bill expands domestic drilling opportunities, not only offshore but also on the land.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support legislation honoring a great American on his 81st birthday, Cesar Chavez. Cesar Estrada Chavez is best known as a farm worker, labor leader and civil rights activist. 
   Born in Yuma, Arizona, of Mexican descent, Chavez became a champion for his fellow farm workers. Among his many achievements, Cesar Chavez was cofounder of the United Farm Workers Association with fellow activist Dolores Huerta. This association provided farm workers with a voice that they so desperately needed. Mr. Speaker, as a lifetime farmer, I can appreciate the sacrifices made by Chavez and his supporters. My oldest brother, Leandro Salazar, the oldest of our family, marched with Cesar Chavez in California for nearly 2 years. 
   We believe that forcing workers to endure this labor under dangerous working conditions and without fair pay is absurd. The most horrific sight that you can ever see is farm workers working out in the field and an aerial applicator coming down upon them and spraying pesticides on them. He worked to make sure that those things did not happen again. 
   We cannot stand by when a laborer is forced to work even as pesticides are being sprayed on the field he or she is working in. His dedication to the cause of worker rights and equality addressed the needs of blue collar men and women across this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, his example inspires us to work together to improve the quality of life for all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, well, it appears that the gentleman's motion to instruct will direct the House conferees to accept the provision of the Senate version of the farm bill. 
   The Senate farm bill contains a provision, section 9021, that would have created a grant program to install E-85 pumps. The Energy and Commerce Committee, who are also conferees in the farm bill energy title, indicate that had this plan is duplicative of section 244 that was included in H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. We tried to avoid this duplication of programs between the farm bill and the energy bill that was passed last year. 
   While I agree with the gentleman that ethanol is a very vital part of our energy independence program, we still have to make sure that we continue to move forward and that we do not derail this current farm bill that we are presently working on. It is my understanding that my colleagues in the conference committee for the food conservation and energy act have already come to an agreement that is already to be reported. 
   Nonetheless the chairman reminds us, all Members, that all motions to instruct are really out of order because the conference committee report is ready to be filed. I know that adopting this motion would obviously delay passage of the farm bill. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle for many of his comments. I understand that this is a very important issue here in America today moving America forward towards an energy independent America. 
   Madam Speaker, however, it is my understanding that my colleagues on the conference committee for the Food Conservation and Energy Act have already come to an agreement that is ready to be reported. We have a title, which is the energy title of the farm bill, which directly deals with agricultural issues and renewable energy and cellulosic-based ethanol. 
   As a matter of fact, the energy title creates a $1.01 per gallon cellulosic ethanol tax credit to 2010. It also has in $1.01 per gallon is based on a 56 cents per gallon tax credit, producers credit, and it has a 45 cents per gallon blenders credit. The total tax benefit is $400 million. 
   And as the gentleman knows, we are currently in a budgetary strain. We have PAYGO rules which we must abide by. I think that adopting this motion would delay the passage of the farm bill. And the chairman reminds all Members that motions to instruct are basically out of order at this time, being that my colleagues in the conference committee have come up with an agreement and they are ready to report this.

   Mr. SALAZAR. I appreciate the gentleman. 
   Let me just say I agree with you on everything that you have said to this point. Ethanol is being blamed for the high cost of food prices. But what the news media forgets to tell you is that we've had the shortest wheat crop on record worldwide for many, many years. They also forget to tell you that because this country continues to borrow money from China, the value of the dollar continues to go down, and so developing countries, like China and India, can now afford American food products. So it creates a larger demand. 
   The Congressional Research Service issued a report that shows that between 40 and 50 percent of the price of food at the grocery store is dependent, directly dependent on the cost of transportation. I agree with you on that. 
   You also talked about the issue of holding the $1 tax credit, which the Senate has approved. It is my understanding that the Conference Committee has agreed upon that. As a matter of fact, what has been created is $1.01 per gallon cellulosic ethanol tax credit through 2010. The $1.01 per gallon is based on the 56-cents-per-gallon producer's credit, and then the 45-cents-per-gallon blender's credit. This should incentivise people to start or companies to start producing ethanol from cellulosic material. 
   I believe that the Nation is capable of producing a sustainable supply of about 1.3 billion tons of biomass per year. As you know, across the Western States of America, many trees have died because of the bark beetle problems. This is biomass that we can actually utilize to produce alcohol to fuel our vehicles.     
   I believe that the 1 billion tons of biomass would be sufficient to probably displace 30 percent of our country's present petroleum consumption. 
   So I do agree with the gentleman.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, today I couldn't agree more with many of the comments that my friend from Nebraska has made. He comes from farming country like I do. We understand the value of the fuel that goes into your tractors and the value of the fuel that goes into your pick-up trucks to run a farming operation. 
   I believe that ethanol is a temporary fix to our energy independence in America. We need to start looking at new technologies such as cellulosic-based technology. We understand that relying on corn-based ethanol is only a short-term solution. 
   Everything that I believe that my colleague has in his motion has been addressed in what the conference committee has brought forward, the higher $1 per gallon cellulosic ethanol tax credit. I think that these are provisions that Mr. Terry's motion has. 
   I only have one concern, Madam Speaker, is that if we were to adopt this motion, I believe that it could potentially delay the passage of the farm bill, and so I would ask my colleague, Mr. Terry from Nebraska, to consider withdrawing his motion.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALAZAR. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a profound debt of gratitude for our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Our brave soldiers are remarkable. They find themselves in a foreign land with regional conflicts that date back over a thousand years. However, they don't run and hide. They fight. They risk their lives helping to encourage and teach the Iraqis to take over their own destiny. 
   Our Nation's sons and daughters deserve nothing short of unconditional gratitude and support from their government and the American people. As long as I am in Congress, our soldiers will have an ally. 
   As a veteran, and a father, I will always fight to protect those who defend their country. I will fight for equipment and supplies. I will fight for their safety and protection. I will make sure they return home to their loved ones as quickly as possible. And I pledge they will NOT be forgotten once they return home. 
   But I will not support sending over 20,000 more young men and women into a fight without a plan to win and get them home. We cannot send more Americans into harm's way to instill a peace that the Iraqis are not willing to seek for themselves. 
   The solutions now are political not military. The Iraq Study Group urged the president to pursue a diplomatic solution alongside our military efforts. 
   But this president has decided to ignore the diplomatic side of the equation. This administration has squandered their credibility by losing billions in reconstruction funds, failing to adequately equip our troops, and failing to develop a clear plan for reconstruction in Iraq. 
   It is time for the Iraqi people to stand up and for the United States to begin a phased redeployment to protect American interests and take our troops out of the direct line of fire. 
   In closing, this war has created a new generation of veterans with new disabilities not seen in past wars. Adding insult to injury, the president's recent budget proposal lacks adequate funding for our veterans returning home. Researching post-traumatic stress disorder, improving suicide prevention, and providing adequate funding for prosthetics are crucial budget needs to serve our new veterans. 
   On a recent trip to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, I met with several of our wounded soldiers. I pledge to them--and to all our men and women in uniform--that your country will take care of you. And I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding and I would like to recognize Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman COSTELLO for their exceptional leadership on this critical issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2881, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007, and urge swift passage of the measure. 
   There are many good and important issues addressed in this bill: funding for capital programs; air traffic control modernization and NextGen; financing that doesn't overburden general aviation; safety; the imposed work rules on our air traffic controllers; consumer protections; R&D; environment; and more. 
   But I'd like to especially thank the bipartisan leadership on the committee for working with me on issues that are particularly important to me and my constituents. 
   H.R. 2881 provides increased funding to local governments throughout the country to maintain and develop their airports, which serve as cornerstones for economic growth. 
   The bill also provides increased radar surveillance coverage in mountainous areas--such as those in Colorado--which will increase the safety and capacity for many of our mountain airports. 
   As many of us come from and represent small, rural communities, we appreciate the need to preserve and improve rural aviation programs, such as Essential Air Service. 
   EAS serves rural communities across the country that otherwise would not receive any scheduled air service. 
   Yet the Administration, once again, has proposed to cut funding by more than half. 
   That would be devastating to more than 140 rural communities--including Cortez, Alamosa and Pueblo, Colorado. 
   I'm proud of the work that we did on the committee to correct this wrong and I'm pleased to see the improvements made to rural aviation in this bill. 
   I believe H.R. 2881 ensures that we remain the world's safest aviation system, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott). 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues of the Blue Dog Coalition to demand more fiscal accountability in Iraq. You know, the Blue Dogs have a plan for fiscal accountability in Iraq. Our plan calls for four things, it calls for transparency on how the war funds are being spent. 
   Two, it creates an commission to investigate the awarding of contracts. 
   Three, it stops the use of supplemental supplementals to fund this war. Do you know that this is the first administration that has continually been using supplementals to fund a war? That is strange. 
   Number four, it uses American resources to improve Iraq's ability to police themselves. 
   Mr. Scott, I have been calling, on and on again, that it is important for us to turn the responsibilities over to the Iraqi people, let them be responsible for their own futures. Why should we be putting our soldiers lives on the line when over 60 percent of the Iraqis now claim that it is okay to shoot an American soldier? 
   But this is about accountability. This is about spending the American taxpayers' funds wisely. This is about the board of directors that America has selected and appointed to the U.S. Congress to do oversight on the taxpayers' funds that are being utilized to fund this war. 
   While the Blue Dog coalition legislation addresses the glaring lack of oversight and accountability in Iraq, we make sure that taxpayer dollars are accounted for. Government reports have documented waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq, time and time again.     
   I believe, Madam Speaker, that it is time now to stop that waste. Congressional oversight is desperately needed. The administration must be held accountable for how these reconstruction funds are being used. 
   And speaking about reconstruction funds, Mr. Scott, you mentioned just briefly about Halliburton. Well, I find it kind of strange that, you know, when they are needed most to help pay taxes so that we can actually fund this war, all of a sudden they decide to pull up stakes and move because they say their tax rates are too high. Well, to me, Mr. Scott, that is not being patriotic. 
   This Blue Dog bill is tangible. It is a commonsense proposal that ensures transparency and accountability. We have already spent $437 billion in Iraq, according to the Congressional Research Service. We will spend another $100 billion in Iraq in 2007 alone. I think that we must start showing improvement in Iraq, and accountability leads directly to success. 
   You brought up a real point. It is almost as if someone reaches into your chest and jerks out your heart. I make regularly scheduled visits out to Walter Reed to visit our returning troops, and I meet with them and talk to them. 
   Their message is quite simple. They are there to do their job. They are proud to be Americans. They are proud patriotic citizens and proud to have served their country. And they tell me, do not let our efforts go in vain. 
   Well, I can assure you, Mr. Scott, that the Blue Dogs are committed to making sure that we stand by them and make sure that they have the equipment they need by holding this administration accountable. 
   It is amazing when you see our soldiers returning without arms and without legs and yet so strong and patriotic and talking about how proud they are to be Americans. 
   Well, Mr. Scott, it is time for the U.S. Congress to also say that they are patriotic and that they are proud Americans, and that they will stand by their soldiers. I think that Iraq must be progressing toward full responsibility for policing their own country. I think without progress it is a waste to continue U.S. investment in troops and financial resources. We all support our troops. We will do everything in our power to get them the equipment they need. 
   I have been in Iraq twice. The first time I was there, soldiers were complaining because they were out in the scrap piles looking for metal to build shields under the Humvees. And in many cases, those became the very instruments that cost their lives.

There has not been any accountability.

   And so I am very proud to be a Member of the Blue Dog Coalition that brings forward this important bill. I think that until our last troop has returned home that the American people deserve to know how their money is being spent. Accountability is not only patriotic, but it often determines success from failure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Grijalva for assistance in moving this important piece of legislation forward. 
   I introduced H.R. 783, along with my friend and colleague MARK UDALL from Colorado, to expand the boundary of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde National Park protects the most notable and best-preserved cliff dwellings in this country. The park is also vital to the economy of southwest Colorado. 
   Established by Congress in June 1906, Mesa Verde National Park was the first cultural park to be set aside in the National Park System. 
   Over 1,400 years ago, the Puebloans settled at Mesa Verde where they built elaborate stone communities in the protected alcoves of the canyon, calling it home for over 700 years. 
   When President Teddy Roosevelt signed the law establishing Mesa Verde, he claimed that it was to ``preserve the works of man.'' 
   The establishment of Mesa Verde set off intense public interest in preserving other such sites in the American southwest and nationwide. Today, the towns of Cortez and Mancos, in Montezuma County, Colorado, rely heavily on tourism from Mesa Verde National Park. 
   H.R. 783 authorizes the National Park Service to acquire two critically important plots at the gateway to Mesa Verde National Park. One is a 324-acre tract of private land to be acquired from the Henneman family. I want to credit the Henneman family, as they remained steadfast in their termination to see the property included in this park, and I'd like to thank them for their dedication. 
   The second plot of land is a 38-acre tract to be donated to the National Park Service by the Mesa Verde Foundation. With passage of H.R. 783, the National Park Service will have the authority to accept the generous donation of this parcel from the foundation. 
   In keeping with the longstanding tradition of preserving the resources and cultural heritage at Mesa Verde National Park, H.R. 783 will greatly enhance the visitor experience at Mesa Verde for future generations of Americans. 
   I urge the House to adopt this important piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to someday come out and visit Mesa Verde National Park.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to be joined by my colleagues of the Blue Dog Coalition to speak about our Nation's problems. 
   Mr. Ross brought up the U.S. national debt now being $8.8 trillion, knocking on the door of $9 trillion. I remember the very first day I came to Congress where the actual figure was $7.54 trillion. Not even 2 1/2 years ago, each American's share of the national debt was $26,000 at that time. What a shame. Over $3,000 more in 2 years. 
   Well, I am proud to join my fellow Blue Dogs today to talk about accountability in government and the gross negligence for taxpayer dollars in Washington. The Blue Dogs have been fighting for greater accountability in Washington for over 10 years. We have argued for a return to a PAYGO system or a balanced budget. We offered a 12-step reform plan to cure our Nation's addiction to deficit spending. We have argued that all earmarks should require written justification from a Member of Congress before being considered. 
   I am proud that our current leadership has taken into account what the Blue Dogs are saying. The Blue Dogs advocate accountability. Let's consider the facts. In 2004, the Federal Government spent $25 billion that it cannot account for. In that same year, only 6 of 63 Pentagon departments were able to produce a clean audit. For 2005, the GAO reports that 19 of the 24 Federal agencies can't produce a clean audit or fully explain how they spend taxpayer dollars. 
   In March of 2005, the Veterans Affairs inspector general issued a report calling for the agency's information systems and securities to be upgraded. No action was taken. And since that time, the personal information of millions of our Nation's veterans has been stolen. 
   Several of our Federal agencies received serious red-flag disclaimers on their 2005 financial statements, including the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Defense who wrote, ``We are unable to give an opinion on the fiscal year 2005 DOD financial statements because of the limitations on the scope of our work. Thus, the financial statements may be unreliable. Therefore, we are unable to express and we do not express an opinion on the DOD's financial statements.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the American public deserves the honest truth. The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security wrote, ``Unfortunately, the department made little or no progress to improve its financial reporting during fiscal year 2005. KPMG was unable to provide an opinion on the department's balance sheet.'' 
   The inspector general for NASA in its 2005 financial report in the enclosed report from independent auditors, Ernest & Young, disclaimed an opinion on NASA's financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005. The disclaimer resulted from NASA's inability to provide an auditable financial statement and sufficient evidence to support financial statements throughout the fiscal year and at year end. 
   Federal agencies are treating the taxpayer dollars that fund them like a joke, and the administration is incapable of lifting a finger to manage them effectively. 
   I believe we need strong enforcement measures in Congress and the Federal Government to make it more accountable for taxpayer dollars. We must ensure that Congress has the tools to hold Federal agencies responsible for their use of taxpayer dollars. 
   Mr. Speaker, American taxpayers deserve to know how Congress and this administration are spending their money. 
   I am proud once again to join my Blue Dog colleagues to demand more fiscal accountability in Iraq. The Blue Dogs have a plan for fiscal accountability in Iraq. Our plan calls for transparency on how war funds are being utilized. It creates a commission to investigate how contracts are awarded, and it stops the use of emergency supplementals to fund this war. This is the first administration, Mr. Speaker, that has used emergency supplementals to fund a war year after year after year. 
   The Blue Dogs also call for American resources to improve Iraq's ability to police themselves. The Blue Dog legislation addresses the glaring lack of oversight and accountability in Iraq. We make sure that taxpayer dollars are accounted for. Government reports have documented waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq. I think it is time to stop that waste. Congressional oversight is desperately needed. The administration must be held accountable for how reconstruction funds are being utilized. 
   The Blue Dog proposals are commonsense proposals. They ensure transparency and accountability. We have already spent $437 billion in Iraq, according to the Congressional Research Service, and we will spend another $100 billion in Iraq in 2007 alone. That is over $500 billion with virtually no oversight from Congress. We must start showing improvement in Iraq. Accountability leads directly to success, in my opinion. Iraq must begin making progress towards full responsibility by policing their own country. Without progress, it is a waste to continue U.S. investment in troops and financial resources. 
   We all support our troops. We must support our troops. We will do everything in our power to make sure that they have the equipment that they need. However, we cannot continue to write a blank check to this administration. Until our last troop has returned home, the American people deserve to know how their money is being spent. Accountability is not only patriotic, it often determines success from failure. 
   The Blue Dog proposal gives us an opportunity to regain that oversight and responsibility. This is the responsibility that we have to all of our men and women in uniform, to their parents, and to the American taxpayer who is footing the bill. 
   The Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office have clearly stated that if this continues, our fiscal irresponsibility in Congress, if it continues by the year 2040, every single penny of revenue that the Federal Government receives will go just to fund the interest on our national debt. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to let this happen. We cannot saddle our children with the irresponsibilities of this administration.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I often tell this story of my father. I served during the tail end of Vietnam and my father was a World War II veteran. My son served now during Iraqi Freedom. He just finished his tour last December, but I like to tell this story of my father who was a proud veteran. 
   At the age of 82, my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease; and as was usual on Sunday mornings, I would go over to Mom and Dad's ranch house, and we 
   would have breakfast with my mom and dad. We had been told by the doctors that my dad had Alzheimer's, and it was one day right around, he must have been around 84 when one Sunday morning we heard him fumbling around in his back bedroom. Shortly thereafter, he came out and in his hand he bore his World War II staff sergeant uniform, and he told us, this is the uniform that I want to be buried in. We thought at the time, well, it sounded a little bit self-serving but doctors tell you not to argue with Alzheimer's patients. So we said, sure, Dad, no problem. We will do that. 
   Well, the disease continued to progress over the next couple of years, but often, often he would bring up the issue of wanting to be buried in his uniform, and it was at the age of 86 that my father suffered a severe heart attack. My mother called me over. We live about a quarter mile away. When I got there, the ambulance was there, and I remember lifting my father off the floor to put him on the gurney to take him to the hospital. And with the last ounce of strength he had in his body, he lifted his arms up around my neck and he said, I love you, and the last word he ever whispered to me was the word ``uniform.'' 
   My father had forgotten almost everything in life, even how to use his bodily functions; but there are two things he had not forgotten, the love that he had for his family and the love that he had for his country and how proud he was to have served his country. 
   For many veterans, that is the greatest legacy that they have, and so when we propose an Iraqi war supplemental, we are also proposing funding to make sure that the veterans that have served this country are protected. 
   I tell this story because it is important that we protect those that have  protected us, and I know that we as members of the Blue Dog Coalition are very proud to stand beside our veterans and make sure that they have the things that they need. 
   The gentleman from Arkansas talks about visiting Walter Reed. I do that on a regular basis, and it is the most disheartening feeling in the world to see our troops without arms and legs. They do not ask for anything. All they ask for is help me get through life. We owe that to our veterans.

   Mr. SALAZAR. I was in the Soviet Union during the fall of communism when Gorbachev was still in power in 1989, when we were out there studying international government with the Colorado Agriculture Leadership Program. 
   It's true, I couldn't agree with you more, that the 
   spirit of democracy has to come from within, from within a country. They want to have it. They want to want it. A perfect example of how you win a war, it's with the spirit of sheer military force, but you also have to have a diplomatic surge as well. That is what Blue Dogs are asking for. They are asking to adopt the Iraqi Study Group recommendations. Sure, we can support a group surge, but coupled with a diplomatic surge. That is how you win wars. But they have to want it.

   Mr. SALAZAR. I want to thank the gentleman for his comments. I think it is clear, with the figures that you have given us, that the $378 billion is not really a true reflection of what the Iraqi war has cost us. 
   And you are absolutely right, we as Blue Dogs, we as Democrats will stand strong with our troops making sure that they have the equipment that they need, and that is one of the things I wanted to talk about tonight was the Iraq war supplemental that our leadership has proposed includes making sure that we take care of our veterans; it includes money for devastated farmers and ranchers across this country due to weather problems and other issues. 
   So I believe that this is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do. But I would ask the administration to please look into trying some diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, and hopefully we can move this forward and bring our troops home as quickly and safely as possible. In the meantime, let us not forget the men and women in uniform who serve this country bravely. And I want to thank the gentleman for inviting me today to visit with the American public and tell them the truth about what is going on with America's budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for yielding, and I want to recognize the chairman and the ranking member for their exceptional leadership on this critical issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1401, the Rail and Public Transportation Security Act of 2007, and urge its swift passage. 
   Horrific terrorist events around the world have forced us to focus on rail security. This bill is an important and necessary step towards protecting our Nation's rail and surface transportation safety. 
   My district is home to the world-renowned Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado. TTCI's Emergency Response Training Center conducts hands-on hazmat training for first responders and is known in the field as the premier graduate school for surface transportation hazmat training. 
   My good friend and fellow Coloradan, Mr. Perlmutter, highlighted in committee the critical role that TTCI plays in advancing rail security, research and development and hazmat training. 
   By making TTCI the sixth member of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, it will add a critical component to the consortium that is now missing. TTCI is the only facility in the Nation that has the experience and assets necessary to test new emergency response and recovery techniques. Adding TTCI to the consortium will help fulfill the goals of this bill, making our rail lines safer from homeland security threats by enabling the facility to accelerate its already outstanding work in the field of rail security. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the investment in rail and public transportation security and passage of this much-needed bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the gentleman from Arkansas and his work with my Blue Dog colleagues in demanding more fiscal responsibility in Iraq. I believe that Congress has now approved nearly $510 billion for military operations since 2001, with nearly no oversight on spending. Operation Iraqi Freedom alone has cost American taxpayers $51 billion in 2003, $77.3 billion in 2004, $87.3 billion in 2005, $104 billion in 2006, and in 2007 we are in the process of funding Operation Iraqi Freedom once again with a supplemental. Now we are spending over $10 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan just on government contractors working on reconstruction. All of this is unchecked, and that is why I am so proud to join my Blue Dog colleagues as a supporter of H. Res. 97. 
   H. Res. 97 was introduced by the Blue Dog Coalition to call for transparency on how Iraq funds are spent. We have a plan for accountability in Iraq. Our plan calls for, first, transparency on how war funds are spent. Second of all, it creates a commission to investigate awarded contracts. Third of all, it stops the use of emergency supplementals to fund the war. 
   Everything that I have read over the past several years indicates that this is the first administration that has used supplementals to fund a war after the first year, after initiation. In January we passed what was called the PAYGO rule. It is my understanding that with supplementals, you don't have to follow PAYGO rules. I think it is critical that we as Blue Dogs continue to move forward and push for an honest budget. 
   Number four, it uses American resources to improve Iraq's ability to police itself. I believe that this is of critical importance.  
   Mr. Speaker, you cannot push democracy on someone who does not want it. Over 65 percent of the Iraqi population now says it is okay to shoot at American soldiers. The Iraqi Parliament a couple of weeks ago voted 144 out of 275 members to tell Americans that it is time for us to come home. We cannot force democracy on someone who does not want it. 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that today what is important is that we turn this over to the Iraqi Government. Our soldiers can become the advisors. They should not be on the front lines. 
   The gentleman talks about the Social Security Trust Fund. Two years ago I introduced the Social Security Protection Act, which would not allow any politician in Washington to touch that trust fund. I think the gentleman raises a critical point there. 
   He also talks about the veterans. I am the only veteran in the Colorado delegation. I am proud to be a Blue Dog, and I am proud that this legislation addresses the lack of oversight and accountability in Iraq. But I am also very proud that this resolution stands for veterans' issues. 
   Government reports have documented waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq. Contractors are being paid billions of dollars by the United States for their services in Iraq. Most of these, Mr. Speaker, are no-bid contracts. Where is the accountability in that? I believe that if their work is resulting in unsanitary conditions, potential health hazards, poor construction methods or significant cost overruns, then Congress has the right to know about it. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that it is time to stop this waste. 
   Congressional oversight is desperately needed. This administration should be held accountable for how reconstruction funds are being used. This Blue Dog bill is a commonsense proposal that ensures transparency and accountability. We bring oversight back to Congress. We start showing improvement in Iraq, and accountability leads directly to success. Iraqis must begin progress towards full responsibility for policing their own country. Without progress, it is a waste to continue U.S. investment in troops and financial services. 
   Mr. Speaker, I visited Iraq twice. While I have seen some improvements in some areas, I have also seen the increase in insurgent attacks not only on American troops, but on other Iraqis. 
   We all support our troops, and we will do everything within our power to make sure that they have the equipment and the funding that they need. However, Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue to write blank checks to the administration. I firmly believe that until our last troop is returned home, the American people deserve to know how their money is being spent. 
   Accountability is not only patriotic, it often determines success from failure. The Blue Dog bill gives an opportunity to regain oversight responsibility. This is the responsibility that we have to all of our men and women in uniform, to their parents and to the American taxpayer who is footing the bill. 
   The gentleman brings up another valid point. He talks about how the budget is a moral document. I, frankly, sir, could not run my household and put my farm into debt and pass the debt on to my children. That is 
   exactly what has happened over the last 5 years. We had a surplus in the budget. The economy was doing great. 
   Democrats have a plan that by 2011 we will balance this budget. It is with the help of the Blue Dog Coalition, with the help of gentlemen like the gentleman from Arkansas, who is so committed to make sure there is accountability, that we will figure out a way to truly be honest with the American people in our budgets. 
   We want to put the Iraqi war supplemental back into the regular budget process so that we have a true, accurate picture of what our national debt is, what our deficit is. The gentleman was showing that we have $8.8 trillion in debt right now. Well, I can assure the gentleman from Arkansas when I came into Congress in the last Congress, our national debt was $78.045 trillion. Your share of that debt, your children's share of that debt, was back then $26,000. I believe the figure you show now, Mr. Ross, is some $29,000, I believe $29,174 and some cents. 
   I believe, Mr. Ross, that this is morally wrong, and I believe that it is time for Congress to start being honest and report to the American people what troubles the last 5 years Congress has moved the American people toward. I have heard that by the year 2040, every single penny that comes in in Federal revenues will go to pay just the interest on the national debt. That is without running government. I believe that is morally wrong. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would ask this Congress, I would ask this Democratic Congress and the Blue Dog Coalition, to continue fighting for balanced budgets, to continue fighting for accountability, because that is what the American people want.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Moran, the gentleman from Kansas. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1527, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act. I want to thank Congressman Moran for introducing this bill, and I want to thank him for being a champion for rural veterans. I have never once in my career here in Congress ever seen him make a veterans issue a partisan issue. 
   I want to thank you for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district similar to Mr. Moran's to over 69,000 veterans. These are hardworking people who inspire future generations to serve our Nation. Many of our veterans live in rural and low-income communities. In big cities veterans are located closer together. In rural districts like mine, we have veterans that are spread out over a wide area. This makes it difficult for them to get the resources they need. 
   The Rural Veterans Access to Care Act will allow highly rural veterans to see a non-VA health care provider. It establishes a 3-year pilot program. Part of it will be in Colorado as well. The pilot program is a great opportunity to see the potential impact of this program on the quality of veterans and the care for veterans. This bill is important because of unique travel challenges in rural areas. Long distances, dangerous terrain, unpredictable weather can make it very difficult to get to a VA facility.     
   H.R. 1527 will take the necessary steps to making health care more accessible to our Nation's rural veterans. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our rural veterans, and support this bill. 
   Thank you to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) for allowing me to speak on this bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your bipartisan effort in trying to make sure that we address veterans' issues in a nonpartisan way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. I want to thank the chairman for bringing up these bills today. 
   It is actually a little disappointing to stand here and listen to the dialogue, when I know my Republican colleagues on the House Veterans' Committee actually voted unanimously to get these bills to the floor. You know, veterans issues to me are not a partisan issue. We are all Americans. I think all of us support veterans, and we are all doing the best we can to move this thing forward. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2818, the Veterans' Epilepsy Treatment Act of 2008. I want to especially thank my fellow Coloradan, Congressman Ed Perlmutter, who introduced this bill. He continues to be a champion for Colorado, for Colorado veterans and veterans across the Nation who suffer from epilepsy. 
   According to the VA, there are currently 89,000 veterans enrolled in the VA who have been diagnosed with epilepsy. This bill creates a national system of care to treat our veterans, co-located at existing polytrauma centers. This is very important to rural districts like mine, where making health care accessible is a constant challenge.  
   The Veterans Health Subcommittee has heard about the increasing rates of TBI among our returning veterans. A DOD study after Vietnam found that 53 percent of soldiers with brain injuries suffered from a penetrating TBI, the most severe type of TBI. About 15 percent of these also developed epilepsy soon after their injury. 
   Longer deployments put our heroes at greater risk for these injuries and mental health conditions. At the same time, advancements in medicine have saved many soldiers from injuries that only a few years ago would have been fatal. The result is a greater number of vets in the VA health care system with these types of injuries. 
   As a veteran myself, I was proud to serve my country at the end of the Vietnam War. Vietnam veterans returned home with head injuries, TBI and PTSD, but were not properly diagnosed. This bill honors their service by improving access to health care for current and future veterans. H.R. 2818 will go a long way in helping change our health care system to one that is prepared for tomorrow's challenges. 
   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation, as we did in the Veterans Affairs Committee, and I want to especially once again thank our Congressman from Colorado, who has a special interest for his leadership in making sure that our veterans have the health care that they deserve.

   Madam Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Kind amendment and in opposition to any amendment trying to destroy the farm bill. 
   My family still farms the same land that my ancestors settled back 150 years ago. As one of only a few ranchers and farmers in Congress, I know a thing or two about agriculture. The farm bill provides a much-deserved safety net for our farmers, but it also provides a much-needed safety net for American citizens. 
   On this bumper sticker it says ``Not everyone farms, but everyone eats.'' The Kind amendment will make it even more difficult for our Nation's farmers and ranchers to stay in business, forcing us to rely on foreign production to feed our growing Nation. Do you really want to rely on other countries to produce our food? Look at the trouble we have gotten into for relying on other countries for the oil that we need. I, for one, would not want to buy or feed my children food harvested in China. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote against the Kind amendment. Please keep America safe and sound.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007, and urge swift passage of the measure. I believe that this bill addresses many important issues that have been ignored for far too long. I am grateful to the chairwoman, as well, for the inclusion of the language that authorizes funding for the tunnel to be built at the Transportation Technology Center, an internationally recognized train testing facility that she was able to tour last year. It is located in Pueblo, Colorado. TTC is used by the Federal Railroad Administration to conduct significant research and development on rail safety. 
   TTC offers 48 miles of railroad track to test rolling stock, track components, signal and safety devices, track structure and vehicle performance. It also has several one-of-a-kind laboratory test facilities used for evaluating vehicle dynamics, structural characteristics and advanced braking systems. TTC already operates as a world-class research and test center offering a wide range of capabilities in railroad and transit research. 
   For the past 2 years, we have been working to get funding for a facility for an underground rail station and tunnel at TTC. The tunnel will add to the center's capabilities and serve as an invaluable resource as we strive to ensure that our Nation's railroads are safe and secure against possible terror attacks. Recent events have sadly demonstrated the vulnerability of underground mass transit systems. Safety experts have identified a number of technology and training needs to prevent attacks on tunnels and lessen the consequences of such attacks. These needs include detection systems, dispersal control and decontamination techniques. 
   The distinctive, remote environment of TTC allows such testing and training activities to be carried out at a secure location, without disruption to the flow of passenger and rail traffic in and around urban areas. I applaud Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown and Mr. Shuster for recognizing the important role that such a tunnel will play in rail safety. I believe H.R. 2095 ensures that we remain the world's safest rail system, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   After graduation, Jerry Murphy joined the Marine Corps Reserve and entered Officers Candidate School. In 1952, he was sent to Korea where he served with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division. 
   In February 1953, Raymond Gerald Murphy was cited for ``Conspicuous Gallantry at the risk of his life and above and beyond the call of duty as a Platoon Commander.'' 
   Although painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy mortar shell, Second Lieutenant Murphy steadfastly refused medical attention and continued to lead his men up the hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small-arms fire. Wounded a second time, he again refused assistance. 
   His resolute and inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon Lt. Col. Murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the United States military service. 
   Raymond Gerald Murphy was the 39th United States Marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor for Heroism in the Korean War. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Lt. Col. Murphy was awarded the Silver Star, Purple Heart, Korean Service Medal with two Bronze Stars, the United Nations Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal.

   My rural communities rely on antiquated water systems, and they need to be updated. Without the means to update old systems, many of our constituents and communities nationwide have been living in substandard conditions. 
   It is not only an environmental health issue. A lack of sufficient water resources can effectively prevent the community from moving forward with critical infrastructure, like additional housing for its inhabitants. 
   This bill is an important and necessary step in protecting our Nation's water infrastructure. Quite simply, Mr. Chairman, we cannot afford not to pass this critical legislation.

   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, this morning as we stand here in our Nation's Capitol, family and friends in Colorado are gathered together to celebrate the life of a truly great American, a wonderful human being. The child of Mexican immigrants, Eva Baca was born on January 1, 1929 in Pueblo, Colorado. She graduated from Pueblo Central High School and attended Colorado State College. Ms. Baca, as a member of the first graduating class in 1965. As a widowed mother of two, she balanced motherhood and her studies while attending Adams State College, receiving her master's in education in 1968. 
   Upon graduation, Ms. Baca taught at Lakeview and Hellbeck Elementary Schools. She went on to get her principal's certificate, and in 1972 she took her first administrative position at the new Eastwood Heights Elementary School. There she instituted new reading programs for children from low-income families. 
   Eva Baca was a strong advocate for the community in which she lived and worked to provide opportunities and increased accessibility to Pueblo's isolated, east side neighborhood. In 1983, Eva Baca was named director of Title I programs for Pueblo School District No. 60, a position she held for a decade until her retirement. Eva Baca has been recognized throughout Colorado and across the country with various honors and awards. Everyone who had the privilege of knowing her has a wonderful story to tell. 
   Most recently, she received the lifetime achievement award by the Pueblo Latino Chamber of Commerce for her outstanding educational leadership and contributions to the lives of countless children in her community. 
   On Thursday, Eva Baca passed away in Pueblo. She was a loving mother to Joyce and Robert Anderson, and Gilbert Baca; a cherished grandmother to Karl, Megan, Lindsey and Nick. She was a fearless educator and dear friend. 
   In 1993, Eastwood Heights Elementary School, the school that she gave so many years of her life, was renamed in her honor. Today, 250 children attend Eva R. Baca Elementary School, a living tribute to a woman who spent her life focused on those around her. 
   John Lubbock wrote, ``The important thing is not so much that every child should be taught, as that every child should be given the wish to learn.'' 
   For the countless children that Eva Baca has given the wish to learn, we thank her.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, many people are not aware that there are approximately 80,000 dams in the United States; and, of these, the Association of State Dam Safety Officials has identified 3,500 dams that are considered deficient or unsafe. In my State of Colorado, we have over 1,800 dams. Of those, 131 are high hazard public dams, and an additional 19 dams are deficient. The State has determined that they are in serious need of repair. 
   Without proper maintenance, these dams are an obvious threat to public safety. It is critical that we help to ensure the safety and security of these dams. H.R. 3224, introduced by myself and the gentleman from New York, Mr. RANDY KUHL, is a bill that does help to ensure such safety and security by addressing rehabilitation and repair of safety-deficient State-owned dams. 
   This bill is direct, quite simple, and will go a long way to mitigate significant hazards to our communities. First, the bill adds ``deficient dam'' and ``rehabilitation'' to the definition section of the Dam Safety Act and thus makes this category of dams eligible for funding for rehabilitation. Second, the bill directs the administrator of FEMA to establish within FEMA a program to provide grant assistance to States for use in rehabilitation of publicly owned deficient dams. The grants will be awarded so that each State will get an equal share of one-third of the total amount, while the remaining two-thirds will be awarded by risk. The Federal cost share is capped at 65 percent. 
   The program's goal is to reduce the risks to life and property by establishing an effective national dam safety rehabilitation program that utilizes the resources and expertise of the Federal and non-Federal communities to achieve the reduction of dam safety hazards. In other words, one of the primary purposes of the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2007 is to provide financial assistance to the States for strengthening their dam safety programs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and urge its passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   We all remember what happened in Minneapolis last August. Thirteen people were killed. Our infrastructure is literally crumbling beneath us. This is simply unacceptable. One-half of all bridges in the U.S. were built before 1964, and now we have over 72,000 highway bridges that are structurally deficient. In Colorado we have 125 bridges that need repair; 24 of those bridges are in my district. 
   And I have got to remind the gentleman from Florida that Colorado has typically been a donor State. After we passed TEA-LU a couple years ago, we actually started becoming a State where we can actually get some Federal dollars back in reference to those that we send to the Federal Government. So in order for us to be able to fix the bridges in my district, we need to be able to have Federal funds to do so. We must do everything possible to keep our travelers, our constituents safe in our highways. By dedicating funding for bridge repairs, this bill provides relief for our State transportation departments.
