<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (IMPROPER OVERSIGHT OF BLACKWATER AND THE PASSAGE OF H.R. 3087 IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO RESPONSIBLY REDEPLOY OUR TROOPS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, today in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, my colleagues and I questioned the CEO of Blackwater and lead figures in the Department of State regarding private security contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   During the course of this hearing, I was absolutely alarmed and shocked by the stark reality that private contractors such as Blackwater have possibly created a shadow military of mercenary troops that are not accountable to the United States Government or to anyone else. 
   With 180,000 Americans, Iraqis and nationals from other countries who operate under an array of Federal contracts provide everything from security and intelligence gathering to infrastructure building and transporting supplies to a country nearly the size of California. 
   Even more alarming is the fact that Blackwater and similar private contractors make up the largest security force in Iraq. There are currently over 20,000 more contractors than the total U.S. military forces. 
   With these numbers, one may suspect the contractors are being utilized, in part, to mask the true extent of our involvement in Iraq. I am also concerned with the fact that many contractors such as those working for Blackwater are simply held to a different standard, where circumventing criminal law, rules of engagement and even the Geneva Conventions have become far too commonplace. 
   There have been 195 escalation of force incidents from Blackwater alone since 2005, including several previously unreported killings of Iraqi civilians. In 80 percent of these instances, Blackwater fired first. This ``shoot now and ask questions later'' attitude has resulted in further distrust amongst Iraqis for American military forces and the Iraqi Interior Ministry demanding that Blackwater cease its operations in Iraq, all during a time when winning the cooperation of Iraqi civilians and government is critical for our success for our mission. 
   Due to these and other incidents, Blackwater has undermined our strategic mission in Iraq and possibly stifled our already sensitive relationship with Iraq's neighboring states, those  same countries where garnering multilateral and bilateral support is critical to solidifying political reconciliation in Iraq. 
   The President has consistently stated that he wants to win the hearts and the minds of Iraqis. However, the ongoing use of Blackwater contractors that are consistently beyond legal reach is not the way to achieve that goal. Blackwater is clearly the realization of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's vision of a ``hollow military,'' where everything that can be privatized and outsourced will be. 
   Blackwater appears to be held above the law, as the State Department continues to make little effort to hold it accountable, while continuing to award contracts amounting to over $1 billion since 2000, $300 million of which were awarded as no-bid contracts. Clearly it is time for a new direction beyond the failed policy in Iraq, which has been further deteriorated by the administration's use of inept privatized security contractors. 
   That new direction begins with outlining a clear statement on appropriate and detailed contingency plans for a reasonable redeployment of troops from Iraq, including consideration of force protection for military and civilian personnel and a need to continue to protect our vital national security interests as mandated in Representatives Abercrombie, Tanner and Turner's bill, H.R. 3087. 
   As such, the passage of H.R. 3087 is a clear step in the right direction, that our men and women in uniform not sacrifice another 3,800 lives without a clear strategy for redeploying our troops. We recognize that, since the planning of the redeployment of our troops from Iraq is a complex status, we must plan accordingly as to not repeat the mistakes made in the original planning for the Iraq invasion and post-war occupation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and in strong support of H.R. 5818, as well as H.R. 5830 and H.R. 5720, which together constitute a comprehensive package of legislation that will help us address our Nation's housing crisis by providing assistance to those who are suffering the most. 
   The numbers characterizing this crisis are truly staggering. The National Association of Realtors reports that median home prices fell in 2007 by nearly 2 percent. RealtyTrac reported last week that in the first quarter of 2008, 1 in every 194 homeowners faced a foreclosure notice. 
   The loss of a home, or value in a home, is a loss of an asset which many Americans often work their entire lives to own, and it is a loss of a dream that many may never again have the chance to achieve for the rest of their lives. 
   Further, the decline of the housing market has pulled our economy to the brink of recession. Our Nation has lost some 260,000 jobs since January of this year, and economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2008 to less than 1 percent. 
   The reality is that many Americans long ago entered their own personal recessions. And the legislation before us today finally begins to provide the aid that our Nation's families so urgently need to get back on their feet.  
   Together, these pieces of legislation will do the following: 
   Provide mortgage refinancing assistance to keep families from losing their homes and protect the values of neighboring homes; expand FHA assistance so that borrowers in danger of losing their homes can refinance into lower-cost, government-insured mortgages they can afford to repay; and provide States $10 billion in additional tax-exempt bond authority in 2008 to refinance subprime loans and refinance the building of affordable and rental housing. 
   I applaud Chairman Frank and Chairwoman Waters for their determined leadership and for these great pieces of legislation, and I urge the adoption of each of these measures.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (CELEBRATING PASTOR ALFRED VAUGHN'S 50 YEARS IN THE MINISTRY -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great admiration and respect to recognize a dear friend and one of the Nation's most distinguished citizens, Dr. Alfred C.D. Vaughn, for his 50 years of service to God as a preacher, teacher, leader, and friend. 
   For the last 21 years, Dr. Vaughn has been the cherished pastor of the Sharon Baptist Church, located in my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. As grace would have it, this is the same church that his grandmother joined in 1894 and of which his mother became a member in 1911. 
   Dr. Vaughn, known as the dean of ministers in Baltimore, is one of thirteen children of Mildred and Robert Vaughn. He received Christ at the tender age of 11. Just 8 years later, he was licensed to preach and began a glorious journey of teaching and preaching God's Holy Word. 
   He first served as pastor of Promise Land Baptist Church in Moneta, Virginia. For 18 years he then led the congregation of Grace Memorial Baptist Church in Baltimore before accepting the calling in 1986 to return home as the visionary pastor of the Sharon Baptist Church. 
   Throughout his career as a minister, the pursuit of a quality education has always been his priority. Dr. Vaughn earned an AB-BD degree from Virginia Seminary and College, a master of divinity degree and a doctor of ministry degree from Southern University, and he has been awarded four honorary degrees. 
   It has been said that ``you show people who you are by what you do.'' Throughout his entire life, Dr. Vaughn has demonstrated to the world, with sincere humility and steadfast determination, his commitment to helping others to be the very best that they can be. 
   Recognizing the need for accessible child care in his community, Dr. Vaughn converted a building near Sharon Baptist Church into a family support center that houses a child care facility and operates other community service programs. He also spearheaded efforts to raise thousands of dollars to send students to college, adopt a local elementary school, and provide after-school programs, local food pantry programs and foreign missions. 
   However, Dr. Vaughn's accomplishments and achievements reach far beyond the walls of his church. He served as commissioner for the Housing Authority of Baltimore City for 10 years. He was appointed as trustee and as treasurer of Provident Hospital and as trustee of the Community College of Baltimore. He served on the board of directors of the Afro-American Newspapers, and he currently serves as chairman of the board of trustees of Eastern Theological Seminary. 
   As a testament to his leadership, Dr. Vaughn was recently elected, for an unprecedented eighth time, to serve as  president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Baltimore and Vicinity, an organization which represents some 250,000 congregants. 
   Outside of serving the Lord and leading souls to His kingdom, Pastor Vaughn's greatest joy comes from his family. He has been blessed with 44 years of blissful marriage to his wife, Lillian. They have three children, Corrogan Vaughn, Lynnette Vaughn, and Cassandra Vaughn-Fox; a son-in-law, Larry Fox, Jr.; and three wonderful grandchildren. 
   Whenever I see Pastor Vaughn in the community, his grandchildren are not far behind. No matter what his daily commitments may be, he picks them up from school every day and spends quality time with them, sharing his wisdom and his love. 
   Baltimore is truly blessed to be able to call a stalwart such as Dr. Alfred C.D. Vaughn one of our very own. As a son of two preachers, I can say with certainty that it is fitting to give God praise for this dynamic leader. For 50 years he has preached the Gospel with truth and honor, not to glorify himself but to save souls and make others' lives better. He is the kind of man who, just by his presence, makes us want to stand taller and reach for the very best that is within us. As my father once said, he is a man whose presence is presence enough. 
   I am honored that God allowed our lives to eclipse. And today I thank Pastor Vaughn on behalf of Baltimore and our entire Nation for his dedication, commitment to God and his church and his community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the ``Employee Free choice Act,'' H.R. 800. This is a historic moment for working families, and I am proud to be a part of it. Unions matter. The Washington Post reported yesterday that 12-year-old, Maryland resident Deamonte Driver died from a bad tooth. A routine, $80 tooth extraction might have saved him. Instead, the infection from the bad tooth spread to his brain. Unfortunately, the bakery, construction and home health-care jobs Deamonte's mother has held did not provide the insurance necessary to pay for his care. 
   This tragedy might have been avoided if Deamonte's mother were a union employee. Eighty percent of union workers have employer-provided health insurance, compared with on 49 percent of nonunion workers. Our health care system is broken in this country, and unions provide a solution for so many families. I would like to thank Chairman Miller for his leadership on this issue, and I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (60TH ANNIVERSARY OF INTEGRATION OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise, along with my distinguished colleagues, for the next hour, which shall be ours, to salute and to mark the 60th anniversary of the integration of the United States Armed Forces. 
   I rise today to celebrate this historic occasion as a step toward greater social justice for minorities and women alike, which shaped the road to equality within the United States and strengthened the very foundation and moral character of our great Nation. 
   On July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman signed executive order 9981, requiring the integration of the Armed Forces regardless of one's race, religion, or national origin. 
   President's Truman's brazen action back there in 1948 set the stage for later victories, including the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act. 
   We are aware, Mr. Speaker, as our history attests, that the shared sacrifice of African Americans in the defense of our great Nation did not begin in 1948. Individuals such as William Williams, a Maryland fugitive slave, overcame the odds by enlisting as a private in the United States Army and defending Fort McHenry of Baltimore, Maryland in 1812. Countless others also served prior to the issuance of executive order 9981, including the Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments, members of the Navy and Marine Corps' Stewards Branch, and the highly distinguished and honored Tuskegee Airmen. These brave servicemembers paved the way for minority men and women who proudly wear the uniform today. Sadly, back then, Mr. Speaker, they were often unseen, unnoticed, unappreciated, unapplauded and unsung, but today we pause to celebrate their lives and their contributions to our great Nation. 
   It is because of their sacrifices that I, along with the 42 other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, serve in the Congress of the United States today. It is through their sacrifices that I serve on the Board of Visitors at the Naval Academy, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and Chair of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee. As such, minorities have played a pivotal role in shaping this Nation's armed services, and I'm proud to say that this role continues today. 
   With the benefit of historical hindsight, we know that the sacrifice of brave Americans on the battlefield had to become a shared experience for America to truly move toward becoming ``one Nation, indivisible.'' Therefore, a segregated Armed Force could not be a foundation for an integrated society, nor could it truly offer ``justice for all.'' 
   However, just as President George Washington initially refused to recruit African Americans in the American Revolutionary War despite the British welcoming the enlistment of minorities in 1775, President Truman's executive order was also met with much opposition by the Marine Corps and the Army. Consequently, this significant change and transition in racial policy took nearly 15 years before the executive order was fully implemented by all of the Armed Forces. 
   Because of President Truman's unyielding vigilance in ensuring the complete integration of the Armed Forces, all Americans today are more secure and remain free. 
   As we remember and honor the brave men and women of every race who have served our Nation, we should also remember those visionary leaders who gave to our Nation, including our colleagues, Representative Charles Rangel of New York, John Conyers of Michigan, Representative Bobby Rush of Illinois, Edolphus Towns of New York, Bobby Scott of Virginia, and so many others, the opportunity to share in that sacrifice which has preserved the America we all love so much. 
   We know that the transformation of our military has not been easily accomplished, and we honor those soldiers, sailors, airmen, guardsmen and women, and marines who, over the years, have challenged the status quo to do what is simply right. 
   All too often in our past, minorities in our Armed Forces have been forced to endure injustice and discrimination. All too often, promotions, choice assignments, and desired occupational fields have not been open to all on the basis of merit alone. Yet, the patriotism of our countrymen and women has kept the transformation and vision by President Truman alive. 
   Today, minorities continue to serve with distinction throughout our Armed Forces. Of the more than 1.8 million servicemembers who have participated in support of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, more than 20 percent have been minorities. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was just today that we congratulated Ensign DeCarol Davis for her selection as being the first African American and the first African  American woman to serve as valedictorian of a graduating class of the Coast Guard Academy. However, despite these advancements, minorities and women continue to be overlooked in being promoted fairly to Flag Officer rank or other leadership positions within the armed services. In fact, minorities remain over-represented in the enlisted ranks of our armed services, but clearly under-represented in the officer ranks. 
   African Americans constitute less than 6 percent of the general officers serving on active duty, amounting to merely 53 officers. And today, 60 years after executive order 9981, the Department of Defense still lacks a comprehensive plan and definition of diversity that can be applied Defense-wide. 
   Moreover, while the number of minorities and women admitted into the service academy has increased, reaching 24.1 percent of minorities for the graduating class of 2007 to 2011 at West Point and 22.7 percent of the United States Naval Academy, reports of the hate-inspired display of nooses at the United States Coast Guard Academy certainly demonstrate how much further we have to go as a Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can do better. Not only can we do better, but we must do better. There is no excuse today for having one Four Star minority general officer, just as there was no excuse 60 years ago for the failure of the Army and the Marine Corps to immediately implement President Truman's noble orders of integration within the services. 
   That is why, together with Representatives Kendrick Meek, Hank Johnson and Kathy Castor, I successfully sponsored the ``Senior Military Leadership Diversity Commission'' amendment to the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. 
   And I would be more than remiss if I did not say that our whip, Mr. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, has made this entire cause of promotions within the ranks one of his major, major themes and something that he has worked on very, very hard, and I want to thank him for all of his efforts. 
   The commission that I spoke about a minute ago will study diversity within the senior leadership of the Armed Forces with the goal of enhancing the role of minorities and women. As I previously observed, Mr. Speaker, shared sacrifice and service to our Nation must be balanced by a fair and equitable sharing of responsibilities, opportunities and promotions.     
   For this reason, the commission's mission will be to evaluate and assess the opportunities for the advancement of minority and female members within the military branches as well as the challenge of retaining our Nation's best and brightest. 
   The Armed Forces continue to be a great career opportunity for the young men and women today. As a Nation, we have a compelling need to further increase the retention and recruitment of minority officers; yet as the co-chair of a task force on minority recruitment in the academies, and as a member of the Board of Visitors of the Naval Academy, I remain deeply concerned. 
   Mr. Speaker, this Nation's long march toward shared opportunity as well as shared sacrifice in the defense of America will continue, as it must. The security and the honor of America are at stake. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my distinguished colleague, Ms. Watson of California.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentlewoman for her strong comments. 
   And I also would note, Mr. Speaker, that throughout these presentations, I think you will hear a common theme, and that is that while minorities are enlisted in the military in the rank and file, there is a concerted effort on our part to make sure that they enter the ranks of officers. It's not enough to give your blood, your sweat, your tears. We want to see more of them in the officer ranks. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Maryland, one of the newest Members of Congress. And she didn't hit the ground running,  she hit the ground flying. From the Fourth Congressional District, Congresswoman Donna Edwards.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentlewoman for her statement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will just take a moment to also salute the members of the Armed Services Committee from the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Kendrick Meek, who has worked very hard on these issues; and certainly Congressman Hank Johnson out of Georgia; and yours truly. 
   So in closing, Mr. Speaker, as all Americans are painfully aware, our history as a Nation has been a collage of contradictions, a struggle between discrimination and social justice, which has been repeatedly overcome by the power of patriotism and love for our Nation. 
   Jim Clyburn loves to tell the story, and many of us have heard these stories, where African American men and women have served many, many years in the military, and then when it came time for them to be promoted, they did not make the list. So after they had given much of their lives to their country, because they were not selected to move up as far as rank was concerned, then they had to leave. And that has happened to so many over and over and over again. 
   But no matter what, they still kept coming. On the one hand, many of them felt that they had not been treated fairly. But on the other hand, they still saluted the flag. They put up the flag every day. They did everything they knew how to be good patriots. Sometimes while they were being wonderful, wonderful patriots, they also found themselves in pain. So it was a dual situation for them, standing up for their country in some instances where they did not feel that their country always stood up for them. And you can hear those stories no matter where you go in any African American neighborhood throughout our country. 
   So going back to President Truman's executive order 9981, requiring the integration of the armed services prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown versus Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act is a testament to this shared struggle. 
   President Truman's executive order was essential to America's history and to his quest to truly offer justice for all. And that's what these soldiers were asking for, simply justice for all. They did not want anybody to do them any big favors. They simply wanted to have what was due them, an opportunity to lead.     
   And so, just as we eventually came together as a Nation to ensure the full implementation of the Executive Order 9981, I thank my colleagues for joining me and coming together as Members of Congress and celebrating the 60th anniversary of this momentous occasion. 
   And I would be more than remiss if I did not give credit to our staff who worked so hard on this special order, Miss Leah Perry, a very distinguished lawyer in her own right, and Miss Ca-Asia Shields, a young lady who is one of our fellows from the military services. And we're very, very pleased with the great work that they did for us.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (CONGRATULATING ENSIGN D<em>e</em>CAROL DAVIS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1241, as amended, which congratulates Ensign DeCarol Davis for her selection as the first African American--and the first African American woman--to serve as valedictorian of a graduating class at the Coast Guard Academy. 
   I also commend Congressman Bennie Thompson, Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, for his work on this resolution and for his tireless efforts to increase diversity not only within the Coast Guard but throughout the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Further, I commend Congressman Tom Davis, who represents Virginia's 11th District--the district in which Ensign Davis graduated from Forest Park High School as class valedictorian--for his work on this resolution and for his service on the Homeland Security Committee. 
   I recently had the privilege of meeting Ensign Davis, who spent her month of post-graduation leave volunteering with a non-profit in Washington, D.C. called D.C. Voices in a program that trains volunteers from the community to perform audits to catalog the needs of D.C. public schools. 
   Ensign Davis is a remarkable--and remarkably poised--young officer. 
   She has been selected as a Truman Scholar--a testament to her intellect and to her outstanding academic accomplishments. 
   Ensign Davis has also won numerous distinctions for her athletic accomplishments--including selection as a 2006 Arthur Ashe Jr.  First Team Sports Scholar for basketball and selection to the 2007 ESPN The Magazine Academic All-District I college women's basketball first team. 
   She combines excellence in the classroom and on the basketball court with a remarkable drive to give back to the community and to help create opportunities for others. In fact, it is her drive to serve others that led her to apply to the Coast Guard Academy. 
   By virtue of her accomplishments at the Academy, she could have chosen any assignment in the Coast Guard. She chose the service's marine safety program. 
   She told me that she made this choice because she wanted to spend her career working to ensure the safety of the maritime transportation system and preserving our Nation's marine resources. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation has been greatly concerned that as the Coast Guard expands to take on its critical new homeland security missions, the service's competence in its traditional missions--particularly the marine safety missions--is declining. 
   I am confident, however, that with officers of the caliber and dedication of Ensign Davis joining the marine safety field, the future of this critical mission is bright indeed. 
   Ensign Davis is truly an inspiring example of the best that the Coast Guard and our Nation have to offer. I look forward to watching the progress of Ensign Davis's career in the coming years--and I know that we will see remarkable things from this young officer. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 1241, as amended, also encourages the Coast Guard to seek and enroll diverse candidates in the Academy's cadet corps. 
   I--and many of my colleagues in the House--are deeply concerned that the Coast Guard Academy's student body does not reflect the diversity of our Nation. Only about 10 percent of the class of 2009, for example, is comprised of minorities. 
   Our Nation's diversity is a strength--but when a school such as the Coast Guard Academy does not have a cadet corps that reflects that diversity, it does not benefit from that strength. 
   In April, the House of Representatives passed the Coast Guard Authorization Act, H.R. 2830, by a vote of 395 to 7. This legislation included provisions that I authored that would alter the admissions process at the Academy to require that students be nominated by a Member of Congress. 
   While I strongly support the actions that the Coast Guard is taking to expand the recruitment of diverse applicants, I also believe that enactment of H.R. 2830--with the provisions requiring nominations to the Academy--offers the best opportunity to expand diversity at the Academy. I urge the Senate to quickly act on this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to express my appreciation to Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Dingell and our entire Congress which has passed a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for an additional 5 years. 
   While I would have preferred a bill with more funding to cover additional children, I am pleased that the $35 billion increase agreed to by House and Senate negotiators will bring health coverage to approximately 10 million children in need, preserving coverage for the 6.6 million who are currently enrolled in a program, while reaching many others who are eligible but not enrolled. 
   I am especially pleased that the agreement ensures quality dental coverage for all children enrolled in CHIP. This provision became a major initiative for me following the tragic death of a 12-year-old Maryland boy named Deamonte Driver. 
   Mr. Speaker, Deamonte died February of this year when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. Eighty dollars worth of dental care might have saved his life, but Deamonte was poor and homeless. He did not have access to a dentist. Deamonte Driver's case was rare and extreme, but he was by no means alone in his suffering. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, dental decay is the second most common chronic childhood disease in this country. And it is preventable. Few public health challenges of this magnitude are so easy to address. We are faced with this problem because we have systematically failed to provide children with the care they need. 
   Approximately 9 million children are uninsured in this country, but more than twice that amount, 20 million, are without dental insurance. That is why I am so glad that we will not only ensure the health coverage of 10 million children, but ensure that they have access to dental care as well. 
   Those of us in the Maryland delegation stood up in support of this vitally important initiative; and in a Congress-wide push, we were joined by 60 of our colleagues. On this issue, Democrats and Republicans from both Chambers have put aside differences to draft critically important legislation that will help American children. Unfortunately, we have received nothing but push-back from the administration. 
   In an arrogant attempt to interfere with the business of Congress, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a letter to States on August 17 that has the potential of drastically limiting some States' ability to implement CHIP. H.R. 976 clarifies States' ability to implement the law, and it also addresses the President's concern that CHIP would not go to cover the Nation's poorest children. On this point, let me be clear: this legislation provides health insurance coverage to poor children, children who were already eligible for the benefit but were not enrolled. 
   President Bush is playing politics with our children's health by threatening to veto the bipartisan CHIP reauthorization and deny 10 million low-income kids the health care they need and deserve. The President has instead expressed support for his own CHIP proposal, which will result in 84,000 low-income children losing their health care coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that my colleagues sent a strong message to the President by voting in favor of the bicameral CHIP reauthorization.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Passenger Improvement Act, and I applaud Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Mica, and Ranking Member Shuster for their hard work on this critical and very, very important piece of legislation. 
   Despite the many challenges it has faced in recent years, Amtrak's ridership has grown for 5 consecutive years and revenue from ticket sales has grown for 3 years. Year after year Amtrak has proven that it is an invaluable asset to the American public and a critical part of our transportation network. 
   Recognizing the vital service that Amtrak provides, Congress has repeatedly provided a level of annual funding support that has exceeded the President's request. However, this funding has not been sufficient to maintain Amtrak's infrastructure in a state of good repair or to enable Amtrak to become a truly modern national rail service. By passing this legislation, Congress will finally take the necessary steps to enable Amtrak to modernize all aspects of the service, including revitalizing infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor. 
   As part of that effort, H.R. 6003 supports the redevelopment of tunnel infrastructure in and around my City of Baltimore and the Potomac tunnel. Opened in 1873, the B&P tunnel's outdated design imposes a number of speed and height restrictions on trains and significantly slows travel time between Washington and New York. There are several studies underway to assess possible new rail alignments through Baltimore, and this bill authorizes $60 million to support the determination of the final alignment by 2023. 
   Modernizing rail alignments in Baltimore is essential to improving service between our Nation's Capitol and all of the States in the Northeast Corridor. 
   I thank Chairman Oberstar and I thank Chairwoman Brown for working with me to address this very critical issue of national importance. I also applaud them for ensuring that at the same time H.R. 6003 makes significant investments in Amtrak, the bill takes appropriate steps to demand accountability of Amtrak for these investments, including requiring Amtrak to implement a modern financial accounting and reporting system not later than 1 year after the date of H.R. 6003's enactment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this long-overdue legislation to provide the investments we need to ensure that America has a safe, effective, and efficient passenger rail system for years to come.

   To say the least, this administration has not prioritized openness in government, and I was not surprised to learn that the President is opposed to the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. 
   I am similarly not surprised to learn that the President and many of his colleagues here in the Congress have threatened that by affording our Federal employees whistleblower protections, we are also threatening national security. This administration has consistently used security threats to strike fear into the public's consciousness. 
   But let me be clear: Claims that the legislation we are considering here today would threaten national security are baseless. If anything, the opposite is true. 
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I know how vitally important it is for Federal officials to be able to share their knowledge and their firsthand experience with the Congress. We now know that, going into the Iraq war, Federal officials at the CIA and the State Department were aware that the pre-war intelligence about Iraq purporting to show that the nation had weapons of mass destruction was wrong. 
   Thousands of Americans and Iraqi lives and billions of American taxpayer dollars could have been saved if these individuals had been able to share their knowledge with a Congress willing to listen to them and protect them from retribution. But, lacking whistleblower protections, they were afraid to do so. 
   Recognizing the critical need for Federal employees to communicate openly with the legislative branch, Congress in 1912 enacted the Lloyd-LaFollette Act. And that act, which has never been repealed, by the way, affords all Federal employees, including employees at the national security agencies, the right to contact Members of Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (CHAMP ACT AND DENTAL HEALTH -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the Children's Health Medicare Protection Act, entitled CHAMP, of 2007,  which makes great strides in improving our Nation's health care system. 
   It chills the conscience to think that approximately 9 million children are currently without health insurance. An estimated 18,000 Americans died last year because they did not have access to health care, many of them sadly were children. 
   There can be no justice until all of our children, our most valuable resource, are granted access to the most technologically advanced system in the world. 
   Individuals travel from every corner of the globe to access our high-quality health care. Yet, we cannot seem to provide care to the individuals in our own backyard. 
   The CHAMP Act would begin to begin to change that injustice, committing $50 billion to reauthorize and improve the State Children's Health Insurance Program, our Nation's health care safety net for low-income, uninsured children. 
   The Act does not expand the SCHIP benefit to wealthy children or adults, as some would argue. It merely provides benefits to the same low-income children who we originally intended to cover. 
   Most of the 9 million children who are currently uninsured are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP, but do not receive the benefits because of enrollment barriers and underfunding. 
   The CHAMP Act will lift the barriers and raise the funding so we can get our children the care they so desperately need. 
   It is with great enthusiasm that I support this landmark legislation. I am pleased that my colleagues have been able to rise above the political rhetoric to develop legislation that will have a significant impact for our Nation's most vulnerable children. I am also pleased that my chairman shares my commitment to improving children's access to dental care. The chairman recognizes, as I do, that oral health is an overall component of overall health, and we cannot afford to ignore the dental health needs of our children. 
   I applaud efforts to include a dental benefits package and dental quality assurance methods in the CHAMP Act. I also want to thank the chairman and of my fellow colleagues from Maryland, including Congressman Albert Wynn, for their support of two initiatives that I had promoted to increase children's access to dental care under this legislation. 
   The first would allow federally qualified health centers to contract with private-practice dentists, significantly enhancing our Nation's dental safety net. The second one requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide educational materials to new mothers on the importance of oral health and the services available to their children, with the goal of stopping dental disease before it even starts. Both initiatives will cost little or nothing, while yielding excellent results for our children. 
   Congressman Wynn and I know the importance of protecting our children from dental disease. It was a short 5 months ago that a 12-year-old Maryland boy died when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. Forty dollars worth of dental care might have saved his life, but he never got that opportunity. 
   As I have said before, Deamonte Driver's case was rare and extreme, but he was by no means alone in his suffering. Dental disease is the single most common chronic disease in this country, and it is preventable. 
   Finally, all it takes on our part is the will to protect our children. I am pleased that so many Members of Congress have demonstrated this will, and I encourage all my colleagues to support the vitally important CHAMP Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (MEETING OUR MORAL OBLIGATION -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago we commemorated the fourth anniversary of the United States' invasion of Iraq. Today we pause, and we voted for the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, and we took a pivotal step in responding to the mandate issued by the American people. 
   I have opposed this war from the very beginning; however, I voted for this legislation because I am realistic about our circumstances. As long as our brave men and women are serving in this country, we have a moral obligation to ensure that they are trained, equipped and rested when they go into battle. Supporting this measure was not easy, especially in light of the fact that a young man from Baltimore, Kendall Waters-Bey, who lived only a few blocks from me, was the first to die in the Iraq war. 
   However, after many discussions with my constituents and much contemplation, I strongly believe that H.R. 1591 was in the best interest of our brave men and women, the people of Iraq, and the people of these great United States. 
   Although I am opposed to the war, I have a responsibility to vote my conscience and a responsibility to help protect the servicemembers while they are risking their lives in Iraq. However, it is more important that we take care of those wounded warriors when they return home. When they have risked so much, we much respect them enough to provide the quality of medical treatment that they deserve. 
   Of the $124 billion to be spent, $900 million will be dedicated to two areas that I feel are of utmost importance, injuries which some military doctors say have become the signature wounds of the Iraq war: traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. This is in addition to the $20 million dedicated to addressing the problems that we saw at Walter Reed. 
   While H.R. 1591 provides $2.8 billion for military health care, this is not nearly enough for the thousands who have already returned or for those who are expected to need that care in the future. However, it is my hope and my intention to revisit this issue at a later date. 
   This legislation is monumental because it marks the first time during our efforts in Iraq that Congress will hold the President accountable. No more blank checks. We have established benchmarks for the war in Iraq that the President himself has repeatedly stated must be reached to resolve this crisis. If these benchmarks are not met, this legislation requires the troops to be fully redeployed by August 2008. 
   I know that there are many reasons that others oppose the legislation; however, the reality of the situation is very simple. Our troops will be in Iraq. In fact, more troops are being mobilized as we speak. We can no longer remain silent. We do not have the right to remain silent. Failing to pass this legislation was no option, because if we had failed to pass the legislation, we would have been in a situation where we would have sent to the President the possibility of a stripped-down supplemental. So we have a moral obligation to provide the equipment and the adequate health care that our troops need. We have done that with the passage of H.R. 1591. 
   I congratulate the Democratic leadership, our Speaker Nancy Pelosi, certainly to Steny Hoyer, and to our whip Jim Clyburn and all of the leadership members.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (WITNESS SECURITY AND PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I have stood before the House many evenings to discuss the problems associated with witness intimidation and its detrimental impact on our judicial system and our communities. 
   Tragically, there has been another ruthless occurrence of witness intimidation in my home town of Baltimore City that I must report tonight. A family who spent 10 years living the American Dream found it destroyed in just 10 minutes. They came home last week to find their home smoldering and torn apart. The phrase ``rats must be killed'' and the word ``snitch'' crossed out with Xs spray painted on their walls. 
   The couple's oldest daughter has been in custody since July for her role in a robbery of a taxicab driver earlier this year. Apparently, her co-conspirators believe she is cooperating with law enforcement on some level. Gang activity also appears to be involved. The word ``blood'' appeared on various parts of the house. 
   Needless to say, the family will not be returning to their home. This is an innocent, hardworking family trying simply to live in peace. They deserve so much better. 
   Unfortunately, when people are willing to cooperate with the police in Baltimore City and other jurisdictions throughout our country, sadly, it has become customary for their homes to be firebombed or for them to be threatened, attacked or even killed. 
   No one can forget the tragedy surrounding the death of Angela and Carnell Dawson and their five children. The entire family was incinerated in October 2002 in the middle of the night when their home was firebombed in retaliation for Ms. Dawson's repeated complaints to police about recurring drug trafficking in her east Baltimore neighborhood. 
   Just 2 years ago, the home of community activist Edna Abier survived a firebomb attack that was launched just because of her attempts to rid her neighborhood of drug dealers. Just a few weeks ago, I had an opportunity to meet with another couple whose home had been firebombed because they were simply trying to cooperate with police. 
   Finally, Carl Lackl was murdered outside of his home with chilling calculation just days before he was scheduled to testify as a witness in a murder case. His murderers lured him out of his home under the premise of looking at his used car that he was trying to sell. 
   Violent crime in the United States is on the rise nationwide, as is drug-related gang activity. However, if witnesses are too afraid to come forward, criminals cannot be prosecuted and our justice system has no credibility and cannot stand. 
   This is why I introduced H.R. 933, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007, which authorizes $270 million over the next 3 years to enable State and local prosecutors who demonstrate a need for the funds to protect witnesses in cases involving gangs or other violence to establish short-term witness protection programs. 
   Improving protection for State and local witnesses will move us one step  closer to alleviating the fears and threats to prospective witnesses and help safeguard our communities from violence. The time has come for us to show our commitment to our constituents and the justice system because, without witnesses, there can simply be no justice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Clean Energy Act of 2007, H.R. 6. 
   This bill, like all of the bills brought to the floor by the Democratic leadership under the Six for '06 package has the same effect, to try to level the proverbial playing field so that every American family has a fighting chance. 
   This bill takes a huge step in the right direction by repealing $14 billion in subsidies given to Big Oil companies and paid for by American taxpayers. It also addresses a future that we know is coming--a future where fossil fuels will be in far less plentiful supply--and sets the stage for investing those profits in clean, renewable and alternative energy technologies and sources. 
   This bill closes tax loopholes for oil companies, rolls back tax breaks for geological and geophysical expenditures and repeals five royalty relief provisions from the 2005 Republican energy bill. In fact, this bill will require companies that have been reaping billions in profits and providing record golden parachute packages to departing CEOs while the average American family has seen an overall decline in income, to pay royalties in order to qualify for new federal leases for drilling. 
   The goal of this bill is energy independence for our country that will allow our foreign policy decisions to be based more on what's good for our citizens and not just what's good for our gas tanks. 
   I applaud the Democratic leadership for bringing this legislation to the floor and I applaud this Congress for successfully passing six critical pieces of legislation that affect the everyday lives of all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Public Health Week and to applaud the passage of legislation to address health issues that impact the quality of life of all Americans. I commend my colleagues for joining me in passing critical health care legislation to improve the lives of Americans, from the youngest to the oldest among us, by increasing their access to care.  
   It is fitting that we address this legislation during National Public Health Week, a time when our attention is focused on the critical need to improve public health. I think it is also fitting that we recognize this week while we remember Ryan White, who died 18 years ago yesterday. This brave young man, whose namesake, the Ryan White CARE Act, has saved so many from the ravages of HIV/AIDS, taught us all an important lesson about our personal roles in improving the public's health. 
   I am the sponsor of two bills that passed this week, the Early Hearing Detection & Intervention Act, which amends the Public Health Service Act regarding early detection, diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss, and the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Management Act, which provides schools with guidelines on how to create appropriate management and emergency plans for children with food allergies. 
   I also support the following bills that were adopted by the House this week: 
   The Wakefield Act, which amends the Public Health Service Act to improve emergency services for children who need treatment for trauma or critical care; 
   The Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act, which provides revised standards for quality assurance in screening and evaluation of gynecologic cytology preparations to ensure that health care professionals who screen and interpret tests for cervical cancer are skilled in today's medical technology; 
   Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, which provides for the expansion and improvement of traumatic brain injury programs by providing grants to States to support the treatment and rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury patients. 
   The Safety of Seniors Act, which directs the United States Department of Health and Human Services to oversee and support education campaigns focused on reducing falls and preventing repeat falls among older Americans; 
   And finally, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, which establishes grant programs to provide for education and outreach on newborn screening and coordinated follow-up care once newborn screening has been conducted. 
   These bills will make great strides in ensuring the public's health and the essential mission of our Nation. Without health, children cannot grow to be all that God meant for them to be, adults cannot fulfill their role as contributing members of our society, and our elderly cannot peacefully live out their golden years. 
   If one were to ask any of us to list those things that might be the enemy of our destiny, we would all have to agree that poor health would be at the top of the list. For this reason, I will continue to fight for the expansion of quality health care programs to help ensure that every American can benefit from a more vibrant and productive quality of life.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Armed Services Committee and a member of the Board of Visitors of the United States Naval Academy, I rise today to express my unwavering support for the men and women who wear the uniform of our proud Nation and to make clear my staunch opposition to putting more of these men and women in harm's way in Iraq. 
   In the absence of a clear and meaningful strategy for success, it is time to extricate our troops out of this civil war and redeploy them out of the occupation of Iraq. 
   Back in 2002, I joined my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus in formulating a brief and succinct statement of principles regarding the Iraq war. Within these principles we expressed our clear opposition to a unilateral first strike action in the absence of clear evidence of an imminent threat to the United States. We further stated that any post-strike plan for maintaining stability in the region would be costly and would likely require a long-term commitment of our troops and treasure. 
   Today, it is very clear that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein has provoked sectarian divisions in the Iraqi society that are now expressed daily through violence on a staggering scale. It is also clear that our efforts to stabilize Iraq has, indeed, required the massive commitment of both lives and taxpayer dollars that we predicted. 
   What was not clear then but is clear now is that this administration had no definite plan for achieving our stated objectives in Iraq.     
   The administration had lofty rhetoric, but no strategy for creating a stable democracy that could be our partner in the war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, I raise these points to remind our Congress that from the beginning of this war there have been voices raised not in opposition to our President but in demand of a strategic approach to the growing threats we face, opposition and demand of an honest assessment of what could be accomplished with military force, and in demand of a clear purpose for why we send our troops into harm's way, our young men and women, the future of our Nation into situations where they may seriously be injured or killed. These are the very points that the resolution before us today demands. 
   I have no illusions about the danger inherent in the growing number of nations that may soon have the capability to construct weapons of mass destruction. To the contrary, I am convinced that maintaining the peace in this increasingly dangerous world has become a precondition to our continued survival. 
   The question is, given the situation in which we find ourselves in Iraq and given that our primary consideration must always be the security of our Nation, is sending additional troops into action most likely to stabilize that nation and the region? Is it the action most likely to cause Iraqis themselves to take the essentially political actions that only they can take to create a government capable of governing? Is  it the action likely to initiate the reconciliation between Sunni and Shiite, and the most recent National Intelligence Estimate says is critical to reducing the violence in Iraq? 
   I have seen no compelling evidence that the answer to any of these questions is ``yes,'' and many of our top military commanders have testified that sending 21,500 more United States forces to Iraq will not create a path to success. 
   Our forces have done all and more than we have asked them to do, and their families have been patiently sacrificing for 4 long years. The voters spoke in November, and we as Members of Congress of the United States do not have the right to remain silent. We cannot allow more to be asked of our soldiers now if their mission is not clear. The President has no plan likely to produce victory. And if, as the National Intelligence estimates suggest, the Iraqi forces and the government are not capable of being partners in their own reconstruction, I urge my colleagues to support our troops by supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1227, the ``Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007.'' This legislation institutes long overdue reforms in our response to the devastation that hurricanes have inflicted on the Gulf Coast region. 
   I have been an outspoken critic of the way this Administration has mismanaged Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, and their resulting aftermath. 
   Anyone who has traveled to the Ninth Ward in New Orleans, as I have, can tell you about overwhelming devastation in that community. Entire city blocks were flattened, with their rooftops smashed and scattered on the ground. 
   The lives of millions were similarly fractured, when governmental systems that were already weak broke down under the pressure from the storm. 
   The entire Nation and the world watched with dismay as news reports chronicled the gross mismanagement and abuse thrust upon the people of New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 
   I told President Bush then that I did not think God would be pleased with our response to the disaster. 
   Sadly, I am not convinced that He would pleased with our current response. 
   One and a half years after the hurricane hit, thousands of Americans remain displaced, their lives and families torn apart first by the storm, and second by the resulting bureaucratic mismanagement. 
   We do not know for sure how many families remain displaced, but our most conservative estimates indicate that at least 150,000 are still affected. 
   Make no mistake: The people of the Gulf Coast region want to return home, but many of them cannot find affordable housing to which to return. 
   Public housing was decimated by the storm. Approximately 70 percent of the 300,000 homes that were severely damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Katrina belonged to low-income families. 
   Homeowners who want to return have been asked to do the impossible. We have appropriated the necessary funds to help rebuild the region, but the money has yet to trickle down to the people. 
   Today, we will take an important step in rectifying this situation by considering the ``Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007.'' 
   The bill would institute much needed reforms, including: freeing up $1.2 billion in funds for Louisiana's Road Home Program, a program that compensates eligible displaced homeowners up to $150,000 for their losses; providing a stock of affordable housing by prohibiting the demolition of public housing until there is a plan in place to replace the current units; and most importantly, extending the Disaster Voucher Program, DVP, for former public housing and Section 8 voucher holders, until January 2008. 
   We have a moral obligation to restore a sense of normalcy to those whose lives have been affected by storms in the Gulf Coast region. They have already suffered for far too long. 
   For this reason, I support and will be voting in favor of H.R. 1227, the ``Gulf Coast Hurricane Housing Recovery Act of 2007.''  
   I would like to thank Chairwoman Maxine Waters and Chairman Barney Frank for their leadership in introducing this vitally important legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Johns Hopkins University located in the Seventh Congressional District in the great State of Maryland for its continued commitment to excellence and its monumental contributions to the advancement of our society and to the health and wellbeing of people throughout the world. 
   Johns Hopkins is a stalwart not only in my hometown of Baltimore City but the entire State of Maryland and this Nation. The university currently supports more than 85,000 Maryland jobs. More than 3 percent of the people receiving paychecks in Maryland either work for Johns Hopkins or have a job because of the money. 
   Additionally, the institution adds at least $7 billion a year of income to the Maryland economy. However, the University's groundbreaking research and contributions that can be felt throughout the entire world. The advancements that have been made in research and technology since the University's establishment in 1876 have been critical in keeping our Nation on the cutting edge. 
   The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is one of the best in the world, receiving more research grants from the National Institutes of Health than any other medical school. The Bloomberg School of Public Health, renowned for contributions worldwide to preventative medicine and the health of large populations, ranks first among public health schools in Federal research support. 
   Madam Speaker, the medical breakthroughs made possible through Johns Hopkins research are saving lives every single day, and the University continues to make great strides in helping men, women, and children who suffer from illness. Just the other day in the Baltimore Sun, for instance, there was an article reporting new, unprecedented success by Johns Hopkins researchers in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. 
   MS is a chronic and often disabling, degenerative condition in which the body's immune system attacks the central nervous system. Symptoms of this disease range from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or blindness, and the programs and severity of this disease is unpredictable. 
   According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, approximately 40,000 Americans are currently suffering from MS and an additional 200 people are being diagnosed each week. Although there are apparently a variety of treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration that can lessen the frequency and severity of MS attacks, there is not yet a cure for this debilitating disease. 
   However, this new research from Johns Hopkins offers a giant leap forward in the search for a cure. In a small college study, nine people were chosen to receive a single infusion of cyclophosphamide over 4 days and were followed for 4 years. Madam Speaker, these nine patients have experienced the most severe symptoms of MS, and most of them had failed to respond to other treatments. 
   At the completion of the 2-year period, researchers found that the treatment not only slowed the progression of MS, but it also restored neurological function that had previously been lost to the disease. Seven of the nine patients showed a decrease in the number of brain lesions in MRIs, and some even began walking, controlling bladder function, and returning to work for the first time in many years. 
   One of the patients in the treatment program, 30-year-old Richard Bauer, summed up succinctly what this research has the potential to offer those who are suffering from MS. And he said, ``I was falling apart ..... trapped in my own body,'' and he continued, ``I'm a regular person again. I've gotten my life back.'' 
   Madam Speaker, there are countless other patients who have benefited tremendously from Johns Hopkins research and who credit this great university for giving them back their lives. I am proud to applaud the work of this great institution and to recognize its contributions to the State of Maryland, to our Nation, and indeed the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I just want to take a moment to make it clear that I support H. Res. 1304. It provides for a structured rule, and I fully support the rule. 
   As I was sitting here, I had to change my remarks in my head because, as I was listening to Mr. Nunes, I could not help but think about the people in my district of Baltimore, only 40 miles away from here, who aren't worried about whose fault it is. What they are concerned about are solutions to their problems so they can get back and forth to work, so that they can go shopping, so that they can do the things that they would normally do. I think that this rule and then this bill are a major step in the right direction in trying to help them. 
   In a sense, I kind of agree with Mr. Nunes. I'm not anxious to do a lot of blaming because the people I represent get tired of watching C-SPAN; they get tired of the back and forth, and they simply want the Congress to come together to find solutions to their problems. 
   Yes, it is true that gas prices have risen to more than $4 per gallon. The Joint Economic Committee, on which I also serve, has reported that households can expect to spend as much as 25 percent more on gasoline this year than last year. This is a tremendous burden for the many households that I represent, and they simply cannot bear it. If, as I fear, these prices represent a new paradigm, we, as a nation, must urgently assess how we can adjust to ensure our economy can continue to grow while we conserve energy. 
   I believe that one of the best adjustments we can make is to support the increased use of public transit, which already saves the United States the equivalent of 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline per year. Unfortunately, in many areas, such as my hometown of Baltimore where public transportation already provides more than 93 million annual trips, transit agencies face budget constraints that are limiting their ability to grow to meet the new demand. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, the Federal contribution to public transit services totals less than 20 percent of all revenue accruing to these services. Local governments contribute nearly half of the revenue needed to provide public transit, but these governments are facing funding constraints. 
   H.R. 6052 would provide an additional $1.7 billion in Federal funding for public transportation in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, funding that is essential to ensure that we can keep our Nation moving while conserving fuel. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill that increases Federal investments in public transit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Coast Guard Subcommittee, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1126 which provides a rule for the consideration of H.R. 2830 and makes in order an amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
   The base text of H.R. 2830, which was ordered to be reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in June 2007, already includes many significant provisions to strengthen the Coast Guard and respond to challenges we face in maritime transportation. For example, the bill, as reported, includes standards to prevent the continued introduction of invasive species in U.S. waters through ballast water. The bill creates an ombudsman in each Coast Guard district to serve as a liaison between the Coast Guard and the port community. And the bill introduces critical measures to improve the safety of the United States fishing industry, one of our Nation's deadliest professions. 
   The amendment in the nature of a substitute adds critical titles that address specific issues considered by the Committee on Transportation and the Coast Guard Subcommittee after the bill was reported. Specifically, the amendment includes titles that strengthen both the Coast Guard's homeland security functions and its maritime safety missions. The amendment in the nature of a substitute also transfers the appeals of cases in which the Coast Guard decides to spend or revoke a mariner's credential to a neutral agency, the National Transportation Safety Board. 
   Further, the amendment includes the text of H.R. 2722, the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act which previously passed the House by a vote of 426-0 and which would strengthen the Coast Guard's ability to manage the $24 billion, 25-year Deepwater procurements. 
   Similarly, the amendment includes the text of the Maritime Pollution Prevent Act to reduce emissions from ships. This measure also previously passed the House. Adoption of H. Res. 1126 would enable the House to consider long-overdue legislation to authorize the Coast Guard and to strengthen our U.S. maritime industry, and I urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007. 
   The time is long past due for Congress to, once and for all, act to end discrimination against patients seeking treatment for mental illness and addiction. More than 57 million Americans suffer from mental illness and more than 26 million suffer from addiction. Unfortunately, our Nation's investment in services for individuals with mental illness and addiction has not kept pace with the trend. Last year, untreated mental illness cost the U.S. economy over $150 billion, and untreated addiction cost over $400 billion. 
   H.R. 1424 reverses this trend by guaranteeing that plans cover the same range of mental illnesses and addiction disorders offered by the Federal employee health plan that Members of Congress use; prohibiting insurers and group health plans from imposing treatment of financial limitations when they offer mental health benefits that are more restrictive from those applied to medical and surgical services; and creating medical management tools that are based on valid medical evidence and pertinent to the patient's medical condition so that specific coverage is not arbitrary and is more transparent to the patient. 
   This is a piece of legislation that is critically important to our Nation and to my constituents. 
   Just the other day I received a letter from a Mr. Smith in my district, whose son, a 16-year-old, was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
   Last spring Mr. Smith's son started using marijuana and used it increasingly as the months progressed in what was described as self-medication. His grades dropped and he withdrew from his friends and showed other signs of substance abuse. 
   When his parents placed him in an outpatient counseling facility, Mr. Smith learned, to his surprise, that the necessary treatment was not covered under his employer-based health insurance. After that counseling proved ineffective, he sent his son to a facility for in-patient treatment which cost approximately $25,000. 
   This legislation is very important, and I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the rule and the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (WHY A SHORT-TERM WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM IS NECESSARY: THE CASE OF CARL LACKL -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I was motivated to address the issue of witness intimidation after the death of Angela and Cornell Dawson and their five children, ages 9 to 14. The entire family was killed, or should I say incinerated, in October 2002 when their home was firebombed in retaliation for Mrs. Dawson's repeated complaints to the police about recurring drug trafficking in her east Baltimore neighborhood. 
   Since this time, witness intimidation has become a plague on our justice system. According to the National Institute of Justice, 51 percent of prosecutors in large jurisdictions find witness intimidation to be a major problem. Additionally, prosecutors in large jurisdictions suspect that witness intimidation occurs in up to 75 to 100 percent of the violent crimes committed in gang-dominated neighborhoods. In my hometown of Baltimore, it is estimated that witness intimidation occurs in 90 percent of the cases that are prosecuted. 
   To make matters worse, the murder rate in the city is also at a record-breaking high. Today's Baltimore Sun reported that since January 1, there have been 229 homicides in Baltimore. At this pace, it is conceivable that the city will regretfully reach 300 homicides by the end of the year. While this figure is significantly lower than the record high of 353 homicides in 1993, the current situation is simply unacceptable. We need for our citizens to come forward by reporting crimes to law enforcement and testifying in court when appropriate. However, these simple acts have become a serious threat to one's life. 
   It is time to combat what is commonly referred to as a ``conspiracy of silence,'' and this is why I am asking  my colleagues to cosponsor and to support the passage of H.R. 933, the Witness Security Protection Act of 2007, should it come to the House floor for a vote. Upon enactment, this legislation authorizes $90 million per year over the next 3 years to enable State and local prosecutors to provide witness protection on their own or to pay the cost of enrolling their witnesses in the Short-Term State Witness Protection Program to be created within the United States Marshals Service. 
   In closing, I will highlight a recent case that exemplifies the need for this type of program. 
   On his way to lunch in March 2006, Carl Stanley Lackl, Jr., walked through a Baltimore City alley and witnessed Patrick Byers shoot Larry Haynes. Not only did Carl Lackl call the police, he stayed with the dying victim, comforting and reassuring him as paramedics arrived. Mr. Lackl was prepared to testify as a key witness in Byers' trial. 
   Unfortunately, Carl Lackl will not get the opportunity to carry out his civic duty. He was killed 8 days before the trial, gunned down in front of his home. Police have accused Byers of sending a text message to an associate giving Lackl's name and address and offering $1,000 to have him killed. 
   According to police, Lackl was at home at about 8:45 when he received a call about a Cadillac that he was selling. As he stood next to the Cadillac, a dark-colored car drove up, and a 15-year-old inside shot him three times, in the arm, chest and leg. Carl Lackl was pronounced dead soon after arriving at a nearby hospital. 
   Mr. Lackl deserved better. By all accounts, he was a hard worker and a devoted father. My prayers go out to his mother, his daughter, and his entire family. We can and should do better. 
   Mr. Speaker, witness intimidation is a growing national problem jeopardizing the criminal justice system's ability to protect the public. This issue must be addressed because without witnesses there can be no justice. 
   Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 933, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (DESIGNATING A PORTION OF INTERSTATE ROUTE 395 LOCATED IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, AS ``CAL RIPKEN WAY'' -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to rise in support of H.R. 3218, which was authored by my colleague from Maryland, Congressman JOHN SARBANES, to designate a portion of I-395 in Baltimore as ``Cal Ripken Way.'' 
   Cal Ripken, Jr. played for 21 seasons with my hometown team, the Baltimore Orioles. Known as the Iron Man, he is perhaps most famous for playing in 2,632 consecutive games, breaking the record for consecutive appearances that was set by another legend of baseball, Lou Gehrig. 
   However, his career was not only about his resilience but about the dedication and the hard work he brought, both to the field and to our community. He finished his career with more than 3,000 hits, an incredible achievement that is one of the most difficult to accomplish in baseball. These hits included 431 home runs, and they produced 1,695 RBIs. 
   He began his career by earning the Rookie of the Year award. He went on to receive two Golden Glove awards, and was twice named the American League's Most Valuable Player. He was also twice named as the Most Valuable Player at the Major League All Star Game. 
   In recognition of his achievements and of his importance to the game of baseball, he was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame this year, the first year in which he was eligible to be so honored. Cal Ripken represents the very best that we have ever seen in the game of baseball. 
   Since leaving baseball, he has come to represent the very best of our community and, indeed, of our Nation by finding new ways to help build the same dedication to excellence in our young people that he brought to his incredible career. He established and  manages the Cal Ripken Baseball Division, in which literally hundreds of thousands of youngsters have participated, learning not only the skills of baseball, but the work ethic that will help them succeed in whatever they choose to do in life.     
   With his brother, he also established the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation in honor of their father to give underprivileged youth the opportunity to participate in baseball and softball. 
   In recognition of his ability to motivate and inspire, he was recently selected to serve our Nation as a Special Sports Envoy for the United States Department of State. At the time of his appointment, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice noted that Cal Ripken brought ``integrity to the game of baseball,'' and I think his personal integrity is truly his greatest legacy. 
   Cal Ripken is not only a sports hero who has achieved extraordinary accomplishments through hard work and sheer perseverance, he is a popular figure who has cultivated, in a way that increasingly few sports figures do, his ability to be a positive role model. 
   Cal has synchronized his personal character with his physical abilities and has consistently used his extraordinary gifts to make a difference in the lives of others. 
   As a Baltimorean, I thank my colleague Congressman Sarbanes for his work on this legislation. I join all of my colleagues from Maryland in recognizing the incredible legacy that Cal Ripken has given not only to our city but to our Nation of excellence on the field and service off the field. I can think of no more fitting way to honor Cal Ripken than by naming the interstate that passes by Camden Yards, which is only a few blocks from my house, where he played his entire career in his honor, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3218. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I want to thank again Mr. Sarbanes for sponsorship. I want to thank you, Mr. Duncan. I didn't know you had that kind of relationship to baseball and to the Baltimore Orioles. 
   As I listened to Mr. Duncan and Mr. Sarbanes, Madam Speaker, I was just reminded that, sitting on the Government Reform Committee, in that committee we dealt with the whole issue of steroids. We saw players come before our committee, many of them having to put their heads down when asked certain critical questions about character. And it is so good to know that there is somebody like Cal Ripken around, somebody who does not mind accepting the role as a role model and being just that. 
   So many young people look up to sports figures, and they try to emulate them. All you have to do is go to a baseball game and you will see them with the jerseys on with names of players on the back. And if you go to Memorial Stadium, now called Oriole Park, you will see a lot of jerseys with little kids, trying to dream the Cal Ripken dream, with his name on their backs. 
   So it is with great honor that I ask all of our Members to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (DEAMONTE'S LAW -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that I have introduced Deamonte's Law, a bill to establish a dental home for every American child by increasing dental services in the community health centers and training more individuals in pediatric dentistry. 
   The legislation is named for Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died on February 25, 2007 when a tooth infection spread to his brain. A routine dental checkup might have saved his life, but Deamonte was poor and homeless and he did not have access to a dentist. 
   When I learned of this senseless tragedy, I was deeply shaken. I simply cannot comprehend how in this country, where we have sent men to the Moon, we let a little boy's teeth rot so badly that his infection became fatal. 
   I often say that as adults we have a responsibility to provide for and to protect our children, and we failed miserably to meet that responsibility for little Deamonte. I think we all should be ashamed by that fact. I know I am. 
   That is why I have made a commitment to addressing this issue from every single angle. I knew that if Deamonte was suffering in my home State of Maryland, other little boys and girls like him were probably also suffering. 
   To be clear, Deamonte's case was rare and extreme. However, even the most casual investigation reveals that children across this great Nation are living with painful, untreated tooth decay, many of them dangerously close to acquiring life-threatening infections. 
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that tooth decay in baby teeth has increased 15 percent among United States toddlers and preschoolers 2 years old to 5 years old between 1988 to 1994, and 1994 to 2004. Tooth decay is the single most common childhood chronic disease, and it disproportionately affects poor and minority children. Eighty percent of dental decay occurs in just 25 percent of children, and parents are three times more likely to report that their children's dental needs are unmet when compared to the general medical care needs. 
   A silent epidemic of dental disease is plaguing our children, and our inability to address this issue has simply been horrifying. That is why I have introduced Deamonte's Law, which would address two critical factors contributing to the inability of children like Deamonte to access a dentist. 
   Deamonte's Law would ensure that children like Deamonte have access to dental services in communities where they live. Community health centers provide a health safety net to underserved areas, such as rural and urban communities. However, an estimated 42 percent have gaps in their capacity to provide dental care. Deamonte's Law would address this issue by establishing a 5-year, $5 million pilot program to provide funds for dentists, equipment, and construction for dental services at community health centers. The program would also provide support for contractual relationships between centers and private practice dentists. 
   Deamonte's Law would also address the dentist shortage. The United States Department of Health and Human Services estimates that there is a shortage of 4,650 dentists, and pediatric dentists are even more scarce. Deamonte's Law would address this issue by establishing a 5-year, $5 million pilot program to enhance training and academic programs in pediatric dentistry, recruit and train dentists to study pediatrics, and provide continuing education for practicing dentists. 
   The legislation is endorsed by the American Dental Association. I was joined in introducing this legislation by my good friend, Chairman HENRY WAXMAN of California, and Subcommittee Chairman DENNIS KUCINICH of Ohio. I want to thank both Congressmen for their leadership and dedication to this issue. 
   On May 2, 2007, at my request, we conducted an oversight hearing entitled ``Evaluating Pediatric Dental Care under Medicaid to Investigate Deamonte Driver's Death.'' At the hearing, it became apparent that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has categorically failed to meet its oversight responsibility with regards to ensuring the State health departments and the managed care organizations that they contract with are in compliance with the law. 
   Section 1905(r)(3) of the Social Security Act ensures that every Medicaid-eligible child will have access to medically necessary dental care under the early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment provision. However, it is evident from our investigation that this has not been the case, and so I urge my colleagues to join in sponsoring this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (NATIONAL MEN'S HEALTH WEEK -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to thank my colleagues for just a few minutes ago passing unanimously H. Con. Res. 138, which I introduced recognizing June 9 through 15, 2008, as National Men's Health Week. 
   The need for this legislation could not be more evident, as far too many of our friends, brothers, uncles, cousins, grandfathers and fathers die each day from illnesses and diseases that are treatable. 
   Despite the advances in medical technology and research, men continue to live an average of almost 6 years less than women, and African American men have the lowest life expectancy of all groups. 
   Further, all of the 10 leading causes of death, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, affect men at a higher percentage rate than women. 
   Men simply are not getting the care they need. Women are 100 percent more likely to visit the doctor for an annual examination and to get preventive care. 
   This happens for a variety of reasons, including fear on the part of men, lack of health insurance, a macho attitude, thinking that they cannot be harmed, lack of information and cost factors. The disparity in men's health has led to increased risk of death from heart disease and cancer. But these problems do not only affect men. 
   More than one-half of elderly widows now living in poverty were not poor before the deaths of their husbands, and by age 100, women outnumber men eight to one. 
   We simply must get more men the early care and education they need to lead long, healthy lives. That is why I sponsored this resolution that recognizes June 9 through June 15 as National Men's Health Week. We need to educate both the public and health care providers about the importance of early detection of male health problems to reduce rates of mortality for common diseases. 
   Appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific antigen, PSA, exams,  blood pressure screening, cholesterol screening and in conjunction with clinical examination and self-testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result in the detection of many of these problems in their early stages. This early detection can lead to increases in the survival rates to nearly 100 percent of men. 
   National Men's Health Week was established by Congress in 1994. The week is designed to encourage men and their families to engage in appropriate health behaviors, and the resulting increased awareness has improved health-related education and helped prevent illnesses. 
   Men who are educated about the value that preventive health can play in prolonging their life span and their roles as productive family members will be more likely to participate in preventive care. 
   By recognizing National Men's Health Week, we bring this very important issue to the forefront, encouraging discussion and promoting this critical education in early detection. 
   I thank Chairman Waxman and Subcommittee Chairman Davis for their support, and I appreciate my colleagues voting in favor of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise today in support of H. Res. 386, as amended. 
   This resolution recognizes the goals of National Safe Boating Week and recognizes the Coast Guard and the Coast Guard Auxiliary for the outstanding work that they do to keep boaters safe and to rescue those in distress at sea. 
   Like so many other of the critical safety awareness campaigns in the transportation field, National Safe Boating Week came about through the dedication of a concerned voluntary group. The North American Safe Boating Campaign began some 50 years ago this year. In 1958, a year after the campaign began, Congress passed a joint resolution that authorized and requested the President to designate the week prior to Memorial Day weekend as National Safe Boating Week. 
   In keeping with this tradition, this year, on May 10, President Bush again  designated the week before Memorial Day as National Safe Boating Week. According to the Coast Guard, as of 2005, there were just under 13 million registered recreational boats in the United States. In 2005 a total of 4,969 recreational boating accidents were reported to the Coast Guard, although it is likely that there were many more accidents that were never reported. 
   According to the Coast Guard, the leading types of recreational boating accidents were collisions and falls overboard. Careless inattention on the part of a boat's operator was the largest single cause of recreational boating accidents in 2005. 
   However, the use of alcohol was the largest cause of accidents that resulted in fatalities. Simply put, mixing boats and alcohol can yield the same fatal results that mixing cars and alcohol can yield. In 2005, recreational boating accidents caused nearly 3,500 injuries and nearly 700 deaths. Total deaths in 2005 were down approximately 25 percent below the total of 924 fatalities experienced in 1991. Unfortunately, however, recreational boating deaths in 2005 increased after 3 straight years of steady decline. 
   The Coast Guard reports that of the nearly 700 people who died in recreational boating accidents in 2005, 491 died as a result of drowning and 426 of those who drowned were not wearing a life jacket. In my own State of Maryland, 13 of the 15 people who died in recreational boating accidents drowned. 
   In response to the prevalence of drowning as the cause of death among recreational boaters, the theme of this year's National Safe Boating Week is simply ``Wear It.'' This imperative emphasizes the singular importance of the use of personal flotation devices during recreational boating. 
   Importantly, however, it is not enough merely to have a personal flotational device on board a boat. Recreational boaters must familiarize themselves with the use of life jackets and should also take the time to experience swimming while wearing the device. 
   I commend all those in our Nation's boating clubs who work year round to train recreational boaters on safe boating practices and to maintain awareness of safe boating practices. 
   In closing, I want to recognize the outstanding work that the Coast Guard performs preserving life at sea. I have often said they are our thin blue line at sea, and that they are. Last year the Coast Guard saved more than 4,400 lives in the course of its search and rescue operations, many of which were performed under very difficult and dangerous circumstances. 
   Just yesterday, we were again reminded of the incredible dedication and skill that the Coast Guard brings to their work when they coordinated the successful evacuation of a reported 281 passengers and crew members from the Empress of the North cruise ship off the coast of Alaska. 
   Finally, I want to remember the Coast Guardsmen who have been lost this year, and all who have died in our Nation's service. I thank all of the members of the Coast Guard for their outstanding work. I also thank them for their work in the gulf coast during the Hurricane Katrina storm. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Very briefly, we want to again congratulate Mrs. Drake on the sponsorship of this legislation. It is very important. 
   One of the things our Subcommittee on the Coast Guard just recently had, we had a hearing with regard to fishing safety. One of the interesting things that came forth during that discussion and during that hearing was how the industry was so very much interested in making sure that there was boating safety, and they wanted to make sure that their industry was regulated.     
   That was very pleasing to our ears. So it is with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (COMMEMORATING MARINAS AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR SIXTH ANNUAL NATIONAL MARINA DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 343, as amended, which would support designation of August 11, 2007, as the sixth annual National Marina Day. 
   National Marina Day recognizes the central role that marinas play in giving shelter and providing gateways to the nearly 13 million recreational boats registered in the United States. National Marina Day is also intended to recognize the important role that recreational boaters and marina operators play in protecting our Nation's critical marine resources. 
   Recreational boating is a central part of the tourism and recreation industry in the United States. According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, in 2005 recreational boating generated an estimated $37 billion in sales and services nationwide. In my own State of Maryland, there are just over 200,000 registered boats. A study by the Maryland Sea Grant program estimated that in 2005 every 7.5 boats in the State supported a job in our State's economy and contributed just over $7,600 in economic activity. Recreational boating contributed an estimated $1.8 billion to the State's gross product. 
   The millions of Americans who participate in recreational boating activities rely on the estimated 12,000 marinas and associated boating facilities in our Nation to access not only the water, but also the support services that boats and boaters need. An estimated 30 percent of these marinas are owned by municipal or State governments and provide the public with water access at low or limited cost. The remaining 70 percent of marinas are private, and many are owner-operated facilities with long family histories. 
   Importantly, however, marinas are not only centers where boats can obtain fuel and services. They are also centers providing boating safety and boating education programs intended to help improve the operating proficiency of recreational boaters.     
   Though 35 States now have some type of operator education or licensing  requirement, the National Transportation Safety Board reported in 2007 that more than 80 percent of all recreational boaters have still never taken any kind of boating educational program. Perhaps in large measure as a result of the still limited enrollment in recreational boating safety classes, total deaths in recreational boating exceed deaths in general aviation. Marinas will continue to play a critical role in helping to reduce boating accidents and to lower the number of fatalities associated with recreational boating by organizing and hosting boating education programs to complement the technical services they provide. 
   I hope that all marina operators through these United States will take the opportunity afforded this year by the National Marina Day to continue their vital effort to expand boating safety programs and efforts. I commend marina operators for their vital role in supporting recreational boating in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSWOMAN JUANITA MILLENDER-M<em>c</em>DONALD -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday we will lay to rest a truly gifted friend, colleague, and public servant, Representative from the California's 37th Congressional District, Juanita Millender-McDonald. So today I would like to pay tribute to her legacy. 
   In 1997 Glamour Magazine wisely named Congresswoman Millender-McDonald as ``one of 11 women who will change the world.'' And even though she has left us before her time, her very significant and meaningful impact on the world is known. 
   Although Congresswoman Millender-McDonald has crossed over, her actions will continue to reverberate for us and for generations yet unborn. 
   We both came to the Congress as a result of special elections in 1996. She came on March 25 and I was sworn in on April 26. As a close colleague, I was proud to see her take the helm of the House Administration Committee, which deemed her the ``Mayor of the House of Representatives.'' And, indeed, she was. In fact, she was the first African American woman to chair a House Committee. 
   Further, within this committee, she was a leader in addressing issues of voting irregularities and voter disenfranchisement. 
   I also worked closely with her on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for 11 years. And most recently, as Congress worked with the passage of the SAFETEA-LU bill, a major piece of legislation addressing highways, transit, and other public legislation, she was indeed a strong advocate for her district and for her State. 
   When I served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, I asked her to serve as the chairperson of the Annual Legislative Weekend, and she did with class. 
   2003, the year that she served as head of the Annual Legislative Weekend, was a very difficult year for all of us. The caucus had several issues to confront: Widespread unemployment, the war in Iraq, and coping with the negative effects of the Bush administration policies. Still, amidst these tough times, she led a 4-day conference entitled, ``Collective Leadership--Challenging a Bold New World.'' 
   That conference reenergized our constituencies to fight for that better world that she fought for every day. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald changed the world by being a pioneer, and she paved a path for many to follow. She was the first African American woman to serve on the Carson City Council. She was the first to hold the position of chairperson of two very powerful California State Assembly committees, Insurance and Revenue Taxation, in her first term. 
   Here in Washington she gave a voice to the voiceless by speaking out against genocide in Cambodia, Darfur, and other regions of the world. She also addressed global HIV/AIDS, which was a major issue for her, and she conducted an annual march in her district. 
   During the 108th Congress, she drafted language that was incorporated into the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act, which authorized funding to reduce mother-to-child transmissions of HIV/AIDS and gave priority in awarding of funds to organizations focused on family survival. 
   In the 109th Congress, she introduced legislation to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that would establish a network of pediatric centers in certain developing countries to provide treatment and care for children with HIV/AIDS. She fought tirelessly for women's rights and empowering women to be all that they can be. 
   As the first Democratic chair of the Congressional Democratic Caucus for Women's Issues, she led the caucus on two groundbreaking meetings, the first with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to talk about the plight of women globally, and another with the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange to develop strategies for increasing women's investments and net worth. 
   She also worked to give women who served our country in uniform during wartime the recognition which they richly deserved. In this regard, she initiated the first annual Memorial Day tribute to women in the military at the Women's Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, and led the fight to secure $15 million for the maintenance of that memorial. 
   Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald did indeed change the world, and she will not be forgotten. My prayers go out to her husband and her family.

   As the chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, I am pleased that the first piece of maritime legislation to be brought to the floor by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is a bill that will enable us to combat pollution emitted by ships. 
   The Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2007, H.R. 802, would institute the legal changes needed to bring the United States into compliance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the MARPOL Convention Annex VI.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today to express strong support for H.R. 6842. I was proud to join Mr. Waxman and other members of our committee on Tuesday when we passed this bill out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I find it odd that certain individuals in Congress feel the need to weigh in on this subject now when it is still in the process of being resolved. 
   Specifically, H.R. 6691, legislation introduced by Representative Childers, entitled the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, which will be offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute, goes far beyond the court's intent. This amendment flies in the face  of the Heller decision by prohibiting the District of Columbia from enacting any future laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms. 
   Aside from my concerns about whether Congress ought to weigh in on what is essentially a local issue, I seriously question whether Representative Childers or any other Member of this body would appreciate Congress determining the gun laws in their congressional districts. 
   The proposed legislation is simply bad policy. We can all agree that different communities, whether they are urban, rural or suburban, require different types of regulation. The District of Columbia in particular presents a unique case. 
   No one in the Congress can tell me that they do not understand the specific homeland security issues that the National Capital region faces. We have allocated millions of Federal dollars to secure this city because we recognize that we are all still sitting in one big target. 
   With the number of U.S. officials and foreign dignitaries who live, work and travel here every day, it's simply astounding that there are not more acts of violence than we currently have. This is a tribute to the fine work of the law enforcement officials who patrol these streets and I, for one, simply cannot understand why we would fail to give them all the tools they need to do their work effectively and efficiently. 
   Let's be clear. They support this legislation. Allowing an individual to own an unregistered AK-47 in our Nation's Capital is pure insanity. And so I support the legislation, and I would ask our Members to vote against the substitute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, I want to thank Ms. Waters for this absolutely brilliant legislation, very comprehensive, and I also want to thank Chairman Barney Frank. 
   Madam Chairman, later today the Fed is expected to lower interest rates for the first time in 4 years to protect the economy in hopes of making homes less expensive for people to finance certain credit card debt and for homeowners to take out popular home equity lines of credit, which often are used to pay for education, home improvements, or medical bills. 
   The Fed's actions today will have a positive impact on homeownership, as will our consideration of H.R. 1852. This legislation will allow FHA to carry out its function of assisting creditworthy, low-income and credit-risk citizens in becoming homeowners. Most importantly, the FHA will be able to steer these people away from the predatory practices of the subprime mortgage industry. 
   Some of the most important features of H.R. 1852 include raising the program's loan limit to $417,000; providing refinancing opportunities to borrowers struggling to meet their mortgage payments; authorizing zero and lower down-payment loans for qualified borrowers; and enhancing FHA's reverse mortgage program to help seniors pay for health and other expenses, by removing the loan cap to avoid program shutdowns and raising loan limits. 
   Again, I applaud Chairman Waters for her outstanding leadership in this area, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding and for his tremendous leadership of our Transportation Committee and getting this bill to the floor and his cosponsorship. I also want to thank Mr. LaTourette for his leadership, and certainly our ranking member of our overall committee, Mr. Mica. 
   At the beginning of the 110th Congress, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Oberstar laid out an agenda for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee focusing on three critical objectives: Ensuring the safety and security of transportation and infrastructure; supporting expanded investment; and combating global warming. 
   The measure before us today, the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2008, H.R. 802, represents yet another step towards the achievement of this agenda, and I applaud Chairman Oberstar for his focused leadership on one of the most urgent transportation issues confronting our Nation. 
   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise in strong support of H.R. 802, which would institute the legal changes needed to bring the United States into compliance with Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships, known as MARPOL. 
   This legislation passed the House of Representatives on March 26, 2007, by a vote of 359-48. The bill finally passed the Senate with a minor amendment at the end of last month, and that amended bill now returns to the House for our consideration. 
   MARPOL is a treaty negotiated by the members of the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations body responsible for developing the treaties that are essentially the sole international regulations for ocean shipping. 
   The MARPOL convention currently has six annexes limiting various forms of pollution from ships. Annex VI was negotiated to control air pollution and has been in force internationally since 2005. With the enactment of H.R. 802, the United States would finally align our Nation's laws to comply with this annex. Among other measures, Annex VI imposes limits on the sulfur content of the fuel utilized by ships, limits the emission of nitrogen oxides from ships' engines, and prohibits the deliberate release of substances that deplete atmospheric ozone. 
   In the United States, ships are essentially the last major non-regulated source of ozone depleting emissions and they are a growing threat to the world's air quality. In fact, some estimates suggest that the emissions of sulfur oxide from ships may now exceed the combined output from all the cars, trucks and buses in the world. 
   Unfortunately, the missions standards imposed by Annex VI are still very moderate. As a result, the United States has been actively working with our international partners to strengthen the annex's emissions controls through the development of new amendments. Among other changes, these proposed amendments which are now under consideration by the IMO would reduce allowable sulfur content in fuel from the current 4.5 percent to 3.5 percent in 2012, and require subsequent reductions through 2020. 
   A vote is scheduled on these new amendments by the current parties to Annex VI in October of this year. Critically, if the United States has not deposited with IMO its instrument of ratification of Annex VI at least 3 months prior to that vote, the United States will not be allowed to vote for the strengthened emission controls that we have worked to craft. 
   Mr. Speaker, implementation of the United States MARPOL Annex VI offers us the first opportunity to limit emissions from ships. Further, by joining this treaty now, we ensure that the United States can continue to lead the effort to achieve additional reductions in polluting emissions from oceangoing vessels. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt H.R. 802 today, and I urge the President to sign this measure as quickly as possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I associate myself with the words that have already been spoken by all of my colleagues. 
   My last colleague who spoke, I just want Mr. Scott, as I listened to him I could not help but think about the first chapter of Habakkuk, fifth verse, and in that verse it says that God says that He will do miracles and He will do it during our time, and if He were to tell us what those miracles would be, we would not believe Him. 
   I rise in support of this resolution, sponsored by the distinguished gentleman from Georgia, commemorating the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King on the 40th anniversary of his assassination. 
   Mr. Speaker, young Americans of this time are the third generation to come of age since Representative John Lewis and other brave young Americans worked with Dr. King to lead America from inequity towards justice and from violence toward a more peace-filled world. 
   We have been inspired and heartened to witness the young people of our time engaged in the democratic process this year like no other. They are renewing Dr. King's message and are crying out to us in Dr. King's voice, through the often harsh realities of their lives. 
   I must submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that whatever their ethnic backgrounds may be, far too many of these idealistic young Americans are being subjected to the most crippling segregation of all, the segregation from opportunity that is the inevitable result of poverty. I've often said that our children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see. 
   And Mr. Speaker, this new, energized, and determined generation is also challenging the foreign policies of this great Nation, even as Dr. King challenged American foreign policy four decades ago. 
   In this spirit, Mr. Speaker, I join Representative Lewis, a true American hero who put his own life and safety on the line for these American principles, and I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this resolution. In doing so, we honor Dr. King and his legacy to America through our actions, as well as through our words. 
   And as it was said in Habakkuk, miracles will happen. The question is whether we will believe in them and do as Dr. King did. Dr. King looked out, and he was not blinded by what he saw, but he saw things that others did not see, but more significantly, he took his vision and put it in the form of a mission and accomplished much.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 because Americans desperately need a raise. 
   Currently, millions of Americans go to work every day but still cannot afford to make ends meet. Sadly, children are at the losing end of this equation. Seven million families cannot afford to adequately provide for their children because they are working for poverty wages. With this bill, we can begin to turn that trend around. 
   Working families are the true beneficiaries of this legislation. Nearly 80 percent of affected workers are adults, and 46 percent of affected families rely solely on the earnings of minimum wage workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, nearly 15 million Americans will likely benefit from this bill, millions of them children whose parents are losing quite a bit of money as we speak. 
   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Representative Miller, and my friend, Steny Hoyer, for their tireless work on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the ``College Student Relief Act of 2007,'' H.R. 5. Every opportunity I get, I tell young people about the benefits of a college education. I use my own experience as an example of the opportunities that higher education can afford. I have a bachelor's degree from Howard University and a law degree from the University of Maryland and I am convinced that, without those degrees, I would not be standing before you today. The statistics support this assertion. The poverty rate for college graduates is about one-third that of high school graduates and individuals with college degrees are less likely to be unemployed. Further, women with bachelor's degrees earn 70 percent more than those with high school diplomas, and for men the difference is 63 percent. 
   Regrettably, a college education is becoming increasingly inaccessible in this country. A recent assessment by The Education Trust entitled, ``Engines of Inequality: Diminishing Equity in the Nation's Premier Public Universities,'' finds that public institutions are no longer the engines of upward social mobility that they once were. To the contrary, these institutions are pursuing increased selectivity over expanded opportunity--targeting wealthier students to improve rankings in college guides. Some argue that the system is now a meritocracy, but this is by no means the case. The highest achieving students from high-income families are nearly four times more likely to attend a highly selective university than the highest achievers from low-income families. 
   Our nation's low-income and middle-class students are being pushed out of premier colleges and universities simply because they cannot afford to attend. Tuition and fees have risen by 35 percent in the past five years, and the typical student now graduates with $17,500 of debt. The Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance predicts that rising costs will prevent at least 4.4 million high school graduates from attending college over the next decade. This trend affects not only individual students, but our nation as a whole. By 2020, the U.S. is expected to experience a shortage of nearly 12 million college-educated workers, losing its competitive edge in the global marketplace. 
   That is why I stand before you today to express my strong support for this bill, which would cut student loan interest rates in half over five years--giving 5.5 million students a much needed break in the cost of college. In my home state of Maryland alone, 48,484 students would get a break. We must do all that we can to provide every American with access to a college education. I want to thank Mr. Miller and the Democratic leadership for introducing this vitally important legislation and bringing us one step closer to achieving that goal.

   As chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, I am committed to expanding diversity throughout the United States Coast Guard. With merely 22 minorities in a graduating class of 222 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy, including them in the commission is imperative. 
   I am proud to say that this amendment brings us closer to achieving diversity in the senior leadership levels in all of the services, something that the Tuskegee Airmen only dreamed about nearly 67 years ago.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. And I also want to associate myself with the words of the lady from Texas who just spoke. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the bill. To date, President Bush has asked us for a total of $804 billion for fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yesterday, the Joint Economic Committee, the committee on which I sit, concluded in a report that the real economic cost of these wars is $1.6 trillion. However, there are numerous hidden costs that could potentially bring the grand total to $3.5 trillion. 
   In response to the President's failing new strategy in Iraq and wasteful spending, Congress has chosen instead to ensure strict accountability. We have heard the American people and have chosen to exercise fiscal responsibility by considering this vitally important legislation. 
   Namely, the bill limits funding in the amount of $50 billion, in comparison to the President's original supplemental request of $196.4 billion, to continue our military operations in Iraq, while ensuring that the responsible and strategic redeployment of our forces begins no later than 30 days from the date of enactment. 
   It also provides troops with the resources needed for continued protection from improvised explosive devices. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to exercise their responsibility to the American people, to over 3,800 brave soldiers, 71 from Maryland who have died and who have paid the ultimate price, and to more than 2.3 million Iraqis who have fled their homes, by supporting the rule and voting in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (KENDELL FREDERICK CITIZENSHIP ASSISTANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. To Chairwoman LOFGREN, I want to thank you for your leadership. And certainly to Chairman Conyers and the ranking member and ranking member of the subcommittee, I want to thank all of you for getting this bill to the floor. Finally, I want to thank the professional staff on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration for working so diligently with my staff to bring this legislation again to the floor of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act truly is a step towards correcting and honoring our non-citizen servicemembers, many of whom continue to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is appropriate, therefore, that we consider this legislation as we approach Veterans Day, honoring all who have risked their lives to protect our own. 
   I introduced the Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act to ensure that those who are willing to fight relentlessly on the battlefield to protect our great Nation do not have to also battle through a drawn-out citizenship process. Specifically, H.R. 2884 will assist our noncitizen servicemen and -women on the road to citizenship by making the following needed adjustments: 
   Requiring the United States Department of Homeland Security to use the fingerprints taken by the Defense Department at induction for citizen applications; 
   Requiring noncitizen military servicemembers to submit their citizenship applications within 24 hours of enlistment; 
   Requiring the Department of Defense and DHS to determine a single acceptable format for fingerprint submission; 
   Requiring DHS to update appropriate application forms for naturalization, the instruction and guidebook for obtaining naturalization, and the DHS Web site when naturalization procedures pertaining to members of the Armed Forces are changed; and 
   Ensuring efficiency and accountability to Congress by requiring the Government Accountability Office to report on DHS's training of personnel, methods and effectiveness in adjudicating applications by members of the Armed Forces. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation honors the memory of a young man from my district, 21-year-old Army Reserve Specialist Kendell K. Frederick. He was a resident of Baltimore County and a native of Trinidad who was stationed in Iraq and died while trying to journey to another post in order to meet the citizenship application fingerprinting requirement. In other words, if he didn't have to go through the changes that he went through, he probably would still be with us today. And one of the interesting things that was mentioned a little bit earlier, he was part of the ROTC process, but he was also a young man, when he entered the military, he entered and made agreement to serve in the military for 8 years. I mean, even knowing that there was a war going on, he bravely said, I want to serve my country. And he claimed this as his country and still went out there and fought, but he wasn't even a citizen yet of our country. 
   Namely, after trying for more than a year to become a citizen and having his application delayed at least five times due to miscommunication and misinformation in processing his fingerprints, keep in mind the reason why he was killed was he was on his way trying to get his fingerprints done over there in Iraq, Specialist Frederick had no choice but to travel with a convoy to a base to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, he was killed on the way by a roadside bomb, never realizing his dream of becoming an American citizen. And the interesting thing is that he was in the last vehicle of the convoy. 
   Mr. Speaker, Specialist Frederick embraced a Nation that had failed to fully embrace him by honoring him with citizenship during his lifetime. And it's interesting I think that it was a day or so after he died, then they gave him citizenship. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2884 to make certain that no other soldier who wants to be a citizen will have to jump through unnecessary bureaucratic hoops. These outstanding noncitizen soldiers such as Specialist Frederick have made the choice to give voluntarily to our Nation by fighting the terrorist groups that threaten us, putting their lives on the line, sacrificing their blood, their sweat, their tears, and their lives. 
   I urge my colleagues to please vote in favor of this legislation. I know his mother is watching, and I know that she will be very moved. This is something that has been a long journey for her. And with that, I thank the gentlelady for your courtesy.

   I want to say to the last gentleman that spoke, it is because we support our troops, because we care about them and their families, that we support this legislation. 159,000 of our troops are currently deployed in battle to stabilize Iraq.     
   On Tuesday, the United States Department of Defense reported that another 20,000 will be sent to Iraq for rotation duty. 
   In the meantime, our servicemembers continue to suffer through multiple deployments with little time for rest or to retrain. The DOD has continuously failed to meet the goal of deploying active duty troops for 1 year and allowing them to rest for 2, along with ensuring that Reservists are deployed for 1 year and rest for 5. This failure has often been called a backdoor draft. 
   Not only has ongoing multiple deployments had a detrimental physical and emotional impact on our troops and their families, but it also has hindered the Armed Forces' ability to reach its retention and recruitment goals. Namely, both the Army and Air Force have failed to reach their retention goals for the mid-career and career personnel. At the current rate, there will be few officers and enlisted soldiers left to lead. Who will be our next generation of soldiers? I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great honor this evening to talk about my good friend and mentor, former Congressman Parren Mitchell. 
   I said today at his memorial service that Parren Mitchell was without a doubt a man of great humility. He was a mentor of mine; and many, many years ago we came in contact with each other. One of the things that he made clear was that being in elected office is not about seeking to be a celebrity. It must be about service. He was one who made it his business to serve his constituents to the nth degree. 
   If you were to ride around the 7th Congressional District, much of which is in the inner city of Baltimore, you would hear people, from presidents of corporations to the folks working in the markets to the bank tellers, call him PJ. They called him PJ not out of disrespect. They called him PJ because of their love for him and because of his humble spirit. 
   It was not unusual for Parren Mitchell to show up at a church or show up at a funeral or show up at somebody's Eagle Scout ceremony. He was the kind of guy who spent his lifetime trying to lift up other people. 
   The interesting thing, too, is that he did something for African American young people that very few have been able to do. When he ran for office in 1968, he lost by about 5,000 votes. Now, in many instances, if somebody got a total of 15,000 votes, which he did, and lost by 5,000, which he did, they would give up. 
   Two years later, Parren Mitchell came back and in 1970 was elected by a tremendous landslide margin of 38 votes, and that was so significant for us because back then I was in high school, and it showed me that an African American could be elected to the Congress of the United States of America. 
   In other words, what Parren Mitchell showed us was what we thought to be impossible was possible, and since that time we have seen Kweisi Mfume come to this body, and yours truly, and we've seen African American Congressmen from all over this country, and I would venture to say that he had a tremendous impact on others, in the Hispanic community and women and  many others, who may have thought at one time it was almost impossible to come here. 
   And so we pay tribute to this great man. His record is clear: a staunch advocate for small business; a staunch advocate for those who have been left out; a staunch advocate for making sure that civil rights are adhered to. 
   And finally, let me say this, Mr. Speaker, as I summarize Parren's life in a written piece for the Afro-American newspaper, Parren Mitchell was one who built bridges to opportunities and tore down walls which caused people not to be included in this society.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (PASSAGE OF THE DEEPWATER BILL -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House of Representatives resoundingly supported efforts to strengthen the management of the Coast Guard's $24 billion, 25-year Deepwater procurement effort by passing the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, H.R. 2722, which I authored, and they voted by a sum of 426-0 for that bill. 
   I want to again thank Congressman James Oberstar, the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for his leadership on this legislation. I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Mica, and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Congressman LaTourette, for their work on this bill. 
   And certainly I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson, for his wise counsel and his efforts to get the bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm confident that the enactment of H.R. 2722 will help restore the trust of the American people in the ability of the United States Coast Guard to manage taxpayers' resources and to hold contractors accountable for the quality of the assets that they produce. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House and with my colleagues in the Senate, particularly Senator Maria Cantwell, the chair of the Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee, to take the steps necessary to put legislation forward to strengthen the Coast Guard's management of Deepwater on the President's desk. 
   The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, which it is my honor to chair, continues to work diligently to oversee not only the Deepwater project but, indeed, all of the operations of the United States Coast Guard. 
   Yesterday, the subcommittee held a hearing to examine the Coast Guard's administrative law system, which weighs allegations of misconduct or negligence to determine whether a mariner's credentials should be suspended or even revoked. 
   The subcommittee received testimony from two former administrative law judges suggesting that during their tenure they worked in an atmosphere that did not support their exercise of judicial independence in the consideration of their cases. 
   Additionally, serious allegations were raised that, if true, would imply that improper actions may have been committed to direct an ALJ to decide matters in the Coast Guard's favor. 
   Such testimony is obviously deeply disturbing, and again, I emphasize, if true, we suggest that the scales of the Coast Guard's justice and administrative law system are not evenly balanced. 
   While we continue investigating the allegations raised, I do know that any administrative law system must not only ensure that there is no impropriety in the conduct of administrative proceedings but that there is not even the appearance of unfairness in the system. 
   I now believe that the administrative law system reviewing cases against mariners should be separated from the  Coast Guard, and I look forward to continuing to work with the ranking member of the subcommittee and with all subcommittee members to consider how best to achieve that objective. 
   Our subcommittee will conduct a second oversight hearing this week. Tomorrow, we will examine the Coast Guard's marine safety program. This hearing will provide a comprehensive examination of whether the Coast Guard personnel have the expertise, the experience and the continuity necessary to effectively inspect vessels, license mariners and develop the regulations that will make vessels safer and protect our natural environment. 
   The Coast Guard is our thin blue line at sea and a critical part of our Nation's homeland security system. The Deepwater bill passed by the House and the oversight hearings held by the subcommittee this week will help to ensure that this thin blue line is as strong as it possibly can be and that the service is working effectively and efficiently to meet the highest expectations of the American people. 
   Again, I applaud the passage of the Deepwater bill and express my gratitude for the dedication of the great men and brave women that serve in the Coast Guard.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3162, CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and to express my strong support for the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007, which makes great strides in improving our Nation's health care system. 
   It chills the conscience to think that approximately 9 million American children are currently without health insurance. 
   There can be no justice until all of our children, our most valuable resource, are granted access to the most technologically advanced medical system in the world. 
   The CHAMP Act commits $50 billion to reauthorize and improve SCHIP, our Nation's health care safety net for low-income, uninsured children. 
   The CHAMP Act would lift enrollment barriers and increase funding so that we can get our children the care that they need. 
   I'm also very pleased that Chairman Dingell shares my commitment to improving children's access to dental care by including a guaranteed dental benefit and two other dental-related measures that I have requested in H.R. 3162. Chairman Dingell also recognizes, as I do, that oral health is an important component for overall health. 
   With that, I urge the Members to vote for the rule and for the Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION ISSUES -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss some important issues that confront the 110th Congress regarding the structure and missions of the United States Coast Guard and the broader field of maritime transportation. 
   I am deeply honored to have been selected by Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR and by my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to chair the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee and to move on an ambitious agenda that will address these critical issues. 
   I look forward to implementing the three policy objectives that Chairman Oberstar has laid out for the Transportation Committee, which include ensuring the safety and security of our transportation infrastructure; supporting expanded investment in transportation infrastructure to relieve congestion and enhance mobility; and ensuring environmental stewardship, including combating global warming. 
   In the area of safety and security, the subcommittee will diligently oversee the implementation of the Coast Guard's $8.3 billion fiscal year 2007 budget, including the more than $1.1 billion appropriated to fund the rehabilitation and modernization of the Coast Guard's fleet through the Deepwater procurement program. 
   The United States Coast Guard is a critical part of our homeland security system, and is the lead agency responsible for ensuring the security of all ports in our Nation, including the more than 150 ports that handle the bulk of our Nation's foreign and commercial commerce. 
   The Coast Guard is also a vital part of our emergency response system, as demonstrated when it was the only Federal agency that could come to the rescue of thousands of Hurricane Katrina victims left stranded in the Gulf. 
   Our subcommittee will closely examine whether the Coast Guard has adequate resources to enable it to implement its significant new Homeland Security responsibilities while also fulfilling its other critical missions, including drug interdiction, search and rescue, and maritime safety oversight. 
   We began that effort just yesterday with an oversight hearing on the Coast Guard's $24 billion, 25-year Deepwater procurement, through which the Coast Guard is acquiring the ships, planes and helicopters that the service will utilize for decades to come to ensure the safety and security of the American people, United States ports, and our maritime industry. 
   Importantly, our subcommittee will also balance oversight of the Coast Guard with our responsibility to strengthen maritime transportation. 
   The United States Maritime Administration estimates that the total volume of trade handled by U.S. ports will double in the next 15 years, Mr. Speaker. To prepare our Nation to handle such cargo growth, we will examine how U.S. ports can more fully be integrated into a multi-modal transportation network. 
   We will also work to foster a pragmatic dialogue between the members of the commercial maritime community and the United States Coast Guard to ensure that each group understands what the other needs to succeed in what should be their complementary pursuits.     
   Security of the United States ports and cargo transported through them will be a major priority of the subcommittee. The House of Representatives has already passed H.R. 1, which not only implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission but exceeded these recommendations by phasing in requirements that will lead to the scanning of all cargo bound for United States ports. 
   The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation will work closely with the Committee on Homeland Security, led ably by Chairman Bennie Thompson, to examine the gaps that remain in port security and to fill these gaps in ways that protect our Nation from emerging threats while not unduly slowing commerce to our ports.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a graduate of Howard University and first-generation graduate of college, to see my daughter graduate from Howard University, too, and then to sit on the board of Morgan State University, this bill is very, very important. 
   I have had an opportunity to visit a lot of historically black colleges and universities. I have often said if they did not exist, we would have to invent them because they have touched so many people. But so often when we go to campuses, we see buildings that are in very bad shape. Sometimes it almost brings tears to your eyes to think that students will come from far away and so often when they get there, so often they are disappointed. But the fact is that they still learn. 
   But it is nice to know that extending this bonding authority will be helpful to them in getting these buildings built and renovated. It is so very, very important. So I want to congratulate Mr. Miller and the committee, and certainly Mr. Clyburn. 
   I have often said that our children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see. I think if we are going to send a powerful message, our children must be educated and they must be educated in the best facilities. They must be educated with the best faculties. So as one who also represents Morgan State and Coppin, as well as Sojourner-Douglass in my district, I think this bill is so very, very important; and I think it says a lot about this body that we would even be doing this.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (SECOND CHANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the House on the passage of H.R. 1593, the Second Chance Act. I congratulate my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Danny Davis, who has worked so long and so hard on this legislation. 
   I am also proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation because so many of our citizens who have been led off course deserve a second chance. 
   While the Nation's crime rates have fallen over the last decade, there has been an unprecedented explosion in prison and jail populations, of which 650,000 men and women are released from State and Federal prisons each year, and an even larger number of people are being released from our local jails. 
   These individuals are arriving on the doorsteps of my neighborhood in Baltimore and in neighborhoods across this great country. Unfortunately, we are failing to integrate far too many of these returning neighbors into the economic and social life of our communities. And, as a result, they are returning to crime and, before long, returning to prison. 
   Nearly two-thirds of released prisoners are expected to be rearrested for felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years of release. Such high recidivism rates translate into thousands of new crimes each year, at least half of which can be averted through improved prisoner reentry efforts. 
   For me, these statistics are not nameless and faceless people. They are very real. I live in the inner city of Baltimore, where approximately 700 to 800 former prisoners are reentering our neighborhoods from prison every month. 
   A lot of good work is being done in the City of Baltimore to move these individuals on the path to productive citizenship; however, we can do much more and we can do better. 
   The Second Chance Act will do just that by addressing critical breakdowns in the services provided. The legislation will strengthen overall efforts to reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and help States and cities to better address the growing population of ex-offenders returning to our communities. 
   The bill focuses on development and support of programs that provide alternatives to incarceration, expand the availability of substance abuse treatment, strengthen families, and expand comprehensive reentry services. 
   We must end the vicious cycle of recidivism for the benefit of our communities and, indeed, our country. This is an issue that touches many of the problems that our society faces every day. Take, for example, the scourge of illicit drugs; 70 to 80 percent of offenders reentering the community have histories of substance abuse. And if the treatment they need is not sought or available upon release, relapse is likely. 
   Prison reentry programs are on the front lines of our national war on drugs, and they are desperately needed in communities like Baltimore City where this war has become increasingly violent. Ex-offenders need help to make a smooth transition into civilian life. Once they make that transition, they have the potential to serve as critical resources to our communities, acting as mentors to our young people and working to unravel the same criminal network to which they once belonged. 
   Reentry programs produce successful outcomes for our communities and our citizens, but they are also cost effective. Taxpayer dollars that could go to providing education, health care, or other vitally important services are instead going to support the costly criminal justice system. According to  the Bureau of Justice statistics, expenditures on corrections alone increased from $9 billion in 1992 to $44 billion in 1997. Those numbers have continued to rise over the past decade. We stand to save billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing recidivism rates by steering our ex-offenders away from a life of crime and into a productive society. 
   Every human being deserves a second chance to turn his or her life around. That is why I am so glad that we have passed H.R. 1593, the Second Chance Act. And again, I thank Congressman DANNY DAVIS for his leadership in introducing and spearheading this legislation. I applaud all of my colleagues who voted in favor of it, and I urge the Senate to move swiftly.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (SUPPORT H.R. 933, THE WITNESS SECURITY AND PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the deeply troubling issue of terrorism right here in our own backyard. It is a problem that is endangering our children, threatening our families, and plaguing our neighborhoods. I am talking about the brazen acts of violence, fire bombings and shootings that are preventing the good people in our communities from testifying to the crimes that they have witnessed. Who can blame them, when they are sitting targets for those who have no shame? 
   In cities across America, people are murdered in broad daylight and their killers are walking free because we cannot adequately address the issue of witness intimidation. We have all heard the news reports regarding the ``anti-snitching'' campaigns that have appeared in so many of our communities, but few of us are aware of what these efforts really mean to the people on the ground. But all around us, evidence of these campaigns' impact is present. Murder rates are at a record-breaking high this summer in my hometown of Baltimore City and indeed in communities across the country where criminals have persistently evaded law enforcement. 
   In order to combat this problem, I introduced H.R. 993, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007. Upon enactment, this legislation authorizes $90 million per year over the next 3 years to assist State and local law enforcement with witness protection, while fostering Federal, State, and local partnerships. 
   Priority will be given to prosecuting officers and States with an average of at least 100 murders during the immediate past 5 years. However, smaller entities will also have a chance to receive funding. State and local prosecutors will also be able to use these funds to provide witness protection on their own or to pay the costs of enrolling their witnesses in the short-term State Witness Protection Program to be created within the United States Marshals Service's office.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (INTEGRATED DEEPWATER PROGRAM REFORM ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Madam Speaker, the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, H.R. 2722, which I authored in my capacity as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, is a critical piece of legislation that will strengthen the management of the Coast Guard's Deepwater procurement program. 
   H.R. 2722 passed both the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on a voice vote and has enjoyed bipartisan support from the members of both the subcommittee and the full committee. 
   I wish to express my deepest appreciation to Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR for his leadership and support on this measure, and, indeed, for his leadership of our committee. 
   I also express my appreciation to the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Mica, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Congressman LaTourette, for their leadership and the commitment they have shown to the success of our United States Coast Guard through their work on the bill before us today. 
   Further, I wish to thank Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON for his wise counsel on this bill and for working with us to get this bill to the floor today. 
   Deepwater is a $24 billion, 25-year procurement effort through which the Coast Guard will replace or rehabilitate all of its cutters and aircraft. Management of the program was awarded in 2002 through a performance-based contract to a private sector team comprised of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, now known as the Integrated Coast Guard Systems or ICGS. 
   Unfortunately, some of the procurements conducted under Deepwater over the past 5 years have experienced unacceptable failures that have delayed the production of needed assets and contributed to a significant shortfall in Coast Guard patrol hours. 
   Perhaps the most widely publicized failure of the Deepwater program is the failure of the effort to lengthen 110-foot patrol boats already in the Coast Guard's fleet to 123 feet. The lengthening was intended to upgrade these boats and extend their service lives while newer assets were being developed. 
   Though warned by Navy experts that the proposed designs for the lengthening was inadequate, the Coast Guard proceeded with the effort anyway. Eight boats, which originally cost some $60 million to produce and which had many years of additional service life left, buckled soon after they were lengthened and now sit sadly in the Coast Guard yard in Baltimore waiting for the scrap heap. 
   Unfortunately, the failure of the 123-foot patrol boats is not the sole failure of the Deepwater program. The initial design of the Fast Response Cutter was also beset by technical failures, though fortunately these were identified before any ships were built. While this acquisition effort has now been revamped, the GAO reported earlier this year that the design failure has delayed the procurement by at least 2 years. 
   Together, the failed effort to lengthen the 110-foot patrol boats and the failure of the first design of the Fast Response Cutter wasted another $100 million of hard-earned American taxpayer dollars. 
   Similarly, despite the obligation of another $100 million, the initial design effort on the Vertical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, which is needed to enhance the surveillance capacity of the National Security Cutter, also failed. This craft had originally been scheduled for delivery in 2007, but the GAO estimates that delivery will now be delayed by as much as 6 years, meaning that the first National Security Cutters will likely enter service without the vehicles. 
   More recently, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General found that the hull fatigue life on the National Security Cutter, the most expensive asset to be procured under the Deepwater program, may not meet contractual requirements. The IG warns that fixing the hulls of the first two NSCs, which are already well into production, will add potentially significant costs to these ships and may even affect their operational capabilities. 
   Despite this troubling record of failure and waste, during the first 4 years of the Deepwater program, the Coast Guard ranked the contractor performance between ``very good'' and ``excellent'' and awarded the ICGS team some $16 million in award fees; in other words, in bonuses. 
   Such a situation is ridiculous and intolerable. Having convened now three hearings on Deepwater in the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation in the 110th Congress and having chaired an investigative hearing on the 120-foot patrol boat program convened in the full Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure by Chairman Oberstar, we have had the opportunity to closely examine the failures in contractor performance and in Coast Guard management that have occurred since 2002.     
   H.R. 2722 responds directly to these failures by requiring the creation of the management systems and the appointment of the personnel needed to enable the Coast Guard to manage Deepwater as effectively as the service managed the truly amazing rescues of victims during Hurricane Katrina. 
   Under the leadership of Commandant Thad Allen, the service is already moving decisively to correct past mistakes. Admiral Allen has formed a new procurement directorate to professionalize acquisition management and to put the business practices in place needed to effectively oversee contractor performance and to create lines of strict accountability. 
   The Coast Guard is now also directly managing the procurement of the Fast Response Cutter, and it has issued a solicitation that includes new measures specifically intended to focus the procurement on producing an asset that will meet all performance requirements. 
   The Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, H.R. 2722, would build on the important reforms Admiral Allen has already enacted by putting in place a comprehensive package of reforms that will strengthen the institutional capacity of the Coast Guard to manage not only Deepwater but all other procurements for years to come. 
   Specifically, H.R. 2722 will require that the Coast Guard be in charge of all technical decisions on Deepwater and would require the use of full and open competition for the procurement of new assets to ensure that the Coast Guard receives the best value for taxpayers' resources. 
   H.R. 2722 also sets rigorous new standards for the testing and certification of all Deepwater assets. 
   The bill requires that all new National Security Cutters procured from the date of enactment be certified by an independent third party to meet all contractual requirements. 
   The DHS Inspector General has testified before our subcommittee that the four audits of Deepwater he has conducted over the past 2 1/2 years have revealed the dominant influence of expediency and schedule over performance quality in the management of this program. 
   Unfortunately, the shoddy results of the prioritization of expediency and schedule can be seen in the 123-foot patrol boats, which cannot float, and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, which did not fly. 
   Professional certification of the design and construction of NSCs 3 through 8 will help ensure that these assets do not have any structural shortcomings, as such certification should be accommodated in all procurement schedules. 
   Further, given the serious concerns that currently exist over hull fatigue with NSCs 1 and 2, H.R. 2722 requires that the design used in all future NSCs be submitted to an assessment conducted by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, before construction on the new NSCs begin. 
   Carderock identified many of the potential hull fatigue problems with NSC 1 and their expertise will help assess whether proposed design changes for subsequent NSCs truly correct design problems that could shorten the hull fatigue life of those ships. 
   H.R. 2722 requires that all other new cutters acquired under Deepwater be classified by the American Bureau of Shipping, and it requires that all new aircraft and aircraft engines be certified for airworthiness by an independent third party.  
   Significantly, H.R. 2722 also requires the appointment of a civilian as the head of the acquisitions directorate. Both the DHS Inspector General and the GAO have testified before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation regarding the importance of personnel continuity in the effective management of acquisitions contracts. 
   Appointment of a civilian with a career's worth of experience in procurement will bring to the Coast Guard the level of expertise that simply is not cultivated among the service's uniformed personnel given that the service lacks a career path to train acquisitions professionals. Of course, while the appointment of a civilian to head Coast Guard acquisitions functions cannot guarantee continuity, the appointment of a uniformed servicemember will guarantee turnover on a predictable schedule. 
   With the implementation of these measures that will prepare the Coast Guard to manage Deepwater, H.R. 2722 requires that private sector contractors be phased out as the lead systems integrator by October 1, 2011. This phase-out can occur prior to that date if the Coast Guard certifies they have the personnel and systems in place they need to perform the lead systems integration function. 
   Madam Speaker, I remain completely confident in Admiral Allen's leadership of the Coast Guard and in his management of the Deepwater program, but I also believe that Congress must act to build within the Coast Guard the systems that will enable the service to effectively manage procurement efforts, and manage taxpayer resources, long after Admiral Allen has retired. 
   The men and women of the Coast Guard will rely on the assets procured under Deepwater for decades to come to defend our homeland against an ever-growing range of threats. This is a procurement effort that simply must be managed correctly, and I'm confident that the enactment of H.R. 2722 will ensure that it is. 
   This bill has enjoyed bipartisan support, both in the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I also note that the Congressional Budget Office has found that enacting this measure will not affect revenues or direct spending in any way and could result in lower procurement expenditures and reduce the long-term costs of the Deepwater program. 
   In closing, I again commend Chairman JIM OBERSTAR, chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for his strong support and his commitment to excellence. Under his inspired leadership, our committee has truly returned oversight and strict accountability to the agenda and is working to enact the ground-breaking policies that are essential to meeting the transportation challenges of the 21st century. 
   I also commend the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Mica, for his leadership and support on this measure; and I commend the ranking member of our subcommittee, the distinguished gentleman, Mr. LaTourette, for his hard work and his outstanding leadership on the subcommittee. 
   I urge my colleagues to demonstrate their commitment to our brave young men and women in our Coast Guard, our thin blue line at sea, by supporting H.R. 2722, as amended. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of this legislation, and I thank my colleague Mr. Green for sponsoring it. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I was recently outraged about an incident that happened at the Coast Guard Academy that has been referenced here earlier where a noose was left in the bag of an African American cadet, and then a training diversity officer, a noose was left in her bag also. 
   Following these incidents, I went to the head of the Coast Guard, Admiral Thad Allen, and at my request he and I visited the academy to remind the cadets that despite their numerous accomplishments, they will be judged by their weakest link. I stressed that any attack against our Nation's defenders weakens and endangers us all. 
   I also talked to them about the strength of our Nation as a free people and of their decision to put on the uniform of the United States Coast Guard, symbolizing their duty to defend and uphold the right of every person in our Nation to live in freedom, security and respect. 
   In my own life, I have learned through personal experience more about the devastating impact of racial hatred than anyone should learn. And this is what I know: Racism is an evil that seeks to destroy the possibility that exists in every human being. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this time of integration and prosperity, some have regretfully forgotten the negative stigma surrounding the noose and why it cannot be displayed in jest. It is important to remind these few that over 4,700 people were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1959. And while the majority of lynching victims were African Americans, many Italians, Jews and Mexicans have been lynched throughout this Nation's history as well. 
   The noose is a symbol of oppression, hatred and intimidation for many racial and ethnic groups, and we cannot tolerate its display. We must respond to these incidents with determination and clarity, and H. Res. 826 is just one positive step in that direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to adopt House Resolution 822 and to recognize the 100th anniversary of the  Port of Los Angeles. I want to thank you, Mr. LaTourette, for yielding time, and you, Ms. Richardson, for your very, very fine work which I will get back to in a moment. 
   During its first century, the Port of Los Angeles has grown to become a massive freight processing complex encompassing 27 cargo terminals which handle more than 43 percent of all the goods arriving in the United States. By any metric, the size of operations at the Port of Los Angeles is simply staggering. Over just the past 11 years, as part of the San Pedro Bay Port Complex, the port has grown 246 percent, generating $256 billion in commerce and $28 billion in tax revenue. That is simply astounding. 
   Already the largest container terminal in the United States, the port handled more than 8.5 million 20-foot container units last year alone. By 2030, the port complex is expected to triple its cargo handling activities again. 
   Not surprisingly, the port is an industry leader in all aspects of transportation. In 2002, the port was a principal partner of the $2.5 billion Alameda Corridor project, which connected the port to America's transcontinental rail system with a 20-mile rail expressway. Created through a partnership with local, regional and statewide agencies, this project epitomizes the multi-modal connections that are essential to speeding and easing freight movements through our Nation's ports. 
   The port has also undertaken a dedicated effort to address the impacts of its operations on the local environment through the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, which is intended to reduce air pollution from port activities by nearly 50 percent in 5 years. 
   The action plan is the world's first program proposed to significantly reduce health risks around a major port by combating regional air pollution from port-related operations. 
   I also want to take a moment to salute Ms. Richardson. She has, without a doubt, I think it was Ms. Lee that said that she came in and hit the ground running. I say she hit the ground flying, including her work just recently with me. When we visited San Francisco, she was the only other subcommittee member who attended the special field hearing convened by our subcommittee to examine the terrible oil spill in San Francisco Bay. Ms. Richardson ably represents California's 37th Congressional District, including the interests of the Port of Los Angeles as evidenced through her work on the resolution before us today. I shall never forget in her opening statement on the floor in the well of this House, one of the things that she mentioned, Madam Speaker, was that she wanted to make sure that the port and the port's interests in her district were well situated and that they were made better by her presence in this great House. And so I want to applaud her for her efforts. 
   I want to thank her for her insight, and I am so, so excited that she is part of the subcommittee which I chair. And with that, Madam Speaker, I thank her and I thank my ranking member on our subcommittee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act, which I have cosponsored, because we have an obligation to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. 
   I am simply appalled by the reports of pervasive waste, fraud and abuse in government contracting. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I led a hearing back on January 30 on the U.S. Coast Guard's troubled $24 billion 25-year-long Integrated Deep Water Systems Project. 
   The project was supposed to modernize the Coast Guard's aging fleet, but a series of failures by contractors and poor oversight by the Coast Guard have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars instead.  
   In one of the more disturbing examples, the modernization of 49, 110-foot patrol boats was halted when the hulls of the first eight modernized boats cracked upon being sent out to sea. 
   In the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and in the House Armed Services Committee, we have consistently heard reports of waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq contracting. Examples include: a report from the Iraq Special Inspector General, Stuart Bowen. He found gross mismanagement in a $75 million contract awarded to Parsons Corporation to build the largest police academy in Iraq. According to the report, the police academy was so poorly constructed that feces and urine rained from the ceilings into the barracks of students, floors heaved inches off the ground and cracked apart, and water dripped so profusely in one room that it was dubbed ``the rainforest.'' 
   Investigators fear that, with its structural integrity in question, the academy is beyond repair, and public health concerns are being raised. 
   Unfortunately, this scenario is not unprecedented. In total, Pentagon auditors have identified $3.5 billion in questionable and unsupported costs in Iraq reconstruction contracts. For one Halliburton contract alone, its $16.5 billion logistic civil augmentation program, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, identified $1.1 billion in questionable costs. 
   Halliburton whistleblowers have shed light on the company's deceitful practices, reporting that the company paid subcontractors up to $45 for a case of soda and $100 for a 15-pound bag of laundry. 
   And the IG in the past has reported that Parsons, despite spending $186 million of a $500 million contract to build hospitals and health clinics, has barely gotten the project off the ground, with just 20 of the 142 clinics completed. The list of such atrocities is endless. 
   Last Monday we visited Walter Reed Medical Center for a field hearing of the Oversight and Government Reforms Committee's Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs to investigate reports that substandard treatment is being provided to our troops and veterans. There, too, contracting played a role. 
   It appears that wherever we find failures in government these days, contractors are sure to be involved. We have consistently been told by this administration that privatization of critical government functions would cost less. But instead it has been both costly and ineffective. 
   We need accountability in contracting. We need the Accountability in Contracting Act. This vitally important legislation would institute critical reforms, including limiting the length of non-competitive contracts, minimizing no-bid contracts, minimizing cost-plus contracts, ensuring public disclosure of justification for no-bid contracts, disclosing contractor overcharges, funding contract oversight, and closing the revolving door.     
   Mr. Chairman, I want to applaud you for doing such an outstanding job on this legislation. And I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, for Fiscal Year 2008. This legislation is vital to preventing terrorism and suppressing potential rogue states by updating our defense systems, which will in turn protect the future of our Nation and our men and women at home. 
   The ill-advised war in Iraq has put historic strains on our armed services. 
   Our readiness is at an all-time low not witnessed since the 1970s. The Army National Guard is operating with only 56 percent of its overall equipment needs. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the funding and enactment of this bill is crucial. By authorizing $692.3 billion for defense and energy-defense related initiatives in 2008, this bill will strengthen our military. It will also honor our veterans with the efficient and cutting edge health care they more than deserve. 
   I am proud to say that an amendment that I introduced during the consideration of the NDAA before the House Committee on Armed Services makes certain that the voices of veterans are heard by vesting the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs with the power to appoint two members to the oversight board that will evaluate the current system and care provided to our veterans and active servicemembers. 
   Working diligently with the House Armed Services Committee, many of my recommendations to the NDAA bill regarding Operation Iraqi Freedom are included in the baseline text of this bill. 
   Namely, these recommendations address the need for proper oversight of the reconstruction efforts, putting an end to slanted no-bid contracts, along with the sharing and distribution of oil revenue resources to the Iraqi people so as to foster adequate reconstruction and facilitate national reconciliation. 
   Moreover, I am proud to have worked with my friend and colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Loebsack, in the adoption of our joint amendment at full committee, which requires Secretary Gates, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to provide perpetual reports to Congress on the status and implementation of the Joint Campaign Plan, JCP, and the Iraqi Government's efforts to implement political reform until the end of U.S. combat operations in Iraq. 
   As such this amendment ensures that Congress is supplied with (1) the information necessary to provide proper and constructive oversight of our progress in Iraq, (2) sheds light on the conditions faced by our troops on the ground, and (3) supplies Congress with the crucial information needed to determine a responsible and timely troop redeployment. 
   While violence has dropped in Iraq, there is a window of opportunity for the Iraqi Government to make serious strides to achieve political reform and in doing so strategically bring our troops home. Therefore, while we continue to urge this administration to shift policy in Iraq to one that is driven by multilateral and bilateral diplomatic initiatives, we must also ensure that our remaining troops in Iraq are supplied with the support that they need. This bill provides over $17.6 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and $8 billion to buy medium and heavy tactical trucks fast enough to replace battle losses and to meet National Guard requirements, which are currently at dangerously low levels. 
   Mr. Speaker, while we may be divided on the war in Iraq, we, must be united in guaranteeing that our brave men and women in uniform are well rested, well trained and well equipped--and that our veterans receive the services they deserve. We must also be united in ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent as effectively and efficiently as possible. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this critical defense bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank my colleague from Maryland for yielding. I want to thank him for his tremendous leadership, outstanding leadership with regard to such a critical issue. 
   As I listened to the last speaker from the other side, I could not help but think about how many people in our country simply want to have an opportunity to have a little life brought to their lives. This is not a major measure, but it is one that will bring spice to life. 
   We are very blessed to have the Chesapeake Bay. We are very blessed to have this program. When you think about my favorite saying, and that is, That we did not inherit our environment from our parents but we borrowed it from our children, I think this program goes a long ways to making sure that we leave an earth better than the one we received when we came upon the earth. 
   This Gateways program and its reauthorization are very important because through its partners it can continue to educate people about the natural, cultural, historic, and recreational sites throughout the bay region and about how their communities relate directly to the health of our largest estuary and national treasure, the Chesapeake Bay. 
   And so what will happen as a result of this is that children will have an opportunity to learn about what part the bay plays in their lives and how important it is and, believe it or not, some of them even being exposed to the bay to really understand that it is indeed a very, very wonderful feature of their State and their backyard. 
   So, again, I congratulate Mr. Sarbanes and all of those who have anything to do with making this happen. I think it's very important, as I said before, that we bring spice to the lives of our citizens, and this bill goes a very, very long way in doing that.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (REGARDING THE PASSING OF CHARLES G. TILDON, JR. -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to pay tribute to a great American who fought tirelessly against injustice and inequality, using education as both his sword and his shield. 
   Charles D. Tildon, Jr., left this Earth on December 15, 2007, at the age of 81. Affectionately known as Charlie, he was born in my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, to Charles G. Tildon, Sr., a preacher, and Estrom Elizabeth Tildon, a teacher. 
   His belief in the power of education was formed at a very young age. He and his brother, Dr. Tyson Tildon, were raised to pursue excellence, despite living in an era of overt and permeating racism. Not only did they pursue excellence, but they achieved it in every task they took on. 
   Both brothers, now reunited in heaven, embodied the virtues of dignity, integrity, and brilliance. Charlie received a degree in biology from the then Morgan State College and graduated from Frederick Douglass High School. He had a long and successful career that culminated with the post of the president of Baltimore City College, from which he retired in 1985. Along the way, he held positions as a middle school science teacher, associate director of Provident Hospital, executive director of the Maryland Service Corps, and assistant secretary of the Maryland Department of Human Resources. 
   His career trajectory as well as his community engagement were fueled by his desire to help others reach their fullest potential. Charles Tildon was indeed a trailblazer. In 1969, he became one of the first African American trustees for the Maryland Institute College of Arts. He also contributed his talents and his time to several community organizations, including Associated Black Charities and Open Society Institute. He combined his leadership capabilities with a passion for justice to help organize movements for social change. He was a founding member of the organization BLEWS, the Black/Jewish Forum of Baltimore, which was created in 1978 as an effort to overcome estrangement between African Americans and Jews. Charlie Tildon understood the importance of having these two communities come together in order to build mutual trust and understanding. He recognized that we are all more alike than we are different, and that by working together we bring out the very best in ourselves and in others. 
   I was blessed to call Charlie my mentor and my friend. He was a role model to me and so many others. He taught us that our intellect is our greatest strength and, with it, we have a voice that we cannot be silenced. He also taught us that there are trying moments in our lives when we simply cannot remain silent. 
   He co-edited a collection of essays called Clairvoyance: Reweaving the Fabric of the Community for Black Folk. This visionary blueprint included discussions by some of Baltimore's most gifted thinkers about the relationship between our schools and the community in which we live. It concluded that we must become a community of learning if we are to become a society in which all people have the opportunity to succeed. Clairvoyance is just one example of how Charlie put education at the forefront of a march for human rights which everyone can join. 
   I fervently believe in our responsibility to create communities of learning to provide all children with equal educational opportunity and to teach them how to use their minds to overcome bigotry and hatred. Charlie helped to shape that belief. 
   Not only did he selflessly serve his community, but he cherished his role as a husband and as a father. I know I speak for all of those who had the privilege of knowing Charlie when I say his presence in our lives was present enough. He saw his life as a vessel to help others to succeed. I can think of no greater legacy. My prayers are with his wife of 49 years, Louise Tildon, his son Charles Tildon III, and his two grandchildren and his entire family. I thank them for sharing him with us, and I thank God for Charles Tildon's life of extraordinary service and unbounded grace.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF PANCREATIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 257, a resolution that recognizes the goals and ideals of the National Pancreatic Awareness Month, which is in November. 
   Today's consideration of this legislation comes on the heels of a recent tragedy that shook the Nation and the world. Last week, Italian operatic icon Luciano Pavarotti died in his home in Modena, Italy, from pancreatic cancer. He was 71 years old. 
   Pavarotti's flawless, rich sound left audiences awe-struck, earning him the nickname of the ``King of the High Cs.'' I count myself among the millions of fans who were moved by his powerful voice. 
   Like Enrico Caruso and Jenny Lind before him, Pavarotti's talent was recognized beyond the standard opera audience. He became a household name in the 1990s with his popular ``Pavarotti and Friends'' charity concerts, performing with rock stars like Elton John, Sting, and Bono.  
   The maestro's moving music and charismatic demeanor will be remembered for generations to come. As we celebrate the life and legacy of one of the greatest tenors the world has ever known, we must also reflect on the need to improve the diagnosis and treatment of the disease that tragically took his life, pancreatic cancer. 
   That is why I am a lead sponsor of H. Res. 257, which highlights the need for improved investment in pancreatic cancer research. Pavarotti might still be alive today if we had made a greater commitment to fighting this very tragic disease. 
   Pavarotti's story is like so many other individuals who suffer from pancreatic cancer. He was diagnosed in 2006 and underwent surgery in July of that year. Treatment failed, however, and he eventually succumbed to the disease. 
   Far too many Americans and people around the world find that a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a death sentence. Seventy-five percent of all patients with pancreatic cancer die within 12 months of diagnosis. Only 5 percent of pancreatic cancer patients survive more than 5 years, making it the deadliest of any cancer. Of the 37,170 Americans who are expected to be diagnosed in 2007, an estimated 33,000 will die this year. 
   Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and the third leading cause of cancer death among 40- to 59-year-old men. It is a disease that disproportionately affects minorities. The incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 40 to 50 percent higher in the African American community than in any other ethnic group. 
   Unfortunately, our financial commitment to the disease has not matched its impact. Only 1 1/2 percent of the National Cancer Institute's $4.747 billion cancer research budget for 2006 went to pancreatic cancer. No significant improvement in survival rates has been made in the last 25 years, and pancreatic cancer research is still in the earliest scientific stages. 
   There are no early detection methods and minimal treatment options for pancreatic cancer. Sadly, when symptoms of pancreatic cancer present themselves, it is usually too late for an optimistic prognosis; and the average survival rate of those diagnosed with metastasis disease is only 3 to 6 months. 
   This is simply unacceptable. We can do better, and we owe it to our citizens and to the legacy of the great Pavarotti to do better. 
   For this reason, I have joined my colleague, Congressman TODD RUSSELL PLATTS of Pennsylvania, in introducing H. Res. 257. We are also joined by 83 of our colleagues who are cosponsors of the bill. I want to thank Congressman Platts for his leadership on this issue, subcommittee Chairman DANNY DAVIS, and full committee Chairman HENRY WAXMAN for bringing this legislation to the floor, and our friends on the other side. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and to join efforts to increase Federal support for pancreatic cancer research.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (RECOGNIZING THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS AND THE NEED TO REFOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 6 years since America experienced its worst foreign terrorist attack. I send my solemn prayers to the families of the victims and the survivors of the September 11 attack, where nearly 3,000 persons lost their lives. 
   Although no amount of time can ever bring back the ones you cherish or erase the memories of the tragic event, it is my hope that their wounds have begun to heal. 
   While the world and the United States mourned the loss of innocent lives that day, we also sought answers as to who had attacked us and what would be our next steps. Rather than focusing on those responsible for organizing these attacks, President Bush and his administration diverted our efforts and refocused our resources to fight the global war on terror by waging war against the regime of Saddam Hussein via a preemptive strike. The administration presented its erroneous case by drawing on allegations that Iran had weapons of mass destruction, that it was a clear threat to the United States, and that it was connected with al Qaeda. 
   While failing to gain the support of the global community, this administration continued on with its ill-conceived stance on Iraq, convincing the majority of the Congress to vote in favor of entering a war where only 5 years later we continue to pay heavily. 
   And what exactly has been the cost? It has cost over $450 billion in taxpayers hard-earned dollars, according to the Congressional Research Service. It has left families of servicemembers and the larger population mourning the deaths of over 3,750 servicemembers, 69 of those being from the great State of Maryland. It has resulted in a strained family situation for those who endure multiple deployments, and has led to strikingly low levels of recruitment and retention of our mid-career armed servicemembers. 
   It has undercut our efforts to ensure adequate protection of the home front because much of the needed equipment has been left behind unaccounted for in Iraq, as the National Guard testified before a Senate committee last April. 
   It has belabored the economy, where the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has reported that the United States simply cannot continue spending at its current rate. And it has, in reality, resulted in the establishment  of al Qaeda in Iraq, as reported by the National Intelligence Estimate. 
   Mr. Speaker, the GAO testified before the House Armed Services Committee, upon which I sit, last week that only three of the 18 benchmarks established by the Congress have been met. Four have been partially met, and 11 have not been met at all. Specifically, only two of the nine security-related benchmarks were met, two were partially met, and five not met at all. 
   Furthermore, in a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, September 6, the Jones Commission made clear that political reconciliation is a key component of resolving the issue of sectarian violence. Accordingly, political reconciliation requires the diplomatic and international support of the global community. Presently, the President and this administration's efforts to gain this pivotal support are less than adequate. The Bush administration, as it has done in the past, continues to try to buy the patience of this Congress and the American people by pulling for excuses. 
   Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago I expressed my disapproval of the war by voting against the United States military operations in Iraq. 
   Today, I still remain unwavering in my support of our troops and the urgent need to make a responsible and timely redeployment of our men and women in uniform as a means to end the continued bloodshed. 
   I urge my colleagues to support our troops, support saving taxpayer dollars, and support the victims of September 11 by ushering in measures that will ensure diplomatic multilateral and bilateral support for political reconciliation in Iraq. A more focused and more determined strategy that will refocus and better utilize our efforts to fight the global war on terror is necessary to ensure that the victims of September 11 have not died without adequate retribution. 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (IRAQ WAR SUPPLEMENTAL -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey for bringing the conference report for the Iraq supplemental to the floor. You have shown tremendous leadership in the face of great opposition and criticism. 
   To my colleagues who joined me in passing this legislation, we have demonstrated to our constituents that we are listening to their mandate. 
   Five weeks ago, we commemorated the fourth year of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Today, we move with urgency to end 4 years of bloodshed that has resulted in the death of 3,300 men and women in uniform deployed in Iraq, 59 of those being sons and daughters of the great State of Maryland. 
   While I opposed the war from the very beginning, I believe we have a duty to redeploy in a responsible manner that protects the Iraqi people and our troops. 
   Additionally, we have a responsibility to our courageous men and women in uniform, their families, and the American people by putting an end to their incredible sacrifices. 
   Despite the rhetoric, the President's plan is simply not working. According to a Washington Post report dated April 4, 2007, the number of Iraqi policemen killed across Iraq nearly doubled from 171 in February to 331 in March. 
   Meanwhile, the numbers of unidentified bodies found across Baghdad are rising again, suggesting an increase in sectarian-motivated death squad killings. Surely, this is not a sign of us winning the war in Iraq; but instead, it is a sign of how the conflict is swiftly tumbling into a civil war that is on the edge of becoming a battle beyond our control. 
   As Members of Congress, it is our duty to bring President Bush back to reality. Progress in Iraq will not be measured in military terms. The primary solution to many of the crises in Iraq are simply political, in that obtaining bilateral assistance from Iraq's neighbors, the international community and the Iraqis themselves, is a vital step to resolving many of the present conflicts. 
   Unfortunately, the President views the situation quite differently. Rather than attempting to reach compromise, he has threatened to use his veto power. In doing so, he will be rejecting the benchmarks for Iraq that he himself has repeatedly stated must be reached to resolve this crisis. The President will also be vetoing so much more. 
   The supplemental provides troops with three things they need to be successful: Training, equipment and rest. 
   Further, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am particularly proud that $3 billion is provided for the purchase of mine resistant, ambush protected vehicles. 
   The President should take note that he will be vetoing accountability requirements in the area of homeland security. To that end, the supplemental makes important changes to the Coast Guard's $24 billion, 25-year Deepwater contract to prevent the development of assets that simply do not work. 
   Further, the supplemental will require the Coast Guard to identify both the staffing structure it needs to manage Deepwater, and the training that acquisitions oversight staff will require to be effective. 
   Having chaired two oversight hearings involving Deepwater, and having worked with Chairman Oberstar, chairman of the full committee, to conduct an investigative hearing into Deepwater, I know that the significant problems that have been experienced with this contract have arisen at least in part due to the decision of the Coast Guard to move forward with the program before they had the staff, expertise, and management systems in place to ensure effective oversight. 
   Finally, I strongly support these provisions and look forward to building on them in the Coast Guard reauthorization which we are drafting. If this supplemental is not signed and if we fail to override the veto, we will start from scratch, forcing us back to the drawing board. However, I will not give up or give in. It is time to bring our troops home

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation is of vital importance, because it ensures that the Department of Defense has the funding necessary to replenish the depleted resources of the U.S. military and provides accountability standards as our military operations continue in Iraq. One of the critical issues we addressed in the House Armed Services Committee was the need to support our troops in combat operations. 
   We accomplish this task by providing $141.8 billion in emergency supplemental spending, which will provide for new combat vehicles and armor that will protect our men and women in uniform from traumatic brain injuries and  increase their overall survival rate. Additionally, this bill safeguards and enhances access to care and treatment programs for our injured servicemembers under the auspices of the Wounded Warriors Assistance Act. 
   Finally, we address the need for oversight and accountability standards for our military operations in Iraq. Congressman DAVID LOEBSACK and I have an amendment included in the bill that requires Secretary Gates, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to submit reports to the Congress on the status of the implementation of the Joint Campaign Plan. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this critical defense bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Thank you very much, Chairman Waxman, for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 734, a resolution expressing our dismay at the withholding of information relating to Iraqi corruption, which I have cosponsored. 
   By all accounts, Iraq was a corrupt state at the time of the U.S. invasion. Unfortunately, it remains so today. The nonpartisan group, Transparency International, finds that the Iraqi Government is the world's third most corrupt country more than 4 years after Saddam Hussein was ousted. 
   In an October 4 hearing of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we listened to the heart-wrenching testimony of Judge al-Radhi, the former Commissioner of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity. During his tenure, the judge uncovered up to $18 billion in funds that were lost as a result of corruption. Rather than receive the accolades for his efforts, however, Judge Radhi faced severe retaliation instead. He told us of the horrible atrocities that he and his family and that of his staff suffered at the hands of those who aimed to stifle his investigations. 
   In total, 31 people from his office and 12 of their family members were killed. Many endured unspeakable torture, their bodies hung from meat hooks. Judge Radhi's own home was struck by rockets. Harassment eventually reached the point that he was forced to flee his own country. This is not the sort of environment that leads to the free and democratic Iraqi society that President Bush is so fond of invoking. 
   We cannot achieve a victory in Iraq as long as we allow corruption to continue unchecked. Unfortunately, officials of the U.S. Department of State do not appear to agree. Following our hearing, the Department retroactively classified reports and portions of reports that detailed problems with Iraqi corruption. These actions represent a blatant attempt to manipulate the classification process to stave off bad publicity. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad reality indeed. I find it ironic that our own government is engaging in obstructive practices in an attempt to cover up the truth about corruption in Iraq. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in sending a very strong message to the administration that these practices will not be tolerated by voting in favor of H. Res. 734.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF AMERICA'S WATERWAY WATCH PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. House Resolution 549, introduced by Congressman GUS BILIRAKIS, recognizes the contributions made to our Nation's security by the Coast Guard's Waterway Watch program. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I strongly support the Waterway Watch program, and I support the resolution offered by the gentleman from Florida. 
   Put simply, America's Waterway Watch program enlists the 70 million Americans who work, play or live around our Nation's waterfronts, rivers, lakes, and coastal regions to become part of our Nation's first line of defense by observing and reporting suspicious activities. Founded by the Coast Guard in 2004, the Waterway Watch is similar to earlier Coast Watch programs instituted during World War II. 
   At the time, the Coast Watch program was comprised of a group of volunteers who scanned our coasts for U-boats threatening U.S. shipping. Today, America's Waterway Watch calls on volunteers to aid in the war on terrorism on our home front. People are advised to take note of suspicious activities and, if it can be done safely, they are encouraged to take photographs or videotape of the occurrence. Observers are then asked to immediately report incidents they have witnessed by calling 911 or the America's Waterway Watch 24-hour national toll-free telephone number, 1-877-24-WATCH. Reported information is then sent to the National Response Center located at Coast Guard headquarters to be evaluated and dispersed to local Coast Guard responders. 
   I emphasize that this watch program is meant to be a simple deterrent to potential terrorist activity by asking  those who frequent our waterways, ports, and waterfront areas to report events and people that seem out of place. It is not a surveillance program and is not meant to spread paranoia. 
   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, I also commend the Coast Guard Auxiliary, which is at the forefront of the Waterway Watch program. The auxiliary is the uniformed civilian component of the Coast Guard. It is primarily responsible for implementing programs that serve the recreational boating community. In fact, the auxiliary helps to promote America's Waterway Watch through their well-established recreational boating safety programs. 
   I also commend the Nationwide Insurance Company, which has supported the Waterway Watch program by giving the Coast Guard Auxiliary Association a $96,000 grant to support the auxiliary's role in the Coast Guard's maritime homeland security missions. The grant funded the purchase of Waterway Watch stickers that boaters can display on their boats. It also funded the printing of brochures, wallet cards, and posters that provide pertinent information on the watch program, including detailing how citizens can become involved in the program and listing the numbers that can be called to report suspicious activities. 
   The Coast Guard's active duty, Reserve and auxiliary forces have united with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and local law enforcement agencies to detect and deter threatening activities at waterfront facilities. 
   However, there are some 95,000 miles of shoreline, 300,000 square miles of waterways, 6,000 bridges, 360 ports of call, and 12,000 marinas in the United States; and the Coast Guard and other first responders simply cannot watch all of these facilities all the time. America's Waterway Watch program ensures that ordinary citizens can help our Nation's uniformed agencies protect our homeland simply by remaining vigilant in their own communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again express my support for America's Waterway Watch program, which helps keep citizens involved in watching our Nation's shores and waterways, and recognizes the importance of the service they are providing. I urge my colleagues to adopt H. Res. 549 and again commend Congressman Bilirakis for his work on this measure. I also congratulate and thank my colleague, the ranking member of our Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee (Mr. LaTourette), for his cooperation in this bipartisan effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (INTRODUCTION OF THE SHORT SEA SHIPPING PROMOTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, when I assumed the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation at the beginning of the 110th Congress, I promised that the subcommittee would balance oversight of the Coast Guard with our responsibility to strengthen maritime transportation. 
   On February 15, the subcommittee began to fulfill that promise by holding a hearing on short sea shipping, which is the waterborne transportation of goods and people from one domestic port in the United States to another port in the United States or between Canada and the U.S. 
   At the present time, trucks carry nearly 70 percent of the freight tonnage transported in the United States. By contrast, the most highly developed water freight transportation routes in the United States, those running on the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway carry just 13 percent of the freight tonnage within the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, the impact of our continued reliance on trucks to move freight will be measured in increased traffic congestion, increases in polluting emissions and increases in accidents between trucks and cars. 
   However, the only way that we will shift freight transportation away from an increasing volume of trucks is by creating affordable reliable transportation alternatives. I believe that one of these alternatives must be short sea shipping. 
   During our February hearing, our subcommittee heard compelling testimony arguing that one of the challenges currently limiting the growth of short sea shipping is a requirement that with only a few exceptions cargo transported by water to a port in the United States must pay the harbor maintenance tax. This tax, assessed at the rate of $125 per $100,000 of cargo value adds to the costs associated with waterborne transportation and is one factor currently making such transportation less competitive than trucks and other modes. 
   Importantly, if the cargo originated in Europe and is off-loaded in New York, just to be reloaded on a ship bound for Jacksonville, Florida then the cargo owner must pay the harbor tax twice.     
   Further, the tax is paid, not by the ship owner, but by the shipper of the goods. So imagine that a FedEx truck wants to get on a ferry in Windsor, Canada, and be off loaded just across the river in Detroit, Michigan. Each of the owners of the 500 packages that are in the truck must pay the harbor maintenance tax. There is simply no easy way to collect the tax from so many different packages, so the truck travels to the United States across the bridge. 
   In part, because it acts to limit the growth of short sea shipping, the harbor maintenance tax generates only about $2 million per year in revenue from short sea shipping voyages, but stands as a costly barrier to the expansion of short sea shipping options. 
   Today, therefore, I have introduced the Short Sea Shipping Promotion Act of 2007, which would exempt goods moved by water from one port in the United States to another port in the United States or between the United States and Canada from the harbor maintenance tax. 
   This exemption will not significantly reduce revenues into the harbor maintenance trust fund, which already has a significant fund balance, but could help open a significant new course for the movement of freight by water. 
   Our Nation urgently needs to take practical steps to address the significant challenges we face in maintaining the flow of freight on which our economy depends. 
   As chairman of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, the measure I have introduced today is just the first step of a concerted and deliberate effort I will undertake to support the potential of maritime transportation, in general, and short sea shipping, in particular, to be a reliable, cost-effective mode in our national transportation network.

This is on top of the original $150.5 billion requested at the beginning of Fiscal Year 2008, bringing the total amount requested to $196.4 billion, more than 10 times the original 50 to $60 billion cost estimated by the White House in 2002.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES IN THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE INDUSTRY -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern with regard to predatory lending practices in the subprime mortgage industry and to emphasize the need for Congress to act swiftly in addressing this critical issue. 
   Owning a home is an essential component of the American Dream. Simply put, homeownership has the power to transform lives. I still remember the day 45 years ago when my family first moved into our own home. I was only 10 years old, but I will never forget that momentous event. 
   Homeownership changed life for me and my seven brothers and sisters. We were able to go to better schools, and our family was able to build wealth. Over the years, my parents worked hard to make the mortgage payments every month, building equity, and eventually paying it off. My mother at 81 still lives in that house, mortgage-free. Because my parents invested in their home, my mother can now live out her final years in dignity and with a sense of security. 
   Every American family deserves the benefits of homeownership that transformed my life. That is why I am outraged by reports of predatory lending practices in the subprime mortgage industry and the upsurge in foreclosures that have occurred as a result thereof. 
   The national foreclosure rate has been increasing at an alarming rate. According to RealtyTrac, a realty research firm, foreclosures increased by 42 percent from 2005 to 2006, to 1.2 million. That translates into one foreclosure for every 92 households. 
   Much has been made of the impact these foreclosures will have on Wall Street. However, I am equally concerned with the impact that they will have on the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are losing their homes. 
   Increasing foreclosures are directly related to the subprime mortgage industry, which has grown from less than 8 percent of the total mortgage market in 2001 to approximately 20 percent of the market today. Subprime mortgages, which target borrowers with low credit scores, often cost more than prime mortgages, and include terms that allow payments to balloon or grow exponentially over time. 
   Predatory lending practices are common in the subprime mortgage industry, where borrowers are more likely to either have limited options available to them or be unaware of their options. Disturbingly, African Americans and Latinos are more likely to get higher rates than white borrowers with the same qualifications, and borrowers over the age of 65 have five times the odds of receiving a subprime loan than younger borrowers. 
   This trend is illustrated in the congressional district that I represent, the Seventh Congressional District of Maryland. 
   If you look at these maps, it is clear. In the map on the left, the red indicates the concentration of low-income African American and Latino populations. In the map on the right, the red area is the highest concentration of subprime loans. 
   Note that the two areas are nearly identical, indicating that subprime loans in the Seventh District are more likely to be given to African Americans and Latinos and lower-income people. This is simply unconscionable. Somebody is making big bucks off of vulnerable families in my district who are losing their homes. For those of us who remember redlining, this is simply more of the same. We must end discrimination in lending practices now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by urging my colleagues to continue to work on this issue. Today I introduced a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that issues related to the subprime market must be addressed. 
   Specifically, the legislation identifies the following goals for reform: strengthening Federal regulations, banning unfair and deceptive practices, requiring lenders to establish a borrower's ability to pay, increasing the disclosure of alternative mortgage products, reducing or eliminating the prepayment penalty, eliminating mandatory arbitration, identifying brokers and lenders with high rates of foreclosure, and mandating preloan counseling. 
   As a member of the Baltimore Home Ownership Preservation Coalition and the Joint Economic Committee, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution and join with our chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), in addressing this critical issue. 
   Finally, I want to thank all of my colleagues who have come to the floor this evening to address this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (SCHIP REAUTHORIZATION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the reauthorization and expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program or SCHIP, our Nation's health care safety net for low-income, uninsured children. 
   We are at a critical juncture in our Nation's health care crisis. An estimated 46 million Americans are uninsured. Approximately 18,000 people die each year in this country as a direct consequence of being uninsured. Sadly, many of the victims are innocent children. No fewer than 9 million American children are without health insurance, and they are suffering as a result. 
   Uninsured children, like uninsured adults, are less likely to have access to early and preventive care, setting them up for a lifetime of health problems that may have been avoided if caught today. Far too many of our children are going to the emergency room because we have failed to let them into the doctor's office. 
   This is immoral, but it is also uneconomical. Preventive health care services are cheaper than disease management and trauma care. By denying our citizenry the former, we are paying a premium for the latter. 
   The President has ignored the potential cost savings, arguing, instead, that an expanded SCHIP program would move children off of private insurance, but that is simply not the case. The vast majority of children who would be covered by this bill come from families with less than $33,200 for a family of three. These families do not have the luxury of choosing private insurance over the public benefit. For them, it is public coverage or nothing. 
   We have a moral obligation to ensure that our children have access to health care. Our health care system produces infant mortality rates and incidences  of health disparities far greater than other nations in the industrialized world. We know statistically that racial and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from poor health and die prematurely. More than 30 years after the national embarrassment of Tuskegee Syphilis Experience, our people are still being denied access to the best medical system in the world. 
   This trend recently played out in my home State in Maryland in an incident that I still find difficult to comprehend. In February, a 12-year-old African American boy named Deamonte Driver died when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. A routine dental checkup costing about $40 might have saved his life. But Deamonte was poor and homeless, and he did not have access to a dentist. 
   Deamonte's case was rare and extreme, but he is by no means alone in his suffering. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that dental disease is the single-most chronic childhood disease in this country. It chills the conscience to think of how one young boy's life was cut short by the failure of our health care system, and millions of others continue to suffer. 
   We have a moral obligation in the memory of Deamonte to fix this problem now. This is why I have consistently advocated for a strong SCHIP bill that expands coverage to 6 million of our Nation's poorest children and guarantees them dental coverage. 
   I was discouraged to see that the first version of the bill from the Senate Finance Committee included only $35 million in additional funding and did not include mandatory dental benefit. As a Washington Post editorial board recently noted, memories are sometimes short here in Washington. I realize the current budgetary constraints make this process all the more contentious; however, these are times that require decisive leadership. I am hopeful that in the House we will be able to find funding to expand the program by $50 million while working with our Senate colleagues to negotiate a strong bill. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this vitally important legislation.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment that you have offered, and I thank you again for your leadership on the Coast Guard authorization and all of the transportation issues that our Nation faces. 
   The manager's amendment includes provisions offered by several of our colleagues that would make a number of important improvements to H.R. 2830. Among other provisions, the manager's amendment would implement recommendations recently made by the Government Accountability Office to require the Commandant of the Coast Guard to prescribe a policy to combat sexual assault and sexual harassment at the Coast Guard Academy. And I do commend my colleague, Ms. Sanchez, for her hard work on this issue. As a member of the Naval Academy Board of Visitors, this is an issue that I have worked on very hard, not only there, but with regard to our Coast Guard Academy. 
   The amendment would also allow the Coast Guard to delegate some regulatory functions, including facility inspections regarding offshore facilities, to classifications societies. 
   Further, the amendment would authorize the Coast Guard to issue regulations to require a pilot to carry on board the vessel he or she is operating a computer equipped with electronic charts of the navigation areas the vessel will transit. 
   I would strongly support this amendment, and I thank the sponsors and thank the chairman for sponsoring it.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered by Mr. LaTourette and Mr. Boustany, the ranking member on the Coast Guard subcommittee, would amend section 720, a section that addresses waterside security around LNG terminals and tankers, and I fully support it. 
   Subsection C of that section requires that, before the Coast Guard can approve a facility's security plan for a new LNG terminal, the service must determine that it has available to the sector in which the terminal is to be located the resources it needs to carry out the risk mitigation measures identified in the waterway suitability report for that terminal. This amendment would include State and local resources in the assessment, which is a good thing. 
   With the adoption of this amendment and with the measures already included in subsection C, section 720, we will ensure that the Coast Guard's resources do not have to be diverted from other high-priority missions as determined by the commandant to secure LNG operations. 
   The Coast Guard will be able to depend upon those State and local law enforcement resources that have the proven training, resources, personnel, equipment, and experience necessary to combat a terrorist attack, to conduct waterborne patrols around LNG facilities. 
   I emphasize that the State and local law enforcement cannot and should not be seen as replacements for the Coast Guard resources, as the Coast Guard is our Nation's maritime time security agency. 
   Further, having the Coast Guard, our trained maritime security agency, defend our communities from the risk of a terrorist attack on an LNG terminal in the neighborhood is not an unwarranted and unnecessary subsidy. As our Nation continues to approve new LNG terminals, we must commit to ensuring that all of the resources, particularly Coast Guard resources, necessary to secure these facilities are in place. I fully support the amendment.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. 
   I also rise in support of this very important amendment. This amendment would make it a crime to operate on an international voyage a submersible or semi-submersible vessel utilized to traffic drugs or support other illegal activities. 
   The use of the submersible vehicles to attempt to smuggle drugs from foreign ports to the United States is on the rise, and such vehicles are capable of carrying vast quantities of drugs. 
   I'm very familiar with this issue, having been former ranking member of the Drug Subcommittee of the Government Reform Committee, and now chairman of this subcommittee. The very drugs that these folks are trying to bring into this country, they're trying to bring them on these kind of boats. I've actually seen these boats. And someone said it a moment ago. 
   It is so important that we keep up with the drug smugglers. They are constantly trying to find new methods to avoid capture and prosecution, and so this is a good thing. 
   In August of last year, for instance, the Coast Guard and other Federal partners seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying cocaine estimated to be worth more than $350 million. 
   And, by the way, Madam Chairman, I also note that this year the Coast Guard has taken in and seized more drugs than in any year in its history. 
   As someone who represents the City of Baltimore, I know firsthand the destruction that drugs can cause. And I know that every gram that is kept off our streets is a victory over the forces that destroy lives and communities. 
   I also know that the profit available from drug drives and smugglers, they continually try to come up with these new techniques, and this is our effort, Mr. Poe's effort to address this. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I wholeheartedly support this amendment. I want to thank Mr. Poe for sponsoring it.

This simple amendment clarifies that the provisions included in the Coast Guard authorization pertaining to the service's marine safety function will not in any way affect the Coast Guard's authority to carry out its Homeland Security missions. 
   As the chairman has said, basically, what we're trying to do is make sure that, while we understand that this organization is being stretched, we want to make sure that it takes on its functions effectively and efficiently. I think this amendment simply strengthens the legislation and, therefore, I support it.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, this amendment merely, simply stated, makes sense. It amends section 708 to require the creation of a program that will enable the Coast Guard to test the use of biometrics technology to identify individuals intercepted by the service. I have actually seen this procedure and have seen this biometric equipment in operation. This allows us to use our resources, our limited resources that the Coast Guard has, in an efficient and effective manner; and it also will allow us to be able to learn exactly who these terrorists might be and get identification information on them immediately. 
   And so I want to thank the gentleman for providing us with this amendment, which makes our bill better.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Chairman, I rise in full support of this amendment. It is another one of those makes-sense amendments that strengthens the legislation. 
   We have a situation here where currently, under an existing memorandum of understanding between FERC and the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard already provides the results of its waterway suitability reports to FERC. This amendment would simply codify that practice. The amendment would then require FERC to inform the Secretary of the actions the commission has taken regarding the proposed terminal's application. 
   It simply makes sense. We've got to have the Coast Guard and FERC working together. Of course the Coast Guard determines suitability of the waterway leading into the location where the LNG is going to be, and then of course FERC takes a look at other things. So the combination of them working together is so very, very, very important, and so we wholeheartedly support the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey).

   Under section 7-105 of title 46, United States Code, the Department of Homeland Security is required to issue a biometric credential to individuals who are authorized to have unescorted access to secure areas, vessels and facilities. And some people are unable to accomplish that. I was just talking to my aid, who said that she went to see the rollout and they didn't pick up her fingerprints, which was a bad day for them. And so I think we have to address this. 
   We will work to ensure that this amendment would not alter the standards in which a TWIC is issued in any way; however, we need to provide options for individuals whose fingerprints, like my aid's, cannot be used to authenticate the cards. 
   I strongly support the amendment, and we will tweak the TWIC. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I fully support this amendment by Mr. Bishop, the Vice Chair of our subcommittee. 
   This amendment would require the Coast Guard to detail the extent to which State and local law enforcement entities are augmenting Coast Guard resources by conducting port security patrols and by aiding in the enforcement of Coast Guard-imposed security zones around vessels entering our ports. 
   While I have the utmost respect for State and local law enforcement, the subcommittee is concerned that such entities may be undertaking maritime patrols to augment the Coast Guard's resources without having previously had experience performing law enforcement functions on the water and without fully understanding what it takes to respond to the unique threats that  confront our Nation in the maritime environment. 
   The study required by Mr. Bishop's amendment would provide the critical assessment that is needed both of whether the Coast Guard has established adequate training, resource, and equipment standards for State and local law enforcement units performing maritime patrols and the extent to which law enforcement can meet these standards. 
   I fully support the amendment.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I want to join with Chairman Oberstar in strongly opposing this amendment. But we do plan to work with the gentleman on this. 
   Title X grants mariners a ``change of venue'' when they appeal the suspension and revocation of their professional credentials from an Administrative Law Judge system controlled by the very same Coast Guard that is seeking to take their credentials to a system located in a neutral agency, the National Transportation Safety Board.     
   I note that title X would move only Coast Guard suspension and revocation cases to NTSB. All other cases currently heard by the Coast Guard ALJ, including cases from TSA, would be unaffected by title X. I know that the concerns have been raised by the gentleman and that the changes proposed in title X would leave the Coast Guard ALJ program without the resources to handle the TSA, but we certainly question that. However, I note that the cases heard by the Coast Guard's ALJ for TSA and for other agencies, like NOAA, are heard on a cost reimbursement basis. Title X would continue to allow agencies to reimburse the Coast Guard ALJ for the costs associated with adjudication of those cases 
   Further, I'd note that since TSA was established, that agency has filed 504  civil penalty cases with the Coast Guard ALJ, 60 cases remain pending, a total of 230 cases did not proceed to an adjudication. Orders granting motions for a decision were issued in 156 cases, and dismissal orders were granted in four cases. 
   Finally, let me say this. No TWIC applicants have requested an ALJ hearing as of April 13, though there have been 230 enrollments, and they started enrolling back in October of 2007. Decisions and orders were issued in only 54 cases, which would be an average of about nine cases per year. 
   So, again, we have the same concerns, and I hope you understand why this even came about, because we have some very painful testimony from mariners about how they felt that the system was already set up against them before they got into the hearing room. And we had testimony from Administrative Law Judges who were concerned that an atmosphere of unfairness was being pushed upon them by those who may have been above them. 
   So I think that the ranking member and I and other members of our committee agreed that we needed to do something, and we thought this was the best vehicle. We have the same concerns that you have. 
   With that, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.

   During that hearing, we heard about some of the glitches that individuals attempting to enroll have encountered. Such glitches are unacceptable when workers must pay $132.50 and take time off from work to obtain a card that they are required to have to do their job and to provide for their families. 
   TWIC is an essential part of our post-security regime and is intended to ensure that those who pose a threat to our maritime infrastructure do not gain access to the secure areas of vessels or port facilities.     
   However, enrollment must be conducted as seamlessly as possible to cause the least burden to those workers. And I want to thank Ms. Jackson-Lee for her amendment. It helps to make our bill a better bill.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the chairman for yielding. 
   And as chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise today in strong support of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his inspired leadership of the Transportation Committee. I also thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership on the Homeland Security Committee. Further, I thank my ranking member of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Mica. And I give special thanks to Congressman LaTourette for his service as the ranking member of the Coast Guard Subcommittee. And certainly I thank Congressman King. 
   Throughout the 110th Congress, I've led the subcommittee in examining the many ways in which the Coast Guard, our thin blue line at sea, has been stretched since 9/11. The amendment in the nature of a substitute before us today responds directly to the issues we have examined by ensuring that the Coast Guard has the expertise and resources necessary to perform all of its missions effectively and efficiently. 
   The legislation would authorize $8.4 billion for the Coast Guard and authorize an increase in the total number of military personnel to 47,000. 
   Our subcommittee has become deeply concerned that the area where the Coast Guard is becoming thinnest is in marine safety, the function responsible for protecting lives, property and the environment at sea. The declines in this program have become shockingly evident when the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General found that the Coast Guard dispatched three individuals who were not qualified to conduct an investigation to respond to the ship that hit the San Francisco Bay Bridge and subsequently spilled 54,000 gallons of fuel into the Bay. 
   Without taking away any of the resources or the flexibility that the Coast Guard needs to perform any other mission, including securing our ports, the amendment in the nature of a substitute requires that individuals  who ensure the safety of the maritime industry prepare for these highly technical jobs by meeting requisite training standards. The bill also requires that as new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals are approved, all of the resources necessary to adequately secure these terminals are in place. I emphasize that these provisions will not impede the development of any new project. They will simply ensure that security requirements are met before new terminals become operational. 
   Further, H.R. 2830 will set new and increasingly stringent standards for the treatment of ballast water through which invasive species have been introduced to some of our Nation's most fragile marine environments, such as the Chesapeake Bay. It will also give mariners the right to have cases involving the potential suspension or revocation of their professional credentials heard by the National Transportation Safety Board's administrative law judge system. 
   These provisions respond to compelling testimony from former Coast Guard ALJs indicating that they did not work in an environment that supported their exercise of judicial independence. Mariners who are unsafe should not be on our Nation's waterways, but fair treatment must be assured to all individuals in any legal proceeding. And the transfer of the Coast Guard's ALJ function to the National Transportation Safety Board will avoid even the potential appearance of unfairness. 
   Finally, the amendment takes significant new steps to ensure that our Nation's ``shield of freedom'' resembles the nation it is defending. The bill would require applicants to the Coast Guard Academy to be nominated by Members of Congress or other authorities. This, in conjunction with expanded minority recruiting efforts, would draw students from all of our Nation's communities to the academy, beginning the process that the Commandant himself has said is needed to expand minorities at all ranks of the more than 6,000-member officer corps from the current number of 827. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, it is my honor to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 2830, which will set standards that will ensure the Coast Guard performs at the level it expects of itself while also providing the resources necessary to enable the service to fulfill all of its missions.

   Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I am honored to take this opportunity afforded by National Maritime Day to pay tribute to our Nation's merchant mariners and to the entire maritime industry. 
   I also honor the tireless work of the men and women of the United States Coast Guard, who ensure the safety and security of our Nation's ports, who protect our economic interests in the maritime environment around the world and who, every year, save the lives of thousands of mariners in distress. 
   In 1933, the United States first honored our merchant mariners through the designation of May 22 as National Maritime Day. Seventy-four years later, we again pause to honor the service and sacrifices of our merchant mariners by considering H. Res. 413, offered by my distinguished colleague, Congressman Bob Filner, the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   H. Res. 413 pays special tribute to the estimated 250,000 Americans who served in the War Shipping Administration, moving 95 percent of the goods and materiel used by the allies used during World War II. 
   The Congressional Research Service report said more than 50 percent of those who served in the Merchant Marine in World War II were under the age of 25, and some 20,000 of these men were killed or wounded in the war, yielding among the Merchant Marine the highest casualty rate of any service, according to the U.S. Maritime Service Veterans. 
   Despite their gallant service, World War II-era U.S. merchant mariners have still not received many of the benefits given to those who served in the other U.S. military forces engaged in World War II. U.S. merchant mariners have still never been made eligible for the GI Bill or for the housing, educational or unemployment benefits that the bill provided for other U.S. veterans. 
   Not until 1988 were World War II-era merchant mariners made eligible for services from the Veterans Administration. Not until 1998 were they made eligible for burial and cemetery benefits. While these are important benefits long overdue to World War II-era merchant mariners, many of these mariners were no longer with us when these benefits were extended. Even fewer of the World War II-era mariners are with us today. For many, therefore, any benefits granted now come too late. 
   Further, even for those who are still with us, it is too late to give them the opportunities that they might have had, had they been eligible for the benefits of the GI Bill at the conclusion of their service. 
   I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to honor all of those who served in our Nation's Merchant Marine during World War II, and I hope that the experience of these mariners will be a lesson to ensure that we never, never again deny any veteran who has served the United States any of the benefits he or she has earned. 
   As I close, I also honor the vital role that our merchant mariners continue to play in responding to our Nation's emergencies. Most recently, the U.S. merchant mariners help evacuate an estimated 160,000 people from Manhattan on September 11, 2001, and provided aid and emergency assistance along the gulf coast to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 
   Merchant mariners also continue to provide the sealift capacity that keeps our Armed Forces equipped to fight the global war on terrorism. More than 8,000 merchant mariners serve in the Military Sealift Command, and the Seafarers International Union has written that civilian crews and military support ships have moved some 79 million square feet of cargo to United States troops in Iraq and throughout the world since 9/11. Without these highly trained men and women, we will likely be unable to equip our Armed Forces with the supplies they need to defend our Nation. 
   I honor all of the members, past and present, of the United States Merchant Marine. I urge the passage of H.R. 413 and again commend my colleague, Congressman Filner, for his tireless efforts on behalf of our World War II-era merchant mariners. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on May 4, 2007, life in the close-knit community of Greensburg, Kansas, changed forever. At approximately 9:45 p.m. central time, a massive tornado all but destroyed the Kansas town of Greensburg, Kansas, located in south central Kansas, east of Dodge City, Kansas. The tornado was classified as an EF-5, a large and extremely dangerous mile-wide tornado with winds up to 205 miles per hour. 
   The 20-minute warning time was reasonable, but the tornado was so destructive that nine people in Greensburg unfortunately died, and 95 percent of the town was damaged or destroyed. While the infrastructure damage is crushing, citizens of Greensburg have refused to let this incident crush their spirit, hope and determination. Resilience is the watchword, and rebuilding is the daily driving force. 
   We're here today as representatives of all the citizens of this great Nation to express our sympathy to the residents of Greensburg for this tragedy of historic proportions. More importantly, we stand in support for the citizens of Greensburg as they heal their families and rebuild their community. 
   I stand here in support of this resolution.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Moran for his statements. There was one scene that I am sure most Americans saw on TV. Right after the storm and the tornado, and people were looking through their belongings, there was one lady who said, ``You know, if I could just find my wedding ring, if I could just find my wedding ring.'' 
   Her house was totally demolished. Apparently she had said that early in the day. Then later in the day, they showed her again, saying, ``You won't believe this. I found my wedding ring.'' 
   For some reason, that was a very telling statement on her part, because what she was basically saying is that while the buildings may fall, while so much may seem so dim, the fact is that I still have family. I want that wedding ring, that band, that symbol of unity, that symbol of togetherness, that symbol of generations yet unborn, and those who have come before me; that's what I am looking for. 
   Just as she found her wedding ring, I know the citizens of Greensburg will make it. Just as Mr. Moran said, they will rebuild. 
   Then there was another scene, just yesterday on the news, where the commentators were talking about how a bank or two had kind of a temporary building, and other buildings were slowly coming up just to keep things rolling and doing business. Then to hear about the graduation of 25 students and 1,800 guests appearing, I think that sends a very powerful message to our Nation, and such a powerful message to so many people. 
   Throughout life, we all fall down, but the question is whether we will get up. I think that as people watch the citizens of Greensburg, they realize that there will always, in the words of Martin Luther King, be interruptions in our lives. The question is whether we will continue our lives after the interruptions. 
   On behalf of all of our Members, and I know there will be a unanimous vote from all of our Members, we want to say to the citizens of Greensburg that we stand with you, that our prayers are with you, and just know that as we remind you, God holds you in the palm of His hand.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (ENOUGH IS ENOUGH -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, the new military strategy in Iraq is simply not working. President Bush misled Congress and the American people when he led our troops into Iraq. To this day, he continues trying to mislead us, most recently with reports that violence is down in Iraq since the surge of the United States troops. This is absolutely untrue, and I am utterly shocked at the audacity of this administration and many of my Republican colleagues to so boldly manipulate the facts to serve their own political agenda. 
   Overall, violence in Iraq has risen since the troop surge. That's right, violence has risen. 
   Newly released statistics for Iraqi civilian deaths in August show a 20 percent increase since July. The President and the Pentagon are picking and choosing which numbers will be included in death tolls to give the appearance that the violence is down. 
   According to information from the Iraq Study Group and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, they do not count deaths of people who have been shot in the head from the front. They do not count deaths of Shiite or Shiite violence which is on the rise in the oil-rich south, nor do they count the intra-Sunni violence in the Sunni Triangle.  
   Mr. Speaker, it is reported they are not even counting deaths from car bombs. We read about deadly car bombs in Iraq nearly every day, and these deaths are not being counted by this administration. 
   I'm also greatly concerned about the Defense Department adjusting its figures for sectarian killings in the 5-month period before the surge began. There's a major discrepancy between the data on the March 2007 report and the June 2007 report for this period. The original number of approximately 5,500 deaths was increased to 7,400, offering the appearance of significantly decreased violence since the troop surge began. 
   I must ask, why is this administration working so hard to create the appearance of success in Iraq? Is it to justify the more than $368 billion we have spent since the inception of Operation Iraqi Freedom? Is it to rationalize the staggering $10 billion a month we continue to spend in Iraq while we put the lives of our brave soldiers at risk? 
   During every month of 2007 there have been more U.S. military fatalities than in the same month of 2006. How can anyone possibly say that this new surge is working? 
   Mr. Speaker, I was hopeful that the administration had perhaps begun listening to the cries of the American people to bring our troops home when reports over the last couple of weeks indicated that General Petraeus was considering a draw down of our current troop levels. 
   Unfortunately, we learned today that our hopes of redeployment of our military servicemembers will continue to fall on deaf ears, as General Petraeus announced earlier today that he has no intention of scaling back our troop levels in Iraq. In failing to do so, this Nation's attention will remain distracted from adequately protecting the home front, building an adequate health care system, reforming Social Security and decreasing the deficit. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush loves to talk about the success of the al Anbar province where he made a surprise visit for a photo opportunity on Labor Day. But there are many conflicting opinions about why violence has decreased, whether or not this is the result of the troop surge, and whether the success in this region is indicative of success in other more complex regions of the country. 
   Many believe this success may be the result of multilayered issues. It may be an indication that ethnic cleansing has been completed in many neighborhoods and that there are just not as many people left to kill. It may be the result of militants moving to other regions of the country where violence has increased. It may be the result of Sunnis befriending the United States simply as a means to accomplish a larger goal of stepping back into power. It may be the result of Sunnis finally rejecting the routine abuse by al Qaeda. It may be a combination of all of these. 
   Regardless, we cannot ensure that any success in al Anbar is a result of the troop surge, nor can we ensure that this success can be transferred to other parts of the country. In fact, the overriding component of ensuring success in Iraq is political reconciliation, as pointed out by the GAO and the Jones Commission before the House Armed Services Committee this week. 
   Military and security progress cannot be made without political reconciliation, which will open the door to resolving the underlying issues that have caused sectarian violence in Iraq. 
   President Bush has yet to discuss the failing grade given by the GAO to Iraq on political reconciliation. 
   Mr. Speaker, ignoring reports and underreporting violence is not the answer. This administration has misled the American people for far too long. Enough is enough.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my strong support of H.R 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Modernization Act. As we near the end of the holiday shopping season, the critical nature of this legislation cannot be overstated. 
   2007 truly has been the Year of Toxic Toys, and I join my colleagues, as well as parents across the nation in expressing extreme alarm at not only the number--more than 2 million--of toys that have been recalled, but also at the names that have been associated with them--Toys 'R Us, Fisher Price, and Mattel. 
   Madam Speaker, these are not just random toys being picked up at some dime store; these are toys being produced by popular, long-established companies whose names parents trust. Sadly, it appears that this trust may be misplaced. 
   Toxic levels of lead in the paint have been detected on the popular Thomas the Tank Engine. GHB--the date rape drug--was found in the popular Aqua Dots, at levels high enough to put children in comas. I could offer seemingly endless examples of the atrocities that have been lining the shelves of our toy stores--and of our children's bedrooms--with more regard being placed on profit over protecting children's health. But, Madam Speaker, I will focus instead on something more alarming than these toys themselves: how they are getting into the market in the first place. 
   Madam Speaker, we have an agency called the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Let me re-emphasize this--the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   Its name alone suggests protection against hazardous products, so how is it possible that parents are purchasing toys with 200 times the legal level of lead? 
   How is it possible, that more than two million toys were able to slip past this agency, which by definition is charged with being a watchdog for our--and our children's--safety? 
   The answer, Madam Speaker, is that under the current administration and the previous leadership in Congress, the CPSC has seen drastic cuts in funding. More disturbing than the lax oversight of safety is the chairwoman of the CPSC, Nancy Nord, voicing opposition to increased funding or authority. 
   I cannot say that I have met anyone who is opposed to getting more money--especially when the person in question is charged with an agency whose mission is so critical--and especially when this agency has one person--one person--assigned to testing toys. 
   Madam Speaker, only 15 inspectors are policing the hundreds of points of entry for our imported toys--and I might add that 80 percent of toys in the U.S. are imported from China. The CPSC has only 85 percent of the employees it had in 2004, and only half of the employees it had 30 years ago. 
   This is shocking to the conscience and completely unacceptable. If Ms. Nord and the CPSC are unwilling to do what they ought to do, we must step in and do it ourselves. Our young people's health and futures depend on it. With H.R. 4040, we are taking steps to protect our most vulnerable consumer: our children. 
   This legislation bans all but trace amounts of lead in toys and children's jewelry. It strengthens the CPSC's ability to notify consumers about dangerous products more quickly and more widely. It bans the importation of toys or other children's products that have not been tested and do not conform to U.S. standards--meaning no more toys containing the date rape drug. 
   And, although Ms. Nord did not want any monetary gifts, we will be stuffing the CPSC's stocking with much needed supplemental funding this holiday season. 
   In closing, I thank my friend and colleague, Representative RUSH for understanding the current crisis and for introducing this much needed legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4040. Let's come together to ensure that 2009 is the Year of Safe Consumerism.

   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise today in strong support of S. 2482. 
   This legislation is very simple. It would repeal an antiquated law that requires vessels and the captains of vessels conducting salvage operations off the coast of Florida to obtain licenses from a United States District Court. The law, which applies only to Florida, was adopted in 1847. No license has been issued under this law since approximately 1921, in large measure, because it seems to have been a forgotten requirement until the recent codification of title 46. 
   This law serves no purpose at this time. The measure before us would repeal this provision and would eliminate  a needless burden on salvors working off the coast of Florida. 
   I applaud Senator Martinez for his leadership on this measure, and I urge its adoption by the House. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to thank her for sponsoring this important bill, and I take a moment to honor my friend, Congressman Millender-McDonald. 
   She and I had a special relationship because we sat beside each other on the committee, and she had come to Washington in a special election about a month before I came in a special election. So we had a certain kinship. 
   But as I sat here and I was listening to Ms. Richardson and listening to the minority, it's clear that all of us had a tremendous respect for her. And I thought about all of the kind things that Ms. Richardson said about her. But one of the things that she said that stood out for me most was that she was a mentor. 
   Around here, we come here, we do our work, we work hard, we give it everything we've got; and I know Mr. Duncan knows what I'm talking about. We give it everything we've got, and then we leave. And sometimes I guess we wonder how much impact we have had. But I think the greatest impact we can have is on other people. 
   The fact that Congresswoman Millender-McDonald took Congresswoman Richardson under her wing as a young staff assistant and then worked with her and considered her a friend, and then the next thing you know we see this young lady that is Congresswoman Richardson now  emerge as just an outstanding Member of Congress says a lot about the effectiveness not only about Ms. Millender-McDonald with regard to her legislative life, that is what she did here on the Hill, but it also says a lot about what she did in her district and how she affected people. 
   The reason I mention that, Mr. Speaker, is because I think a lot of people get very confused about what we do here. Some people think that it's just the buildings that you have built and all of the things that you may bring back to your district. But the thing that is truly lasting is not all the buildings and all of the highways, but it's about building people because that's what truly lasts. 
   I'm often reminded of a part of ``The Lion King,'' which I love so much. My kids tease me about it, but I love it. There's one portion of ``The Lion King'' where the young lion cub says to his father, ``You died, and I need you, and I need you to be here with me so that I can talk to you and ask for advice and so that you can help my through my difficult times.'' And he's saying, ``Where are you?'' And then a few songs later, it says, ``He lives in you.'' 
   I think what we're doing here right now today is a perfect example of that. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald, just like all of us, had to move on and make a transition. But she was able to leave someone behind to carry on her work. And she has left an impact not only on the Democratic side, but our Republican brothers and sisters, so that we can carry on that work. 
   I can never remember ever sitting down at a markup where Ms. Millender-McDonald did not have something to say about her district. Ever. I used to tease her. I used to say, ``You're getting all the money, girl.'' She'd say, ``That's my job.'' 
   So I just wanted to take a moment to honor her, and I just hope that when we folks drive down Highway 91, somebody will ask the question, ``Who was she,'' some child who never got to know her, somebody who may have not been informed about who their Congresswoman was, but hopefully somebody would be there in their car to be able to tell them the story of a great lady, a great lady who not only built bridges, but one who also tore down walls, consistently tore down walls of separation, built bridges of unity bringing people together as head of our House Administration Committee, constantly reaching out. 
   One of the last letters I got before she passed away was a letter about an issue that was very controversial, but she had resolved it, and it was just before she died. 
   So to the very end--and that's what they told us at her funeral, by the way, they said she was working until the day she died. 
   But then she did something very important. She passed on the baton to a young lady now who turns around and says, ``You know what? I am not going to let you be forgotten.'' 
   And this Congress is not going to let her be forgotten because her life is a shining example of what all our lives should be. I want to thank again all sides for making this happen.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (INTEGRATED DEEPWATER PROGRAM REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman for yielding and for all of his hard work and help in making this happen, this legislation happen today. 
   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I rise today to urge the adoption of the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act of 2008, H.R. 6999, as amended. As Chairman Oberstar has stated, this legislation is based on Deepwater reform legislation, H.R. 2722, which passed the House by a vote of 426-0 last year, and on S. 924, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent. 
   The manager's amendment amends the underlying bill by making it a crime to operate a submersible vehicle that is not registered in any country. Such vessels are often used to smuggle illegal drugs into the United States. In  fact, just this month the Coast Guard worked with the United States Navy to seize two such submersibles, carrying a combined total of 14 tons of cocaine. 
   As a representative of the City of Baltimore, I know that every gram of illegal drugs we keep off our Nation's streets is a gram that cannot destroy a life or a community. Therefore, as smugglers develop new ways to bring drugs to our shores, our laws must be updated to enable law enforcement personnel to prosecute these new types of crimes, and this bill does precisely that. 
   I recognize and I want to thank again Chairman Oberstar, chairman of our full committee, and also thank the vice chairman of our subcommittee, Mr. Bishop, and Mr. Taylor for their hard work; and I give special thanks, too, to Mr. Mica, to Mr. LaTourette, our ranking member of our subcommittee; Chairman Thompson, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, and certainly Representative King, who is the ranking member of Homeland Security; Senators Inouye and Hutchison and Senator Snow; and we want to give special thanks to Senator Cantwell, who has worked very, very hard on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, since my appointment in January 2007 as chairman of the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard, the subcommittee has exercised careful oversight over the Coast Guard's $24 billion, 25-year Deepwater procurements, through which the Coast Guard is replacing or rehabilitating its cutters and aircraft. Senator Cantwell has been leading a similar aggressive oversight effort on the Senate side. 
   Unfortunately, many of the acquisitions conducted under Deepwater have miserably failed, including the nearly $100 million effort to lengthen the 110-foot patrol boats, which yielded eight unseaworthy vessels that have been removed from service. 
   The early Deepwater procurements failed because the Coast Guard did not have the systems and personnel necessary to manage large acquisitions. They failed because the Coast Guard left private sector contractors to police themselves. And they failed because Congress did not require of the Coast Guard full accountability for the billions, the billions of taxpayer dollars appropriated to support such acquisitions. 
   I'm very pleased that our committee and our subcommittee wrote H.R. 6999 to ensure that all Coast Guard acquisitions meet three key requirements. One, in basic contract law, that we get what we bargain for as a Nation. That we get what we bargain for. That was number one. Number two, that the equipment that we buy would enable the Coast Guard to fulfill its many missions to protect our homeland and to do all the other things that they have to do. And number three, and very interestingly, we wanted to make sure that the equipment that we were purchasing with taxpayers dollars could not bring harm to our very personnel. Those were the three principles that we wrote this legislation on, and I was glad to see that our subcommittee and our committee pretty much adopted them as we went through this legislation. 
   The Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Thad Allen, has moved to strengthen the service's ability to manage acquisitions, including creating a new acquisitions directorate, and I applaud his efforts. 
   Under his leadership, the service has taken conditional delivery of the first National Security Cutter, the Bertholf. Having joined the Coast Guard in commissioning the Bertholf this summer, I know it is a fine ship, and it will greatly enhance the service's mission capabilities. 
   However, the Bertholf experienced significant cost overruns, and the Coast Guard continues to face procurement challenges and not only within Deepwater. For example, the Rescue 21 program, which is intended to upgrade the systems the Coast Guard utilizes to locate those who are distressed at sea, is now hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. 
   American taxpayers, who are now being asked to rescue our financial system from the consequences of failed oversight, have already shouldered the burden for the Coast Guard's earlier failed procurements and for failed procurements throughout the Department of Homeland Security, which according to a tally compiled by the Homeland Security Committee have wasted approximately $15 billion. 
   As a representative elected by the citizens of Maryland's Seventh Congressional District and as subcommittee chairman, I believe that one of our most critical duties at this time is to implement every available measure to ensure that Federal agencies are effective and efficient stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. The legislation before us today implements such measures with regard to the United States Coast Guard. 
   Specifically, H.R. 6999 requires the Coast Guard to eliminate the use of all private-sector lead systems integrators by October 2011, the same date on which their use is phased out in the Department of Defense. 
   This bill creates in statute the position of Chief Acquisitions Officer. It requires that it be filled with a fully qualified individual who can, at the Commandant's choosing, be a civilian member of the senior executive service or a uniformed member of the Coast Guard but who must have Level III Acquisitions qualification and 10 years of experience managing acquisition efforts. 
   The bill requires independent, third-party certification of assets and requires that appropriate testing be performed on asset designs so that problems can be identified before construction of an asset begins. 
   It also requires a regular submission of acquisition program reviews to Congress, including notification of cost overruns and schedule delays, so that Congress is aware of emerging issues before they become crises. 
   In short, this bill brings commonsense oversight and management reform measures, many of them based on current practices within the DOD, to the Coast Guard. It also requires strict and appropriate accountability from the service and demands that it be an effective and efficient steward of our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. 
   All of these measures are critical to ensure that through the remaining Deepwater procurements, the nearly 42,000 men and women, who I call our thin blue line at sea, will be equipped with state-of-the-art assets equal to the missions they perform and the challenges they will face in the 21st century. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6999, and I thank the minority for their wonderful participation in making this happen. I thank all of those, our staffs, who have worked so hard to make this happen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding. And I also associate myself with her words and the words of Mr. Poe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation to the members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the leadership for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Special acknowledgment and thanks also go to my friend and colleague, Representative Gregory Meek of New York, for acknowledging and appreciating the efforts and accomplishments of the Constellation's crew by joining me as a lead cosponsor. 
   This resolution recognizes the USS Constellation for its role in ending the Transatlantic slave trade. The Constellation deserves to be recognized not only for the liberation of thousands of Africans, but also the liberation from oppression and ignorance. 
   As a descendent of slaves, I understand the importance of the Constellation's role as a shining moment in one of the darkest points in our Nation's history. Its role in the progression of our society is only further amplified, given the political history that is currently being made today, and as Ms. Jackson-Lee alluded to. 
   As the first Union Navy vessel to interdict major slave ships along the West African coast, the USS Constellation was a flagship for the United States Navy's African squadron from 1859 to 1861. During this time, the USS Constellation was used to capture 14 slave ships and liberate nearly 4,000 Africans headed towards a life deprived of freedom and unpaid labor. In fact, after a dramatic chase into the night on September 25, 1860, the USS Constellation was used to capture the Cora near the mouth of the Congo River. Crammed into the dark ``slave deck'' were 705 Africans. 
   A detachment of the Constellation's crew took the surviving Africans to Monrovia, Liberia, a colony founded for the settlement of free African Americans that became the destination for all Africans freed on slave ships captured by the United States Navy. 
   In 1894, the Constellation continued its historic service as a training vessel at the U.S. Naval Academy and ended its service as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet during World War II. 
   Decommissioned in 1955, the USS Constellation is berthed in my district and, of course, in my hometown of Baltimore at the Inner Harbor. This 153-year-old American warship was designated as a national historic landmark on May 23, 1963, and is the perfect location to commemorate the bicentennial of the abolition of the Transatlantic slave trade in the United States. 
   On September 25, 2008, the USS Constellation Museum will hold a ceremony to commemorate the history of the ship and its crew. Additionally, there will be a special program to recognize the descendents of Constellation's crew who will be in attendance. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I thank those who supported H. Res. 1159 as cosponsors, and ask that my colleagues support the adoption of this resolution to ensure that this part of American history is never forgotten.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING PROSTATE CANCER DETECTION AND TREATMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I want to thank everyone for all the hard work that went into getting this bill to the floor today. 
   I rise today to express my appreciation to all of my colleagues who are considering H. Res. 353 which I introduced expressing the need for enhanced support for advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection and treatment. This legislation will lead to the development of prostate cancer screening technologies that are on par with mammography, while improving blood tests and providing education to the general public. 
   Mr. Speaker, the tragedy of prostate cancer has touched so many Americans, and I ask that you consider these issues: 
   Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. This cancer strikes one in every six men, making it even more prevalent than breast cancer, which strikes one in every seven women. In 2007, more than 218,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 27,000 men died from this disease. One new case occurs every 2.5 minutes, and a man dies from prostate cancer in this country every 19 minutes. 
   To compact the matter even further, African-American men are 56 percent more likely to develop prostate cancer compared with Caucasian men and nearly 2.5 times as likely to die from the disease. Many of us in the Congress, and indeed throughout the country, have either personally been affected by the disease or had a loved one suffer from it. For me, it was my father. 
   Tragically, our commitment to fighting the disease has not met its impact. To date, the Department of Health and Human Services has failed to invest substantial resources in promising advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer research. And while they have failed, people have died. As a result of that, there are currently no reliable accurate diagnostic tools for detection and treatment of prostate cancer. 
   The implications of this reality have been grave. More than 1 million men have unnecessary prostate biopsies each year, resulting in needless suffering and an enormous waste of resources. At least 10 percent of men undergoing surgery and 44 percent of men undergoing radiation treatment would have benefited more from watchful waiting. 
   Current treatment is costly and causes many complications, including impotence and incontinence, in up to 50 percent of men. I might note here that Johns Hopkins Hospital and University, which are located in my district, have done many pioneering things with regard to this disease; as a matter of fact, they have some of the leading experts on it. 
   More than 70,000--or about one in two--men experience treatment failure each year. Mr. Speaker, in this country, with the greatest medical system in the world, we can simply do better. And we must do better. That is why I was so glad that I was joined by 101 of my colleagues in sponsoring H. Res. 353. This legislation is a first step in recognizing the critical need to address this very tragic disease. 
   I urge my colleagues to similarly take up the Prostate Research Imaging and Men's Education Act, or PRIME  Act, H.R. 3563, which I have also introduced. 
   The bill provides $100 million per year for 5 years to expand research on prostate cancer and provides the resources to develop innovative and advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment. The bill also allocates $10 million a year for 5 years for a national campaign to increase awareness about the need for prostate cancer screening and the development of better screening techniques. 
   Finally, it will spend $20 million a year for 5 years to improve current, often unreliable, blood tests. Just the other day, Mr. Speaker, as I stood in the bank, I ran into four men, all of whom had recently gone through prostate cancer procedures. And it is so sad when you hear them tell their various stories about how it has affected their lives. 
   And I do believe that this Congress can do better. I believe that this Nation can do better. So many men have said that they want to be treated, but they are simply afraid; they're afraid of the pain, they're afraid of the embarrassment. And I spend a lot of time in my district preaching, almost, to men to make sure they get the test. But if they don't have to have the test, if they can have a better method of discovering this disease, I want them to have that. 
   Someone once said that in our time and in our space we can make a difference. And we can make a difference. And I realize that a resolution is one thing, something allocating money to do something is another. And that's why this is more or less a precursor, hopefully, for legislation which will bring about the resources so that we can properly address this issue.

   Mr. CUMMINGS. I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership and to you, Chairman Frank, and all of the members of the committee. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a very important piece of legislation involving what we have, HOPE VI projects. And I just want to correct Mr. Bachus. Two of those projects are within six blocks of my house, so I deal with these folks every day. I talk to them. I wish we had more HOPE VI projects because I will never forget when we opened one of them. The area had been drug infested, a highrise, and when we opened it up, literally a lot of residents came back and they were crying because they were going to move in. There were others who couldn't move in because we did not have enough housing. I will never forget that day. I said this is like having Andy of Mayberry in the middle of our community. And it is. Children are able to play. Men staying out late at night playing checkers. People can leave their bikes out. A wonderful life and giving hope. That's what it's all about. 
   So I want to thank Ms. Waters and Chairman Frank for including in this legislation, as part of their manager's amendment, certain items that we included. And I want to thank you very much for your leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (THE VALUE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, according to today's Baltimore Sun, there have been 240 homicides in my hometown of Baltimore City, 22 more deaths than this time last year. Unfortunately, many of these victims and their families will not have closure because of the inability of law enforcement to bring their killers to justice. This is due in large part to the fear that witnesses have in coming forward. 
   Witness intimidation is a serious threat to our justice system. According to the National Institute of Justice, 51 percent of prosecutors in large jurisdictions find witness intimidation to be a major problem. In Baltimore City, it is estimated that witness intimidation occurs in 90 percent of the cases that are prosecuted. 
   Madam Speaker, protecting witnesses is a core government function. It is standard in the Federal system, and State and local prosecutors should have the same tools. However, there is a great disparity between funding and witness services, if any, that are provided by local authorities and those of the Federal Witness Security Program within the United States Marshals Service that operates on a $40 million budget to assist 17,500 witnesses and their family members with gaining new lives, new identities, and new jobs. 
   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel recently reported on the problems associated with inadequate witness protection programs. Maurice Pulley was shot to death in front of his home, the apparent victim of retaliation for agreeing to cooperate with authorities. Just three days prior to his death, Mr. Pulley had agreed to testify as a witnesses against Calvin Glover for shooting him on June 30; however, law enforcement was not able to offer him assistance because the witness program in the county was essentially terminated due to budget cuts. The sheriff even admitted to occasionally relying on private funding to relocate witnesses. 
   Madam Speaker, the same week, the Denver Post told a story of Javad Marshall-Fields and his fiancee, who were gunned down just days before he was scheduled to testify against Robert Ray. In 2004, Robert Ray shot and killed one person and wounded two others, including Javad Marshall-Fields. 
   A program to protect State witnesses has been in existence in Colorado for over 12 years; however, the budget was recently cut from $100,000 to $50,000. Unfortunately, it now allows for a little more than a bus ticket or security deposit for a new apartment. 
   To make matters worse, it appears that no one told Javad that this program even existed, even though prosecutors filed a motion to keep his address and those of five other witnesses secret due to their fear of retribution. Why was Javad not notified of the program? His mom was told that it was because he did not ask. 
   Madam Speaker, as I always say, there is nothing worse than a person not knowing what they don't know. This is why I recently teamed up with Baltimore City's State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy to film a public service announcement encouraging people in the communities to come forward if they have witnessed a crime, or if they have already come forward and feel they may need protection. 
   Additionally, I have introduced H.R. 933, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007, that authorizes $270 million over the next 3 years to enable State and local prosecutors who demonstrate a need for funds to protect witnesses in cases involving gangs or other violence to establish short-term witness protection programs. This legislation will assist in correcting the inequity that exists between the Federal and State level. I call upon my colleagues to support its enactment. 
   Improving protection for State and local witnesses will move us one step closer to alleviating the fears and threats to prospective witnesses and help safeguard our communities from violence. It is time that we show our commitment to our constituents and the justice system, because without witnesses, there can be no justice.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that I wholeheartedly support H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act. 
   I echo the words of Mr. Pence, who just spoke. I think he said it quite precisely and concisely, the citizens of the District of Columbia deserve a full right to vote. This bill does not go as far as I would like for it to go; but at the same time, it is a step in the right direction. 
   I applaud my colleague, Eleanor Holmes Norton, for tirelessly giving everything she has to make this happen. So this is a great day for her and a great day for our country and our Congress.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007, because the time is long past due for District of Columbia residents to gain the right to vote. 
   It is very fitting that we are considering giving D.C. residents the right to vote this week. April 15th marked the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African-American player in the Majors, and on Monday, D.C. residents celebrated Emancipation Day. In keeping with this line of great accomplishments, today we have the honor, the privilege, and the duty to correct one of this Nation's oldest violations of civil rights. 
   District residents have been denied full representation in Congress for over 200 years. This disenfranchisement impacts more than 500,000 people who live in the District, pay federal taxes, and fight for their country in war. Further, it disproportionately impacts the African American community, which makes up fifty-seven percent of the population in the District. No other state in the union has a larger percentage of Black residents. 
   However, this is an issue that surpasses race. It is about basic equality. I find it ironic that we are spending billions of dollars to export democracy, when our fellow American citizens are denied the very cornerstone of democracy, the right to vote. The residents of the District of Columbia demand and deserve the right to fully participate in our democracy. 
   Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON has shown great resolve in her tireless efforts to secure full voting rights for her constituents. And Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Tom Davis has been a great ally in this cause, both now and when the Republicans were in the Majority. 
   The bill includes a number of important provisions. 
   It will increase the size of the House by two seats, from 435 to 437 seats. One of the seats will go to the District of Columbia and the other seat will go to Utah, the next state in line to get a congressional seat. 
   The bill prevents partisan gerrymandering by creating the new seat for Utah as an at-large seat and by ensuring that Utah does not redistrict its other congressional seats until apportionment is conducted following the 2010 Census. 
   Importantly, the bill contains a non-severability clause, providing that if a court holds a section of this bill invalid or unenforceable, all other sections will be invalid or unenforceable. 
   Members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee recognize the compelling need for granting full representation to the citizens of the District of Columbia. I hope that all of our colleagues in the House will join us, and vote in favor of H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. 
   To be sure, while I support this bill, I do not think it goes far enough. However, this compromise legislation is a step in the right direction--a step towards granting residents of the District of Columbia the ability to fully express their democratic right to vote. This is a historic moment, and I would urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history by voting in favor of this bill. 
   Again, I would like to express my appreciation to Congresswoman Norton, Ranking Member Davis, and Chairman Waxman, and the House Leadership for their dedication in bringing this vitally important legislation to the floor and for providing us with the opportunity to correct years of disenfranchisement.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (SUPPORTING HOME OWNERSHIP AND RESPONSIBLE LENDING -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank Mr. Frank for his leadership and the assistance of his staff in helping us bring this resolution to the floor. And certainly I also say thanks to the ranking member of the subcommittee and the chair of the subcommittee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H. Res. 526, which supports homeownership and responsible lending. Specifically, this resolution expresses the sense of the House that government action should be taken to protect home buyers from unscrupulous brokers and lenders. 
   This resolution was inspired by the plight of the American people, the people of Maryland, and my neighbors in Maryland's Seventh Congressional District who have lost their homes to foreclosure or who are currently facing foreclosure. 
   The dramatic increase in foreclosures is directly related to the emergence of the subprime mortgage industry, which has grown from less than 8 percent of the total mortgage market in 2001 to approximately 20 percent of the market today.  
   While subprime loans are not inherently dangerous, practices within the industry are turning homeownership, an essential component of the American dream, into a nightmare, costing many people their ticket to the middle class and/or preventing them from passing property on to their children. 
   Subprime mortgage loans are geared towards borrowers with low credit scores. Other characteristics of the loans often include low initial payments based on a fixed introductory or ``teaser'' rate that expires after 2 or 3 years and then adjusts to a variable rate for the remaining term of the loan; no payment or rate caps on how much the payment amount or interest rate may increase on the reset dates; and substantial prepayment penalties. 
   Terms of this nature present incredible risks to consumers who find it impossible to meet the increased payment requirements. Furthermore, the risk of foreclosure increases when borrowers are not adequately informed of product features and risks. And I would say to this House, we must be very careful not to blame the victim. 
   Many believe that the government should just allow the market to correct itself. However, remaining idle while the situation continues to get worse is unconscionable. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, approximately one in five subprime loans issued in 2005 and 2006 will go into default, costing 2.2 million homeowners their homes over the next several years. 
   RealtyTrac, a real estate research firm, estimates that foreclosures have increased by 42 percent from 2005 to 2006, to 1.2 million. This translates into one foreclosure for every 92 households. Most alarming is the fact that new foreclosure events in May 2007 totaled over 176,000, an increase of 19 percent since April and of 90 percent since May of 2006. 
   Recent reports estimate that 5,700 homeowners in Maryland were facing foreclosure and over 36,000 were late on their mortgages in the first quarter of the year. Most startling is the fact that, in June, Maryland ranked 22nd nationally in foreclosures, up from 40th in 2006. 
   My congressional district alone had 466 foreclosures in the month of May. This equates to a 570 percent increase since May 2005. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are astounding figures, but when combined with the impact that foreclosures have upon families and their communities, there is little doubt that immediate action needs to be taken to address this national crisis. We must do everything in our power to protect the future of homeownership. 
   A foreclosure results not only in the loss of a stable living place and significant investment for a family, but it also lowers the homeowner's credit rating, creating barriers to future home purchases and also hindering the ability to pay rent. It typically takes a victim of foreclosure 10 years to recover and buy another house, which means that more and more potential homeowners will be taken out of the home buyer base. 
   For lower-income communities attempting to revitalize, the consequence of increased foreclosures is often a substantial setback in neighborhood security and sustainability. Areas of concentrated foreclosures can affect the price that other sellers can get for their houses. As higher foreclosure rates ripple through local markets, each house tossed back into the market adds to the supply of for-sale homes and could bring down home prices. In the last 2 years, foreclosures have cost the city of Baltimore approximately $1.8 billion in reduced property values. 
   Finally, the predominance of subprime loans in low-income and/or minority neighborhoods means that the bulk of the spillover costs of foreclosures are concentrated among the Nation's most vulnerable households. These neighborhoods already have incidences of crime, and increased foreclosures have been found to contribute to higher levels of violent crime. Because of the inherent dangers posed by foreclosures, we must act now to save families across this Nation and preserve our communities. 
   Various pieces of legislation have been introduced in the House and Senate to help homeowners refinance their homes, but congressional action alone will not fix the problem. Earlier this year, I sent a letter to Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve asking that action be taken to protect homeowners from predatory lending practices using its authority under the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act. I am pleased that the board and other regulators recently issued guidelines to lenders that encompass many of the ideas expressed in the letter sent in May and in House Resolution 526, which states that the government action should do the following: enforce rules to eliminate unfair and deceptive practices in subprime mortgage lending; encourage lenders to evaluate a borrower's ability to reasonably repay the mortgage over the life of the loan, not just at the introductory rate; establish clear minimum standards for mortgage originators; require that disclosures clearly and effectively communicate necessary information about any mortgage loan to the potential borrower; reduce or eliminate abuses in prepayment penalties; address appraisal and other mortgage fraud; raise public awareness regarding mortgage originators whose loans have high foreclosure rates; and increase opportunities for loan counseling. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to reiterate that owning a home is an essential component of the American dream. Simply put, homeownership has the power to transform lives. Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and continue working to address this critical issue. Again, I thank Chairman Frank for his leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (THE AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend Chairman Barney Frank, the House leadership, and the administration for working together to bring relief to the automobile industry and millions of workers. By passing the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, H.R. 7321, we took the monumental step of both saving jobs and setting the U.S. automotive industry on a path that will make it globally effective, efficient, and competitive. And equally important, we established a new standard of accountability that must be enforced for any institutions seeking government assistance. 
   For months, the Federal Government has been blindly throwing money at nearly every financial institution that blinks with no written requirements on how that money is to be used and with no written standards of transparency or accountability. In response, these institutions have taken hundreds of billion of taxpayer dollars and continued to do business as usual: the business of partying at the spa, getting their facials and manicures, getting millions in retention payments and spending hundreds of millions of dollars on sports sponsorships. 
   This type of mismanagement of taxpayer funds has left the American people suffering from bailout fatigue. I get that. I have been one of the most vocal critics of this distribution of top funds to date. 
   However, today's legislation is completely different. The automakers have been forced to leap over 5 million hurdles to even be considered to receive a loan. And with every demand we have made of them, these companies have willingly obliged. 
   We cannot have one standard for white collar employees and a different standard for blue collar employees. We need to have strict standards for every one. 
   The legislation passed today includes very important oversight provisions to protect taxpayer dollars, such as prohibiting golden parachutes and capping executive bonuses. It also establishes a ``car czar'' position to hold these companies accountable for developing and implementing viable long-term restructuring plans and ensuring compliance on financing efforts. 
   And yet despite these requirements, there are some who will still believe that assisting the Big Three is a continuation of throwing good money after bad. I strongly disagree. With one in ten American jobs tied to the auto industry, this should not be considered a waste of money. We're talking about 3 million jobs expecting to be lost within a year if the auto industry goes down. With men and women across America continuing to struggle to keep roofs over their heads, to make ends meet, we simply cannot afford to lose these jobs. 
   Lastly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing the loss of 533,000 jobs in November, the highest single month loss in 34 years, and one of the most dismal reports in the Bureau's 124-year existence. 
   These figures were simply staggering, and we can and we must do better. And by passing this legislation today, we are taking a first step in doing so. 
   For this reason, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly consider H.R. 7321 and enact this much-needed legislation as soon as possible. I ask them, and I hope they will have more faith in our automobile industry, and I encourage all of my colleagues to continue the strict standards of accountability as we move forward. 
   With that, I yield back.

   Mr. Chairman, today we have the opportunity to pass a bipartisan piece of legislation that will assist in correcting many of the wrongs that are rampant throughout our armed services health care system, as most recently illustrated in the reports and investigations surrounding Walter Reed. 
   I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this very vital piece of legislation that is an initial step, and I emphasize that, initial step in tearing down the bureaucratic red tape that can hold wounded service men and women in limbo for months and even years after they return home with injuries from the battlefield. 
   H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act, ensures better access to health care, better conditions in outpatient and inpatient treatment, a better means to report substandard conditions and, finally, better oversight. 
   H.R. 1538 responds to concerns raised by the men and women of our armed services and does the following things that are so important: Providing them with an assigned medical care case manager and limiting their caseload in order to prevent extensive backlogs; providing medical advocates to stand with soldiers before medical evaluations boards; and I think this is so important, providing a toll-free hotline that soldiers and their families can use to report inadequacies in care; and establishing a pilot program to ensure that our servicemembers have a seamless transition from Armed Forces to the Veterans Affairs agency. 
   Finally, let me say this, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that our chairman, Mr. Skelton, who has done an outstanding job, and Mr. Hunter, our ranking member, were very significant, along with Mr. Filner, in seeing that an amendment that I put forth was passed, and that was to give the head of Veterans Affairs two appointments to the Oversight Committee. So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very outstanding piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (H.R. 3963, CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007: PART II -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, for the second time we have overwhelmingly and on a bipartisan basis passed a bill to provide health insurance for 10 million American children by reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   This legislation presents another opportunity for President Bush to show the American people that he values the well-being of our Nation's children. After all, the President has often said that he is a ``compassionate conservative.'' 
   Well, he failed the first time, and I was hopeful that the House could override his ill-advised veto. But, unfortunately, we came up 13 votes short. 
   So we are here again today passing a revised bill that sufficiently addresses the stated concerns of those who opposed the earlier bill. Those concerns really amount to little more than empty rhetoric. 
   Rather than complain, House leadership compromised on phasing out health care insurance for childless adults from 2 years to 1 year. The bill we passed today clarified that CHIP will focus first on enrolling low-income children by capping the enrollment level at 300 percent of the poverty level, or $62,000 for a family of four. 
   We also added language to clarify that CHIP does not cover illegal immigrants by requiring States to obtain further documentation of citizenship that cannot be confirmed by the Social Security Administration. And in addition to doing those things, creating new options for States to develop and expand premium assistance programs designed to keep children and their parents in an employer-sponsored plan, the new bill contains a provision adding premium assistance programs to the list of things a State can do to receive bonuses. It will also now require all States to develop plans and implement recommended best practices for minimizing crowd-out. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. None of these fixes were necessary under the original CHIP bill, which already contained provisions addressing these very issues. But these were concerns raised by some Members and the President; so we clarified the language for them. There can now be no question as to whether this bill should be supported. 
   In addition to addressing the concerns that have been raised, it contains several excellent provisions for our children. It insures dental coverage and mental health parity, including guaranteed dental benefits that I offered in response to the death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died when a tooth infection spread to his brain. 
   It also provides $100 million in grants for new outreach activities to States, local governments, schools, community-based organizations, safety-net providers, and others. And it improves a new quality child health initiative to  develop and implement quality measures and improve State reporting of quality data. 
   A recent national poll from CBS News finds that 81 percent of the American people support this bipartisan legislation, including large majorities of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. 
   I have heard many of my colleagues say that they wanted more time to review the bill, but we have already debated the issue more than was necessary. We are acting expeditiously because the short-term fix CHIP expires on November 16 and we cannot allow the 6 million children who are currently enrolled in the program to lose their coverage because we cannot make up our minds. 
   When it comes to health of our children, there is no time for uncertainty. That is why I am glad that we were able to pass the legislation a few minutes ago. And I strongly urge the Senate and President to follow suit with a great sense of urgency. This urgency is needed because there are 10 million very good reasons why we should support this legislation. As I have often said, our children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see. I think we ought to be about the business of urgently making sure that we send children into the future who are healthy.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CHIP REAUTHORIZATION -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened that we have failed to override the President's veto of legislation to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. This action represents a misstep of historic proportions. 
   It also saddens me that several Members on the other side applauded when this body failed to override the President's veto. By voting against this bipartisan, bicameral legislation, some Members of Congress have turned their backs on more than 10 million poor children who need health insurance now. 
   Let me be clear. The legislation that was vetoed today was an excellent piece of legislation, and our children will be worse off without it. The continuing resolution that we passed will temporarily cover children who are currently enrolled in CHIP, but the uncertainty surrounding the program's future leave our children's futures uncertain. Some States are already indicating that they will make cuts to the program if they cannot rely upon a steady Federal funding stream. 
   Further, the continuing resolution fails to address many of the critically important measures that we included in the reauthorization. Notably, dental, mental, and vision coverage are all absent. 
   We need no greater reminder of the need for these provisions than the recent death of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy from my home State of Maryland who died when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. Yes, he died. 
   Those who voted against this bill have ignored the calls of more than 81 percent of the American people and members of the Democratic and Republican Parties who support the initiative. Because of their lapse in judgment, 4 million uninsured children, 65,500 of them from my home State of Maryland, will be denied the coverage that Congress intended to grant them. Further, my colleagues who voted against this bill have shut the doctor's office door on approximately 6 million children who currently rely on CHIP for health insurance. 
   It chills the conscience to think of all those children who will be forced out of care. 
   It is particularly upsetting to consider how this will affect children with chronic disease who rely upon the CHIP benefit to get the care they need to simply survive. Lives are in the balance. 
   Bipartisan coalitions, including the National Governors Association and the United States Conference of Mayors, recognize the unique moral obligation we have with this legislation. Earlier this week, Mayor Sheila Dixon of my hometown of Baltimore held a press conference to call on Congress to override the President's veto. She also joined 20 mayors from across the country in signing a letter making the same appeal. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues in this Chamber stubbornly failed to acknowledge the reality that so many of us have clearly seen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could talk about the benefits of reauthorizing CHIP as I have in the past statements before this Chamber, but today I will take a different approach by letting my Republican colleagues speak for me. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, I will associate myself with the following comments: 
   Republican Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY of Iowa said, ``This is not a government takeover of health care. This is not socialized or nationalized medicine or anything like that.'' 
   Republican Senator ORRIN HATCH of Utah called the bill ``an honest compromise which improves a program that works for America's low-income children.'' 
   Republican Congressman DON YOUNG of Alaska said, ``Issues such as the health and well-being of our Nation's children are nothing to play politics with and nothing to scrimp on.'' 
   Republican Congressman VITO FOSSELLA of New York said the bill ``will put millions of young people on the road to a longer and healthier life.'' 
   And, finally, Republican Congressman WAYNE GILCHREST from my home State of Maryland expressed his support for the bill, noting, ``It focuses on the lowest income kids and fixes a lot of problems with the current program.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I deeply regret that the President and some of our colleagues lack the foresight to recognize the critical importance of passing the CHIP reauthorization. We simply must regroup and pass this vital piece of legislation. 
   Access to quality care is not a privilege; it is a right. We cannot afford to play politics with our children's lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Bipartisan Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, H.R. 4. 
   H.R. 4, despite the protestations to the opposite, does not require price controls, does not hamper research and development, does not require the Secretary of HHS to adopt the pricing structure of the Veterans Affairs system and does not require a national formulary. 
   What H.R 4 does require is for the Secretary of HHS to leverage the power of our 43 million Medicare beneficiaries to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to get the best possible drug prices for our seniors and disabled under Medicare Part D. 
   There are still some of my colleagues who say this legislation is not necessary, but the facts indicate otherwise. Manufacturer prices for brand-name drugs rose 6.3 percent in the 12 months ending June 2006, more than one and one-half times the 3.8 percent rate of general inflation over the same period. In 2006 alone, this increase translated to an additional $283 for the typical American senior--an increase many can ill-afford. 
   We know that these prices are only likely to further increase and we need to repeal this prohibition now to help our seniors and disabled. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. 
   The interim report released by the President today details exactly what I anticipated, a lack-of-progress report which demonstrates that the Iraqi Government has made the least progress on those key benchmarks that are vital to achieving stabilization. 
   The President at a press conference earlier today stressed the usual line of excuses that he has far too often utilized in the past, stating that we need to give General Petraeus time to show that the plus-up is effective and stress the importance of waiting until the September 15 progress report is released before drawing conclusions on the policy in Iraq. However, the President forgot to mention that General Petraeus said in an interview just last month that the chances of having a stable Iraqi Government in place by September are slim to none. Those are his words. 
   Frankly, our troops need our support, and that support must be their redeployment, which will end the continued bloodshed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman I rise to enter into a short colloquy with the chairman. First of all, I thank the chairman for producing a balanced and outstanding bill. 
   I come to raise an issue of concern to me regarding the food stamp eligibility for people who seek assistance for drug and alcohol abuse. This is why I offered an amendment to H.R. 2419, to ensure equal access to this vital benefit program regardless of whether one participates in an institutional drug rehabilitation program or supportive housing. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Food Stamp Program was designed to allow those who participate in private and public drug and alcohol treatment programs and individuals who live in supportive housing to receive food stamp benefits. However, the current language in the law that provides this benefit has been misinterpreted by various State officials. This ambiguity has made it difficult for individuals in supportive housing and rehabilitation programs to access food stamp benefits for which they are eligible. 
   I would ask the chairman if you would work with me in conference to see if we can address this inequity. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, tonight this House passed House Resolutions 740, 573 and 726 with regard to Darfur and Sudan. 
   Madam Speaker, decades from now our children's children will look back on these times as an ugly blemish on human history. They will remember a time when innocent people were senselessly slaughtered in the Darfur region of Sudan. The question is whether they will look back and see that this Nation and this Congress stood up for what is right and just, or did we sit idly by and watch from the sidelines. 
   Madam Speaker, we must be on the right side of this issue. That's why I'm so glad that we have passed these resolutions today. Although much work remains to be done, they represent a step in the right direction. 
   The passage of these bills rightfully pressures the Sudanese Government to end civil strife and ongoing human rights violations in Darfur, which threatens stability in the region and the very fabric of Sudanese life. 
   As you know, Madam Speaker, Darfur remains in great peril. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have lost their lives since the conflicts spiraled out of control in February of 2003. Over 2 million civilians have been internally displaced, and an estimated 215,000 more persons have been externally displaced in such neighboring states as Chad. Even for those who are internally displaced persons, they have experienced anything but a safe haven outside of Darfur while ongoing killing, torture, rape, looting and the unlawful destruction of their property by all parties continues, mainly by the janjaweed, associated militia groups, and the institution that should be protecting them, the Sudanese Government. 
   Indeed, as House Resolution 726 points out, it has become treacherous for women or young ladies in Darfur or eastern Chad to leave their villages to collect firewood or food from the market. They are at risk of being raped and assaulted, which, unfortunately, to date is exactly what has occurred to thousands. 
   Although some strides have been made in reducing the government's participation in continued human rights abuses in Darfur, militia groups remain a very real and present threat for the civilians in Darfur and eastern Chad, despite peace negotiations. 
   Particularly, as reported by the United Nations, these systematic human rights violations have been and continue to be committed with total impunity throughout Sudan, especially in Darfur. It is clear that the Government of Sudan has taken to turning a blind eye to such atrocities, choosing instead to provide strikingly few prosecutions, sentencing or even adequate examinations of war crimes or crimes against humanity, whether by criminal courts or those courts established to investigate the violations. 
   These failures by the Sudanese Government to respect and abide by customary international norms, international humanitarian and human rights laws embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Geneva Conventions and the Convention on the Rights of a Child that it is a party to demonstrates a lack of respect for international law and responsibility that it has to protect its citizenry from unacceptable levels of abuse. 
   Meanwhile, this Bush administration has held tightly to a hands-off approach by failing to send any troops to Sudan, despite there clearly being a lack of an adequate and capable number of African Union troops, amounting to a mere 7,000. 
   The President promised to not allow another Rwanda-style atrocity to occur; however, it appears to be happening once again, with little being done about it. Even the peace negotiations that recently occurred in Libya appear to be faltering, with two key militia groups failing to show up for the meeting. 
   As such, I congratulate my colleagues in passing these three vital resolutions this evening. And I thank the Congress, which has chosen to answer the pleas for help by the people of Darfur while the administration has failed to adequately respond. 
   We must act with a great sense of urgency. History will judge whether we have synchronized our conduct with our conscience.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank Chairman Oberstar for yielding. I also thank him for his leadership on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and for his unwavering commitment to the value of investing in our Nation's infrastructure. I also thank Congressman DeFazio for his leadership of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit and for his work on this legislation. 
   As a senior member of the Transportation Committee, I rise today in strong support of the National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act and the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Oberstar. 
   One out of eight bridges in the richest land in the world is now structurally deficient. In my own State of Maryland, the State Highway Administration maintains 2,578 bridges and overpasses at an annual cost of $110 million. A total of 129 of these bridges are structurally deficient, while an additional 410 are functionally obsolete. The drivers in this Nation should not have to worry as they cross bridges that the bridge will give way beneath them. But they do now. 
   To begin to meet our Nation's backlog on bridge maintenance needs, H.R. 3999 authorizes the appropriation from the general fund of $1 billion. Unfortunately, that is just a down payment. And as we work to bring our infrastructure into a state of good repair, the safety of the traveling public will rest on the effectiveness of our bridge inspection regime. 
   To strengthen that regime, this bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to develop a reliable national bridge inventory, to develop a risk-based method for assigning repair and replacement priorities, and to develop uniform bridge inspection processes. These are commonsense measures that will enable us to manage the resolution of our bridge maintenance needs effectively and efficiently. 
   Mr. Chairman, our Nation's highway infrastructure is a pillar of our economic success. And by passing this bill today, we can make a modest investment in the maintenance of that infrastructure to ensure that it can continue to carry our Nation's to new successes. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (FREQUENCY OF WITNESS INTIMIDATION -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, this evening I will continue my discussion on a growing and often deadly plague on our society, witness intimidation. 
   Each day, there is a story reported about civic-minded citizens being threatened with violence or becoming victims of fire bombings or shootings, all of which are designed to prevent them from testifying to crimes that they have witnessed. 
   Unfortunately, these tactics are working to form what has become commonly known as a ``conspiracy of silence.'' Witnesses are literally afraid for their lives. If you do not believe me, listen to these recent reports: in Newark, New Jersey, for 2 years Reginald Roe was the star and sole witness that prosecutors were relying on in a case involving an ambush gang killing in a parking lot there. Having picked two men's pictures out of a photo array and sworn before a grand jury, he said: ``I saw everything, I was there.'' 
   But when the case came to trial, with a group of gang members glaring at him in open court, Roe changed his story, testifying that he had heard the shots, but never saw who fired them. The two suspects were acquitted. 
   In Philadelphia, as the culture of fear continues to deter witnesses from coming forward, a Federal grand jury accused a drug dealer and his girlfriend of conspiring to intimidate a government witness by having the witness's neighborhood plastered with flyers labeling him ``a rat and a snitch.'' 
   In Parachute, Colorado, Garfield County deputies arrested five teenagers they believed threatened to beat someone with a baseball bat who planned to testify against them. 
   In my hometown of Baltimore, a 16-year-old witness in the case of the murder of 15-year-old Christine Richardson was moved from the city by relatives due to mounting threats. Indeed, the teenager was beaten the day after the murder occurred and was threatened by three girls, one of whom brandished a gun. 
   Mr. Speaker, the current situation is simply unacceptable. We should be making it easier for witnesses of crime to come forward. It should be the norm, rather than an odd occurrence, for criminals to be prosecuted. This issue must be addressed because without witnesses, there can be no justice in America. 
   Some success stories do exist. On August 31, Baltimore City State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy was able to get a witness to testify, which helped secure the conviction of 39-year-old Joseph Brinkley on two counts of attempted first-degree murder and handgun charges. In November of 2005, Brinkley approached two men as they hailed a cab and shot them in the back multiple times with a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The victim originally told detectives that he did not see the shooter, but recanted his statement after Brinkley approach him and his 9-year-old son. 
   Unfortunately, such bravery is rare. Our constituents must know that taking an interest in their community and reporting crime is the right thing to do and that the government will do everything possible to ensure their safety. 
   This is why I urge my colleagues to become a cosponsor of H.R. 933, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007, and to support its passage when it comes to the House floor. Upon enactment, this legislation authorizes $90 million a year over the next 3 years to assist State and local law enforcement for witness protection while fostering Federal, State, and local partnerships. Priority will be given to prosecuting offices in States with an average of at least 100 murders during the immediate past 5 years; however, smaller entities also have a chance to receive funding. 
   State and local prosecutors will also be able to use these funds to provide witness protection on their own or to pay the cost of enrolling their witnesses in the short-term State witness protection program to be created within the U.S. Marshal Service. 
   Mr. Speaker, finally, improving protection for State and local witnesses will move us one step closer toward alleviating the fears of and threats to prospective witnesses and help to safe guard our communities from violence

<DOCNO>Mr. CUMMINGS. (PROVIDING FOR AGREEMENT BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2095, RAIL SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CUMMINGS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, today, as we in Congress consider spending on the order of $700 billion to bail out the Nation's financial system--and that figure could go up to $1.3 trillion--we have the opportunity to make what, by comparison, are very modest investments in the transportation and infrastructure that keep our economy moving. This is by supporting Amtrak and by implementing long overdue safety reforms throughout our rail system. These changes and the money will be spent effectively and efficiently. 
   I applaud Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Mica, Ranking Member Shuster, and all of our colleagues in the Senate for their determined efforts to finalize this legislation. I also thank them for working with me to address several specific safety concerns in this legislation. 
   Section 304 of division B of the bill supports the redevelopment of tunnel infrastructure around Baltimore, in my district, which is a linchpin on the Northeast Corridor and which is more than 130 years old in some instances. It has antiquated designs, and it lacks modern fire and life-saving systems. The replacement of it is critical to improving both the quality and the safety of Amtrak service. 
   The legislation also responds directly to concerns raised by the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation into the Howard Street tunnel fire in my district in Baltimore in 2001 by ensuring that first responders called to incidents in rail tunnels have all of the information they need to provide an effective response to emergency situations. 
   Again, I deeply thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Brown for working with me to address these critical issues involving rail tunnels, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Might I finally say that I agree with Mr. Shuster, Ms. Brown and with our chairman. This is a bipartisan committee, and I think this product that we have produced today shows what bipartisanship can do and what it can achieve. So, again, I urge my colleagues to support this very, very important legislation.
