<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (NEW ENGLAND NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 1528 amends the National Trails System Act to designate most of an existing trail system in Massachusetts and Connecticut as the New England National Scenic Trail. In 2002, Congress directed the National Park Service to study this trail for potential addition to the National Trails System. The draft study, completed in 2006, supports designation of the trail, with some changes to the route to address landowner concerns. The administration has testified that no major changes in the study are expected, and expressed support for the measure in testimony before the Natural Resources Committee. 
   The trail runs 220 miles through the heart of Connecticut and Massachusetts, past some of the most spectacular vistas and landscapes in New England. The trail offers some of the world's best opportunities to view volcanic and glacial geology, including fossil and dinosaur footprints. The proposed trail also fulfills another requirement of the National Trails System Act by being close to population centers. This trail has over 2 million people that live within 10 miles of the route, and this accessibility makes the trail a wonderful recreational opportunity. 
   The route of the trail crosses land owned by State and local governments and by private landowners. No Federal land is involved. Local trails associations have obtained permission from landowners allowing existing trails to cross their lands. If a landowner requests that the association close the trail on his or her property, the association honors that request. The NPS study identified no need for direct Federal trail ownership or direct Federal trail management. 
   If H.R. 1528 is enacted, the role of the National Park Service in implementing the designation would be to provide technical and financial assistance to  the existing trail partners, including State, tribal, regional and local agencies, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. H.R. 1528 is cosponsored by Members representing all the affected districts in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and enjoys energetic support from the affected local communities. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, and I want to commend my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) for his commitment and leadership on this matter. We support the passage of H.R. 1528, and urge its adoption by the House today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments that the gentleman from Utah, the ranking member of the subcommittee, made. There is a point of consistency, too. As we talked about the effects, I thought we were talking about a trail bill, not a farm bill, but the effects of the Federal Government on private land. 
   I would suggest that part of the consistency would be to quit incentivizing extraction of mining claims and mining rights on private property, that that would be consistent. It would be consistent also to not have eminent domain and condemnation with regard to road construction of Federal roads and energy corridors. I think that kind of points out the fact that we are talking two different things here. We are talking about a trail that has already been through the process and the study and that merits our support today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy).

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this draft report that I'm holding is entitled The National Scenic Trail Feasibility Study and Environmental Assessment. 
   Like many products of the Federal Government, it's lengthy and complicated. But let's be perfectly clear. We're not waiting for a separate environmental assessment. It's all done and it's all in here.  
   Even though it's labeled a draft report, the National Park Service doesn't do drafts like a high school assignment does drafts. This is a 75-page bound document, eight full color fold-out maps. It draws on more than 90 sources, from books on dinosaur footprints to books on the pioneers who first set foot on those trails, from scholarly histories of the ancient Earth to histories of the small communities along the trail. This study is done. 
   In reality, the process of changing the study from a draft into a final report is a bureaucratic one; it is not a substantive one, which makes this amendment dilatory, at best, and not a substantive one. 
   The draft study was completed in August of 2006. It has been under review at the Department of the Interior for 17 months. The National Park Service tells us that it needs approximately one dozen signatures from various Interior officials in order to be considered final. That's all we're waiting for. 
   In effect, therefore, the amendment could have us abdicate our authority and responsibility to designate trails and pass that authority over to the Secretary, so that whenever he and the various Deputy Assistant Secretaries at Interior get around to signing off on the study, then the trail would be designated. Such an abdication would not lead to a better study; it would just lead to delay. 
   It might be different, Mr. Chairman, if my good friend from Utah could point out something that is lacking in this study, if he wanted to wait because he felt the analysis of the affected environment on pages 61 and 62 were not entirely complete, or if he was contending that the book The Indian Tribes of North America by John R. Swanton and the Smithsonian Institution Press should not have been relied on in this study. 
   That is not the case, Mr. Chairman. The work of the study is done. The administration came before the National Parks, Forest and Public Lands Subcommittee in May and testified they do not anticipate any substantive changes to this document and that they support the designation. 
   Congress has, in this study, more than sufficient documentation to establish this trail. There is no reason to delay this designation. Only if you simply oppose the trail, then that would be the reason for delay. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's not the role of the Secretary of the Interior to designate trail. It's the role of this Congress, and we should get on with it. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.     
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, let me just say that this amendment is completely unnecessary. The trail crosses State land that is State-owned, local, and the property of willing private landowners. That's all. State and local hunting and fishing laws clearly govern all of these lands. 
   What's more, this amendment refers to ``all designated and future designated land within the New England National Scenic Trail, including all Federal lands.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, once again, there are no Federal lands involved here. 
   So in addition to being unnecessary, the amendment is drafted and applies to land that does not exist. 
   Secondly, we are perplexed as to why we would single out State and local laws on hunting and fishing and the possession or use of a weapon, trap, or net. Why would we state that these laws, which, as I have already said, obviously apply to the lands along the trail, why would we state that these laws apply but not mention other equally applicable State and local laws.  
   The amendment could legitimately cause someone to wonder, because we mention only these activities, are other State and local laws somehow rendered inactive by this bill?

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, we accepted a motion on hunting and fishing that was consistent with State laws because that seemed to be the most pressing issue in the discussion and debate over this legislation. Now we have a motion to recommit that tries to solve a problem already dealt with which is easily and simply dealt with with the underlying legislation. 
   The bill specifically prohibits condemnation, so there is no legitimate concern regarding private property rights. There is no legitimate reason to say the same thing over and over again. But now we're in a whole other realm. We're in a conspiracy theory, Federal bogeyman kind of discussion where proponents of the bill say, Well, sure, you have stopped Federal condemnation, but what about our doomsday scenario where the Feds and a State or a locality team up in some secret plan to have the State condemn the land and then give it to the Feds. We better stop that scenario as well. 
   The point of the matter is that this motion is about usurping local control and, indeed, giving it to the Federal Government. I want to say enough is enough. At what point have we gone far enough to deal with any legitimate problem? 
   Supporters of this amendment and the motion see condemnation under every rock and around every corner, and there could never be enough language in this bill or any other bill to satisfy them. 
   Even worse, proponents of this language know full well that neither this motion nor anything else we do here in Congress can stop States from exercising their condemnation authority. Here we have a motion that is both completely unnecessary and completely ineffective. There is no condemnation under this bill. Proponents of this motion need to move on. 
   I urge defeat of the motion to recommit. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, many of our soldiers returning from service in Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from a loss of limb or other serious wounds. Our VA and military hospitals have state-of-the-art facilities to treat these wounds and to help our soldiers make a recovery that they need and deserve. 
   But the same is not true for those soldiers who return from combat suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. A Washington Post series chronicled the struggles faced by many of our soldiers seeking psychological assistance and support from our medical facilities and from the VA. The Post writers concluded that Walter Reed lacks sufficient psychiatrists and clinicians to properly treat the growing numbers of soldiers returning with combat stress. 
   I am proud to say help is on the way. The historic VA funding which passed the House last week provides 600 million more than the President requested to treat PTSD and finally, finally, begin to address a disturbing problem. Let us not repeat the mistake we have made with our Vietnam veterans and begin to help our veterans now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. House Resolution 138, introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from Arkansas, Representative MIKE ROSS, would express a recognition by the House of Representatives of the importance of the Hot Springs National Park on its 175th anniversary. 
   Most people know that Yellowstone is our first national park, but more than 40 years before Yellowstone was established as a park, Congress set aside 2,529 acres in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas to preserve 47 hot springs located there. 
   The law was enacted at the request of the General Assembly of the Territory of Arkansas and signed by President Andrew Jackson on April 20, 1832. That made the Hot Springs Reservation the first nationally protected parkland. 
   The reservation was turned over to the Department of the Interior when  that Department was established in 1849. However, it took another quarter of a century, a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, and the protection of Federal troops to settle the bogus land claims and chase off overeager entrepreneurs seeking to make profit from the springs. Notably, the 1916 Organic Act which established the National Park Service mentioned only the Hot Springs Reservation by name, even though by that time several other national parks and monuments had been designated by Congress. The Organic Act placed all these units under the supervision, management, and control of the new agency. 
   On March 4, 1921, Congress elevated Hot Springs to a national park status, apparently with the personal interest of the first director of the National Park Service, Stephen Mather. 
   Bathhouse Row, the Hot Springs street lined with opulent bathhouses and hotels, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, 1974. The most elegant of these bathhouses, the Fordyce, has since been adapted to use as a visitor center and museum. 
   The park currently totals 5,550 acres and attracts over 1 million visitors a year. The park plans a 175th anniversary celebration on Friday, April 20; and this resolution will be a fitting commemoration of the role Hot Springs played in National Park history. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to commend and congratulate my colleague, Representative Ross, for his commitment and leadership on this matter. We strongly support the passage of House Resolution 138 and urge its adoption by the House. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I would like to commend our colleague, Representative MARK UDALL, for his hard work on this issue. 
   As many of us know, clean water is one of the most precious commodities in the West. The bill before us, H.R. 902, has a promise of providing more clean water to western communities. 
   In oil and gas fields with thousands of producing wells, millions of gallons of so-called produced water will be brought to the surface along with oil or gas. To those who operate oil and gas wells, produced water is a waste product. In some cases, the produced water can be injected into the wells to force more oil to the surface. If the water quality is good enough, a well operator might be allowed to discharge the water down the nearest stream, but there may also be opportunities to treat the water and make it useful for irrigation or even domestic purposes. H.R. 902 authorizes a study of the opportunities and the obstacles to beneficial and environmentally safe use of this produced water. 
   I again commend Mr. Udall for his hard work on this legislation. In the 109th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on similar legislation. This legislation was subsequently passed by the House. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   H.R. 658 is an administration proposal introduced by Representative JON PORTER of Nevada. The bill would authorize the National Park Service to enter into cooperative agreements to spend Park Service funds outside of existing Park boundaries. 
   According to a report from the Government Accountability Office, the National Park Service is the only Federal land management agency that does not currently have that authority. 
   While there are several areas in which such cooperative agreements would be useful, the ability to participate in coordinated plans to eradicate invasive species in and around national parks is the primary reason that the National Park Service is seeking this authority. 
   Under the terms of this legislation, the National Park Service could enter into such agreements with State, local or tribal governments, with other public entities, educational institutions, private nonprofit organizations, or participating private landowners. The legislation requires that any such cooperative agreements provide clear benefits to park resources. 
   Madam Speaker, I would note this legislation does not authorize any new funding.

   H.R. 838, sponsored by the ranking member of the National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee, Representative Rob Bishop, is intended to preserve existing open space in Park City, Utah.

Park City will pay fair-market value for the land. 
   Two other parcels in the area owned by the BLM are encumbered with unpatented mining claims. The bill directs that these parcels, which the BLM had previously identified for disposal, be sold at auction, subject to any valid existing rights, to resolve these outstanding issues. Park City is expected to bid for these properties at the auction. 
   It is our understanding that Park City has undertaken an aggressive campaign to maintain open space and that the citizens of Park City have proven their commitment by approving a local bond initiative to fund this project.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, in 2005, during the debate on the energy bill, I asked my colleagues to strike down provisions that amounted to more corporate welfare for oil companies. At that time the Republican majority voted down that amendment. 
   Now, as news reports continue to mount regarding the billions of dollars in profit oil and gas companies are reaping we have to look seriously at that policy. Why should the American taxpayer continue to shell out subsidies to oil companies when clearly they need no incentives to drill? 
   Moreover, why are we still allowing them to drill in our public lands and waters for free because of some mistakes made in the 1990s during the leasing process? 
   Had the President and his appointees acted when this was discovered, it would have saved taxpayers upwards of $1 billion that has already been lost. Instead, they have deliberately ignored and covered up this problem. 
   We must send a message that the American taxpayer will no longer be ripped off by Big Oil. 
   But ending this fiscally ridiculous practice of subsidies for megarich oil companies is not enough. We also need to make a clean break from the past and take a bold step into the 21st century. 
   Global warming is upon us. We need clean renewable fuel, and we need it now. It will be a tough transition but we have to start right now. We are ready for this challenge. We have the know-how and a highly skilled workforce, and we will create millions of new jobs in the process.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, as was indicated by the gentleman from Utah, the Altmire amendment, which was endorsed by the NRA and the NRA supported the bill with the inclusion of that amendment in its present form, dealt with this issue and dealt with it effectively by reaffirming the right of gun owners and hunters in those public lands. Also in the legislation is a savings clause which guarantees that management prerogatives that are on the land now will remain on the land. 
   This to me is clearly a bait and switch. It's a gotcha move. These issues have been dealt with in the legislation. It is not a second amendment threat that we are talking about here. We're talking about, more importantly, the issue of public lands and their management. And it might be added that the use of the word ``promptly'' in the motion to recommit would effectively kill this legislation, a decent, well-crafted, bipartisan legislation supported by many Members in this House. 
   Let me just read from the letter sent out by the NRA: 
   ``Because of our longstanding support for our hunting heritage and sportsmen's rights, the National Rifle Association will consider the vote on this amendment,'' the Altmire amendment, ``in our future candidate ratings and endorsement. If the Altmire amendment is adopted, the NRA will withdraw our current opposition to H.R. 2016.'' 
   I repeat again, this motion to recommit is not about protecting the second amendment. This motion to recommit is a ploy to effectively kill the bill. If you cannot win arguments, it appears, through facts and through rational discussion and debate, then you try to win votes by using scare tactics and ploys. This is a ploy to kill the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2016 is simple, straightforward legislation. The bill would provide statutory authorization for a conservation system which was established administratively nearly a decade ago. This is not a land management policy bill, rather, it seeks to finally grant the National Landscape Conservation System the congressional recognition that it truly deserves. 
   The NLCS covers approximately 26 million acres, about 10 percent of the land administered by the Bureau of Land Management, including all national scenic and historic trails, national conservation areas, national monuments, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and wilderness study areas managed by the BLM. 
   The individual lists which make up the National Landscape Conservation System are unique and beautiful. Canyons of the Ancients in Colorado, Craters of the Moon in Idaho, Agua Fria and Vermillion Cliffs in my home State of Arizona, these are poetic names for poetic landscapes. And Mr. Chairman, these units are truly nationally significant, ecologically, scientifically and culturally. For example, Agua Fria National Monument is remarkable for its natural splendor, with the Agua Fria River cutting through Sonoran Desert mesas, and for its unique and diverse wildlife, which includes pronghorn antelope, javelina, and the gila monster, among many others. But the monument also preserves significant and intact pueblo ruins, some with more than 100 rooms, terraced agricultural fields, which bear witness to the lives and stories of those that came long before us. 
   Like Agua Fria, each of the units included within the NLCS was created to conserve unique cultural and natural resources. But while the individual monument or wild and scenic river or other designations which make up the system are about conservation, creation of the NLCS itself has more to do with accomplishing the full mission of the Bureau of Land Management. From 1946 to 1996, very large, new national monuments created under the Antiquities Act was removed from BLM management and turned over to National Park Service. 
   The National Landscape Conservation System was created to assure that these valued public lands remain in the BLM system, allowing the agency to manage them and fully realize the conversation aspect of its multiple-use mandate. 
   The NLCS has been enormously successful. Visitation to these areas is increasing as more people are learning about BLM's spectacular landscapes. From its red rock deserts to its rugged coastlines, NLCS units provide unique and world-class outdoor recreation opportunities for hikers, hunters, anglers, climbers and bird watchers, among many others. Sportsmen consider these areas essential not only for their recreational value, but also because the NLCS is critical to the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat on BLM lands. 
   Mr. Chairman, opponents of this bill seem to be concerned that it will somehow change or alter the current management of these lands. This is simply not true. Included in H.R. 2016 is a section that specifically states, ``Nothing in this act shall be construed to enhance, diminish or modify any law or proclamation (or regulations related to such law or proclamation) under which the components of the system identified in section 3(b) were established or are managed, including but not limited to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the Wilderness act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Trails System Act, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act.'' 
   After almost a decade of success, it is time for Congress to finally put its stamp of approval on this system by formally authorizing NLCS. H.R. 2016 does nothing more or less than write the NLCS into statute. The bill will not alter management of a single acre of Federal, State or private land. Enactment of this legislation will not change the management of these areas, but it will change the perception; it will not upgrade their protection, but it will upgrade their stature. 
   The coalition of organizations supporting 2016 is as diverse as the system itself, including environmental groups, the American Hiking Society, the National Council of Churches, American Sportfishing Association, Boone and Crockett Club, National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Wildlife Federation, and the Outdoor Industry Association. The Bush Administration has enthusiastically supported the legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, what we have here are uniquely American places that should and must be recognized. The NLCS deserves congressional sanction, and we should grant it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think in the course of the debate on H.R. 2016 we are going to hear a lot of claims, a lot of allegations, of how H.R. 2016 will change the management of these public lands, how H.R. 2016 will restrict uses in the future for these public lands. I want to remind Members of section 4, Statutory Construction, the savings clause, which in fact codifies the existing management and codifies the existing uses. But we are going to continue to hear that, the generalizations. And with those generalizations come half-truths and untruths as to what this bill does and does not do. 
   What this bill does not do, it does not encroach on private property rights. What this bill does not do, it does not change grazing and oil and gas development on these lands. It does not threaten recreational and traditional uses of the land, including hunting, rock climbing, hiking, camping, rafting and motorized use. It does not make the conservation system park-like or eventually managed by the national parks. It does not provide additional protections for Wilderness Study  Areas in the conservation system, and will not designate new wilderness. It does not create a new level of bureaucracy. It does not take money away from national parks. It does not increase spending on government land acquisitions. And it does not impede border security. 
   I find it ironic that the now-minority, having been the majority for the past 7 years, has not been able to change some of the land designations that they are so upset about today. This vehicle, H.R. 2016, should not be the vehicle for them to vent their frustration. H.R. 2016 has gone through a rigorous process and has bipartisan support. 
   With regard to border security, the failure of this Congress to comprehensively grapple with the security issues, the border issues and the immigration issues that are facing this country, a broken immigration system that all of us can agree to, that failure to enact those should not be now made the responsibility of H.R. 2016, for the crisis that has been created by the inaction and the fearful reaction of many Members of Congress to try to deal with border issues and border security. 
   H.R. 2016 is a good piece of legislation. Specifically, the savings clause protects the intention of those lands, the management of those lands and the uses of those lands.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I mentioned earlier the discussion of what H.R. 2016 does not do. I think it is worth mentioning what it does do. It is very important. And I am only going to concentrate on one point. I think we will deal with the values issue in the amendment process. 
   H.R. 2016 unifies separate units into a coherent system. It ensures permanency, and I think that is the most important point. It will permanently establish perhaps a last great American conservation system in statute, and those lands will continue to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management and prevent any future attempts to get rid of the system. It enhances the statute of this system, and it deserves to be enhanced. 
   It is a good piece of legislation. It has good support from Members of Congress and from interest groups who care about the conservation issues that we face in this Congress.  
   Mr. BROWN of Georgia, Mr. Chairman, seizing land infringes on the most fundamental of Constitutional rights and endangers property owners across our great Nation. NLCS will eternally lock land into Government control and prevent Americans from their right to property ownership. 
   Our Federal Government already owns 653,229,090 acres of land. Does it really need to control any more? NLCS would take control of 26 million acres of land--13 percent of the nation's surface. This land will be forever taken and the right to own land denied. There is no justification to consume more land. 
   Second Amendment Rights are also under assault in this legislation. Nothing in this legislation protects hunting, fishing, or gun rights on NLCS land--even though they have traditionally been allowed. 
   The Constitutional right to own property should always be protected. Citizens should be allowed to utilize and prosper from the land. As chairman of the Property Rights Action Caucus, I believe that no legislation should ever infringe on property rights or attack the Second Amendment. Protect these fundamental Constitutional rights of land and gun use by voting ``no'' on H.R. 2016.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment states in its entirety that nothing in this act shall impede any effort by the Department of Homeland Security to secure the borders and enforce the immigration laws of the United States. 
   Let me be clear, the recent decision by DHS Secretary Chertoff to waive more than 30 bedrock environmental laws, including the Safe Drinking Water Act and the National Park Service Organic Act, in order to build a wall along our southern border was, in my opinion, an abuse of discretion granted to him by the previous Congress. 
   I have introduced separate stand-alone legislation, H.R. 2593, the Borderlands Conservation and Security Act to, among other things, repeal this waiver authority because, in my view, there are better ways to secure our borders than requiring them to waive laws which protect the water we drink and the air we breathe. 
   I have also joined with Members of Congress in filing a notice of our intent to file briefs before the United States Supreme Court because I believe the waiver provisions violate our Constitution. 
   However, the bill currently before the House, H.R. 2016, is not an appropriate vehicle for addressing these concerns. This is simply an authorization bill for a conservation system. It is not intended to impact the management on any of these units, including management decisions regarding border security. 
   The amendment I am offering here simply makes this as clear as possible. I oppose the law, and I am using every opportunity to make that opposition plain, but this is not the bill for those opportunities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, make sure the debate on border security takes place in the appropriate time in an appropriate manner under the appropriate legislation, and then we can move forward on this straightforward conservation bill.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, as with most of these amendments, the Cannon amendment is clearly unnecessary. Once again, we have, in this bill, an ironclad savings clause which I demonstrated earlier. That would be, after the enactment of H.R. 2016. Nothing in this act would diminish or enhance that. 
   The ability to sue plaintiffs that they have under current law, that would not be changed by H.R. 2016, and nothing in this act would change that. Nothing we do here creates a Federal cause of action. Since the creation of the system in 2000, nothing ever has. The proponents of this amendment are looking for a problem where a problem doesn't exist. 
   However, if the proponents of this amendment will feel more comfortable that we include language that simply states the obvious, then we will not oppose the amendment.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment for the same reasons I opposed the previous amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah. 
   Like the previous attempt to strike the purposes of this bill, this amendment would strike language instructing the BLM to continue managing these BLM conservation units in a ``manner that protects the values for which the components of the system were designated.'' 
   Mr. Bishop argues he simply does not understand what this term means, and he worries that the BLM doesn't know what it means either. Let me assure Members that this is not a new standard and that the BLM clearly understands what it means to manage land and to protect its values. In fact, they have been doing so for years. 
   I have here at least 10 instances in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 in which the term ``values'' is used. Not only does it appear in the declaration of policy section of that law, it actually appears in the definition of the term ``multiple use.'' 
   If that is not clear enough, most, if not all, of the laws or proclamations creating the individual units of the NLCS refer to the ``values'' to be protected. 
   I have three examples. There are many more, but we have selected three because they were approved by majority-Republican Congresses. The Black Canyon of Gunnison and Santa Rosa National Monuments and the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, all units of the NLCS, all mention ``values'' in their enabling legislation. 
   The section this amendment would strike is an accurate reflection of the current management standards applied to these lands. To strike it would be to downgrade these conservation areas. 
   For a better understanding of what this standard means, I would encourage all of my colleagues to read the law, rather than simply trying to disregard language with which they are not familiar. The amendment needs to be defeated. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. As we have mentioned, H.R. 2016 already contains an extensive savings clause which makes absolutely clear that the simple act of writing the NLCS into statute will not change the way individual units are managed. 
   The inclusion of this savings clause should relieve Members of the need to come to the floor today and further amend the bill to enumerate each and every possible use of public lands for specific mention in the legislation. 
   The underlying bill already makes plain the fact that energy development, along with other authorized uses of these lands, will continue in those areas where they are currently allowed, even after H.R. 2016 is enacted. 
   Apparently, this broad savings clause is not plain enough. This amendment would single out energy production for special mention as one of those uses not impacted by the bill. 
   From the standpoint of writing clean, clear legislation that avoids redundancy and needless repetition, I oppose the amendment. 
   However, if this language provides an extra level of assurance and comfort for some Members, this amendment does not really change the bill, and I am prepared to accept it.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Grazing is obviously allowed in the units of the NLCS where it is appropriate, and nothing in this legislation would change that. The savings clause makes that fact as clear as it could possibly be. The underlying bill makes no changes to existing grazing rights. 
   Were this amendment written simply as an extension of the savings clause, as many other amendments offered today have been, it would be unnecessary, but not harmful to the bill. This amendment goes much, much further, however. It is not as simple as a savings clause specific to grazing. Rather, this amendment would operate to prohibit the BLM from maintaining current standards, dictating the location and the management of grazing on these lands. 
   This amendment goes beyond simply saying that nothing in this act shall impact grazing, to say that the presence of these areas in the NLCS cannot affect the operation of grazing. Talk about an invitation to litigation. 
   Does this mean the BLM would lose the authority to manage grazing on 800 or so units in the system? 
   Does this mean that those NLCS units where grazing is not allowed under current law would have to be opened up, whether it was appropriate or not? 
   The Pearce amendment could operate to force grazing into sensitive conservation areas where it is currently prohibited, and for good reason. Arguably, this amendment's an attempt to use this simple authorization bill to undermine provisions of existing grazing law that have been on the books for years. 
   If the gentleman from New Mexico wants to make sweeping amendments to the grazing law, he should do so directly, not by means of an amendment on this bill. 
   I urge the defeat of this amendment and reserve the balance of my time.

I have been a strong supporter of the No Child Left Inside Act. As a member of Education and Labor and Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, this act represents an important confluence of my interests, and I am happy to support this legislation. I attended the field hearing for this legislation, and have taken a personal interest in its passage through the many steps it has taken to the floor. Though I am unable to participate in the vote on final passage today, I wish to make it clear that I remain a steadfast proponent of the No Child Left Inside Act, and am pleased with its consideration by the House today. 
   This act will promote environmental literacy and hands-on educational experiences, while at the same time promoting core learning of critical skills. These programs have also been linked to meaningful improvements in student cooperation, conflict resolution, motivation to learn and positive behavior. Additionally, these programs add to the encouragement of a healthy and active lifestyle of outdoor recreation. 
   No Child Left Inside promotes environmental literacy where it is most effective--in nature. This, in turn, promotes children's health, increases their knowledge of the natural world, and encourages students' interests in the lesson. NCLl provides educators with the necessary skills to teach environmental education, and provides grants for State and local agencies to acquire the needed capacity for effective environmental education. 
   The benefits of this program have a measureable impact on students' core curriculum--improving performance in science, math, reading and social studies. The No Child Left Inside Act is important for our environment, as it educates the next generation, who will inherit a planet whose fragile habitats will increasingly need our help and protection.

   Willing sellers. The concept of willing seller means that you cannot use eminent domain. I think the legislation before us is good legislation. The motivation for its defeat is something that we have not been able to get to the root of that reason.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1100 authorizes a boundary expansion of 115 acres at the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, a unit of the National Park System in western North Carolina. The bill was introduced by my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, Representative HEATH SHULER, in whose district the Sandburg National Historic Site is located. Representative Shuler has been a strong advocate for the bill, and I commend him for his enthusiasm and the dedication to this important piece of legislation. 
   The 264-acre Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site preserves the farm where the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author and his family lived for the last 22 years of his life. 
   Carl Sandburg was one of America's most versatile and recognized writers whose stories, histories, and poems captured and recorded America's traditions, struggles, and dreams. 
   H.R. 1100 authorizes a 115-acre boundary adjustment that is recommended in the historic site's 2003 General Management Plan, a plan developed through a 4-year process that involved extensive public input. The boundary adjustment is necessary to allow construction of a visitor center and a parking lot as well as to protect the pastoral views from the Sandburg estate. 
   H.R. 1100 authorizes the Secretary of Interior to acquire land from willing sellers only, and I would note that all of the affected landowners have agreed to have their parcels included in the proposal to expand the historic site. 
   H.R. 1100 is important for the continued protection and operation of this historic site, and it has bipartisan support. At a hearing on the bill last month, the administration testified in support of the legislation, as did a local county commissioner. In the Senate, companion legislation has been sponsored by Senator Dole and Senator Burr. 
   During the markup of this bill, the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands adopted an amendment that made several technical changes and standardized the bill's language. The amended bill was forwarded to the full committee by voice vote. The bill, as amended, was ordered favorably reported to the House by the Natural Resources Committee by voice vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1100 is a result of a lengthy public planning process. It has extensive and enthusiastic community support, including the support of the landowners involved. It also has the backing of the Bush administration and North Carolina's Republican Senators. Given all this, we have to wonder why there are those who would try to make this, a straightforward bill, controversial. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would again commend Representative Shuler for his hard work on behalf of this important and worthy legislation, and I strongly urge the passage of H.R. 1100, as amended. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And, yes, Carl Sandburg is beloved in North Carolina, but his significance is of national importance. That is why our cosponsors from east coast to west coast are part of this bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is clearly intended to stop the boundary expansion at the Carl Sandburg home historical site from ever happening. It imposes excessive, ill-defined requirements on this historic site, standards that we have never imposed on any other national park or government agency, and that I suspect most of us would never impose  on ourselves. Could you, as a homeowner, certify that all maintenance on your home is ever complete? Isn't there always a light bulb to be changed, a wall to be painted? Would we expect the Department of Defense to certify that maintenance on every piece of equipment in their inventory is complete before allowing them to purchase new equipment? Of course not. So why is the Carl Sandburg Home Historic Site expected to meet that standard? 
   The minority has had 12 years to do something about the National Park Service maintenance backlog and failed to act, but that failure should not be allowed to hinder the continuing needs of the National Park System. 
   The new majority in Congress is committed to addressing the past budget shortfalls, while managing and growing the National Park Service responsibly. We can do both, and we must do both. 
   Further, Mr. Bishop's amendment requires an unspecified person to determine that all deferred maintenance at Carl Sandburg has been completed, but fails to define not only who makes the determination, but also what the definition of ``deferred maintenance'' is. Therefore, I don't see how a determination can ever be made. Even the Director of the National Park Service herself has testified before the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands that deferred maintenance is an ongoing process, just like it is for every other Federal agency or a homeowner. 
   The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources has already purchased 22 of the 110 acres proposed to be added. They would like to donate these lands to the National Park Service, but Congress must authorize this boundary adjustment first. This amendment would require the State to continue to hold the land indefinitely, something they should not have to do. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment will have no impact on whether the backlog of maintenance on the national parks is managed effectively. Rather, it was simply introduced to kill this boundary addition. I urge defeat of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the Bishop amendment arbitrarily slashes the boundary adjustment at the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site by 95 percent. This reduction is based on no science, no studies, and would substitute the judgment of a few for those of the many. 
   The National Park Service has invested 4 years and tens of thousands of dollars in a public planning process to determine the future of this very important historic site. With extensive analysis and public input, a 115-acre boundary adjustment was determined to be necessary to protect park resources and provide for the enjoyment of the public. Mr. Bishop's amendment simply ignores this, undermining good public policy. 
   The amendment flies in the face of the wishes of the local community, including the village council and the local county commissioners. It defies the many State and Federal agencies that participated in and supported the outcome of the multiyear planning process. It contradicts the wishes of the Bush administration, who testified in support of this legislation at a hearing just last month. And it goes against the desires of two Senators from North Carolina, both Republicans, I might add, who have sponsored companion legislation in the Senate.  
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment also flies in the face of the desires of landowners in question who have agreed to have their properties included in the proposed boundary expansion. It virtually guarantees these lands will be developed. The owners would like the opportunity at some future date to sell their property or an easement on their property to the historic site for conservation purposes. If and when these landowners are ready to sell their land, this amendment assures that the Federal Government would not be at the table, but a developer surely will. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Natural Resources Committee has moved this year Republican-sponsored park expansion bills that have added more than 3,000 acres at a cost of millions of dollars with no amendment of this type offered. Money and expanding parking are clearly not the real issue here. The Bishop amendment has no science, no studies, no local support, and it should be defeated. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is inconsistent and unfair. As I stated earlier, the enhancement and preservation of this site is a national responsibility. This amendment abdicates that responsibility by prohibiting the use of Federal funds to fulfill this role. Strangely, it allows Federal funds to be used for development but requires State and local landowners to shoulder the costs of protecting the historic viewshed. 
   Philanthropy has and will continue to play an important role in the care of our national parks and is something that we are all thankful and grateful for. A perfect example is the State of North Carolina. Recognizing the importance of protecting the historic viewshed, it has purchased 22 of the 110 acres identified as needing protection and would like to donate them to the National Park Service. The National Park Service will, of course, continue to welcome any donation of land or money to help protect the remainder of this land. 
   However, it is irresponsible to expect the State to shoulder the total responsibility of purchasing all 110 acres, nor should small landowners have the responsibility to donate their property to the National Park Service. We need to maintain the option to purchase the land from willing sellers, so that when it is on the sale block, the Federal Government's hands are not tied. 
   The amendment is not about the availability of Federal funds. This is a funding source specifically set aside for Federal acquisitions of land identified as important for conservation. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has a current balance of $16 billion. I would say that is sufficient to allow the possibility of using appropriated funds for this 110-acre addition.     
   This amendment is also inconsistent. It allows the use of Federal funds to purchase 5 acres for construction of a visitor center, yet does not allow the use of Federal funds to purchase 110 acres of land or easements to protect the historic viewshed. 
   Finally, this amendment is unfair. Committee Republicans raised no objections nor offered any amendments when the Natural Resources Committee favorably reported a Republican bill that would add more than 3,000 acres to the Jean Lafitte National Historic Park. That bill allows appropriated funds to be used, and the CBO estimate put the cost at up to $5 million. Why should appropriated funds be available for that bill but specifically protected in this bill? 
   Mr. Chairman, land protection at a national historic site is a national responsibility, as recognized by my Republican colleagues in the Jean Lafitte legislation. The Heller amendment is inconsistent and unfair. I believe Mr. Shuler's predecessor did not recognize the importance of enhancing and protecting this valuable viewshed. We should not penalize the author of this legislation for recognizing it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to Mr. Shuler for his comments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, the language in this bill is no different from other wild and scenic river bills that have passed both Democratic and Republican Congresses, including under the former committee chairman, the famed property rights defender, Richard Pombo. 
   To hear opponents tell it, this bill is a threat to private property with the Federal Government waiting in the wings to condemn land. In reality, nothing of the sort would happen, and that's because opponents of the bill have persistently refused to acknowledge the clear language of the legislation. 
   First of all, the bill prohibits condemnation under the authority of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Then the very next sentence states: ``The authority of the Secretary to acquire lands for the purpose of this Act should be limited to the acquisition by donation or acquisition with the consent of the owner.'' 
   Therefore, I believe, Madam Speaker, this is an absolute, unambiguous blanket denial of condemnation authorities. We say it twice in the legislation. We don't need to say it three times. 
   My colleague, JOE COURTNEY, has done an outstanding job with this measure, which is supported by the entire Connecticut delegation, the Republican Governor of Connecticut, the State legislature and all of the affected local governments, and the Bush administration. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bipartisan measure.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, as I hear the colleagues on the other side raising the specter of massive condemnation on the part of the Federal Government, I believe that it is more of a scare tactic to divert attention, I think, about what is good in this bill because there are really no substantive grounds in which to oppose it. 
   Twice in the legislation it is reaffirmed that condemnation is not part of the process, that there must be willing consent on the part of property owners. There is no real problem in that. The Bush administration understands it, the Republican Governor of  Connecticut understands this, the affected local communities understand this. 
   In my opinion, I think the motivation for opposition has to do with the audacity of the gentleman from Connecticut to run for office, replace an incumbent and his predecessor, and then the audacity of the voters of that district to go ahead and elect the gentleman, the sponsor of this legislation. 
   It is a consensus bill. It has good support. Rather than dealing with the messenger, as we are doing today in a political basis, let's deal with the content, the substance, and the support of this legislation. And I would urge rejection of the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Let me thank the chairman for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here to support H.R. 1483 as chairman of the subcommittee, but also supporting the larger heritage area bill. One section in particular that applies to my community is the designation of a new heritage area in the Santa Cruz Valley of Arizona. 
   The Santa Cruz Valley has national significance and deserves the recognition that this designation would bring and highlight what is a shared border with Mexico. The Santa Cruz Valley encompasses many diverse cultures and histories. These include native peoples whose heritage dates back 13,000 years, and the descendants of Spanish, Mexican and American territorial settlers who shaped the region, its land, its customs and its traditions from the 1690s to the present date. 
   For me it's an important designation. I grew up on a ranch, Canoa Ranch, that is located within the Santa Cruz Valley. It's a historic ranch, been designated as such and presently is being renovated to bring and highlight what that ranch life was in the 1800s and 1900s. 
   The towns and cities of the Santa Cruz Valley support this. The amount of support that this proposal has is truly outstanding. I want to say something not only about the Santa Cruz Valley and its importance, but I think it transcends the discussion that we are having about heritage areas. Heritage areas, through the designation, is also a recognition of a mosaic, a mosaic of history, people, traditions, the environment, a mosaic that shapes this country. Each one is as different and diverse as our Nation. To get to a designation point takes a great deal of work and cooperation among communities and peoples, and that's what we are acknowledging with heritage areas, the work that went into it, the diversity of this great Nation of ours, and the mosaic that makes this Nation of ours as special and privileged as it is in the world. 
   I would also like to say that we are going to hear things about taking property rights, the cost. A GAO study was commissioned, and many of the organizations which have been submitted for the record as private property rights advocates were solicited to provide specific examples where heritage areas did indeed interfere with, take or prohibit the use of someone's private property. Not one instance came up in that study. I just want to reaffirm that these projects, these heritage areas are cooperative, bipartisan and truly deserving of the designations. I want to thank the chairman for the entire bill.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The purpose of H.R. 786, sponsored by our colleague from Lakewood, California, LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ, is to authorize the Secretary of Interior to participate in the Los Angeles County Water Supply Augmentation Demonstration Project. 
   The legislation will authorize Federal financial assistance for a unique water reuse and conservation project in the Los Angeles area. The initiative will demonstrate that small-scale neighborhood projects can be built to increase local water supplies and reduce urban runoff pollution. Projects like this can help residents of southern California increase local water supplies, reduce our dependence on imported water from northern California and the Colorado River. 
   This is an innovative project and a good bill that deserves our support. I congratulate my colleague, Congresswoman S&#193;NCHEZ, for championing this legislation. 
   In the 109th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on similar legislation. This legislation was subsequently passed by the House under suspension of the rules. 
   We strongly support H.R. 786, and I would like, once again, to thank and commend my friend, LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ, for her work on this bill.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California, LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking Mr. Grijalva for being so generous with time. And I would also like to thank Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young, as well as Water and Power Subcommittee Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, for recognizing the importance of this bill, H.R. 786, the ``Southern California Water Augmentation Study.'' 
   I would like to especially thank Chairwoman Grace Napolitano for her support on this bill and her leadership in moving it through the Natural Resources Committee. 
   I became interested in this effort because California and other parts of the country need to move forward on two very important issues. First, we must increase our groundwater drinking supplies. We can do this by improving the safe infiltration of surface water which seeps into the ground. Second, we must reduce urban storm-water runoff that can carry trash and contamination to our beaches and oceans. This water augmentation study addresses both of those issues. 
   Storm-water currently becomes contaminated by running off rooftops and roads and carrying that pollution into our oceans. Our study is assessing ways to safely absorb that water into the ground where natural purifying processes can take place. This will stem the flow of polluted water into the ocean and safely recharge our groundwater supplies. Simply put, this project is about taking the water that we lose and turning it into water we use. 
   This study will assess the potential of urban storm-water infiltration to augment our water supplies. It will determine the benefits, costs, and risks of infiltration. It will help us understand what conditions we need to make infiltration work and assess its potential for increasing our drinking water supply. At the same time, it will show us how to reduce water pollution, creating additional environmental and social benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is designed to make southern California more water-self-sufficient and less reliant on imported water from our neighbors in the central and northern parts of our State. 
   This is a bipartisan effort in which there is agreement on the merits of the project throughout our government. I am very pleased that President Bush has included funding for the water augmentation study in his last four budgets, including this year. 
   Also, the Bureau of Reclamation has been extremely supportive of this project. In fact, they helped create it in the year 2000 because they see it as helping to solve the real problem we face in California and other, shall I say, ``water-challenged'' areas of the country. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young, as well as the great staff on the  House Resources Committee; and to thank Representative Napolitano for her unyielding support of this bill. 
   In 1907, Theodore Roosevelt said, ``The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem. Unless we solve that problem, it will avail us little to solve all others.'' With your help, Southern California can make significant progress toward improving its water resources management. 
   I urge approval of this legislation.

   H.R. 865, introduced by the gentleman from Alaska, Representative Don Young, would resolve a long-standing conflict between Alaska Native land titles and utility rights-of-way in Alaska. This legislation is in response to a September 2004 GAO report entitled, ``Alaska Native Allotments: Conflicts With Utility Rights-of-Way Have Not Been Resolved Through Existing Remedies.'' 
   Although the Copper Valley Electric Association, a rural non-profit electrical cooperative, holds rights-of-way granted in the 1950s and 1960s, and built electric lines prior to the filing of the Alaska Native allotment claims, there is a conflict with land titles subsequently issued under the Alaska Native Allotment Act. In essence, H.R. 865 resolves that conflict by ratifying the existing rights-of-way across 14 specified Native allotments and providing for fair market value compensation for the landowners. As amended, the bill provides that the compensation, which is estimated by CBO to be no more than $150,000, is subject to appropriations. We have no objection to H.R. 865.

   The purpose of House Resolution 217, introduced by our colleague from Oregon, Mr. David Wu, is to express the sense of the House of Representatives concerning the 50th anniversary of the flooding of Celilo Falls. Celilo Falls was a unique natural feature formed as the Columbia River carved a path  through the hard volcanic rock east of the Cascade Mountains. On March 10, 1957, the Dalles Dam was completed, flooding the historic fishing and trading area around Celilo Falls. 
   For over 10,000 years, the falls had been an area of intense trading and commerce for Indian tribes from as far away as Alaska, the Great Plains, and the Southwest. The falls were also noted as an extremely abundant fishery, where tons of Columbia River salmon were caught, dried, and traded. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution simply seeks to recognize the 50th anniversary of the flooding of the falls, and to remember Celilo Falls as an important area of fishing and trading for many tribal peoples. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House Resolution 217, and I offer my congratulations to Congressman Wu for his leadership on this resolution.

   The land in question is part of a larger block of lands conveyed to Clark County under a provision of the Public Law 109-263, the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act of 1998. These lands comprise part of the Airport Environs Overlay District for McCarran Airport, and Public Law 105-263 required that the land be managed in accordance with airport noise compatibility planning agreements. 
   Further, the 1998 act specified if land was sold or transferred, it had to be done at fair market value with the proceeds distributed pursuant to the act. H.R. 815 would waive this last requirement. Since the proceeds of the land is for an important public purpose, we believe the waiver is appropriate.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, during fiscal years 2002 and 2003, Grand Canyon National Park entered into construction contracts worth $17 million with a general contractor called Pacific General, Incorporated, known as PGI. 
   In January 2004, numerous subcontractors employed by PGI notified National Park Service that they were not receiving payment. After an investigation, it was discovered that PGI was diverting Federal funds which should have gone to the subcontractors. PGI eventually declared bankruptcy. 
   It was further discovered that in a clear violation of Federal policies, the park had failed to require PGI to post a surety bond as a condition of the contract. The agency is now prohibited from paying the subcontractors directly because the funds appropriated for those contracts have already been paid to PGI. Overall, the subcontractors are owed about $1.3 million. H.R. 1191 authorizes the Secretary to use $1.3 million in available funds from Grand Canyon National Park to pay the subcontractors. Applicants for the funds would have to verify the amount they are owed, demonstrate that they have exhausted all reasonable legal avenues to recoup amounts owed to them by PGI, and provide written statements that the amount they are seeking represents payment in full. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an imperfect solution to a difficult problem. However, these small business owners who provided quality services to the Federal Government in good faith should not have to wait any longer to receive payment. 
   My colleague from Arizona, Representative Renzi, is to be commended for his efforts on behalf of these small business people. Similar legislation  was approved by the House in the 109th Congress, and we urge its passage today.

The proposed wilderness, to be known as the Wild Sky Wilderness, has probably been more studied and reviewed than any recent wilderness considered by the Natural Resources Committee. 
   This is not a new matter. Nearly identical legislation was approved by the committee in the 107th Congress. This message was subject to a hearing in 2004, at which time the administration testified they do not object to its passage.  
   Further, similar legislation has passed the Senate in each of the last three Congresses. The proposed wilderness includes significant low-level elevation wilderness that is home to important fish and wildlife populations. This new wilderness would link with previously designated wilderness in the national forest and would be within a few hours' distance from half of the population of Washington State. 
   The Wild Sky Wilderness has significant State and local support in Washington. State officials, local elected officials, businesses, and church groups have all gone on record supporting the wilderness designation.

Recycling and reuse of this water would decrease the strain on older treatment plants in the area and help meet future demands, providing reclaimed water for golf courses, landscaping, and other industrial uses. 
   The water recycling project identified in this bill will be eligible for limited financial assistance from the Bureau of Reclamation's title 16 water recycling program. Water recycling and desalination projects are proven technologies that can help stretch limited water supplies in areas such as Texas. The City of Waco is keenly aware that additional sources of water will be required to meet future water demands and should be commended for looking for sustainable solutions.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Many units of the National Park System were established to conserve U.S. military history. All these units have restoration of their historic landscapes as an important management goal. This restoration entails removal of landscape features, including trees, which were not present at the time of the relevant historic event. However, removal of any natural resources from a National Park must be undertaken extremely carefully. In addition, many of these park units report a lack of funding for such work. 
   H.R. 309, introduced by my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, Representative Steve Pearce, would create a revenue source for such projects by allowing individual units to retain proceeds from the sale of timber removed from the unit. Importantly, the legislation is narrowly written as a demonstration project to apply within a defined list of 24 military parks and to prevent any change to existing environmental requirements governing logging on NPS land. 
   Representative Pearce has worked tirelessly on behalf of this legislation and is to be commended for his efforts.

Cesar Chavez was born 83 years ago and would have been 83 years old yesterday. He devoted his entire life to the betterment of this Nation and to its people. He gave voice to the voiceless. In working with the farm workers, in organizing their union, in fighting for their dignity, respect and equal treatment on the job, he worked for farm workers who were not considered equals in any sense. He gave voice to the voiceless. 
   And in these times when we see these disturbing trends going on in our Nation, where even on the floor of this great people's hall we hear disturbing trends where people are marginalized, demonized, dehumanized because of who they are and the circumstances of their life, these disturbing trends should remind us of Cesar's legacy. His legacy was not about creating a situation where people are treated less than but creating a society where people were treated as equals, with respect and with dignity. Cesar insisted on the best for us and on the best in us. He insisted on a sense of faith about the future and our families and our Nation. He insisted on tolerance, that we as human beings should understand and respect each other and with that respect comes understanding and with that respect comes a better nation. 
   He insisted on equality, that all humans are created equal under our Constitution, all people are created equal under our Constitution, and he fought his entire life to make that value a reality for all of us. 
   So when we celebrate his birthday and we celebrate his legacy, let us not forget that Cesar's legacy is a living legacy, a legacy that calls upon us day  after day to continue his work, to forward his vision and to make this Nation the best it can be and to make ourselves the best we can be.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (MULTINATIONAL SPECIES CONSERVATION FUNDS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by commending Congressman Don Young, the ranking Republican on the Committee on Natural Resources, for introducing H.R. 50, the Multinational Species Conservation Funds Reauthorization Act of 2007. This bill would authorize two important international wildlife conservation laws, the African Elephant Conservation Act and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, illegal poaching, habitat loss and other factors have pushed African elephants, rhinoceroses and tigers dangerously close to extinction. H.R. 50 authorizes funding through fiscal year 2012 for scientific research, management, law enforcement and public education activities used to conserve and protect these keystone wildlife species and their habitat. 
   Congress has provided $26.9 million, which has been leveraged through matching funds and in-kind contributions to generate more than $96.1 million for international species conservation. This has been an excellent investment for the Federal Government. 
   We support this noncontroversial bill, and urge all Members on both sides to vote for this important conservation bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which I introduced on March 13 of this year, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Avra/Black Wash Reclamation and Riparian Restoration Project. 
   The extremely arid climate of Tucson, Arizona, and that metropolitan area requires careful and innovative planning of both water supply and wastewater treatment systems.

   Mr. Speaker, the Underground Railroad was a historic protest movement against slavery which helped escaped slaves find freedom in Northern States and Canada prior to the Civil War. 
   The National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998 established the Underground Network to Freedom Program administered by the National Park Service. Today the program carries out important activities in more than 27 States and the District of Columbia.

   The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail designated by H.R. 1388 would follow the historic routes used by British and American troops during the war. The National Park Service supports this designation, as do an impressive array of State and local governments and numerous private organizations.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2400 would direct the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish an integrated Federal ocean and coastal mapping plan for the Great Lakes and coastal waters and the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone and the Continental Shelf. The legislation responds to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy's recommendation that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration consolidate and coordinate the Federal Government's mapping activities. A National Research Council study made a similar recommendation. 
   To accomplish this end, H.R. 2400 would coordinate the efforts of all Federal agencies involved in mapping our oceans and coasts. Consistent protocols would be developed across all Federal agencies to collect data and develop maps, instead of various agencies using their own criteria. 
   In addition, the legislation would require Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts. Ultimately, those entities dependent on maps for navigation, national security, scientific research, energy development and location of cultural resources, such as shipwrecks,  would all greatly benefit. H.R. 2400 will increase the efficiency of our mapping efforts, reduce redundancy and allow data used by one agency to be used again and again by others for multiple purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and encourage Members to vote for this noncontroversial legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Congressman Jim Saxton, for introducing H.R. 465, the Asian Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2007. H.R. 465 would authorize the Asian Elephant Conservation Act through fiscal year 2012. This law authorizes grants to be issued for the survival of the Asian elephant in the wild. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the status of the Asian elephant remains tenuous. Fewer than 4,000 Asian elephants are found throughout the forests and savannas of South Asia. Approximately 16,000 of these animals are held in captivity. The captive elephants are used to assist people in timber harvest, forest clearing and agriculture. In the wild, populations remain under heavy stress from several factors, especially habitat loss and deforestation. 
   Since the first grant was awarded in 1997, more than $10.3 million in matching contributions or in-kind support have been generated by leveraging the $7.8 million contribution made available by the Congress.     
   Funding supports cooperative conservation projects that protects Asian elephants and their habitat by providing scientific research, law enforcement and education. 
   I support this noncontroversial bill, and again commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), the author of the original Asian Elephant Conservation Act, for his unwavering commitment to international wildlife conservation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. And certainly what a relief it is. 
   Madam Speaker, for years, students and families have been burdened by growing debt and Congress' unwillingness to budge on any key higher education issues. The fear of student loan debt causes many would-be students to forgo the better quality of life that a college education offers. 
   These difficult decisions tangibly impact minority access to education. Over half of Arizona's K through 12 students are minority. By the year 2020, Latinos will make up almost one-quarter of our Nation's undergraduates. 
   Now we have the chance to make up for the $12 billion cut in student loan programs that the former majority enacted during last year's budget reconciliation. This is just the first of many steps this Congress will take to achieve this end. 
   This bill enjoys bipartisan support. Unfortunately, last night the President released a statement indicating a possible veto of the bill, reasoning that H.R. 5 would direct Federal subsidies to college graduates and not to students and their families. 
   This statement is simply untrue. As an example, at the University of Arizona, in my district, all 6,200 Pell Grant recipients also receive subsidized Stafford loans. In our current higher education climate, subsidized Stafford loans are an integral part of a comprehensive, need-based financial aid package. 
   The fast-rising price of post-secondary education, coupled with the decline in need-based aid, endangers the opportunities of low income, first generation and students of color in the pursuit of a better life through education. This bill brings need-based aid front and center and provides real relief for student borrowers. 
   I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 5 and open the doors to college affordability once again for all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3221. 
   This bill is a package of important provisions that will move our energy and climate policies toward a more sustainable future. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   One of the highlights of this bill is a provision to require royalty payments from oil and gas leases that currently are exempt from royalties. We are losing millions of dollars on these faulty leases that are allowing oil and gas companies to extract taxpayer-owned resources for free. Putting a stop to this is fiscally unsound public policy is a much-needed step in the right direction. 
   With this measure, we will also establish progressive and sensible policies designed to help families and businesses save energy with new efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings. 
   This bill puts our priorities back on track in funding new research into renewable fuels, which could be unlimited sources of clean energy if we invest in them properly. This will begin to move us away from the antiquated, dirty sources of energy we use today. 
   I support this bill and plan to vote in favor of it. I am, however, disappointed that several important provisions were removed from the Natural Resources Committee bill, H.R. 2337, as it was being incorporated into this bill. The colleagues who demanded the removal are primarily from big oil producing states whose interest is to move that product for the corporate interests they represent without thought or consideration for the rights of other Western states, communities, ranchers, farmers and the shared public lands of the American people. 
   One gentleman in particular represents a vast oil producing district with no real public land, at least 100 hazardous waste sites, numerous former superfund sites, watershed and ground water contamination sites. Perhaps the gentleman feels that is the price of doing the oil industry's business? I and many others in the West prefer a different scenario--where study, consultation, protection of our public lands, public participation, and cost recovery for the tax payer--are an integral part of doing business.  
   As Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, I've become concerned about the 2005 Energy Policy Act's impacts on public lands, private landowners and wildlife in the West. 
   The provisions removed from this bill prior to floor consideration would have made very modest improvements to the Energy Policy Act, a bill largely written by and for the fossil fuel industry. 
   The first would have simply authorized a study before federal agencies designate energy corridors on federal lands across the entire West. I am deeply concerned that the most recent maps put forth by the agencies identify corridors crossing through National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, Monuments and wilderness areas. Like DICK CHENEY's Energy Taskforce, the initial maps of the draft corridors were drawn at the request of the energy industry, with very little public input. The study would have simply put a better, more thorough process in place by requiring agencies to consider congestion and constraints on the system as well as barriers to access for renewables. My provision would have also required the agencies to avoid places like National Parks when designating corridors. 
   The second provision, specifically requested by the Western Governors' Association, would have required land management agencies to analyze the impacts of oil and gas activities in critical wildlife areas before allowing drilling. I ask unanimous consent that these letters from the Western Governors' Association be entered into the RECORD.  
   Under the 2005 bill, the oil and gas industry is able to conduct drilling and other activities on public lands without first ensuring protection of wildlife and other resources. The original provision would have required agencies to avoid wildlife areas and follow appropriate laws to protect the environment. 
   I am disappointed that these modest reforms of the oil and gas industry's sweetheart package from 2005 were rejected. 
   Nevertheless, I support the reform provisions of this bill and I know that there will still be opportunity to address some of the shortcomings of the 2005 Energy bill as we move forward. Because once the public is fully aware of the consequences and immense impacts of the energy corridors designations and categorical exclusion provisions, they will demand action.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I make a point of order that the motion to recommit contains nongermane instructions in violation of clause 7 of rule XVI. 
   Let me add, Madam Speaker, the Office of the Inspector General just released an investigation that they conducted on the office responsible for protecting the taxpayers in the royalty collections on our public lands. Let me just give a couple of quotes from the summary of the report. 
   ``A culture of ethical failure. The single most serious problem our investigations revealed is a pervasive culture of exclusivity, exempt from the rules that govern all other employees of the Federal Government. In other cases, the results of our investigation revealed a program taxed with implementing a business model program, such as royalty-in-kind marketers, donned a private sector approach to essentially everything they did. This included effectively opting themselves out of the Ethics in Government Act, both in practice, and at one point even explored doing so by policy or regulation. We also discovered a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity in the RIK program, both within the program, including supervisors who engaged in illegal drug use and had sexual relations and consort with industry in the oil business.'' 
   I mention those because the gravity of this particular problem, this pathological behavior, should be noted and looked into by this Congress. When we get our new energy policy on the floor--soon--I hope that the other side will join with me in ensuring that ethical reform of the agency responsible for the protection of the taxpayers' investment are part and parcel of any comprehensive energy reform. 
   With that, I insist on the point of order, Madam Speaker.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 3667, the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic River Study Act, was introduced by our colleague from Vermont, Representative Welch. This bill would amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the National Park Service to study specific sections of the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers in Vermont for their potential inclusion into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   I want to thank our colleague from Vermont, Congressman Welch, for his hard work on this measure. This is a good piece of legislation, which will help showcase the natural heritage of Vermont. 
   We are coming upon the 40th anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in October. It's important to celebrate the legacy of this act, the preservation of some of our wildest rivers and the safeguarding of our scenic waterways for generations to come, and to acknowledge the essential role that stewardship and a conservation ethic play in the management of our Nation's rivers and streams. 
   The Missisquoi is a tributary of Lake Champlain, located in northern Vermont. The Trout is a tributary of the Missisquoi. With its headwaters in Lowell, Vermont, the Missisquoi extends almost 100 miles, flowing north into Quebec, then returning to Vermont to flow west before finally ending its journey at Lake Champlain. 
   As it runs its course through open pastoral fields, scenic gorges and native hardwood forests, the river is a remarkable example of a northeastern ecosystem. It is bordered by the largest and perhaps highest quality silver maple floodplain forest remaining in the State of Vermont. American elm, white ash, white oak, and red maple are found along its banks. 
   The river is home to diverse fish and wildlife, including native rainbow and brown trout, rare freshwater mussels, spiny soft-shell turtles and river otter. While on the river's banks, bobcat, white-tailed deer, and moose can sometimes be spotted, and the surrounding marshes host large flocks of migratory birds. 
   In addition to these natural qualities, there are numerous Abenaki Indian archeological sites along the floodplain. 
   And the river is well-known for its outstanding recreational opportunities as well. It is part of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail--a historic 740-mile water trail through New York, Vermont, Quebec, New Hampshire, and Maine--and outfitters consider the northern part of the river to be the preeminent flat-water paddling spot in Vermont. 
   It is also renowned for its waterfalls, and the Great Falls on the upper river is recognized as Vermont's largest undammed waterfall. 
   Simply put, this river is a superb illustration of Vermont's postcard perfect national scenery. 
   During a hearing on this bill, the administration testified in support of the bill, but recommended that changes be made to clearly specify which segments should be included in the study, as not all of the sections of the river in the original bill were appropriate for consideration. They recommended other technical changes as well. 
   The Natural Resources Committee amended the bill to respond to those recommendations and clarified which sections of the river would be studied for the wild and scenic attributes. 
   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3667 simply authorizes a study of this river. It is a preliminary step, not a final designation. 
   Its enactment would simply trigger a process which will allow the National Park Service the opportunity to gather information from, listen to, and coordinate with State officials and local communities; with farmers, business owners, and river outfitters; and with hunters, anglers, birders, paddlers, and hikers--all those who value this river. Only then, after careful consideration and with input from all the stakeholders, will the National Park Service provide recommendations to Congress about the potential of this river. 
   That is all the legislation does. It is that simple. Let's not lose sight of what this bill is about. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3667. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I'm encouraged by the newfound populism of my good friend from Utah. And I agree that a comprehensive approach to energy has to be something that this Congress accomplishes within the week. This does not negate what I believe to be a good piece of legislation that is before us. 
   And it is considerable work. We have to unravel 8 years of failed energy policies. We have to unravel the relationship between Big Oil and the administration so that the consumer, the average Joe out there, will get the kind of break and attention that he needs and she needs with regard to energy costs and the rising cost all around us. 
   Having said that, let me now turn to the sponsor of this good piece of legislation, the gentleman from Vermont, Congressman Welch, for as much time as he may consume.

I think relative to this bill I don't appreciate them, but I really believe that there has to be an understanding that our leadership and the Democrats on this side of the aisle can actually walk and chew gum at the same time, that we can deal with an issue that we are dealing with here today that affects the State of Vermont and deal with the very pertinent issue which is the energy policy for this country.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require that the study authorized by H.R. 3667 analyze any potential impacts a wild and scenic river designation for this river might have on the possession or use of a weapon, trap or net, including a concealed weapon. 
   As with many of the amendments offered today, I do not believe this amendment is necessary. The underlying legislation already is more than sufficient in what it directs the Secretary to study when considering a wild and scenic river designation. Further, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act already makes perfectly clear that these river designations are not intended to infringe upon existing State authority to manage hunting or fishing. 
   Nevertheless, Chairman Rahall has filed this amendment in an overabundance of caution, and as a good-faith effort to dispel any rumors that this bill will impact existing policies on hunting and fishing. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, just as a friendly correction for the gentleman from Georgia, nada is spelled N-A-D-A. So none of the above doesn't quite fit the acronym, so there might need to be a search for an appropriate balance. 
   The other thing, and he mentioned a good point. Under the jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Committee are 68 million acres under lease and not in production under the public lands of this country. So under that jurisdiction, I think the committee has made that effort to try to extend the public lands as a source for energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, the legislation being offered today will extend the authorization of the Small Business Administration and its programs through December 15, 2007. 
   As Congress moves forward on improving SBA and the services it provides, this short-term extension will ensure that small businesses have many of the tools they need to be successful in today's economy. 
   I am pleased to say the Small Business Administration Committee has made significant progress in making long overdue improvements to this agency. During the 110th Congress, the House Small Business Committee has successfully reported nearly a dozen bills, each designed to update and upgrade SBA programs to meet the needs of the 21st-century entrepreneur. 
   Nearly all of this legislation has been passed out of the House, and every single bill has had broad bipartisan support. With their passage, we are well on our way to providing the most significant overhaul of the Small Business Administration and its programs in at least two decades. 
   During this Congress, the House Small Business Committee has successfully moved forward on legislation that will provide affordable loans to entrepreneurs, prevent large corporations from being awarded small business contracts, and ensure veterans, women, and minority-owned firms have access to the assistance that they need. And in light of the failures we saw during Katrina, the committee reported a bill that will improve SBA's disaster loan program. This has been completed in a span of a little over 6 months. 
   Our committee has been able to provide these changes due to the outstanding leadership of Ranking Member Chabot and our Chair, Nydia Velazquez. They have worked in a bipartisan manner to provide the necessary tools for this Nation's small businesses. 
   The extension before us today will allow the committees in the House and Senate to work out the differences in their bills and get them signed into law. These major changes require time to reconcile the House and Senate bills. H.R. 3206 provides the necessary time while ensuring operation of these programs are not interrupted. I urge support of this extension. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 986 would designate 25.3 miles of the Eightmile River and its tributaries in Connecticut as a national scenic river. The bill was introduced by my friend and colleague, Representative Joe Courtney, who has been a strong and effective advocate for this designation. 
   H.R. 986 would protect portions of the Eightmile River that have been found to have outstandingly remarkable values, including an intact watershed with a natural flow, very high water quality, unusual geological features, and large numbers of rare plants and animals. 
   The bill would designate five segments of the river and its tributary as scenic under the Wild and Scenic River Act. 
   The designated segments would be managed according to a plan produced pursuant to the 2001 Eightmile River Wild and Scenic River Study Act. 
   The administration supports the legislation. The National Park Service has found these segments of the river and its tributaries to be eligible and suitable for designation. Under the provisions of the bill, the river will be managed pursuant to a partnership agreement as envisioned in section 10(e) of the Wild and Scenic River Act. 
   H.R. 986 is cosponsored by the entire Connecticut House delegation. Both Connecticut centers support the designation, as does the Republican Governor of Connecticut and the State legislature.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Thank you, Chairman Miller, for your work on this very, very important piece of legislation, the first time in a decade Congress is going to pass a Higher Education Act. I'm happy to support this long past-due improvement to higher education. 
   This legislation is about inclusion and not exclusion. The bill simplifies the means by which students and families can research colleges, apply for help, and gather information to aid in the important decisions we all must make.     
   It expands access and support for poor students and students of color through changes to Pell Grants and improvements to TRIO and GEAR UP, additional support for students who have with disabilities, additional support for veterans and their families. 
   This piece of legislation is a hallmark of the work of this Congress and this session. I'm proud to be on the committee and proud to serve in the development of this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, today, for the first time in a decade, Congress will pass a higher education act, and I am happy to support the long past-due improvements to higher education that will be put into effect by the passage of this bill. 
   This Higher Education Opportunity Act demonstrates a commitment by this Congress to inclusion. The bill simplifies the means by  which students and families can research colleges, apply for student aid and gather information to aid in the important decision making process. 
   It expands access and support for poor students and students of color through changes to Pell Grants and improvements to TRIO and GEAR UP, making college accessible to first-generation students and those who are most likely to be expensed out of college. 
   It offers expanded support for veterans and their families to honor their continued sacrifice by creating new scholarships and by establishing education support centers and other services to aid in access to education. 
   It establishes more opportunities for students with disabilities to gain equal access to college by offering national centers of support, aiding colleges in recruitment and retention of students with disabilities, and expands Pell Grant eligibility. Additionally, one of my priorities will create model demonstration programs to improve the access to quality materials for students with print disabilities. It will also create a commission to consider ways to better distribute these materials. 
   The rising cost of a college education means that students now more than ever must be informed about their decisions as they relate to living expenses and borrowing for education. This bill will add a number of mechanisms to aid students in making these choices, including a provision I worked hard to add that will improve the way cohort default rates are calculated. These changes, though more modest than I had hoped, will encourage schools and lenders to provide better financial literacy to guide students with post-college debt. 
   The Higher Education Opportunity Act marks a significant improvement in our national commitment to inclusive access to higher education and expresses our continued efforts to make college more affordable and accessible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5781, Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. 
   Work and family are pillars of our society, and a sensible and humane government should seek to relieve the stresses one can place on the other. For this reason, I am glad to support this important piece of legislation, the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2008. 
   This Act will grant guaranteed paid parental leave to federal workers who do not presently have it. This is especially important for younger workers who have not had time to accrue an adequate amount of paid leave. 
   Paid leave is critical to new families so that new parents can worry about the care of their child and not their financial security. The possibility of a relatively relaxed immediate post-natal period is necessary for parent-child bonding, and ultimately for the well-being of the child and the family. 
   This Act also makes the Federal Government a much more competitive employer. This law is not just humane, it is necessary as a practical matter for the Federal Government. According to a March 2008 report by the Joint Economic Committee Majority Staff, nearly all Fortune 100 firms offer working parents some paid time off when they have a new child. Bringing the Federal Government in line with the personnel practices of the most competitive employers will also pay further dividends by reducing costs related to worker turnover, replacement and retraining. 
   H.R. 5781 is a necessary and welcome step in making the federal workplace more family-friendly, and, ultimately, strengthening families and building a just, prosperous, and healthy society. I am glad to vote for its passage and look forward to seeing it go into effect.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 783 authorizes a boundary expansion at Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado of approximately 362 acres. Mesa Verde National Park, established in 1906, contains the most extensive concentration of cliff-dwellings in the United States. 
   H.R. 783 authorizes the acquisition of two parcels of the land that border the park. One parcel is in full view of the park's entrance road and contains important archaeological sites, an ancient forest, and the largest known population of a globally imperiled plant. This parcel is currently zoned for a subdivision, but the owners would prefer to protect the property through inclusion in the park. 
   The second parcel is currently owned by a park partner, the Mesa Verde Foundation.     
   The foundation intends to donate the parcel to the park for the development of a visitor information center and museum collection facility but cannot do so until the park boundary is expanded. 
   Mr. Speaker, the administration has testified in support of this legislation, the Natural Resources Committee approved the legislation with a minor amendment by unanimous consent. 
   I want to acknowledge, at this point, the hard work of the bill's sponsor, Representative JOHN SALAZAR, in bringing this important legislation forward. We support this bill and urge its adoption by the House today.

   The utility district is in the early stages of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's relicensing process. The project's current license was granted in 1962 and will expire in May 2012. An application for relicensing must be submitted by 2010. 
   H.R. 523 directs the Secretary of the Interior to sell 662 acres of BLM land within the project boundary to the utility district and requires the district to pay the appraised fair market value of the land. 
   Importantly, the legislation requires that, even after the conveyance takes place, the Secretary of the Interior will retain authority under the Federal Power Act to place conditions on the utility district's new license, if necessary, to protect the natural resources of the area. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have worked closely with the sponsor and our minority colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee to improve this legislation. We thank them for that and appreciate it very much.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, soon after the Revolutionary War, Alexander Hamilton selected the area around the Great Falls of the Passaic River as a site for the first planned industrial center in America. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, invited Pierre L'Enfant to design the city in 1791. The result was the City of Paterson, New Jersey, which became one of the most important manufacturing centers in America during the Industrial Revolution. President Gerald Ford designated the Great Falls Historic District as a national historic landmark in 1976. The 104th Congress established an historic district and authorized the restoration, preservation, and interpretive program for the area. 
   H.R. 189, sponsored by our colleague, Representative Bill Pascrell, the former mayor of Paterson, designates the historic district as a National Historic Park and a unit of the National Park System. This bill contains standard management language for NPS units. 
   This is a unique area and will make an excellent addition to our National Park System. Representative Pascrell is to be commended for his tireless efforts on behalf of the legislation and the city and the people of Paterson. We urge the adoption of this bill by the House today.

   Mr. Speaker, the National Park Service has testified in support of the legislation, and it was approved by the Resources Committee by unanimous consent. This addition to our National Park System will preserve important sites from our Nation's past.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2262. 
   It is an understatement to say that the West has changed dramatically since 1872, but this law that we are reforming today has not kept pace. Those of us from the West need this legislation to pass to protect the health of our communities, our scarce water supplies and our public lands, which are under continuing threat from an outdated mining law. 
   In my home State of Arizona, hardrock mining has left behind a legacy of contaminated lands and rivers, abandoned mines leaching poisonous metals into groundwater and other hazards to the public, with hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars to reclaim and cleanup the mess left behind. 
   Only a few months ago, a young girl was killed when she and her sister drove their vehicle into a mine shaft that had been left exposed after the site was abandoned. The mine shaft was hidden by brush, had no signs or barriers to warn anyone about the danger. The younger sister was trapped overnight with her sister's body before rescuers found them the next morning. 
   This is just one heartbreaking example of the impacts of a law left over from another era, an era when the West was not populated and when our value system was far different from what it is now.     
   The law simply must be updated to today's modern-day values and environmental standards. The issue of employment has been raised over and over again, exporting our jobs and importing our vital metals. I agree, mining jobs are good jobs, but I would suggest they are not the only jobs in the West. We need to have a diversified workforce, and that workforce needs what the population needs, diversified opportunities. 
   Chairman Rahall's bill puts standards in place, requiring cleanup and reclamation of mining sites. This bill makes certain that lands are off limits to mining, as they should be, but it also ends the free-for-all that this law has created over the years, where companies have used a patenting process to purchase inholdings within national forests and other public lands for a few dollars per acre, only to have the Federal Government later buy them out for millions of dollars when they threaten to develop the land. 
   The Federal Government has spent billions of dollars over the years rebuying patented mining lands, and taxpayers' are served much better for their money. They deserve a fairness and an equitable return for their tax dollars. 
   I strongly support the balanced approach that the chairman has taken with this bill. I am also pleased that the committee approved amendments I offered to allow Native American tribes to petition the Secretary to withdraw from mining lands of cultural, historic or religious importance to them. Tribes have been just as impacted as other communities by the impacts of mining and should be able to weigh in on these important matters. 
   There is an urgency here that cannot be understated. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (PROTECTING THE MEDICAID SAFETY NET ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, over the past year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, have introduced a series of Medicaid regulations that have caused grave concern to our States and beneficiaries. States are struggling as the economy sinks into recession, and these proposed regulations, if not suspended, will add billions in Medicaid costs to our States at a time when their tax revenues are falling and Medicaid caseloads are growing. 
   The seven regulations issued by CMS erode the foundation of the Medicaid system by preventing beneficiaries from accessing the care they need. These proposed regulations would endanger access to care by severely limiting payments to public hospitals, eliminate coverage for outpatient services that keep beneficiaries from unnecessary emergency room use, and by restricting support for transportation services for children with disabilities. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman DINGELL for his superb leadership on this issue and for introducing and garnering bipartisan support for this unfortunate but very necessary moratorium. This important legislation will help protect beneficiaries from harmful cuts and alleviate the immediate concerns that the Medicaid regulations cause for long term care patients, residents and providers alike. The bill also establishes an independent review of these regulations prior to the expiration of the moratorium next year. In addition, it provides $25 million to HHS each year, beginning in FY 2009, to fight fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program. 
   This moratorium is a temporary fix, allowing Congress an opportunity to review these regulations as thoroughly as possible before they are implemented and the burden is borne by our constituents. 
   While CMS argues that these changes will create efficiencies in the program, there is no evidence to support this claim. What is known is that these changes will cause extreme harm to our most vulnerable citizens--low-income children, the disabled, and the elderly. By utterly disregarding the immense public outcry surrounding the enactment of these rules, this administration is placing desperately needed services in jeopardy without thoroughly weighing the effects these regulations will have on States. 
   Now more than ever, in the face of major State budget deficits, we cannot allow the Federal Government to make major regulatory changes to Medicaid that will result in billions of additional costs to states. 
   I am a proud, original cosponsor of Chairman DINGELL's H.R. 5613, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008 and urge all my colleagues in this 110th Congress to stand with me and stop this Administration from implementing these foolish and potentially devastating regulations.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (BAINBRIDGE ISLAND JAPANESE AMERICAN MONUMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 161, introduced by my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, the gentleman from Washington State, Representative Inslee. 
   This noteworthy legislation would authorize a memorial to commemorate the Japanese Americans of Bainbridge Island, Washington, who were the first Americans to be forcibly removed from their homes and relocated in internment camps during World War II. 
   The new memorial will serve as an important remembrance of a sad chapter in American history. Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order providing for the relocation of Japanese Americans living along the west coast. 
   On March 30, 1942, the relocation began at the Eagledale Ferry Dock, with 227 Bainbridge Island residents being forcibly removed to internment camps away from the coast. Eventually, more than 12,000 Japanese Americans in Washington State and more than 110,000 Japanese Americans along the west coast were relocated. 
   Public Law 107-363 directed the Secretary of the Interior to study the Eagledale Ferry Dock on Bainbridge Island, Washington, to determine the suitability of designing the site as a unit of the National Parks System. The study was to include an analysis of the historical events associated with the dock and the potential for preserving and interpreting the site. 
   On May 1, 2006, the Department of Interior transmitted to Congress the study report. The study recommended designating a memorial site on Bainbridge Island, and that memorial will be managed as a satellite site of the Minidoka Internment National Monument, an existing National Park System unit in Idaho. H.R. 161 would implement the recommendations contained in the study. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and congratulate my colleague, Mr. Inslee, for his commitment and leadership in this matter. A hearing was held on a nearly identical measure last Congress, and Representative Inslee arranged for the Subcommittee on National Parks to receive moving testimony from an internee whose photograph showing her holding her infant child has become a searing image of the internment. 
   I would also note that for most of us the internment of Japanese Americans was a historical event that we read about in history books, but for two of our colleagues it was part of their life experience. My colleagues, Mike Honda and Doris Matsui, spent part of their childhoods in internment camps. I want to acknowledge their experiences in this unfortunate episode in history. 
   Mr. Speaker, we strongly support passage of H.R. 161 and urge its adoption by the House today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, as the President gets ready to ask this Congress for an additional $145 billion to fund his efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new report has come out showing tens of millions of dollars in wasteful spending by our government in Iraq. 
   Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, released his quarterly report last week. It concluded that the $300 billion U.S. war and reconstruction effort is plagued with waste, spiraling violence, and corruption. Among the worst misuses are $43.8 million for a residential training camp that stands empty, about $4.2 million for 20 VIP trailers and an Olympic-sized pool that was ordered by the Iraqi ministry of interior. 
   Perhaps the most disconcerting, however, is that our government spent $36.4 million for armored vehicles, body armor and communications equipment that could greatly benefit our troops, but it is completely unaccounted for. Mr. Speaker, this abusive spending in Iraq must stop for the American taxpayer and for the troops.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 512, which was introduced by my colleague from California, Representative Becerra. 
   The legislation directs the establishment of a commission to study the potential creation of a National Museum of the American Latino, to be located here in Washington, D.C. The commission will be composed of 23 qualified individuals, with seven appointed by the President and the remainder appointed by the majority and minority leadership of the House and Senate. 
   Under H.R. 512, the commission would be required to prepare a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of the museum, including recommendations for a legislative plan of action to create and construct the museum. The commission's plan would be due not later than 24 months after the date of the commission's first meeting. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 512. Given the contributions that American Latinos have made and continue to make to the cultural and social history of the United States, this is a most fitting measure.     
   The legislation was the subject of hearings in the House last Congress, and I would note that a nearly identical measure passed the House on September 27, 2006. 
   As the face of this Nation is represented by many people, the museum would be an opportunity for all of  America to look at the diversity, to appreciate the many peoples that make up this great country of ours. 
   And I want to take this opportunity to also commend and congratulate my colleague from California, Xavier Becerra, for his leadership on this matter. He has worked very hard with many parties to bring this legislation to fruition. 
   Mr. Speaker, we strongly support H.R. 512 and urge the adoption of the legislation by the House today.

And now, this Congress wants to change legislation to have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission not investigate or prosecute cases of discrimination if the complainant doesn't speak English, like this young man's mother.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3246, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007. 
   This bill acknowledges a critical component of our country's success, and creates the Southwest Border Regional Commission for border counties in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas. 
   First, I thank the committee for the inclusion of this region in the bill. I am proud to represent this region, home to one of the most vibrant communities. Where the United States and Mexico meet, it is a symbiotic community. For cities in my district, there is often a division. 
   Many times on this house floor, the debate of the border is divisive and based on demagoguery. There is no room for those issues in today's debate. This commission is about investing in U.S. citizens that live in a unique community, a community that is the gateway to our country. 
   For as much as this Congress debates and exploits immigration and constantly works to militarize our border, we could spare some time to discuss needed investment in the region. 
   The residents of the southwest border are burdened with concerns that include low income, low education levels, the lowest number of health professionals, some of the highest rates of diabetes, tuberculosis, AIDS and other health crises, a lack of economic development, and the list goes on. 
   The southwest border communities are at the periphery of the United States and Mexico's national economic and political concerns. The U.S. Government has historically forgotten this community in terms of economic development, education and social programs. 
   The Southwest Border Regional Commission takes a great step to correct this misguided omission. It is our responsibility to assist our border communities and our border residents. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and reject any attempts to further exploit the citizens who are at the gateway of this country and who sacrifice so much already to the demands of our border security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chairman, the Act of August 25th, 1916, more commonly referred to as the National Park Service Organic Act, states that, ``there is hereby created in the Department of the Interior a service to be called the National Park Service, which shall be under the charge of a director, who shall be appointed by the President.'' 
   Since 1916, the National Park Service created by the Organic Act has grown to include 22,000 people, conserving and interpreting 391 units in a National Park System that will welcome more than 270 million visitors this year. Our National Parks are a source of enormous pride for millions of Americans and examples for the world regarding the conservation of places and resources which make a Nation and a people unique. And of course, Madam Chairman, much of the credit for the tremendous success of the National Park idea is due to the professionalism, commitment and expertise of the men and women working for the NPS. 
   As the centennial of the Organic Act approaches, there is consensus--among policy-makers and the American people--that this 100th anniversary must be viewed as an opportunity to recommit ourselves to building a stronger, more diverse, better trained and better equipped National Park Service. In February, the Bush Administration proposed legislation to increase funding for the NPS over the next decade in recognition of this milestone. Two of my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee--full committee Ranking Member Don Young and subcommittee Ranking Member Rob Bishop--have introduced that legislation, by request, as H.R. 2959. 
   Today, with the support of Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall, I am honored to introduce H.R. 3094, legislation we believe will best commemorate this 100th anniversary while also preparing the National Parks and the National Park Service for another 100 years. H.R. 3094 authorizes mandatory spending expected to total $100 million a year for ten years. The bill creates a process whereby the Executive Branch will coordinate 
   annual proposals for how best to spend this new funding and the Congress, through the Interior Appropriations bill, will allocate the funds. 
   In contrast to the Administration's proposal, H.R. 3094 identifies six specific program areas within which this increased funding is to be spent. These areas include education in the parks, diversity programs, an environmental leadership initiative, professional development, resource protection an construction. This mix of funding priorities--investing in natural resources, bricks and mortar and human capital--will insure our parks and park employees can meet the challenge of the next 100 years successfully. 
   Also in contrast to the legislation proposed by the Administration, H.R. 3094 provides this new spending without requiring private matching funds. While we recognize the critical role private giving has played in creating and sustaining the National Park System, we remain concerned regarding the ever-increasing reliance on private funds. H.R. 3094 encourages private giving but makes absolutely certain that NPS spending priorities are determined by the Congress and the Administration without regard to which projects might, or might not, be most attractive to private donors. 
   And finally, Madam Chairman, H.R. 3094 differs from the Administration's proposal in that all of the spending in our bill is paid for--meaning this bill addresses the stringent PAYGO requirements instituted by the Democratic majority. The Administration's failure to identify a source for the mandatory expenditures in H.R. 2959 makes that proposal simply unrealistic. 
   Madam Chairman, the American people treasure their national parks and care deeply about their future. The funding levels we provide for the National Park Service, at this critical milestone in its history, should reflect that. The initiatives funded through this legislation--especially those which will use our national parks as classrooms for young people--will create new generations of stewards to safeguard our national parks for the next 100 years.

I wish to recognize their dedication and the contributions to their community. By completing a high school diploma, the future for these students has become considerably brighter. 
   I also wish to take a moment to reflect on largo group of valedictorians, salutatorians and graduates who, despite high school success and graduation, will be shut out of many of the opportunities for a prosperous future that we promise to our children for their hard work. 
   I am referring to the many valedictorians, salutatorians and graduates who have worked hard in the communities they have known their whole lives, played by the rules, excelled in school and, because of their undocumented status, will be systematically cut off from the opportunities that are afforded to successful students like them. Through no fault of their own, these bright, intelligent, model students will be caught in limbo--denied an opportunity to pursue success and, in so doing, to serve our country. 
   These students are confronted with a lesson that high schools do not teach--that because of a status that was not of their choosing, their achievements are worth less than the achievements of their friends and classmates. This is a cruel lesson indeed; the lesson that they have grown up in a social caste; that despite America's promise of prosperity for hard work, that no matter what their educational success--they will be branded ``untouchables''.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 415 would add a 40-mile segment of the Taunton River in Massachusetts to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   Back in 1999, local residents approached their congressman, our late colleague Representative Joe Moakley, about securing a wild and scenic designation for the Taunton. Representative Moakley supported the idea and introduced legislation in the 106th Congress to formally study the river. The study was released last year and found the following: 
   All 40 miles of the main stem of the Taunton River have been found eligible for Wild and Scenic River designation based upon free-flowing condition and the presence of one or more outstanding remarkable natural or cultural resource values ..... Outstandingly remarkable values including fisheries, history and archeology, ecology and biodiversity, and scenery and recreation. 
   Specifically, the study recommended 26 miles of the river for scenic designation and 14 miles, including the lower Taunton, for recreational designation.  
   Between November of 2004 and July of 2005, all 10 communities abutting the river adopted resolutions supporting the Federal designation. The Taunton Wild and Scenic River Study Advisory Committee, representing the local communities and State and nongovernmental partners, also voted unanimously to support the designation. 
   So based on years of study and nearly unanimous local support and collaboration, Representative Frank introduced H.R. 415 in January of last year. The legislation is cosponsored by the entire Commonwealth delegation in the House, and the companion bill, which passed out of committee in the other body by voice vote, is sponsored by both Commonwealth Senators. H.R. 415 was favorably reported by the Natural Resources Committee by voice vote. 
   In short, Mr. Chairman, this proposal has cleared every single procedural hurdle placed in its path, and I believe it's high time we approve the legislation. 
   Finally, Mr. Chairman, a word about the proposed Weaver's Cove LNG plant. If the need arises, we can provide more detail, but for now let me simply enter the following facts into the Record: The Coast Guard captain of the Port for Southeastern New England denied approval for the proposed plant based on safety concerns in December of last year. In May of this year, the First District Coast Guard commander, Rear Admiral Timothy Sullivan, upheld that decision on appeal with a thorough review that included more than 50 pages. 
   In addition, the Commerce Department issued a decision last month finding that ``the national interest furthered by the project does not outweigh the project's adverse coastal effects. Of greatest concern are the effects on navigational safety resulting from LNG tanker traffic called for by the vessel transit plan for the project.'' 
   These decisions by the Coast Guard and Commerce Department prohibit the Weaver's Cove proposal from moving forward for one simple reason: The proposal is unsafe. 
   The bottom line is this, Mr. Chairman: The Taunton is deserving of this designation and this has nothing to do with the safety concerns that killed the proposed LNG facility in the area. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 415. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

The Department of Commerce came to that same conclusion. On appeal, it came to that same  conclusion. As a result, the Weaver's Cove LNG proposal is already dead. Decisions have already been made on that subject, and have absolutely nothing to do with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act or designation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, notwithstanding the wonderful personal attributes of Mr. Frank, this bill, in and of itself, has tremendous merit, and that is why we brought it here for support by our colleagues. I should remind all our colleagues that this particular scenic river, the Taunton, was studied under the 1968 law, met the criteria for designation and, consequently, that is what the study recommended after 7 years of study. 
   Another point I think is important, as I pointed it out in the opening statement, the lower portion of the Taunton River from Muddy Cove to the Route 195 bridge in Fall River is being designated a recreational river, rather than a wild and scenic designation. 
   This designation is reserved for river stretches that are accessible by road or railroad, may have development, may have undergone some impoundment or diversion, but that offer outstanding opportunity for recreation.     
   The lower Taunton fits that description perfectly. The National Park Service, as I mentioned, spent 7 years studying this river, working with local communities. And I mention that because if we are going to value opinions, as my colleague from Utah was speaking, then I think a very democratic response needs to be a supportive response as well to the near unanimity of support for this designation by local communities, the elected officials, and the delegation from the State. I think that merits a value, and that value should be to extend support and credibility to their desires to have this designation occur. 
   I would also caution, on that note, caution my colleagues against substituting our own judgment when we do not represent the area, have not participated in or reviewed the study. This is an 80-page study that found this designation appropriate and recommended that designation. 
   Further, we were talking about precedent. There are several examples of other rivers, the Lower Delaware in New Jersey, the Allegheny in Pennsylvania, the Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts, which have similar levels of nearby development and represent very successful designations under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. At least, I might mention, at least two of these rivers I just mentioned, by the way, passed the House under Republican rule on suspension. 
   H.R. 415 is an important piece of legislation. It incorporates the designation, it incorporates the use by urban communities of the designation. It is fitting and it has been verified through study and through the cooperative work of all the communities and the delegation. I ask for its support and urge a ``yes'' vote.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Let me state my opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from Utah. 
   As I stated before, the portion of the Taunton River which will be struck out by this amendment is deserving of this designation and has nothing to do with the decisions that have already stopped the Weaver's Cove LNG facility. As we pointed out, the lower portion of the Taunton River is being designated as a recreational river, rather than a wild or scenic designation. 
   The designation is actually intended for river stretches that look like the Lower Taunton because they are accessible and may have some development and undergone some impoundment or diversion. 
   The designation is similar, as I mentioned before, to other urbanized river segments in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts. 
   There has been 7 years of study. The National Park Service thinks this segment qualifies for this designation. The towns along the river think it qualifies, and the Members of Congress from the State think it qualifies.  
   And I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and preserve the integrity of the legislation that is before us.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. The amendment offered by Mr. Bishop for Mr. Pearce is unnecessary because the designation of the Taunton River is not going to have any impact whatsoever on energy resources in the country. As a result, this amendment requires a report that will likely be only a sentence or two long. 
   The energy debate is ongoing in this country and here in Congress, and I can assure you that no matter where you come down on the issues raised by the debate, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act does not even make the top 100 list of the reasons we're paying so much for gas at the pump. Reports on the impact of the Bush-Cheney energy policies or the energy policies enacted by the former Republican majority would provide significantly more insight into the problems we now face than a report on one wild and scenic river designation. 
   To go even further, we will debate, and I hope adopt, an amendment sponsored by Representative Boyda making it absolutely clear that H.R. 415 will have no impact on the supply of domestically produced energy. However, Mr. Chairman, as with most amendments that are completely unnecessary, this amendment does no harm to this legislation, so we will not oppose it. 
   I yield back the balance of our time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, let me just read an amendment that passed this House unanimously just previous to this discussion, the amendment to H.R. 415 offered by Mrs. Boyda of Kansas, ``section 3, domestically-reproduced energy resources. Nothing in this Act shall impact the supply of domestically-produced energy resources.'' 
   The point being that this motion to recommit has nothing to do with the protection of domestic energy resources. It has to do with the ability by putting promptly in the motion to recommit to effectively kill this legislation. 
   This legislation has the support, almost unanimous support, of communities, elected officials, the delegation of the State, the Governor, and has had 7 years of study in order to receive the recommendation for the designations that are before us in this legislation. 
   I understand the need to talk about energy on any topic. This particular legislation has nothing to do with the high cost of gas. It has nothing to do with domestic energy supply. If we are looking for reasons, perhaps we could walk over the last 8 years of this administration and a Republican-controlled Congress and look at the failed efforts at really bringing an energy policy to the American people. That is the root cause of our problem. The root cause is not this designation today. 
   Let me yield now to the sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3332 would provide for the establishment of a memorial within the boundaries of the Kalaupapa National Historic Park on the island of Molokai, Hawaii. It will serve as a remembrance of thousands of Hansen's disease patients who were forcibly separated from family and friends and interned at this site. 
   Beginning in 1866, when the Hawaii Islands were still an independent kingdom, and continuing through 1969, residents of the islands who were infected with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, were isolated from the rest of society at the settlement. In all, 8,000 Hansen's patients were forcibly relocated to the settlement where they struggled to create new lives. The majority succumbed to the disease while living there. 
   Today, less than 20 percent of the graves and headstones of these former patients can be found in the peninsula. The remaining 80 percent are forgotten on the landscape. A nonprofit organization made up of family and friends of former patients will be responsible for funding and constructing the memorial which will contain the names of all 8,000 patients who were forced to call this settlement their home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend our colleague, Congresswoman Hirono of Hawaii, and her cosponsor, Congressman Abercrombie, also of Hawaii, for their efforts to ensure that all families of former residents have a fitting commemoration of their deceased loved ones. 
   Mr. Speaker, we enthusiastically support H.R. 3332 and urge its passage today as a tribute to the present and past Hansen's patients.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   House Resolution 868, introduced by our colleague from California, Representative LYNN WOOLSEY, recognizes the beauty and the significance of Muir Woods National Monument on its 100th anniversary. Muir Woods National Monument preserves one of the last remaining ancient redwood forests on the Pacific Coast and in the world. 
   The coast redwood is the tallest species of tree in the world and one of the oldest. The mature trees of the Cathedral and Bohemian groves in Muir Woods reach heights of 250 feet and average between 600 and 800 years in age, with the oldest believed to be at least 1,100 years old. 
   In 1905, Congressman William Kent, who later went on to introduce the bill that would establish the National Park Service, purchased the land where Muir Woods stands, recognizing the beauty, value, and significance of an uncut, old-growth redwood forest. Eventually, Congressman Kent donated 295 acres to the Federal Government. 
   On January 9, 1908, using the Antiquities Act, President Roosevelt declared Kent's donated land a national monument, proclaiming that the groves of the redwoods were of ``extraordinary scientific interest and importance because of the unique character of the forests and the character, age, and size of the trees.'' 
   President Roosevelt wanted to name the new monument for Congressman Kent, but Kent insisted that it be named after the venerable conservationist John Muir, who sought to protect some of America's most iconic landscapes for their inherent national beauty. These ancient trees now offer a silent, yet powerful, testimony to Muir's ideals. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend and congratulate my colleague Representative Woolsey, for her commitment and leadership on this matter. We strongly support passage of House Resolution 868 and urge its adoption by the House today.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   House Concurrent Resolution 209 would express the sense of Congress that the Museum of the American Quilter's Society in Paducah, Kentucky, should be designated the ``National Quilt Museum of the United States.'' The concurrent resolution was introduced by our colleague, Representative ED WHITFIELD of Kentucky. 
   Since its establishment in 1991, the Museum of the American Quilting Society has collected and displayed quilts made by quilters from 44 of the 50 States. Today, with a permanent collection of more than 180 quilts and three galleries totaling 13,400 square feet of exhibit space, the facility is the largest museum in the world dedicated to the artistry of quilting and illustrates the significance of quilts and quilting to this Nation. 
   A friends' group comprised of members from all 50 States has provided the museum with a broad national fundraising support and advocates since its inception 17 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 209 would grant recognition of the House to this museum and the art form it seeks to preserve. A museum of this size, scope, and significance appears worthy of designation as the National Quilt Museum of the United States. We have no objection to House Concurrent Resolution 209 and urge its passage.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time, and let me also thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for the very important resolution, H. Res. 954, that she introduced. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 954 and to honor the life of senior Border Patrol Agent Luis A. Aguilar who lost his life in the line of duty near Yuma, Arizona, on January 19 of this year. He lost his life on a border filled with dangers for agents who confront organized drug and people smugglers on a daily basis, smugglers who are prepared to go to great and dangerous lengths to protect their profit and to protect the illegal activities they are conducting on the border. 
   First, let me give my condolences to Mr. Aguilar's family who gave the ultimate sacrifice, his wife, son, and daughter, who have lost an American hero. I'm proud to say that Agent Aguilar lived in Somerton, Arizona. He was originally from El Paso, Texas, but was raising his family in the district that I have the privilege to represent in this Congress. 
   His life was devoted to this country as he served in the U.S. Border Patrol for more than 5 years. He protected this country and enforced its laws. 
   For his wife, children, and family, he provided them with a great foundation. He was a devoted family man, actively involved in the lives of his children and his family, making sure that his family was first. Community members could always count on him being there on a T-ball or soccer field cheering on his children and other children. 
   Luis Aguilar will be remembered as a quiet, yet strong, man who always had a smile on his face for his friends and family. 
   Mr. Speaker, we may disagree on the nature, the content and the future of an immigration policy for this Nation, but there is no disagreement on the bravery and value of the men and women who carry out this policy for us. In honoring Luis Aguilar and his family, we honor all of them and respect them all. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 954 in memory of Luis Aguilar and in gratitude for his service and the service of his colleagues in the Border Patrol.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2251 was introduced by my good friend from Maine, Representative Mike Michaud. The legislation addresses several housekeeping matters at the Acadia National Park. Acadia, located on Mount Desert Island on the coast of Maine, is one of our most popular and most visited national parks. 
   This bill would authorize the park to participate in the construction of a new transit center. Currently, visitors can only catch the park bus at their hotels, meaning that day visitors have no access to the system. The bill would allow the park to participate in the establishment and operation of a planned intermodal center to be located just off the island. This center would provide visitor services, parking, and bus access to day visitors. A variety of Federal, State, and local agencies are involved in establishing the center. 
   H.R. 2251 would also extend the authorization of the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission for another 20 years, continuing this important forum for the park and local communities to jointly consider issues of importance. 
   Finally, H.R. 2251 would authorize an additional $10 million for the park's land acquisition budget to enable the park to keep pace with rising property values and providing for prompt payment to willing sellers who regularly offer their lands to the park. 
   At the hearing in the last Congress, the National Park Service testified in support of similar legislation, and that measure also passed in the Senate. The measure before us today has been updated to address several concerns by the National Park Service, and to cap NPS contributions to the intermodal transportation center. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill will significantly improve the experience of visitors to one of our great national parks. Representative Michaud and Representative Allen are to be commended for their hard work on this legislation. 
   I urge the House to support H.R. 2251.

Visitors who want to drive the park's loop roads are welcome to do so, but many have found that riding the bus is much more convenient. So there is a categorical assurance that the intention of this legislation is not now or will be to ban automobiles from Acadia.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 407, sponsored by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird), would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of designating a national heritage area in western Washington State. Specifically, the study would examine coastal areas in Clatsop and Pacific Counties at the mouth of the Columbia River, as well as inland areas along the river in two adjacent counties. The bill includes standard criteria for national heritage area studies, and requires completion of the study 3 years after the date funds are made available. 
   Mr. Speaker, the area included in this proposed study is not only beautiful, but is rich in Native American and European history. The area was a busy stop on European trade routes many years before Lewis and Clark famously visited the west coast. Representative Baird is to be commended for his hard work on behalf of this legislation. We look forward to working with him on the designation of a national heritage area should the study support such an action.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would first point out that almost identical legislation, H.R. 5485, was the subject of a subcommittee hearing in the Resources Committee during the previous Congress. 
   During that hearing, the Bush administration and local business leaders expressed support for the legislation. That hearing, organized by then-Republican majority, featured no testimony opposing the bill. Further, the companion to this bill was sponsored by the Republican Senator from Oregon. Given that bipartisan and noncontroversial legislative history, and the fact that the bill simply authorizes a study, it is perfectly appropriate that the measure be before the House today. We have used similar procedures to bring other measures left over from the previous Congress to the floor, measures sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats. 
   The one organization mentioned as opposing the bill failed to make their opposition known to the committee or the sponsor, nor did they testify at last year's hearing. Further, the group has no real relevance because it opposes all heritage area study proposals on ideological, rather than substantive, grounds which have nothing to do with this specific proposal. 
   Lastly, this legislation simply authorizes a study, not a national heritage area. To oppose the study because you assume you will oppose what the study will recommend is premature at best. There is no real controversy regarding this legislation, and we urge our colleagues to support it.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 1080 was introduced by our colleague from Wyoming, Representative Barbara Cubin. The legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to expand the boundaries of the Grand Teton National Park to include approximately 50 acres that landowners in the adjacent Grand Teton Park Subdivision wish to donate to the park. 
   The subdivision is located adjacent to the park's eastern boundary and is visible from the park's main road. According to the National Park Service, the land is similar in character and quality to the adjacent parklands and offers unobstructed views of the Teton range and across the broad valley of Jackson Hole. 
   One lot in the subdivision was owned by the Gerald Halpin family. The remaining seven lots were donated by the Halpin family to private organizations, including the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the National Park Foundation, and the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. 
   All of these owners would like to donate their land to the park, but the parcels lie outside the existing park boundary. The 1950 law creating the park includes a provision forbidding expansion of any national park or monument in Wyoming without the express authorization of Congress. 
   H.R. 1080 would authorize the Secretary to accept the donation of lands within the subdivision and, upon acquisition, adjust the boundary of Grand Teton National Park. The bill would also prohibit the future sale, donation, exchange or other transfer of the acquired land without congressional approval. 
   Related legislation passed the other body in the 109th Congress and has been reintroduced by Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming and approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee earlier this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, the National Park Service has testified in support of the bill, and it cleared the National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee, and the full Natural Resources Committee on voice votes without any amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, Representative Cubin is to be commended for her work on this legislation. We support passage of H.R. 1080 and urge its adoption by the House today.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the influence of soul music on this Nation and the contributions of the city of Memphis, Tennessee, and Stax Records for enriching the Nation's cultural life with 50 years of soul. 
   Soul music became a new genre of American music in the 1950s and incorporates various types of music including gospel and rhythm and blues. The origins of Southern soul music can be traced back to Memphis, Tennessee, the home of Stax Records. 
   Stax Records produced some of the earliest recordings of soul music legends including Isaac Hayes, Otis Redding, and B.B. King. Over time, other important recordings were produced at their studios, including works from the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. 
   Throughout 2007, the Memphis Convention and Visitors Bureau, Concord Music Group/Stax Records, and the Soulsville Foundation will celebrate American soul music and the 50th anniversary of the founding of Stax Records with an event titled ``50 Years of Soul.''

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Arizona Women's Softball Team on their eighth national championship. The Wildcats won their title June 6, 2007, giving them back-to-back championships over the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers. 
   The road to the championship was not easy for the Wildcats. The Wildcats climbed out of the loser's bracket turning the tournament to face off in the best of three championship series against the Lady Volunteers of Tennessee. After losing the opener of the series, the Wildcats won the second game 1-0. The final game of the series was the most-viewed women's college game on television and was played in front of a sold-out audience. The game was 0-0 until the fifth inning, when the Wildcats scored five runs. Ms. Mowatt, the pitcher, continued to pitch a no-hitter, leading the Wildcats to their second title in a row. 
   For those of us that are alumni and have the pleasure of living in the community where the Wildcats Women's Softball Team has brought us great honor and prestige, know that the effort and the victories are due to great team effort. It's about teamwork, but there are individuals that must be acknowledged, and it begins with the head coach, Coach Candrea, who has taken the team to every one of their championship titles, in addition to leading the United States team to a Gold Medal in the 2004 Olympics. 
   Acknowledgment has to be extended to the pitcher, Ms. Mowatt, who threw 1,035 pitches in eight games in 7 days, setting a new women's college record for pitching 60 innings. 
   The members of the team that were selected to the all-tournament team due to their performance were the shortstop, Ms. Fox; third basewoman, Ms. Leles; and second basewoman, Ms. Lowe. 
   In addition to the team and support staff, I would like to recognize the endless support of family, friends and fans who give to the university and support the university throughout the whole season. The victory for U of A Wildcats Women's Softball Team is celebrated throughout my district and by Wildcat alumni across the world. 
   But I think their victory is more than a championship title. It is a testament of the ability of women and the need and the importance of the continued investment in title IX. The victory  reminds us of that importance every time that a women's team at a collegiate level is as successful as the University of Arizona Wildcats and other teams. 
   My congratulations to the University of Arizona Women's Softball Team for their great victory, for the honor that they bring the State, and for the honor that they bring women athletics across this Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Donald Jeffry Herbert and to express appreciation for his great educational contributions. 
   Donald Herbert was born in Waconia, Minnesota, on July 10, 1917. He graduated from La Crosse State Teachers College in 1940, where he studied to become a science teacher. Before Don Herbert could make an educational contribution, he first served in the United States Army Air Force in World War II. During his service to our country, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters. 
   Don Herbert is best known for developing an idea which became ``Watch Mr. Wizard,'' a live television show which introduced many children to science. This show aired from 1951 to 1964. Don Herbert, who came to be known as Mr. Wizard, also produced another children's show from 1983 to 1990 titled ``Mr. Wizard's World.'' 
   Mr. Wizard was able to explain seemingly difficult science to children with visually stunning experiments. Mr. Wizard amazed all of us that watched that show. He could make a Bunsen burner change colors by the elements that he used on there. He could take two colored solutions, pour them into a beaker and it would become clear. 
   And today, when there is such an emphasis across this country and by this Congress to instill an appreciation and a love for science among our students, and among the children of this country, Mr. Wizard stands as a great example and a wonderful show that did just that, stimulated interest and created appreciation among children for science. 
   Don Herbert's television programs inspired generations of children to become knowledgeable in science. These educational television programs earned Don Herbert a Peabody Award in 1954. He also won three Thomas Edison National Mass Media Awards and the Robert Millikan Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers. 
   Don Herbert realized that an education including science and technology is a necessary component in forming a productive and competitive society. While he passed away on June 12, 2007, his great contributions to advancement of the education in the field of science will continue to have effects for many, many years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution.

   As we speak, preparations are being made to send more of our Nation's sons and daughters to Iraq, with or without our consent, and some are already there.

The Constitution gives this House, gives this body, if it chooses to exercise it, the power of the Federal purse. No signing statement or political calculation can erase this hard fact. And if we choose to deny that we do have this power, we do a disservice to our Constitution, our constituents, and this body. 
   The escalation in Iraq, as announced by the President the other night, will only deepen our involvement in this debacle. 
   Mr. Speaker, this war is a financial, strategic and moral disaster for this Nation. We need to bring this sad misadventure to an end and start bringing our troops home now.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of H.R. 903, introduced by my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, the gentleman from Colorado, Representative MARK UDALL. 
   This legislation would require the Forest Service to review lands in or adjacent to the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and report to Congress on the present ownership of the lands, and which undeveloped lands may be at risk of development, as well as apprising Congress of appropriate actions that could be taken to preserve the open and undeveloped character of these lands. 
   Rapid population growth in the northern Front Range area of Colorado is spreading west from Denver, pushing homes and shopping centers up the valleys and along the highways. This development then spreads out along the ridges and mountaintops that make up this backdrop. New homes and businesses in the wildland urban interface also create new liabilities for first responders and a more complicated management framework for forest managers. 
   The result of these changes is the potential loss of many of the very qualities that attract new residents and contribute to the quality of life of the region. H.R. 903 is designed to help provide a better understanding of what steps might be done to lessen the risk. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and congratulate my colleague, Mr. Udall, for his commitment and leadership on this matter. A hearing was held on a nearly identical measure last Congress, and the bill was approved by the Natural Resources Committee and passed the House by voice vote last September. 
   Mr. Speaker, we strongly support H.R. 903 and urge its adoption by the House today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The purpose of H.R. 122, as amended, introduced by our colleague, Congressman Dreier of California, is to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Inland Empire regional water recycling project and in the Cucamonga Valley Water District satellite recycling plant. 
   H.R. 122, as amended, would add approximately 100,000 acre-feet of new water annually to one of the largest recycled water distribution systems in the Santa Ana River Watershed. Some of the recycled water will be used to reclaim the groundwater basin and help drought-proof the service area. These water recycling plants will develop recycled water near where it will be used, offsetting the energy costs associated with pumping. 
   The Subcommittee on Water and Power held hearings on similar legislation in the 108th Congress. In the 109th Congress, similar legislation was passed by the House. 
   H.R. 122, as amended, will provide a very modest amount of Federal financial assistance to help in the construction of these worthy water recycling projects. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 995) to amend Public Law 106-348 to extend the authorization for establishing a memorial in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor veterans who became disabled while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (EXTENDING AUTHORIZATION FOR THE AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The 106th Congress authorized the Disabled Veterans Life Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial in Washington, D.C., to honor disabled veterans. The law specified that the memorial is to be established pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act. A memorial site located near the Rayburn House Office Building was identified, but the project is yet to advance due to security and traffic concerns raised by the Architect of the Capitol and the U.S. Capitol Police. 
   The foundation is in the process of negotiating a solution to that problem. However, the Commemorative Works Act specifies that the legislative authority for any memorial expires 7 years after the date of enactment, October of this year for this proposal. H.R. 995, sponsored by our colleague from Illinois, Representative Phil Hare, amends the original authorization to extend authority to establish the memorial to October 24, 2015.     
   This extension will allow additional time to ensure an appropriate commemoration to our Nation's disabled veterans to whom we owe a tremendous obligation. 
   While Representative Hare is a new Member of this House, he is well acquainted with the sacrifices made by our Nation's veterans, both from his service in the Army Reserves and his more than 20 years as district director for our former colleague and advocate for veterans, Mr. Lane Evans. We congratulate Representative Hare for his work on behalf of this important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I might add that, given the ongoing and recent scandal regarding the care and support of our current disabled veterans, this legislation, H.R. 995, is timely and appropriate to honor and remind us of the sacrifice of all veterans and those that are disabled as a consequence of their service to this country. This is an obligation that is owed to them. This memorial would be a fitting reminder that we have an ongoing obligation and responsibility to their care and comfort. 
   Mr. Speaker, we strongly support H.R. 995 and urge its adoption by the House today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 299, introduced by my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan), provides for a minor boundary adjustment to the Lowell National Historic Park. Lowell National Historic Park was established in 1978 to commemorate the City of Lowell's prominent role in the American Industrial Revolution. 
   H.R. 299 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire five small tracts of land totaling less than 1 acre. These tracts are necessary to complete development of the canalway, a linear park and walkway along Lowell's 5.6-mile historic power canal system. 
   These parcels provide the access points needed for the development, maintenance, and surveillance necessary to complete the historic canalway. While the total boundary adjustment is less than 1 acre, it would allow public access to at least 2 miles of this historic canalway. 
   I want to commend my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) for his efforts on behalf of Lowell National Historic Park. He has worked diligently to advance many partnership efforts such as this one, which would bring together Federal, State, and local resources to preserve and interpret the park. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 299 is supported by the administration, the City of Lowell, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Identical legislation was approved by the House last Congress, and we urge our colleagues to support this measure today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, Brigadier General Francis Marion commanded the Williamsburg Militia Revolutionary Force in South Carolina during the Revolutionary War. 
   He is distinguished for his innovative warfare techniques, his pivotal victory at Eutaw Springs in September 1781, and for his commanding the first racially integrated troop force. General Marion is perhaps even better known by the nickname given to him by an exasperated British commander, the Swamp Fox. 
   H.R. 497, introduced by Representative JOE WILSON, would authorize a private entity, the Marion Park Project, to establish a commemorative work in Washington, D.C., to honor General Marion. The memorial is to be established pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act and is to be privately funded. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House approved identical legislation in the last Congress, and we strongly support H.R. 497 today.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 247 was introduced by my colleague on the Natural Resources Committee, the gentleman from Oregon, Representative PETER DEFAZIO. This legislation designates an existing Forest Service trail in the Willamette National Forest in Oregon as a national recreation trail in honor of Jim Weaver, a former Member of the House of Representatives. This trail will be designated as the Jim Weaver Loop Trail. It forms a 19.6-mile loop around Waldo Lake. 
   Congressman Weaver served in this body from the 94th Congress through the 99th Congress and was a former subcommittee chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources. He was a strong advocate of conservation and public lands. The establishment of this trail around one of Oregon's largest and most beautiful lakes is a fitting tribute to our former colleague. Under this bill, an interpretive sign will be installed at the trail head to indicate the name of the trail and provide information on the life and career of our former colleague, Congressman Weaver. 
   This bill before us today is identical to a measure that was reported favorably by the Natural Resources Committee last year. 
   Mr. Speaker, we strongly support H.R. 247 and urge its adoption by the House today.

   The purpose of H.R. 467, as amended, introduced by our colleague Congressman Simpson, is to authorize early repayment of landowner obligations to the Bureau of Reclamation within the A&B Irrigation District in southeastern Idaho. 
   The A&B Irrigation District receives part of its irrigation water supply from the Bureau of Reclamation's Minidoka Project. H.R. 467, as amended, will provide administrative consistency between the landowners within the A&B Irrigation District and those within other districts served by the Minidoka Project. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation simply allows landowners to pay off their financial obligations related to the Bureau of Reclamation's Minidoka project. We believe this legislation is appropriate and, in fact, may provide a slight financial benefit to the United States. 
   In the 109th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on similar legislation. This legislation was subsequently passed by the House. We have no objection to this noncontroversial bill.

   Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Piedras Blancas Light Station is one of only a handful of tall, seacoast lighthouses built on the West Coast. It is located in San Luis Obispo County in Southern California. 
   Completed in 1875, the lighthouse was manned by the Coast Guard until 1975, when it was automated. The Coast Guard transferred the lighthouse and the surrounding public land to the Bureau of Land Management in 2001. This area is not only historically significant, but it is also home to a population of gulls, cormorants and an elephant seal colony, numbering 10,000 animals. 
   H.R. 276, sponsored by my committee colleague Representative Lois Capps, would establish the Piedras Blancas Historic Light Station Outstanding Natural Area to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the existing National Landscape Conservation System. This area would be managed by the BLM to conserve the significant historical and natural resources found there. 
   Mr. Speaker, Representative Capps has worked tirelessly on behalf of this legislation, and we commend her for her efforts. Identical legislation was approved by the House in the last Congress, and we urge our colleagues to support this measure once again.

   Construction of the memorial and military museum began in 1935. The site was dedicated by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. On Memorial Day, 1938, the building officially opened to the public. The Soldiers' Memorial Building is a stately structure which, in addition to serving as a memorial to those who lost their lives in the service of their country, also contains exhibit rooms that house a collection of military items. The building has been found eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. It is operated by the City of St. Louis and made available to the public free of charge. 
   I want to commend my colleague from Missouri, Representative Clay, for his efforts to preserve this memorial and museum, which was built to honor those who gave their lives to this country.

   I rise in strong support of H.R. 376, introduced by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt). This legislation would direct the National Park Service to conduct a study to determine how best to protect the sites related to the First and Second Battles of Newtonia, Missouri. 
   Two Civil War battles were waged near Newtonia which lies in Newton County, Missouri. The first, on September 30, 1862, involved 4,000 Confederate troops and 6,500 Union soldiers, and it is believed to be the only Civil War battle in which full American Indian units fought on both sides of the conflict. 
   The Second Battle of Newtonia occurred on October 28, 1864, and involved 1,500 Union cavalry engaging a Confederate Army returning from the unsuccessful Missouri and Kansas Campaign of Confederate General Sterling Price. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend and congratulate my colleague, Mr. Blunt, for this bill. A hearing was held on a nearly identical measure last Congress, and that bill eventually passed the House. We strongly support H.R. 376 and urge its adoption by the House today.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRIJALVA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I am here today to support the resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I won't spend a lot of time assessing the blame and the responsibility for the quagmire that our Nation finds itself in in Iraq, but I do find it curious during this debate that the opponents of this resolution want us to believe that the history of the Iraq war begins today, that it has no past, that it has no consequences, just a doubtful future. This head-in-the-sand attitude, while politically expedient, denies reality and truth. 
   Rest assured that history will not be kind to the decisionmakers and the decider of this war, nor will it be kind to a Congress that looked the other way. 
   The resolution before us today is a first tentative step toward the removal of our troops from Iraq. The escalation proposed is another desperate act opposed by the American people and former military leaders. 
   The resolution does not demoralize our troops nor embolden the insurgents. To the contrary, this resolution offers hope to our troops that an end is in sight and that their elected representatives in this House are not passing on their authority regarding the most important issue confronting our Nation today. 
   I personally know families whose loved ones have been lost, badly injured or profoundly intangibly affected by this war. Our commitment should be to those families and veterans who need our full measure of support. Our gratitude should be measured in real resources for veterans, and not empty platitudes and political rhetoric expounded to justify an irreparable failure in Iraq.     
   The focus of this debate is not centered on our soldiers who are nobly doing their duty and following their orders. It is directed at those who set policy and who have produced a war without end, with no plan of success or exit, with no international strategy, who now turn to a desperate and doomed escalation that only reinforces the failure and the desperation of those policymakers. 
   Rest assured that the civil war in Iraq will not end with the influx of more American troops. I do believe this resolution should have teeth. We must send a message that binds all of us to real action, an unflinching message of opposition to the escalation and a message of support for our troops. Today marks a step in that direction. 
   And I wonder, how many ways can the American people tell this Congress to act to prevent more loss of our blood and treasure in the war in Iraq? Weren't the elections that just happened a strong message? Isn't the loss of confidence by the public in their elected officials a strong message? Isn't the sacrifice and valor of our men and women fighting this war deserving of the respect of this government? Don't we have a duty to those men and women to protect them, reunite them with their families immediately, and, above all, share the truth with them, that the question is no longer if we get out of Iraq, it's how and when. 
   The answer to that question for me and many other families is, the sooner the better. I could stand here and read poll after poll that talks about the public's overwhelming opposition to this war and even more overwhelming opposition to this escalation. But as I think about it, the most important poll for those of us who serve in Congress needs to be our conscience. The resolution before us is simple and direct. It speaks in a very clear way to the frustration we all feel about this misadventure in Iraq. And I said I would not belabor the question of who to blame, but it is important to address the obvious. 
   Remember weapons of mass destruction? None found. 
   Remember the links between Iraq and the attack on 9/11? It didn't exist. 
   All the misspent funds in Iraq, misappropriated dollars. That was ignored by the administration. 
   ``Mission Accomplished.'' What a premature political hype that was. 
   And a strategy for Iraq. It doesn't exist. 
   Funds for education, health care, our cities and towns, investments in our people here in this country, that has all been spent in Iraq. 
   The litany of failures and untruths goes on and on. The lack of leadership by this administration requires, no, I think it demands that this Congress assert its constitutional duty to check and balance this administration by beginning with the important step of passing this resolution.
